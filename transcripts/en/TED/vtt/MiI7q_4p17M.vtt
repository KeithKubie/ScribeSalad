00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:18.704
(Piano)

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.836
(Singing) It was done

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.283
When the benediction had been sung

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:45.312
Firelight gently woke us
from our golden night

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:48.670
My surprise

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.027
I can turn to see your open eyes

00:00:54.681 --> 00:01:00.307
And I know
You are alive

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:03.885
I know that smile

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:07.608
Nothing more

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:13.173
In the after

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:16.974
There is waking from your sleep

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:20.926
And your lover

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.321
Is the only face you see

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:28.425
We are after

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:31.687
Ever after

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:34.868
There is laughter

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.692
Afterneath

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:59.107
The war

00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.902
Nobody ever even asked what for

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:07.484
Up above

00:02:07.508 --> 00:02:11.289
Nothing matters but the ones you love

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:14.968
So get out with me

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:18.790
Now you've got enough with me

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:22.187
Just the two of us you see

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.393
And nothing more

00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:30.956
In the after

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.714
There is waking from your sleep

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:38.385
And your lover

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.395
Is the only face you see

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.731
We are after

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:49.485
Ever after

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:55.862
There is laughter
Afterneath

00:02:56.234 --> 00:03:00.650
Oh, we after

00:03:00.674 --> 00:03:04.437
Ever after

00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:07.396
There is laughter

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.435
Afterneath

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:19.633
Oh

00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:27.929
Oh

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:36.265
Oh

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:46.482
Oh

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:51.126
Thank you.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.302
(Applause)

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:56.477
Thank you very much.

00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.377
(Applause)

00:03:58.401 --> 00:03:59.551
Thanks.

00:04:00.363 --> 00:04:02.781
I love a depressing song ...

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:03.806
(Laughter)

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.981
you know?

00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:07.394
I've been writing them for 15 years now,

00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:10.424
and to be honest, over that time,

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:13.787
I've come to kind of believe
that they're not really depressing at all.

00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:17.479
In fact, I think they're kind of the most
important songs we have.

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:21.441
Songs that sing of sorrow,

00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:22.616
of grief,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.998
of longing,

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:26.186
of the darker side of love,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.641
the underside of being alive,

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.507
these are the songs
I just never tire of hearing

00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:33.742
and I never tire of writing,

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.865
because they make me feel less alone.

00:04:36.973 --> 00:04:40.298
They speak to a very real
part of being human

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.943
that can often be hidden in fear and shame

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:45.541
and pushed deep down
where it lingers and rots.

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:48.497
But I think in listening to these songs --

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.600
really listening --

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:55.014
can allow us to refeel
these hard emotions,

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.306
but in a cathartic and healing way.

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:03.006
In a way that reminds us, as we listen,
that we're not alone in darkness.

00:05:04.676 --> 00:05:09.419
There's a Japanese phrase
known as "mono no aware,"

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:14.238
which roughly translates
as "the bittersweet poignancy of things,"

00:05:14.262 --> 00:05:17.674
or the pathos or "ahness" of things.

00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:21.515
It's a valuable awareness of impermanence,

00:05:22.324 --> 00:05:27.343
both a kind of gentle, transient
sadness as things pass by in life,

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:32.031
but also a deeper,
softly lingering sadness

00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:34.312
about the impermanence of all reality.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.925
"Mono no aware" can be manifest
in lots of life stories and moments

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.138
and songs.

00:05:41.162 --> 00:05:45.334
One example in Japanese culture
is the celebration of the cherry blossom.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.358
The cherry blossom in and of itself
is no more impressive

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:52.470
than that of an apple or orange tree,

00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:54.909
but what sets it apart is its brevity.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.389
Cherry blossoms fall
within a single week --

00:05:58.413 --> 00:06:00.770
can be whisked away
on the gentlest breeze --

00:06:01.686 --> 00:06:03.759
and it's this that makes it
more beautiful.

00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:06.353
It's utterly fragile,

00:06:06.377 --> 00:06:08.870
and fragility gives life its poignancy.

00:06:09.918 --> 00:06:11.250
Now, being a cheery chap,

00:06:11.274 --> 00:06:14.092
nothing speaks to me more
than this, and --

00:06:14.116 --> 00:06:15.378
(Laughter)

00:06:15.402 --> 00:06:19.795
you know, I think it's been the essence
of my songwriting for years,

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.631
of what moves me to write,

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:23.383
what inspires me to sing.

00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:27.234
Because pain and grief and doubt,

00:06:27.258 --> 00:06:30.790
when it's made manifest
in music, in song --

00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:34.504
when it's made beautiful
in poetry and painting,

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:38.644
it can build a community and a kinship

00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:42.380
in the knowledge that we are
none of us alone in darkness.

00:06:43.243 --> 00:06:47.520
My next song is one
that I call "Killing Me,"

00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:48.742
and as the name suggests,

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.609
it's not a dance floor favorite.

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:51.634
(Laughter)

00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:54.471
But it isn't miserable.

00:06:55.073 --> 00:06:57.128
It's full of love and hope.

00:06:57.176 --> 00:07:00.192
And I think it exemplifies everything
I've been talking about.

00:07:00.192 --> 00:07:04.698
And it's the first song I've written
from the perspective of somebody else,

00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:07.167
specifically my grandmother,

00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.580
as she lives on without
my late grandfather,

00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:12.715
as she experiences
new things in her life --

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.155
her grandchildren getting married,

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.780
having their own children,

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:18.954
speaking at TED --

00:07:20.358 --> 00:07:21.886
all the while she lives without,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.397
and all the while she misses
her soul mate.

00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:26.019
Thank you.

00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:38.149
(Piano)

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:49.417
(Singing) Sweetheart
would you wake up today?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.242
I promise you would recognize my faith

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:03.383
I want to show you
how I've grown in this place

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:09.173
In this place I'm not alone

00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:12.288
And I know I'll be OK

00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:20.058
But it's always harder
When the winter comes to stay

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:26.714
And I can't help remember
all the words I never said

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:36.696
And it's killing me
That you're not here with me

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.213
I'm living happily

00:08:40.862 --> 00:08:43.386
But I'm feeling guilty

00:08:45.429 --> 00:08:51.333
And you won't believe
The wonders I can see

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:55.051
This world is changing me

00:08:55.689 --> 00:08:59.508
But I will love you faithfully.

00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:05.692
(Piano)

00:09:07.477 --> 00:09:12.161
Oh, everything is taller these days

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:20.616
Maybe I feel smaller
and time rushes away

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.982
So much I could show you

00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:28.238
How all the great-grandchildren

00:09:28.262 --> 00:09:33.557
Have been laughing
like we did when we were young

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.212
I've been laughing like we did
when we were young

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:48.607
Oh, it's killing me
that you're not here with me

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:52.620
I'm living happily

00:09:52.644 --> 00:09:55.245
But I'm feeling guilty

00:09:57.023 --> 00:10:03.006
Oh, you won't believe
The wonders I can see

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:06.870
This world is changing me

00:10:06.894 --> 00:10:10.778
I will love you faithfully

00:10:11.992 --> 00:10:17.259
Oh

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:22.135
Oh

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:31.416
Oh

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.032
Oh

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:42.248
Oh, it's killing me

00:10:42.272 --> 00:10:45.425
That you're not here with me

00:10:45.868 --> 00:10:48.414
I'm living happily

00:10:49.217 --> 00:10:51.907
But I'm feeling guilty

00:10:53.645 --> 00:10:59.520
Oh, you won't believe
The wonders I can see

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.451
This world is changing me

00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:07.932
I will love you faithfully

00:11:07.956 --> 00:11:10.983
Oh, it's killing me

00:11:11.007 --> 00:11:14.096
That you're not here with me

00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:17.875
I'm living happily

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:21.694
But I'm feeling guilty

00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:29.167
Oh, you won't believe
The wonders I can see

00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:33.933
This world is changing me

00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:38.411
But I will love you faithfully

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.687
Thank you very much.

00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:47.261
(Applause and cheering)
