SPEAKER 1: Talks at Google
and the Asian Google Network

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
are very excited to have Dr.
Ronesh Sinha with us today.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.770
He's an internal
medicine physician,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.940
and he's been pioneering
corporate wellness programs

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.970
that help reverse chronic
health conditions like diabetes

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.411
and cholesterol disorders
through targeted lifestyle

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:25.910
changes.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.970
He's also the author of "The
South Asian Health Solution"

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.530
and is committed to helping
improve people's lives,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.912
no matter what their background.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.120
RONESH SINHA: Thanks so much.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.350
It's such a pleasure to be here.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.120
I've been taking care of
Googlers for many years,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.994
so it's a pleasure to
actually come to Google

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:45.050
and talk to you guys.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.400
So today, we're going to cover
a broad array of topics, really

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.410
based on my work and
clinical experience

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.330
in terms of how
I really approach

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.920
my patients of
diverse backgrounds.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.620
You know, many of my patients
are of Asian background

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.580
as well, and we're seeing a
lot of unique health conditions

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.770
that I actually wasn't
trained to approach

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.789
in medical training.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.830
There are a lot of different
nuances to the types

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.362
of medical conditions we see.

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.820
So we are definitely going to
be covering a lot of content.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.410
You're going to have a
lot of resource slides.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.360
Typically, people know
me in Silicon Valley

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.980
for giving out a lot of
information during talks.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.310
So often, they do have to
watch replays of my talks

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.970
a few times.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.730
But the nice thing about the
way we arrange this talk is we

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.380
will have about 30 minutes
at the end for Q&amp;A.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.900
I'm an adult physician,
so I take care of patients

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.970
age 18 to 100-plus.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.370
But often, because of
my topic, I sometimes

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.770
get questions regarding kids.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.229
So I brought my
wife, Shally Sinha,

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.645
who's sitting there
in the corner.

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:40.649
She's a pediatrician.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.440
So if there are any
questions about growth,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.880
micro-nutrients, or
a lot of the issues

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.466
that we're facing
in kids, I'm going

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:47.090
to have her back me
up on any questions

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.560
like that because I
may not be equipped

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.810
to answer all those questions.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.925
So with that, we'll get started.

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:53.300
And I wanted to
sort of start off

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.620
with a positive, empowering
message, because oftentimes,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.120
even in medical training, when
I was taught about conditions

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.460
like type 2 diabetes,
we were never

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.340
told that these conditions
can actually be reversible.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.980
So you're looking at a lab
panel of a patient up here.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.710
And this is a 52-year-old
software engineer

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.850
who was diagnosed with
pre-diabetes back in 2003.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.930
He ended up developing
full-blown diabetes in 2014.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.840
And if you look up at
his labs, under 2014

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.650
you can see his glucose is 164.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.550
His triglycerides are high.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.830
And then there is also
number that I've circled

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.570
called the A1C.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.014
And for those of
you that may not

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:32.930
be familiar with that,
that actually tells you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.030
what your average sugars are
for the last three months.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.040
So typically when you're
A1C rises above 6 or 6.5,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.620
you've been diagnosed
with diabetes.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.330
So he ended up developing
full-blown diabetes.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.310
Incidentally, he had also seen
dietitians and specialists

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580
that had said that you're
diabetic now, so we need

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.230
to start you on medication.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.450
So I saw him for a
consultation, and we

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.400
went over sort of some
of my high principles.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.294
And we actually prescribed
some lifestyle changes.

00:02:58.294 --> 00:02:59.960
And literally in less
than three months,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.100
he went from 7.5 to 5.4.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.539
So you completely eradicated
diabetes in that visit.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.830
And this is really the types
of things that I'm seeing.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.720
And it's been overwhelming
to really realize

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.469
that these conditions
that we didn't think

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.890
were reversible can
actually be reversible.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.760
And I don't give false
hope to my patients,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.570
but what I tell them is we
are not a victim of our genes.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.190
Many of us have parents.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.715
We might have relatives that
have diabetes or heart disease.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:23.090
And when my patients
tell me, you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.290
know what, I might
as well enjoy life

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.670
because I'm going to
become diabetic at 40,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.920
anyway, so let me eat these
Indian sweets or noodles

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.480
or rice, but I told them, no.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.040
That's really not the case.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.590
Other patients sometimes have
a false sense of confidence

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.100
because they tell me, my
parents lived to be 80.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.630
They were fine, so I can go
on doing what I need to do.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.890
But unfortunately,
they don't realize

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.390
that some of their
lifestyle changes

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.210
might cause diseases
to come on early.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.240
And so the way I want to
express that point is by using

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.050
a concept called epigenetics.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.230
So quite simply,
what I tell people

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.880
is think of your
genetic material

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.394
as sitting inside a smartphone.

00:03:54.394 --> 00:03:56.060
OK, that smartphone
is inside your body.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.280
It's got all your
genetic material.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.230
And the way we used to
think about the genes

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.730
were we thought
genes were hardware.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.320
You inherit this
gene, and that's

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.630
what your programmed to
develop that condition.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.340
But the exciting thing
about epigenetics,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.390
we're finding that it's
more like software.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.390
So basically, you
might have inherited

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.140
the app for type 2 diabetes
or the app for obesity,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.810
maybe the app for cancer
or Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.579
But that app will not get
turned on in most cases

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.190
if you implement the
right lifestyle changes.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.035
So what types of things
turn those apps on or off?

00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.410
Things like
emotions, which we'll

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.035
talk about towards
the end of the talk.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.830
So stress, depression
can turn it on.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.690
Food and micronutrient
deficiencies,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.490
so eating the
wrong foods or when

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.440
you're lacking the
right types of foods,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.160
that can turn the switch on.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.210
Inactivity, sleep deprivation,
and specific toxin exposures

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.010
are all elements
that we think about.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.325
And if we can address
those topics the right way,

00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:48.200
you can become the first
person in the family

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.460
not to become diabetic.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.040
So I think that's a very
empowering, hopeful concept,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.860
rather than this sort of genetic
what we call determinism,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.520
where your genes
determine your outcomes.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.590
And, really, when we think about
how those apps get turned on--

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.820
this is a very busy slide.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.200
But I'm just showing you there
are two root cause processes.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.086
One is called inflammation.

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:09.710
The other is called
insulin resistance.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.990
And those are the
two root cause apps

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.630
that lead to the development
of almost every chronic health

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.840
condition out there, from
cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.820
all of that.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.050
And at a very high level,
I just want to go over.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.930
Inflammation basically,
at the most obvious level,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.880
is if I were to trip
here on these wires

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.620
and I sprained my
ankle, you would

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.660
see that my ankle
would become inflamed.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.456
It would become swollen,
red, and painful,

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:33.830
and that's a
protective mechanism

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.288
to prevent me from actually
moving that ankle in a way that

00:05:36.288 --> 00:05:37.770
would cause further injury.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.080
So that's actually
an adaptive response.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.350
But when inflammation is present
persistently at a low level--

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.920
so this is a level where
your immune system is active.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.640
OK, it's reactive, and it's
activated in a chronic fashion.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.470
That can lead to more issues,
like chronic health disorders.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.760
So that's inflammation
sort of gone haywire.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.330
The second process that I
put up on that first diagram

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.835
is insulin resistance.

00:05:59.835 --> 00:06:02.210
And I want to spend some extra
time on insulin resistance

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.180
because this really is
the root cause for most

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.050
of the chronic health conditions
that I'm seeing in my clinic

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.050
and that we're seeing worldwide.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.870
And I actually describe
insulin resistance

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.039
as being a carbohydrate
parking problem.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.580
And this is an image and diagram
that literally in the clinic

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.330
I show to every single
one of my patients.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.330
And I explain it to
them because once they

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.640
understand this process,
then their lifestyle

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.210
changes make a lot of sense.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.480
So let's spend a few
minutes and go through this.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.020
So think of carbohydrates.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.160
Carbohydrates are basically
chains of glucose molecules.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.870
Think of those as
being a car, OK?

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.880
So this is basically
the carbs, our car,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.710
sitting in the
center of this slide.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.410
And you've got three major
parking lots in your body.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.410
You've got your muscle,
your liver, and your fat.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.780
The ideal parking
destination, the parking lot

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.270
for those carbohydrates, is
we want that car to drive

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.070
to the muscle parking lot.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.500
And the way the carbs get
inside that muscle parking

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.340
lot is by using a special
parking pass called insulin.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.680
So when diabetics, for
example, have diabetes

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.360
and they require
insulin, the insulin

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.760
is actually the parking pass
that gets the glucose out

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.850
of the bloodstream and into
the muscle parking lot.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.790
Now the problem is when we
become insulin resistant,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.030
that muscle parking lot is
not responding to the insulin

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.780
signal.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.846
Our body is pouring out
more of the parking pass,

00:07:13.846 --> 00:07:15.220
but the muscle is
not responding.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.450
So maybe some of the carbs
are going to get inside,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.260
but now we've got all this
overflow glucose traffic.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.280
And where is that
glucose going to go?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.860
So the insulin parking
pass can usher the carbs

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.630
into our fat parking lot.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.700
Unfortunately, unlike
the muscle parking lot,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.170
which has limited
space, especially

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.540
if we're not physically
active, the fat parking lot

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.500
is open 24/7.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.000
It's got plenty of
space, and that's

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.430
why people can pile on
hundreds and hundreds of pounds

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.750
of body fat.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.557
So that's one
direction it can go in.

00:07:40.557 --> 00:07:42.890
And that visceral fat we'll
talk about in a second, some

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.720
of the side effects,
that belly fat.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.040
The other parking lot, it
goes through the liver.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.040
And the liver can take
those extra carbohydrates

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.322
and either store them
and turn them into fat

00:07:51.322 --> 00:07:52.280
when they're in excess.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.988
So that's why there
is a condition called

00:07:53.988 --> 00:07:56.270
fatty liver, which we're
seeing a lot, especially

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.190
in Asian kids and adults.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.630
That liver, when
it's overloaded,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.640
can also expel
those carbohydrates

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.040
in a form of fat
called triglycerides.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.606
High triglycerides are a
major epidemic worldwide,

00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:08.480
and it's the most common
cholesterol disorder

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.740
that I see here in Silicon
Valley amongst my patients.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.050
So we'll talk a little
bit more about that.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.510
But that's really
the root cause.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.272
It's basically, I tell people,
this is a parking problem.

00:08:17.272 --> 00:08:19.730
And we need to teach you how
to get that glucose car moving

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.320
back towards muscle.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.590
We think of insulin resistance
as being linked to diabetes.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.940
Absolutely, root cause for
diabetes, heart disease,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.810
but now we're finding that
that same parking problem is

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.120
being connected to all types
of other chronic health

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.299
conditions.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.110
So one in particular that I'm
particularly concerned about

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.979
is a condition called
Alzheimer's disease,

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.770
which is a neurodegenerative
condition that

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.789
can cause memory loss and
other cognitive changes.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.430
And the link between
insulin resistance

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.030
and Alzheimer's disease
is now so direct.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.480
It's so intimate now
based on recent research

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.184
that now they're calling
Alzheimer's type 3 diabetes.

00:08:55.184 --> 00:08:56.600
And one of the
reasons for that is

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.790
because when you have
that parking problem

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.360
and your body produces extra
insulin parking passes,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.160
those extra insulin
parking passes

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.130
prevent your brain from getting
rid of a chemical called

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.080
amyloid.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.500
And amyloid is
actually the substance

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.710
that accumulates in the brains
of Alzheimer's patients.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.040
We also see that when people
have insulin resistance,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.920
a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus actually

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.820
shrinks.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.740
And the hippocampus is
responsible for learning,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.549
memory, and
emotional regulation.

00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:26.090
So this is pretty
scary because we're

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.570
seeing major increases in the
incidence of Alzheimer's all

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.620
over the world.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.300
And it looks like
diabetes and insulin

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.730
resistance is one of the
primary root causes for that.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.950
And that bullet point at
the end I'm showing you

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.520
says that diabetics are
50% more likely to develop

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.760
Alzheimer's disease.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.900
That's pretty frightening.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.840
And again, I'm not saying
that if you have diabetes,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.298
you're destined to
get Alzheimer's.

00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:49.280
Again, if you inherited
the app or the tendency,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.260
then diabetes is a major switch
that can flip that app on.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.360
Cancer, so again,
in my clinic, I

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.230
deal a lot with diabetes
and heart disease.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.930
But we're also hearing
in our community

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.840
about first-generation
cancers, a woman developing

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.670
breast cancer even
though there's no family

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.825
history of breast cancer.

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:06.950
We're starting to see that.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.250
So again, a case of inheriting
an app, but then this condition

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.110
might be flipping that app on.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.850
How this is connected
is number one.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.590
When you have
insulin resistance,

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.230
your body can't dispose
of glucose properly.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.790
That extra glucose, just like
humans like to eat sugar,

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.780
cancer cells like
to eat sugar, too.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.310
So cancer cells, their
preferred fuel is sugar.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.000
So if you're chronically walking
around with elevated sugar,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.070
and you have a tendency
towards cancer,

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.600
then that could be a trigger.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.370
The second thing is,
again, I mentioned

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.050
that when you have
insulin resistance

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.660
your body produces
excess insulin.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.050
And that extra insulin
actually has secondary effects.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.440
So it can increase the release
of a substance called IGF-1,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.520
and that can accelerate
tumor growth as well.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.276
So we are seeing
that linkage there.

00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:52.650
And then finally, one other
condition I want to highlight

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.210
is a condition called Polycystic
Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.340
And if you are a woman
or you have daughters,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.140
just be aware of this
condition, especially

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.264
if you're of Asian or South
Asian background, where

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:04.620
we see a lot of this.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.210
But basically,
this is a condition

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.640
that's developing in
young teenage girls

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.900
and in young women.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.700
And even when I was
growing up, I just

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.500
realized that a lot
of our family friends,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.900
their daughters, reflecting
back, they probably did

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.010
have PCOS.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.620
But there was no awareness
about that condition.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.980
And a young woman or a teenager,
the types of signs and symptoms

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.520
they get off at that age are
things like irregular periods.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.720
You know, they can get acne.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.760
They can get facial
and body hair.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.280
But they can also lose hair
at the top of their head,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.290
and then obesity as well, too.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.869
So imagine for a second what a
teenage girl or a young woman

00:11:36.869 --> 00:11:37.410
goes through.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.960
Like, emotionally, having
these types of symptoms

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.750
during certainly the
crucial stages of their life

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.450
can cause tremendous
depression and other anxiety.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.250
But the downstream
impact of that

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.890
is when you have this
condition as a young woman,

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.760
your future risk of diabetes
is seven times greater,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.860
increased heart disease risk,
high risk of infertility,

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.690
all these things.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.319
So I just want you
to be aware of this.

00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:00.360
And this is something to
address with your doctor

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.310
if you start seeing that
some of these symptoms

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.840
are starting to develop
in your daughter,

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.048
or, if you're in your young
20s and have noticed some

00:12:06.048 --> 00:12:08.880
of these things because this
is a condition that's directly

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.160
linked to insulin resistance.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.745
So when you think of
the human life cycle,

00:12:15.745 --> 00:12:19.450
a key thing to understand is
those two root cause processes,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.400
inflammation and
insulin resistance,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.120
those triggers can occur at
any stage of that life cycle.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.620
You know, as you're
an adult, you're

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.060
parents, if you're having that
baby, in any of those stages

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.357
those conditions can occur.

00:12:32.357 --> 00:12:34.690
And one thing I want to
actually highlight for you, too,

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.060
is often I feel like
in some cultures,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.490
unfortunately, often
if a condition develops

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.176
in the child, often the mom
is actually given the blame.

00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.050
You know, it's a very
sad, unfortunate thing,

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.406
but that actually does
happen in cultures.

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:48.280
You know, if there was
a behavioral disorder,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.110
if there's diabetes,
what happened

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.670
during the mom's pregnancy?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.320
But again, coming
back to epigenetics,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.150
what I want to
make you understand

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.710
is that now we have
lots of studies

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.870
that show that the
male's lifestyle

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.370
patterns before conception--
so if you have a male that's

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.680
planning to get pregnant,
and they were sedentary,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.250
they're eating a poor diet,
they're not sleeping properly,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.560
they pass those on to the
gene pool through the sperm.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.370
So I tell my couples that
are planning to have kids,

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.540
you treat that event--

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.040
if you're planning
to have children,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.914
that's the most important
event of your life.

00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:19.180
Treat it like an Olympic
event, and you train for it.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.500
Optimize sleep, stress.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.630
Eat the most nutritious
foods possible.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.850
Stay physically active
because otherwise, each of you

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.890
are going to have a potentially
damaging effect on the gene

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.400
pool, not only for offspring,
but also for grandchildren.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.280
So we see a lot of these
behaviors can skip generations.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.980
They can actually
come from grandparents

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.390
and go two generations
down, so really this

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.270
is an opportunity to influence
that gene pool as positively

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.420
as we can.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.510
So which comes first?

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.080
So even though I showed
them as separate processes,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.360
this slide just shows you
that insulin resistance

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.610
and inflammation, they
feed on one another.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.100
When you've got diabetes
or insulin resistance,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.620
inflammation levels are higher.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.330
The extra glucose in the
insulin causes your body

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.610
to be in a constant
state of inflammation.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.950
And also if you have an
underlying inflammatory

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.960
condition, or if
you're eating foods

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.670
that cause more
information, that

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.770
will also put you at risk
for insulin resistance.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:17.116
So really it is a vicious cycle,
where one feeds upon the other.

00:14:17.116 --> 00:14:18.490
And I also want
to make the point

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.442
about intermittent
versus chronic,

00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:22.900
because sometimes what happens
is you might read about some

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.350
of this work.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.670
And you're like,
insulin's the enemy,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.780
or inflammation is the enemy.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.363
But I want to take
a couple of minutes

00:14:27.363 --> 00:14:30.010
to explain that it's not that
those entities are the enemy.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.480
It's basically intermittent
versus chronic.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.680
And what I mean by that is
intermittent insulin release

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.960
is absolutely necessary
to control blood sugar.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.995
We need insulin to do that.

00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:41.620
Actually, intermittent
insulin release,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.660
when you use it the right way,
can help with muscle growth,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.160
too.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.110
So if you had a heavy
weightlifting workout,

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.850
and then you had a good,
healthy carbohydrate that

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.040
raised your insulin
levels, that insulin

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.770
is going to take the protein and
carbs and send it your muscle.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.140
So your muscles can refuel,
and you can actually

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.730
grow stronger muscle.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.830
So insulin can be
your best friend.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.026
But in the wrong context,
when it's persistently high,

00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:04.150
it can be your worst enemy.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.580
The same with inflammation,
the inflammation system

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.670
was designed to protect
us, to heal us from injury,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.919
to prevent infection.

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:12.460
But when it's chronic
and persistent,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.740
that's when the
devastation happens.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.485
With stress, same things,
emotional stress intermittently

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:18.360
can build resilience.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.140
It can be adaptive.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.810
Physical stress intermittently
in the form of exercise

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.064
is adaptive.

00:15:24.064 --> 00:15:25.480
On that note of
physical stress, I

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.090
do want to say that in my clinic
and going around companies,

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.570
often I see that people
are over working out.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.160
They're doing intensive
boot camps every single day,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.910
seven days a week.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.380
They're sore every day.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.780
And that's actually a chronic
stressor that eventually

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.940
can lead to injuries,
or it can actually

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.680
trigger more of that
blood-vessel-based

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.670
inflammation.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.320
So many times, I'm
finding my execs

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.780
in my clinic that are very
type A or other patients,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.434
I'm actually telling
them to slow down

00:15:48.434 --> 00:15:50.350
and maybe interrupt boot
camps with a bit more

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.900
yoga, stretching, or just
outdoor walks and hiking.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.540
Calories, so
intermittent restriction

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.530
of calories, a practice
that's popularly

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.420
known as intermittent fasting,
can be incredibly adaptive.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.590
We'll talk about that.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.085
But obviously, the
persistent caloric exposure

00:16:06.085 --> 00:16:08.210
is really what's leading
to a lot of chronic health

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.610
conditions.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.240
So let's talk about how we
can each assess our own health

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.960
risk.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.350
OK, so biometrics, certain
lab results can be a guide.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.360
The great news I gave
you today is genes

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.510
are more like software.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.352
So we can influence
and change our genes.

00:16:22.352 --> 00:16:24.310
And then we're going to
focus a little bit more

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.350
on some key lifestyle
changes that

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.470
have really helped my patients.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.720
So one of the key labs that
I want to talk about first

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.795
are triglycerides.

00:16:32.795 --> 00:16:34.420
I mentioned to you
that that's probably

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.180
one of the most common
risks that I end up seeing

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.664
in my patient population.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.330
And I'm spending some
extra time on this

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.950
because when I went
to medical school

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.570
and we went through
medical training,

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.760
when we looked at a
cholesterol panel,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.910
the number that we focused on
probably the most at some point

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.210
was probably total cholesterol
and then the LDL cholesterol.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.326
But most of what I'm seeing
here and also globally,

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.700
most of the conditions are
coming from the triglycerides.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.890
So let's understand
what triglycerides are.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.140
So that red tube that you
see at the top of the screen

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.220
is your blood vessel, and that
yellow ball is a fat cell.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.250
So whenever we eat
foods, when the food goes

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.710
from the bloodstream
and gets stored as fat,

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.700
we call that process
lipogenesis, or fat storage.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.089
When our fat cells empty out
nutrients like triglycerides,

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.980
when the fat cells
are broken down

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.440
and that energy goes back
towards the bloodstream,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.173
we call that lipolysis.

00:17:25.173 --> 00:17:26.589
So in general, we
don't want to be

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.422
in a constant lipogenic
state, because we're

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.190
going to be accumulating
more body fat.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.410
We want to be able to make
sure that on a daily basis

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.660
we're breaking down
body fat as well.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.030
So when people have
high triglycerides,

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.760
that tells us that they're in
an excess state of lipogenesis.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.140
They're storing more
fat throughout the day.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.560
The other reason I
look at triglycerides

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.480
as being important
is because they

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.420
are an early marker of
insulin resistance, that

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.310
carbohydrate traffic problem.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.250
So if you've had labs done, and
your blood glucose has always

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.440
been good-- your
A1Cs are normal--

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.860
often patients are like, great.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.230
I don't have any signs
of risk for diabetes.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.780
But if your
triglycerides are high,

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.670
I call that pre pre-diabetes.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.500
That's an early sign
already that your body

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.000
has developed that
metabolic traffic

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.950
problem, so be aware of that.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.960
High triglycerides
are an early trigger

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.440
to atherosclerosis, which is
the process of plaque formation

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.030
in the blood vessel walls.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.400
And it also leads
to the formation

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.400
of a type of cholesterol
called type B LDL,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.530
and we'll talk about
that in the next slide.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.890
High triglycerides
also lower your HDL.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.806
Think of H as standing for
healthy, the good cholesterol.

00:18:29.806 --> 00:18:31.930
So typically, when you look
at a cholesterol panel,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.890
a very common pattern is you'll
see high triglycerides combined

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.240
with low HDL.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.030
They go hand in hand because
the high triglycerides

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.780
physiologically push
down the HDL levels.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.780
So really be aware of
those types of processes.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.180
LDL, one quick thing
on LDL, again, I

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.709
mentioned to you
that it was really

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:52.000
emphasized in medical training.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.130
It's still important,
but it's probably not

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.020
the central culprit in
a lot of our patients

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.770
that have insulin resistance.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.570
So think of LDL cholesterol
as being a cholesterol boat.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.640
So LDL carries cholesterol.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.700
The cargo is cholesterol,
and the boat is LDL.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.860
So basically, when you
get a standard cholesterol

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.080
panel done, what
you're measuring is

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.120
you're not measuring
the number of boats.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.700
You're measuring how much
cholesterol each of those LDL

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.890
boats carries.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.390
When you get a more
advanced panel--

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.431
I'm not recommending
advanced panels in everyone.

00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:24.650
But really, what's causing a lot
of heart disease is two things.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.490
Number one, if you're generating
more of these small boats,

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.630
we call those type
B LDL particles,

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.100
and if there's a lot of them.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.275
So you can see in this
image from my book,

00:19:33.275 --> 00:19:34.900
there's a type B.
There's a boat that's

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.260
anchored on to the side
of a blood vessel wall.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.000
When these boats attach
to our blood vessel wall,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
that's when they trigger
plaque formation, which

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.510
can lead to heart attacks.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.720
So generally, when we have
more of the small boats,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.070
you would think that
big boats are worse,

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.560
but it's actually the small
boats that cause more damage.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.830
More of the type B LDLs
is what causes damage.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.250
Now even without having to get
an advanced cholesterol panel,

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.660
I'm going to give you a quick
shortcut for figuring out

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.870
how you might have
those type-B boats.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.230
If your triglycerides
are typically above 150,

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.030
it's almost guaranteed,
80%, 90% chance

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.700
that you have the type-B boats.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.840
If they're above
200, 90%, 95% chance

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.274
that you have type-B boats.

00:20:14.274 --> 00:20:15.940
So again, the main
point I'm telling you

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.820
about this and the slide before
it is triglycerides, often

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.775
that is the early marker that
instigates all these changes.

00:20:21.775 --> 00:20:26.980
It lowers the HDL, makes
you develop the type-B LDL.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.200
So if we can keep
track of that number

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.480
and then make the right
lifestyle changes to reduce

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.899
that, that's really empowering.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.690
You can see that you're
actually preventing

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.880
a lot of these health
conditions from happening.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.580
So let's put some
numbers to this, OK?

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.970
So this is a heart attack case
study, not an actual patient.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.430
The numbers are actual, but
I just put up a name, Ed.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.594
So Ed's a 32-year-old
VC, Venture Capitalist,

00:20:48.594 --> 00:20:50.260
who came to see me
after his first heart

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.980
attack six months ago.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.220
He has a body mass index of 22.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.250
You know, so the general cut
off for the population is 25,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.670
but this guy's pretty lean,
based on his body mass index.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.870
He's got normal blood pressure,
non-smoker, exercises five days

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:05.504
a week.

00:21:05.504 --> 00:21:07.420
And he was told that his
lipids are not highly

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.384
concerning by his last doctor.

00:21:09.384 --> 00:21:11.050
So now let's go through
his numbers, OK?

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.450
So I put the target
levels on the right column

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.070
and his results
basically in the middle.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.940
So the first thing is his
total cholesterol is 190.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.450
And I actually put target
level as not important

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.950
because usually what does it
say in most cholesterol panels?

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.200
What number is the one
that triggers concern?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.105
When it's above
what, 200, right?

00:21:28.105 --> 00:21:29.980
Whenever people have a
cholesterol above 200,

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.280
then they get concerned.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.910
But in this case,
his is less than 200.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.160
So most people would say, hey.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.470
That's not too bad.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.170
His LDL, that bad
cholesterol, is 108.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.360
So typically, a cutoff might be
less than 100 or less than 130.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.180
So that's really not that bad.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.849
His HDL came back at 32.

00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:46.390
That's the healthy,
good cholesterol.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.790
And in males, we want
that to be above 40,

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.160
so that's kind of
low in his case.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.860
The triglycerides
came back at 250.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.720
And the cutoff for
most labs is 150.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.720
But I'll tell you, based
on more recent science,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.610
we want that number
to be closer than 100.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.860
There are actually some
health care entities out there

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.950
that use the cutoff of 400
or 500, which is astounding.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.050
We've got to make sure
that it's less than 150.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.220
100 or below is even better,
so his was clearly high.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.280
And then I put it
in red, the ratios.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.670
So this is a key point.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.560
When you look at your
cholesterol panel,

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.010
pay attention to ratios
rather than absolute numbers.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.310
The first number is the total
cholesterol to HDL ratio.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.600
You take the 190.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.460
Divide by the
healthy cholesterol.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.170
The ratio is 5.9.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.292
So it should be less than 4.0,
so that ratio is elevated.

00:22:32.292 --> 00:22:34.000
The other number I
want to tell you about

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.550
is not reported on nearly
all cholesterol panels,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.710
but I think is one of the
most important ratios you

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.550
can understand, the
triglyceride to HDL ratio.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.230
You take the triglycerides.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.000
You divide by the HDL.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.130
The ratio should
be less than 3.0.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.290
His ratio came back at 7.8.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.840
So if we had looked at these
ratios in the right way,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.669
if I had seen this
guy 5, 10 years ago,

00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:55.960
I would have been all over him.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.660
I would be like, we have to
make sure we fix this as soon

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.570
as possible, because his
high-stress lifestyle,

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.970
even though he's
exercising, he's young,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.711
this sort of cholesterol
panel with high stress,

00:23:06.711 --> 00:23:07.960
probably some family history--

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.192
I can't recall, probably
had some family history--

00:23:10.192 --> 00:23:12.400
this led to the development
of very early onset heart

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.590
disease, which we're
seeing very commonly.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.750
So when we're talking
about body fat, too,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.680
so body fat ends up being
a major risk as well, too.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.580
So I want to spend a
few moments to explain

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.890
to you about body fat.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.800
When you think of body fat,
let's use a jelly donut.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.557
I know this is not the most
nutritionally sound analogy.

00:23:31.557 --> 00:23:33.140
This my trigger some
hunger in people,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.420
but I don't want to use this
as an example of body fat

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.800
and the two major
types of body fat.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.370
So think of the jelly inside
as being a type of fat

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.500
called visceral fat.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.230
We also refer to that as
being like an inflammatory fat

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.360
because that's the
type of fat usually

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.130
around our belly
and waistline that

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.890
causes chemical
substances to be released

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.730
that can trigger inflammation.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.730
Now the crust of that
jelly donut, think of that

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.100
as being subcutaneous body fat.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.230
And subcutaneous
means under the skin.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.320
So most of the visible, external
fat that we carry around,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.910
that's hanging
over our belt line,

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.940
is subcutaneous fat,
where the deeper fat that

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.450
sits inside our liver or
encases our internal organs,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.310
that's the visceral fat.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.470
So even though the
external, visible fat

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.940
might seem like
it's more damaging,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.715
it's that more invisible fat
that causes more trouble.

00:24:20.715 --> 00:24:23.340
Now I'm putting up this diagram
of different ethnic backgrounds

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.800
because the distribution
of jelly to crust

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.170
varies based on your
ethnic background.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.660
You look at Caucasians, and
their distribution of jelly

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.670
to crust, moderate jelly.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.040
And they've got a fair
amount of crust around that.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.500
African Americans,
interestingly, relatively,

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.230
have a smaller amount of
that inflammatory jelly,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.510
but they've got more of
the visible, external fat,

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.946
the subcutaneous fat.

00:24:43.946 --> 00:24:44.820
And it's interesting.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.250
So African Americans do
develop diabetes as well, too.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.602
Their incidence is not
as high as most Asians.

00:24:49.602 --> 00:24:51.810
A lot of their heart disease
comes from hypertension.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.226
Their rates of
high blood pressure

00:24:53.226 --> 00:24:55.690
are much higher than
the other ethnic groups.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.960
But then look at the
Asians on the right.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.210
Asians on the right,
relatively speaking,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.520
are carrying around a
lot more of the jelly,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.220
more of the visceral,
inflammatory fat.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.790
But they've got a very thin
rim of the visible fat.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.750
And the reason I see so many
Asians with heart disease

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.350
at a normal body mass index is
because of that distribution.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.080
They've got more of that
deep, invisible fat,

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.210
but they've got less
of the external fat.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.070
So often, many of my
heart attack patients

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.450
have normal body mass
index, or they're skinny.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.850
They're, like,
pencil-thin skinny

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.750
with very skinny arms and legs.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.200
And they're shocked that they
develop diabetes or develop

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.370
their first heart event.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.830
It's because they're carrying
more of that jelly, so really

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.160
important to keep in mind.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.540
This is a slide of two famous
obesity researchers, Dr. Yajnik

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.860
and Dr. Yudkin.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.660
So Dr. Yudkin is on your left,
and he's basically from the UK.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.632
And Dr. Yajnik is
from South India.

00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:51.090
And I'm just putting
up this slide.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.798
They've done a lot of
compelling research

00:25:52.798 --> 00:25:54.192
around insulin resistance.

00:25:54.192 --> 00:25:56.150
And I'm just putting this
slide up to show you.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.733
They're actually at
an Indian wedding.

00:25:57.733 --> 00:25:59.810
You can see by the saris
in the background there.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.000
And they actually have an
identical body mass index.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.220
But then look at their scans.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.170
So what you're looking
at on the sides here,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.340
those are DEXA scans.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.800
So DEXA scans are basically
used traditionally

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.810
to measure bone density,
but they're also

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.820
very accurate imaging
studies to look at fat.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.730
So the dark-purple
areas are fat.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.650
So you can see
that if you compare

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.510
the skinny guy on
the right here,

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.730
he's got significantly more body
fat than the doctor on the left

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:25.310
there.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.120
And you can see the body fat
comes down to be 9% versus 21%.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.490
So clearly, he's not
carrying around much crust,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.440
right, not much
subcutaneous fat.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.780
But he's storing a
lot of visceral fat.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.716
So very, very high risk of
heart disease on the right.

00:26:38.716 --> 00:26:40.340
And this is a cultural
thing, you know.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.048
In my book, I kind of
joke about the fact

00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:44.600
that a lot of times if you've
got a son or a son-in-law

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.070
like this, what does
the family want to do?

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.720
They want to overfeed
the heck out of that guy

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.678
because they think that
he's going to basically

00:26:49.678 --> 00:26:50.782
starve to death, right?

00:26:50.782 --> 00:26:53.240
And a lot of times, skinny
guys, a lot of my skinny Asians,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.800
think that they got
the lucky genes.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.990
So they go around, eating
whatever the heck they want.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.864
And they don't realize
that they are actually

00:26:58.864 --> 00:27:01.550
causing a bad problem, making it
worse, because they're actually

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.490
causing more inflammation by
storing more fat in the liver.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.740
Often, these slender
folks have fatty livers.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.990
We check their liver function
tests and ultrasound.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.350
And their liver is stocked
away with all this storage fat.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.940
And that's why a key
message is really

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.250
don't judge anybody
just by looking at them.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.909
I have plenty of people
with high body mass indexes.

00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:20.450
And their heart
disease risk is quite

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.520
low because of the
lifestyle that they lead.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.760
Their numbers are good.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.490
But plenty of slender
folks that are not

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.040
leading the right lifestyle,
and their risk of heart disease

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.810
is significantly higher.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.030
And one other thing I
want to mention, too,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.040
about the problem with
the guy on the right

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.390
is not just the visceral
fat that he's storing.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.390
There's something else
that really concerned me.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.490
It's the fact that he's so
skinny in his arms and legs.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.810
When you're that skinny,
remember my parking diagram.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.020
We want our muscle parking
lots to be vigorous and strong.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.970
When you've got
stronger muscles,

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.860
they store more carbohydrates.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.350
When you've got skinny, skinny
arms and legs and you're

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.540
not working out at
all, what that means is

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.570
it takes less carbohydrates
for you to start shifting

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.750
traffic into the liver to
make triglycerides and fat

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.610
or into that visceral fat store.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.640
So it's a combination-- more of
that fat causing inflammation

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.637
and less storage space, less
energy demand from the muscles.

00:28:10.637 --> 00:28:12.470
And we have to attack
both of those problems

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.060
if we want to really
reverse this risk.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.960
So based on this, so waistline
targets based on ethnicity

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.700
are actually
stratified because of

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.220
that jelly-to-crust difference
between different cultures.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.960
This is up here
for your reference.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.930
So the waistline
cutoffs for US, somebody

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.480
from European background, or
somebody from Asian background

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.115
is different.

00:28:32.115 --> 00:28:34.240
So unfortunately, somebody
from my background, I've

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.260
got less room for
error around my waist.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.440
So I've got to stay leaner
than somebody that's

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.606
from a different background.

00:28:39.606 --> 00:28:41.140
Now these are
general guidelines.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.000
I've definitely seen a
lot of slender people

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.850
of European descent that still
have a lot of visceral fat,

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.050
and they have fatty liver.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.960
But culturally speaking,
because of that tendency,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.356
you have to look at
culturally tailored cutoffs.

00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:54.730
And this is something I'm
educating the medical community

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.410
about because often
you'll see a doctor.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.685
And you get treated
like everyone

00:28:57.685 --> 00:28:59.140
is from the same
ethnic background.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.140
We're looking at the same
body mass index scale,

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.419
the same waist circumference.

00:29:02.419 --> 00:29:04.210
But we've got to really
culturally stratify

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.880
that information.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.400
Waist-to-hip ratio is
another very powerful way

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.060
that you can assess risk.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.450
So basically, when you
look at different cultures,

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.010
body mass index doesn't
tend to work very well.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.530
It's a very blunt tool.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.480
So body mass index,
again, is your weight

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.860
relative to your height.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.740
But waist to hip ratios
are a really accurate tool

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.030
for assessing
heart disease risk.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.940
So you take your
waist circumference.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.040
You divide it by your
hip circumference,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.106
and you get that ratio.

00:29:31.106 --> 00:29:32.980
And I've got some videos
and other references

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.240
that show you how to do this.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.906
Look up a video that
says how to measure

00:29:35.906 --> 00:29:37.520
the waist-hip ratio accurately.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.770
But I've put the cutoff there.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.150
So this could be
a much better way

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.316
to assess risk because we're
really trying to assess

00:29:42.316 --> 00:29:45.920
that dangerous visceral fat.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.990
There's actually a
gender disparity, too,

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.240
in fat distribution.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.750
I want to go over this briefly.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.880
So coming back to buy,
my carbohydrate car

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.360
and that jelly donut diagram,
interestingly, women,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.260
especially before menopause,
more of their carbohydrates

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.130
tend to go to the crust,
more of that visible fat.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:08.360
For guys, interestingly,
their glucose traffic

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.555
tends to go to the jelly.

00:30:09.555 --> 00:30:10.680
OK, so what does that mean?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.860
So I see a lot of
couples in my practice.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.990
And often what happens
is you'll see the guy.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.170
He's, like, 20, 30 pounds
maybe lighter than the wife,

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.330
but his triglycerides
are through the roof.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.080
Inflammation levels are high.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.230
And the reason is
because his traffic is

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.850
going towards the visceral fat.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.650
And his traffic's also
going to the liver

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.610
to produce triglycerides.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.430
The woman, you know,
is like, my God.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.320
I'm, like, 20, 30
pounds heavier.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.760
All my numbers are normal.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.100
But why am I still
storing that extra fat?

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.370
Because more of her fat is
going to the subcutaneous layer.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.650
Less of it's going to the liver.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.810
So before menopause,
why does that happen?

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.820
I mean, when you
think evolutionarily,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.250
women were designed
to protectively

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.850
store more fat because it's
to basically promote progeny.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.640
OK, in times of
stress and things,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.286
women are supposed to store more
fat in that subcutaneous area.

00:30:59.286 --> 00:31:01.160
So they have more of a
protective filter that

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.116
prevents the
cholesterol from going

00:31:03.116 --> 00:31:04.490
in the wrong
direction, the carbs

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.300
from going in the
wrong direction.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.530
But unfortunately, when they hit
perimenopause after menopause,

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.464
things change.

00:31:10.464 --> 00:31:12.380
So now all of a sudden,
we've got more traffic

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.770
going towards that
inflammatory fat.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.330
In many of my women,
when they hit 45 or 50,

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.160
we start seeing fatty
liver triglycerides go up.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.850
So I tell women, don't
feel bulletproof by this,

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.590
especially if you
have a family history.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.006
You've got to
prepare for the fact

00:31:26.006 --> 00:31:28.280
that maybe towards menopause
or after menopause,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.340
these numbers might start to
go in the wrong direction.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.870
So we've got to
really prevent that

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.120
by being proactive early on.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.260
So this might be a
reason why we see this.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.620
That subcutaneous fat,
it's a separate topic.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.230
It's a little bit more
difficult to shed.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.480
So when we see couples
that go on lifestyle plans,

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.360
typically the male will
shed their fat very quickly.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.090
But subcutaneous fat, we'll
talk about this actually

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.620
in a couple of future slides.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.510
There are other elements
to subcutaneous fat

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.010
that makes it more
difficult to shed

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.380
than just exercising
harder and just reducing

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.390
carbs or calories in the diet.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.080
So how do you tell that you
have that insulin-resistant

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.940
carbohydrate traffic problem?

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.657
So I put a list of criteria.

00:32:06.657 --> 00:32:08.240
Most of these overlap
with a condition

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.323
called metabolic syndrome.

00:32:09.323 --> 00:32:11.630
So if you looked up metabolic
syndrome, a lot of these

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.492
are similar.

00:32:12.492 --> 00:32:14.700
But, again, we've gone over
most of these principles,

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.100
so these should make sense.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.680
The increased waist
circumference or visceral fat,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.380
the high triglycerides, the
low HDL, the blood glucose,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.350
which can be
represented by a glucose

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.410
level or an A1C,
high blood pressure

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.690
also is linked to
insulin resistance.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.000
If you have certain
specific conditions,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.370
like gout, like fatty
liver, or like PCOS,

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.810
acanthosis nigricans is
actually a hyper-pigmented skin

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:39.720
disorder.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.300
So a lot of people of South
Asian descent, for example,

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.300
might have these dark
streaks in their skin folds.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.880
That's actually a sign
of insulin resistance.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.520
And then diabetes
during pregnancy

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.250
or gestational diabetes are
all obviously associated.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.724
Now high-risk ethnic groups,
South Asians, East Asians,

00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:56.390
we're seeing it.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.744
Hispanics, Latinos, Filipinos
tend to relatively have more

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:00.410
of these issues.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.120
Native Americans
have very high rates

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.980
of insulin resistance as well.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.500
So these ethnic backgrounds
do put us at greater risk.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.220
So how do we overcome
insulin resistance?

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.330
At a high level, I'm putting
this traffic diagram.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.760
This is a bit of a
different image from this.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.990
And we're going
to dig into these

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.190
in a little bit more detail.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.740
But I want to talk
about a few concepts

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.324
based on these
different parking lots.

00:33:21.324 --> 00:33:23.364
So the first thing is when
we look at our muscle,

00:33:23.364 --> 00:33:24.810
we talked about
this a little bit.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.684
But the first thing is
we just have to reduce

00:33:26.684 --> 00:33:28.230
the carbohydrate traffic.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.050
If we're eating excessive
amounts of carbohydrates

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.814
on a daily basis, our muscle
parking lot is constantly full.

00:33:34.814 --> 00:33:37.230
And what people don't realize
is if they go through a day,

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.180
and they overate
carbohydrates, I

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.100
wish when you wake
up in the morning

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.100
it would just automatically
reset and just clear the cache.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.200
The memory is gone, and
the muscles open up.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.100
It doesn't happen.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.720
Your body stays
closed the minute

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.010
you wake up in the morning.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.320
So even the healthiest
carbohydrates you take in,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.190
they have no physical
space to get inside.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.220
So we do have to
regularly make sure we're

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.500
keeping track of that
carbohydrate traffic

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.160
and keeping it on the lower end.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.260
We want to do some form
of resistance and strength

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.760
training.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.551
So if you're only doing
walking and cardio,

00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:06.550
those are great for your health.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.489
But again, if you're
a slender Asian that

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:09.961
doesn't have much
parking space, we

00:34:09.961 --> 00:34:12.460
might have to up the weights a
little bit and do some squats

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.230
and focus on the
larger muscle groups

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.094
so we can enhance
the parking space.

00:34:16.094 --> 00:34:18.510
We want to increase overall
activity, getting more walking

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.199
steps, doing all those things.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.750
So that's the muscle end of it.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.530
For the liver, same concept.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.670
We want to reduce that glucose
traffic because your liver

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.350
actually take starches, right?

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.320
So why do I see so
much high triglycerides

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.290
in my vegetarian Indians
who don't eat red meat,

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.850
and they hardly eat fat?

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.690
Because the main fuel
for their triglycerides

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.320
is coming from the starches.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.570
It's coming from the
flatbreads and the rice,

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.520
even the lentils in abundance.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.860
So we have to reduce
that carb traffic.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.500
We also want to eat clean
foods because our liver is

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.150
our filter that detoxifies.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.239
So if you're eating foods that
are processed and packaged,

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.664
if you're eating out a lot
and using inflammatory oils,

00:34:56.664 --> 00:34:58.080
that's going to
clog up the liver.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.114
If you're drinking
alcohol excessively,

00:35:00.114 --> 00:35:02.280
that's going to prevent us
from cleansing the liver.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.200
And then practices like
intermittent fasting

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.462
will help empty out some of the
extra glucose and fat stores.

00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:10.170
Now it's a longer list
on the right side.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.400
Some of this is similar.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.070
Reducing carb traffic,
eating cleaner foods,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.340
intermittent fasting, powerful,
managing stress and sleep

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.120
is a huge part.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.795
A lot of this subcutaneous
fat, believe it or not,

00:35:20.795 --> 00:35:22.170
is really linked
to our emotions.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.130
And unless we're able
to manage emotions,

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.485
that subcutaneous fat
holds on because, again,

00:35:26.485 --> 00:35:27.860
for a woman's body
in particular,

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.220
that feels like a threat.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.390
You're in a threatening
environment.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.800
I'm not going to shed
this fat because I'm going

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.970
to pop out a baby, all right?

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.761
Even if you're not
planning to have a baby,

00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:36.780
your body is thinking
like that all the time.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.660
That's like a comforting,
insulating type of fat.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.790
Replenishing
micronutrients, so even

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.100
if you're on a low
calorie, low carb diet,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.840
if there are specific
micronutrients that

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.080
are missing, then that might
promote excessive fat storage.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.990
Restoring hormonal balance,
so in addition to insulin

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.490
that we've talked
about, melatonin,

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.410
because of disrupted
sleep patterns,

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.000
cortisol, which is
our stress hormone,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.970
if we don't fix those things,
we may not shed that fat.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.520
And then we do want to limit
any environmental toxins we

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.270
might be exposed to.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.970
And then just a quick point, so
I'm all about root cause, OK?

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.430
So now you guys know the
metabolic nutritional

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:13.070
underpinnings of why
insulin resistance happens.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.570
But there's a lot of behavioral
psychological underpinnings,

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.069
too.

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:18.590
So I often tell people that
insulin resistance, at its root

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.464
cause, often comes
from inner resistance.

00:36:20.464 --> 00:36:22.380
Many of us are going to
walk out of this talk.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.850
We're going to understand
what we need to do,

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.600
but we're still not
going to do it, right?

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.933
So what are some of the reasons?

00:36:27.933 --> 00:36:29.780
I don't have time right
now, but, you know,

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.100
things will get
easier later in life.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.810
We all know that life
does not get easier.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.200
I'll wait till the
kids get older.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.210
My wife and I have twins.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.084
So when they were babies,
we were like, gosh,

00:36:37.084 --> 00:36:39.410
once they hit 8, 10, whatever,
things will get easier.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:40.679
Things are not easier, right?

00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:43.220
You just find a different way
to become overwhelmed and busy.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.874
Once my startup, I
see a lot of execs,

00:36:44.874 --> 00:36:46.790
or I see a lot of people
working in companies.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.320
And they've got
business ambitions.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.290
Once this startup or
this idea takes off,

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.450
then I'll have more time
to focus on my health.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.300
I'll have money to hire a
personal trainer, whatever.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.680
We've talked about genes.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.240
Diabetes is in my family.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.106
I can't escape it.

00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:00.605
Why bother?

00:37:00.605 --> 00:37:02.570
Well, today I've
told you, definitely

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.610
bother, because you can
be the one to not have

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.930
diabetes in the family.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:07.670
And then we talked about
the other part of the genes,

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.086
where people are like, well,
my parents lived a long life.

00:37:10.086 --> 00:37:10.700
I'm protected.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.777
Don't think like that.

00:37:11.777 --> 00:37:13.610
And then the last one,
which is my favorite,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.780
I hear all the time.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.850
Eating lots of rice
is part of my culture.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.020
I can't avoid it.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.340
I'm predestined to eat that.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.650
And I want to use that
last point to transition

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.320
to my next slide,
which basically

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.230
is if you are going to say
that, well, I want to eat rice

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.750
like my ancestors, then
you have to start living

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.400
life like your ancestors, too.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.060
You can't be selective about it.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.960
I'm from a part of
India, from Calcutta.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.800
So I'm Bengali.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.690
When I was growing
up, every summer, we'd

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.434
go out to Calcutta, and I'd
marvel at the rickshaw pullers.

00:37:41.434 --> 00:37:43.600
We lived in an area that
was right near the rickshaw

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.580
pullers, and I would
always watch these guys.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.455
And the thing with
rickshaw pullers--

00:37:47.455 --> 00:37:48.830
I actually found
this while doing

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.600
a little bit of
research-- is on average,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.270
they run about
40,000 steps a day.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.387
And they're doing it in
a sprint type fashion.

00:37:55.387 --> 00:37:56.720
They sprint, stop, sprint, stop.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.553
So they're literally
doing interval training

00:37:58.553 --> 00:38:00.006
for several hours each day.

00:38:00.006 --> 00:38:01.880
They have definitely
got strong legs and core

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.280
because they're carting
around families, where they're

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.190
becoming heavier and heavier
because of the obesity crisis,

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.520
or other loads as well.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.820
So they've definitely got
a strong leg and core.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.770
Normal vitamin D
levels because you

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.860
get most of your vitamin
D from sun exposure.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.310
So if you're dressed
like that and you're out

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:17.810
in the sun all day,
you're not going

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.430
to have vitamin D deficiency.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.900
And vitamin D is not just
about bone health and strength.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.500
The vitamin D actually
helps lower inflammation.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.530
It can also help with
insulin resistance.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.030
That metabolic
traffic problem, when

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.590
you're vitamin D
deficient, there

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.420
are studies that
link severe vitamin D

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.400
deficiency to worsening
insulin resistance.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.520
So for this sort of guy,
eating extra servings of rice

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.220
is OK, all right?

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.870
But what about my
guy on the right?

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:45.060
2,000 steps is on average what
my engineers tend to walk,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.380
2,000 to 3,000 steps.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.620
I actually track their
steps like a vital sign.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.630
So this guy is
about 20 times less

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.140
active than the guy on the
left, weak leg and core

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.270
from sitting all day,
rampant vitamin D deficiency

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.090
because we've replaced
sunlight with screen light.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.457
For him, lots of rice can
cause a completely different

00:39:01.457 --> 00:39:04.040
metabolic disturbance, insulin
resistance and all these health

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:04.539
crises.

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:06.380
Now I'm not saying we
have to quit our jobs

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.350
and become rickshaw pullers,
pulling rickshaws down the 101.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.250
But we do want to mimic some
of these lifestyle habits

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.370
however we can.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.760
And doing some of this
can make dramatic impacts

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.135
on a lot of the
health conditions

00:39:17.135 --> 00:39:18.890
that we've talked about.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.230
So again, coming back
to the whole issue

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.180
of the metabolic
traffic problem,

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.824
this is a little slide
image from my book.

00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:28.490
But these are the types of meals
that I see in the patients that

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.750
come into my clinic.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.020
So typically, instead of
looking in calories and fat,

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.869
I will get people to understand
how many carbohydrates

00:39:34.869 --> 00:39:37.160
or net carbohydrates should
they be consuming each day.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.530
And by net carbohydrates,
what that means is

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.570
you take the grams
of carbs in a food.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.119
And you subtract
the grams of fiber

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:44.660
because that's the
healthy part of it

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.076
and see how much
you're left with.

00:39:46.076 --> 00:39:49.430
You can use an app, you know,
MyFitnessPal or some sort

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.600
of fitness tracker.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.125
And just see on a daily basis
how much you're consuming.

00:39:53.125 --> 00:39:53.750
So you can see.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.570
This is a relatively benign
looking meal, very common.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:59.690
This woman, Sumita,
is eating one chapati.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.840
She's having a cup of cooked
lentils, a cup of cooked--

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.880
aloo sabji is basically
a potato-based curry.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.170
So that's one meal.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.970
And in that one
meal, she's basically

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:11.420
consuming about 94 grams
of net carbohydrates, which

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.579
is about what I eat
in an entire day.

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:14.870
So that's where the problem is.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.810
Even though this is
low calorie, low fat,

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.935
she's eating this two
to three times a day.

00:40:19.935 --> 00:40:22.310
That's going to lead to more
of that carbohydrate traffic

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.160
problem.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.350
What's happening in China?

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.290
We're seeing a major
epidemic of diabetes.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.070
The rise there is incredible.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.880
I found this one meta analysis,
which looked at several studies

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.120
to assess how much rice is
being consumed in China.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.450
625 grams of rice daily, right?

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.310
And I just told you,
probably an optimal

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.460
for our modern lifestyle
is between 100 to 150.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.324
That's about four
servings daily.

00:40:45.324 --> 00:40:47.240
When they compare that
to Western populations,

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.570
they do about two to three
servings of rice per week.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.980
And this is just rice.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.470
This is 625 grams
just from rice.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.000
And on the noodles, the
desserts, whatever sauces,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.750
and the carbohydrates, we
might be close to 1,000, right?

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.510
So that's really what's really
causing a lot of the issues

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.060
that we're seeing
throughout Asia.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.549
So based on what I told
you, many of my patients--

00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:09.340
so the thing that was
really startling is I

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.756
found that I was seeing so
much heart disease and diabetes

00:41:11.756 --> 00:41:14.890
risk in my vegetarian Indians,
for example, my vegetarian

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:15.760
patients.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.260
And I'm definitely
a fan of eating

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.637
more of a plant-based diet.

00:41:18.637 --> 00:41:20.470
But we have to make
sure that we're actually

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.720
eating plants along with that.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.430
Most of my vegetarians are what
I call grainatarians, right?

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.850
So this is, like, a type of
meal that my uncle in Calcutta

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:28.480
would eat.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.729
And I just wanted to show you.

00:41:29.729 --> 00:41:31.630
You can see we've
got two flatbreads.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.040
We've got a bowl of rice.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.416
Those four brown golf balls
are Indian sweets there.

00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:38.290
You know, there's all
these other carbs here.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.831
And the interesting thing is he
would eat through this plate,

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:43.360
and the tomatoes and cucumbers
would always be left behind.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.564
So I always tell people,
that salad, actually, it's

00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:46.480
not meant to be eaten.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.170
It actually has a
decorative purpose.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.570
It just adds color
to your plate.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:50.950
But eating it is
optional, right?

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.560
So this is a type of vegetarian
meal that we're eating.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.660
And even in Asian noodle dishes,
we might have some vegetables.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.660
But there's a lot of
starches, and often they're

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.400
cooked in the wrong
types of oils.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.560
So those processes of
inflammation and insulin

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.110
resistance are really
propagated by eating foods

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.080
like this on a regular basis
and not being active, not

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.660
creating that muscle demand.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.810
Carb copycats is one concept
I talk about in my clinic.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.080
How do we eat foods?

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.210
Now I'm so happy.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.861
When I first wrote the book, I
put the recipe for cauli rice

00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:19.360
in there.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.020
I was telling people, try
to lower your starches

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.370
and add these carb
copycats into your food.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.590
And now as you know,
most grocery stores,

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.470
Trader Joe's, have cauliflower
rice pre-riced for you.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.870
But these simple
substitutions significantly

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:34.150
bring down our net carb intake.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.120
That lowers insulin.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.940
It causes your body
to burn more fat.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.550
So this is just a game-changing
tool that can really

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.780
help lower visceral fat.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.180
So simple changes
like this are really

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.140
encouraged in all patients.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.770
Now I get a lot of questions
about saturated fat.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.030
Is it good or bad, right?

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.350
I mean, it depends on the week.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.480
Every week, I feel like
the news headlines change.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.729
Saturated fat is good for you.

00:42:53.729 --> 00:42:55.270
No, saturated fat
is bad for you.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.060
And really, it depends
on the individual person.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.447
It depends on your genes.

00:42:59.447 --> 00:43:01.780
So I put a couple of names
of different genes out there.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.180
But basically, in my patients,
I don't check these genes.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.110
But what we do is if we put
them on a diet that's lower carb

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.075
and maybe a little bit
more saturated fat,

00:43:09.075 --> 00:43:11.200
I'll check their cholesterol
in two or three months

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.770
and see how the numbers look.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.770
In most cases, if they're
eating healthy sources

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:17.840
of saturated fat, I don't see
adverse cholesterol elevations.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.582
But in some cases, if
these genes might be off,

00:43:20.582 --> 00:43:22.790
there might be significant
elevations in cholesterol.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.340
And then we have to reassess.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.860
Are we eating too much ghee
or coconut oil or butter

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.800
in the diet?

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.610
So my overall approach to
fat is you want to diversify.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.277
Right now, coconut oil
is all over the news.

00:43:34.277 --> 00:43:36.860
Everyone is putting coconut oil
in their hair, in their mouth.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.026
Whatever they can find,
they're putting coconut oil.

00:43:39.026 --> 00:43:40.490
And I'm not opposed to that.

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:43.610
But I tell people, you want
to diversify your fat intake

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.250
because although
in many patients

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.150
I find coconut oil
and butter and ghee

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:48.890
will not raise
their cholesterol,

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.212
they have not also been found
to be as heart protective

00:43:51.212 --> 00:43:53.170
as some of the other fats
that have been around

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:54.660
or have been
studied more deeply.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.130
So emphasize the evidence-based,
heart-healthy fats,

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.490
the monounsaturated fats like
olive oil, avocados, nuts,

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.450
and seeds, omega 3s from
marine sources or leafy greens.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.680
Eliminate the
hydrogenated trans fats.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.860
Hopefully, we were
doing that already.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.170
Cut back or cut out
the seed-based omega

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.674
6 oils like safflower,
corn, sunflower.

00:44:14.674 --> 00:44:16.340
Many of us are still
cooking with these.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.142
But these are highly
processed oils

00:44:18.142 --> 00:44:19.850
that can trigger
inflammation, especially

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.797
if you cook at a high
temperature with them.

00:44:21.797 --> 00:44:23.630
And then if you're using
some saturated fat,

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.957
make sure they're well-sourced.

00:44:24.957 --> 00:44:26.540
And use them in
moderation, especially

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.890
if you've seen any elevations
in your cholesterol.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.920
So if you diversify
that fat intake,

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.450
you should be in
good shape, rather

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.440
than focusing on just one
type of saturated fat.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.090
So overall approach,
whether you're

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.660
vegetarian or non-vegetarian,
half that plate

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.100
has got to be vegetables, OK?

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.480
A lot of people
on low-carb diets

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.402
use that as an excuse
to eat a lot of meat.

00:44:46.402 --> 00:44:48.110
That's definitely not
a healthy approach.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.820
Half of it's got to be veggies.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.670
We've got a corner of protein,
a corner of carbohydrates,

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.470
some of the healthy
fats, there, too.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.960
And then I vary this in
myself and my patients

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.190
based on activity.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.070
If I did a major endurance event
or did some really hardcore

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:03.680
workout for an hour,
then I can starch up

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.592
because my muscles
need that starch.

00:45:05.592 --> 00:45:07.550
If I had a day where I
sat in meetings all day,

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.480
and my muscles don't
have much of a demand,

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.021
I'm going to be much
more restrictive

00:45:11.021 --> 00:45:12.500
about the carbohydrate intake.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.695
Same with the protein,
if I did heavy lifting,

00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:16.070
and I've broken
down some muscle,

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:17.900
and I need to rebuild
some new muscle,

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.822
I might amp the protein up.

00:45:19.822 --> 00:45:22.280
But if you're just sitting all
day and eating lots and lots

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.110
of protein, that's
not good for your body

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.440
at all because excessive protein
intake when you're sedentary

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.690
will cause the release
of that chemical

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.030
we talked about
earlier called IGF-1.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.190
And that in high amounts
on a persistent level

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.200
can cause more tumor
cell proliferation.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.969
It can actually
increase cancer growth.

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.760
I put a list because
I always get questions

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.560
about proteins and vegetarians.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.690
And I think there was
already a question on Dory.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.540
I put the list of some of the
vegetarian proteins there.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.940
And I did a dedicated
protein post on that,

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.800
so for vegetarians.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.020
Sp clearly, vegetarians can
get multiple healthy protein

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.880
sources into their diet.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.280
OK, so exercise, I think we're
all aware of activity monitors.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.380
We want to make sure we're
getting regular steps

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.320
because prolonged sitting does
cause an elevation in glucose

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.730
and triglycerides.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.990
So try to interrupt prolonged
sitting every 20 to 30 minutes.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.010
Use these trackers to
keep you motivated.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.600
I tell people, make sure you've
gotten at least 4,000 steps

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.410
by 12:00 to 1:00 PM so you're
distributing your steps

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.550
throughout the day.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.180
Interval training is a great
way to clear parking space.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.820
If I overate carbs one
day, my goal the next day

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.380
is, how do I make parking space?

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.940
Interval training is a quick,
efficient way to do that.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.030
So you can use apps
like Tabata or Seconds,

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.400
but basically doing anything
high intensity for, say,

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.670
20, 30 seconds and then
pausing for 15 seconds,

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.050
20 seconds again.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.130
Do a few sets of that.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:43.310
In 10 to 15 minutes, you can
clear a lot of parking space

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:44.210
in the muscles.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.090
So these are great ways that
you can trigger fat burning,

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:48.177
boost growth hormone.

00:46:48.177 --> 00:46:49.760
But the one thing I
tell you is people

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.800
that do short-session
HIT training,

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.301
sometimes they use that as an
excuse to actually sit longer.

00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:55.800
They'll do a 10
minute workout, then

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.500
they go straight back
to their computer.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.430
No, don't do that.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.429
I mean, you definitely
want to still incorporate

00:47:00.429 --> 00:47:02.570
some longer exercise
sessions to allow your body

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:03.750
to really benefit from that.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.530
So don't just substitute an hour
workout with a 10-minute HIT

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.060
session.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.370
And then resistance
training, so this is in India

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:11.732
during the monsoon season.

00:47:11.732 --> 00:47:13.940
It's hard enough that these
guys have to pull humans.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.980
But then all of a sudden,
they have to pull them

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.750
through floodwater conditions.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.030
But resistance training,
like we've talked about,

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:23.850
is another core part of really
reversing insulin resistance.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.390
So do full-body-type workouts.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.200
Use your legs.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:27.920
Do squats.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.679
Do lunges.

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.470
I tell my patients,
when you go to the gym,

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.639
when your motivation
levels are highest, that's

00:47:32.639 --> 00:47:33.680
when you want to do legs.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.200
If you wait till after the
aerobic and the other weights

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.440
to do legs, often people
don't do them properly.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.780
And really keep in mind
that leg power actually

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.220
does help brain health.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.070
So this study was done
on identical twins, where

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:48.950
they actually looked at what
was the strongest lifestyle

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:53.305
predictor of reduced brain
degeneration or loss in memory.

00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:54.680
And they found
that leg power was

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.100
the actual number-one factor.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.560
So believe it or
not, leg strength

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.424
does actually contribute
to brain strength as well.

00:48:01.424 --> 00:48:03.340
These are some apps that
I've used in patients

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.380
to really motivate them
to exercise and use

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.620
their total body, so doing
things like plank and squats.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.480
You can use these apps
to actually track it.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.355
So sometimes, I'll have
my patients come back

00:48:12.355 --> 00:48:13.480
and report back to me.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.230
How many squats are they doing?

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:16.240
What's their plank time?

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.610
So there are some great
tools and devices out there

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.257
to really encourage
full-body workouts.

00:48:21.257 --> 00:48:23.590
And then I tell people, create
your own rickshaw, right?

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:27.089
So one big concept is
this rickshaw puller,

00:48:27.089 --> 00:48:28.630
he's not doing it
because he's trying

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.000
to reverse insulin resistance
or lower inflammation.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.830
He's doing it out
of his livelihood.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.050
And that's the same thing
we have to sometimes do.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.440
Can you create an active
workspace in some way?

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.931
So I wrote more than half my
book on an elliptical machine.

00:48:39.931 --> 00:48:42.430
I would spend two to three hours
on that elliptical machine,

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:43.334
just typing away.

00:48:43.334 --> 00:48:44.750
So I wasn't thinking,
oh, my gosh.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.416
I'm burning fat.

00:48:45.416 --> 00:48:47.208
I was actually doing
work while doing that.

00:48:47.208 --> 00:48:49.707
Now there are some types of
work where I can't be in motion.

00:48:49.707 --> 00:48:51.070
I've got to be seated and still.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.650
But sometimes, you're
going through your emails.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.785
You're going through your
iPad messages, whatever.

00:48:54.785 --> 00:48:56.410
You might be able to
do it on your bike

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.120
or maybe on a walking treadmill.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.820
We've got to make activity
sort of part of our work life,

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.740
otherwise it's very
difficult to stay ahead

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.070
of these chronic
health conditions.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.790
And then in terms
of burning fat,

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.190
keep in mind that just
intensifying exercise

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.750
isn't necessarily the way.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.430
What are we eating
before we exercise?

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.150
So fasting workouts work
really well in many people.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.820
So this particular
study looked at some

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.160
of the genes that were
actually turned on when

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.990
you exercise in a fasted state.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.550
So fasted means
you still hydrate.

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.350
You maybe have
your tea or coffee.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.410
But they found on the right
side that basically those genes,

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.160
PDK 4, HSL, these genes
were actually switched on.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.110
So there was more
fat burning happening

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.360
in people that didn't eat
anything before breakfast

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.190
versus people that had their
healthy pre-workout breakfast.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.810
So keep that in mind.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.839
OK, so now that you're an
expert on these numbers,

00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:48.130
I want to show you my own data.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.630
The reason I'm
passionate about this

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.140
is because despite me following
a lot of the standard health

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.960
guidelines, I actually developed
pre-diabetes and metabolic

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.692
syndrome.

00:49:56.692 --> 00:49:58.650
Now that you guys are
experts on these numbers,

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:00.180
you guys can analyze my numbers.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:03.960
You can see back in 2009, my
triglycerides at that point

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.730
were 314.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.512
My healthy cholesterol was 28.

00:50:08.512 --> 00:50:09.720
Look at my total cholesterol.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.564
It was 154.

00:50:10.564 --> 00:50:12.480
So most people would
look at that and go, wow.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.279
Your total cholesterol is great.

00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:16.320
But now you know that that
really doesn't give us

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.120
much valuable information.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.440
Look at my LDL cholesterol.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.550
That was 85.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.040
That looks really good based
on most of the cutoffs.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.380
But the issue here
was look at my ratio.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.770
The triglyceride to HDL
ratio came in at 11.2.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:30.780
Does anybody remember
what the cutoff is?

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:31.970
It should be less than--

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:32.470
sorry?

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:33.180
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.513
RONESH SINHA: It's actually
less than 3.0 is the cutoff.

00:50:35.513 --> 00:50:37.560
So I was well above that.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.470
And why was my LDL
so normal-looking?

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.970
Because I had those type B.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.290
So I knew about this already.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.000
So I checked my size pattern.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.370
I had type B. When
you have small boats,

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.500
small boats carry
less cholesterol,

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.720
and that can make
your LDL look lower.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.740
So it's really false.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.320
It's kind of like a false
number because it's really

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.350
representing smaller particles.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.720
As I made dietary changes and
I dropped the triglycerides

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.080
over the years, you can see that
my healthy cholesterol went up,

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.030
because those are
intimately related.

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.760
My LDL actually went up but
in a good way because look.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.830
I went from type
B to type A. Now

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.470
I've got the larger boats that
don't cause as much damage.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.890
They carry more cholesterol.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.710
So in a cholesterol
panel, the LDL

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.210
is going to be a
little bit higher.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.292
But look what my ratio
is now, right, 1.9, 1.6.

00:51:21.292 --> 00:51:23.250
So that's where the power
of lifestyle changes.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.380
You can see one of the
critical foods that

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.390
caused my damage
was steel-cut oats

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:28.920
and a banana in the morning.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.555
That comes out to be about
47 grams of net carb.

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:33.180
And I know, based on
my labs, that when

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:37.540
I go above 100 on a sedentary
day, my triglycerides go up.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.640
So switching to an omelet,
or for my vegetarians

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.700
I might do more of
a yogurt-based meal

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:44.730
with nuts and seeds, we
dropped that number down.

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.740
All of these numbers
get reversed,

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.150
all without medications.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.430
That's really our goal.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:54.190
And then for
inflammation, I just

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:55.960
wanted to put this
up and just show you.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.580
Just ignore the other numbers.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.982
But this CRP is a test
marker for inflammation.

00:52:00.982 --> 00:52:02.440
It's not necessary
in all patients,

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.898
but I want to show that this
guy's inflammation levels were

00:52:04.898 --> 00:52:05.930
quite high.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:10.450
And then with lifestyle changes,
he dropped it initially to 3.6.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.510
It was still stuck there.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.480
But then we dropped it to 0.6.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.940
So what was the single change
he made that dropped it

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.050
from 3.6 to 0.6?

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.780
It was meditation.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.260
So I want to make the point that
chronic persistent stress does

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.050
activate the immune system
and cause more inflammation.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.426
So this guy, purely through
meditation and mindfulness,

00:52:28.426 --> 00:52:30.050
was able to actually
lower that number.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.459
So I always remind myself
about this example.

00:52:32.459 --> 00:52:34.000
And really it actually
has encouraged

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.050
me to add more mindfulness
practices as well.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:38.640
So, please, do be aware of that.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.750
And based on stress, I kind
of call this condition chronic

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.540
entrepreneur's syndrome,
where we have a lot of people,

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.210
I see a lot of execs
that are very successful.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.730
They're lab numbers
are completely normal.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.920
They're very fit, but
their stress levels

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.920
are high all the time.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.250
And it feels normal because
they're always hyperactive.

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:56.600
They're sleep
deprived, and they're

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.266
coming in with their
first heart attack,

00:52:58.266 --> 00:52:59.620
despite having normal labs.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.360
And as I've seen more and more
of these patients in my clinic,

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.940
it's motivated me to actually
really take that lifestyle

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.254
balance more seriously.

00:53:06.254 --> 00:53:08.420
Every single person in this
room is an entrepreneur.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.420
If you're thinking about
doing something greater

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.014
than yourself, your
mind is active.

00:53:12.014 --> 00:53:13.430
I'm not saying
that's a bad thing.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.620
But if we're not doing
mindfulness practices

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.690
to break up those
active situations,

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.980
then we might be putting
our health at risk.

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.630
For women, we've talked about
some of the issues in women.

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:25.180
So obviously, the
more common issues

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:28.570
are hormonal compromise,
infertility, PCOS,

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:31.270
resistant weight loss,
mental health disorders,

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:34.330
a lot of autoimmunity, so
Hashimoto's thyroiditis,

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:38.280
which is a root cause for
an underactive thyroid.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.780
Post-menopausal, we talked
about heart attack risk

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.170
approaching males.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.290
I talk about this a lot.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.360
But the key high
level point I want

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.800
to make for women's health
is usually emotional

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.160
obesity is more common
than metabolic obesity.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.690
So many women that
come to see me,

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:54.310
they already have
a personal trainer.

00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:55.851
They're working out
five days a week.

00:53:55.851 --> 00:53:58.140
They've tried every diet
and cleanse under the sun,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.890
but they've refused
to manage their stress

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.151
and improve their sleep.

00:54:01.151 --> 00:54:03.400
Often, they have to do more
yoga instead of boot camps

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.620
and walk more or
spend time in nature

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.230
before they see those
stress hormones normalize.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:10.390
And then that
subcutaneous stubborn

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:12.170
crust fat starts to shed.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:13.630
OK, so keep that in mind.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.460
Often, micronutrient
deficiencies,

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.552
so if you're eating the
same foods all the time,

00:54:17.552 --> 00:54:19.510
and you're not adding
the right micronutrients,

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.620
that can promote more
of the fat storage.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.980
And so, again, key point is
just adding more exercise

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.900
and cutting calories
back may actually

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.499
make that problem worse.

00:54:27.499 --> 00:54:29.290
So self-acceptance is
critical for, really,

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:30.706
emotional and
physical well-being.

00:54:30.706 --> 00:54:33.040
So really try to
incorporate those

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.149
if you've tried everything else.

00:54:35.149 --> 00:54:36.940
I know we're already
at an hour, but I just

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.940
want to make a quick few
other closing points just

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.594
on how we prevent insulin
resistance in our kids,

00:54:42.594 --> 00:54:45.010
because we are seeing this
condition happening in children

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.290
at a very early age.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:51.310
This lifecycle just shows you
how an unhealthy pregnancy--

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.940
when people are
insulin resistant,

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.880
so in some parts of the
Bay Area, in Fremont,

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.620
I talked to a doctor
who said they're

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.840
seeing Indians that have
about a 50% incidence

00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.930
of gestational diabetes.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.290
About half of the Indians
who walk into the clinic

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.900
have diabetes during
pregnancy, which is astounding.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.760
And if someone's
pregnant, you know,

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.760
if they're diabetic during
pregnancy, then what happens

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.250
is less carbs and
nutrition reaches the baby.

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.900
And often, they
can be underweight.

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.270
And those babies get overfed,
and that can actually

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:18.380
propagate the cycle
of insulin resistance.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.110
So this whole cycle
is what we want

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.420
to interrupt as much as we can.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:25.090
The cholesterol
problems that we talked

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:27.980
about, as a result of
this, the triglycerides,

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.920
the healthy cholesterol,
we're seeing kids

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.680
are developing these
issues very commonly.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.180
So if you've got a family
history of high cholesterol,

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.257
often the kids need to
be screened as well.

00:55:37.257 --> 00:55:39.090
And then these are
really the common things.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:40.862
We're seeing kids
that are overworked.

00:55:40.862 --> 00:55:41.820
They're undernourished.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.204
They're overstimulated
from digital toxicity.

00:55:44.204 --> 00:55:45.870
And they're sleep
deprived as well, too.

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.570
So my wife and I are now going
out to schools and companies

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:51.030
to really talk about how we
can restore more optimal health

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.920
in young kids, because
they are suffering

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.290
from a lot of these things.

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:56.784
I talk about redefining
our child's card.

00:55:56.784 --> 00:55:58.950
Maybe they're getting
straight A's here on the left.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.950
But on the right, many
of our kids are failing--

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:03.145
physical activity,
time out in nature.

00:56:03.145 --> 00:56:04.020
What are they eating?

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.150
Fitness, activity, mindfulness,
all of these things

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.119
are core parts of this.

00:56:08.119 --> 00:56:10.410
And then finally, just keep
in mind that those thoughts

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:12.840
and emotions, there's a
whole field now called

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.620
behavioral epigenetics.

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.519
So when we are actually
experiencing chronic stress,

00:56:17.519 --> 00:56:19.560
we can flip on the genes
for these chronic health

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:20.620
conditions in kids.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.070
So we want to make sure we
are managing those emotions

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:26.310
as well as we possibly can.

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:29.330
OK, so my resources, if you
want to reach out to me,

00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:31.490
you can always reach out
to me through my blog.

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:33.710
I've got some online
programs and ebooks.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.560
Actually, my publisher agreed to
release the children's chapter

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.352
for my book.

00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.560
So if you actually put your
email address in my blog,

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.930
you will get the whole
children's chapter for free.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:44.570
I've also put a book on
Recharge to help people

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:46.730
with chronic fatigue
and energy issues.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.560
And if anybody ever
has questions outside

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.840
of this session, you can always
email me through the blog.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.839
I answer every single
question that comes to me.

00:56:52.839 --> 00:56:54.500
So that was a lot
of information.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.810
But we're done right at 1:04,
and we'll have some time

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:57.852
to open up for questions.

00:56:57.852 --> 00:56:59.351
And if there are
kid questions, I'll

00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:01.740
ask my wife to come up here
and assist me as well, too.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.760
So great.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.640
Yes?

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.695
AUDIENCE: Over here, with
your recommendations,

00:57:07.695 --> 00:57:10.305
I've been able to implement this
thanks to the food at Google,

00:57:10.305 --> 00:57:12.920
plus what you can get at
Whole Foods, Trader Joe's.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:13.550
I go home.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.280
I tried to implement
this with my mother

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.120
and completely shocked her.

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.930
We come from a
rice-growing family.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.370
Breakfast, lunch, and
dinner is rice-based.

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:28.700
And cauliflower rice and
almond flour based things just

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.050
do not exist in the market.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:32.540
And you don't eat raw vegetables
because of the pesticide

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:33.720
problem.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.644
So how do you address in a
country like India [INAUDIBLE]??

00:57:36.644 --> 00:57:39.060
RONESH SINHA: It's a very tough
crisis right now in India.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.600
And in India, the problem
is a lot of Western foods

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.532
have come into the
diet as well, too.

00:57:43.532 --> 00:57:45.740
But all you can do when you
go back to India or China

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.840
or Asian countries is
how can you still--

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.180
even if you can't
find cauliflower rice,

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.410
how can you modify that
rice in a different way?

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:55.027
So what I tell people is if
you just have plain white rice,

00:57:55.027 --> 00:57:57.110
that's going to cause a
glucose and insulin spike.

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:59.318
If you were to graph it out,
it would look like this.

00:57:59.318 --> 00:58:01.490
But you can do a few
things to actually lower

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:03.500
that curve on the glucose
and insulin spike.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.390
What do you do?

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.070
Any time you eat vegetables
before carbohydrates,

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:09.350
you lower that
reaction by 30% to 40%.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.060
So cut up those
cucumbers, tomatoes,

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.390
and have some sort of vegetables
before you eat the starch.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.000
The second thing is what are
you mixing in with the starch?

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.291
I tell people even if they
don't have cauliflower rice,

00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:21.410
maybe reduce the rice
amount by a little bit.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.271
Mix vegetables into it if your
diet allows it, eggs, nuts,

00:58:24.271 --> 00:58:24.770
and seeds.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.920
So Indian-style biryana
or Asian-style fried rice

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.900
is much better because when
you add fats, proteins,

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.720
and vegetables to
a starch, you're

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.730
going to lower that
glucose response.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.560
And then after that
meal, if you inevitably

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.280
end up eating a meal like
that, even a 10 to 15 minute

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.140
walk after that meal
is going to lower that.

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.030
So it's all about
damage control when

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:45.530
you go to India
because you're being

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.230
flooded from all directions
with all types of carbs.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:49.730
What are some of
the things that you

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:51.284
can do to kind of dampen that?

00:58:51.284 --> 00:58:52.200
And then you're right.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.440
We do have more options here.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.640
You know, India and
Asia are not up to speed

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.040
on all the different nutritional
options that we have.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.260
But clearly, we've had
people benefit very well

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.025
in other countries
because it's more

00:59:02.025 --> 00:59:04.400
eating the traditional foods
the way our grandparents did

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.244
and incorporating
activity into that.

00:59:06.244 --> 00:59:08.160
We can already see a lot
of benefit from that.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.059
So, yeah, we do our
best, whatever we can.

00:59:10.059 --> 00:59:12.350
But there are a lot of elements
of the Indian diet that

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:13.058
are very healthy.

00:59:13.058 --> 00:59:15.530
You know, the spices, the
way we cook the vegetables,

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:17.501
the proteins and healthy
fats are all things.

00:59:17.501 --> 00:59:20.000
And I think exercise is starting
to become a little bit more

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.970
fashionable in India.

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:22.552
So I think doing
it the right way,

00:59:22.552 --> 00:59:24.260
focusing on weight
training, these things

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.989
can help dampen the effects
of the high-carb diet.

00:59:26.989 --> 00:59:28.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks for that, Doc.

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:28.780
RONESH SINHA: Sure, thank you.

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.000
AUDIENCE: My wife has read
your book page to page,

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.260
and she has made my life hell.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:32.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:36.915
RONESH SINHA: OK,
I apologize, sir.

00:59:36.915 --> 00:59:38.790
AUDIENCE: A couple of
questions and comments,

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:42.530
so the first thing goes
back to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:44.420
the guy was working out.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.575
Was it probably the stress
that caused his issues

00:59:47.575 --> 00:59:49.040
with the heart attack?

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.670
And then you mentioned
CRP for inflammation.

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:57.367
Is there a common test
that you can recommend

00:59:57.367 --> 00:59:59.600
as part of a blood panel?

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.180
What exactly should we
be asking our doctors?

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.680
RONESH SINHA: So
let me address CRP.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.971
Then I'll talk about the guy
that had the heart attack.

01:00:05.971 --> 01:00:10.310
So the C-reactive protein is a
very easily measured test that

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.050
can be done on any blood panel.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:14.630
But my disclaimer is C-reactive
protein, so there's one

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:17.690
called the HS, Highly
Sensitive C-reactive protein.

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:20.120
That's more of a marker for
the blood vessel inflammation.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.380
So I find that more useful.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.690
The general CRP can
be elevated if you've

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.437
got just general inflammation
from an infection,

01:00:26.437 --> 01:00:28.020
or if you injured
yourself, et cetera.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.130
It's very nonspecific.

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:30.755
A lot of doctors
don't like ordering it

01:00:30.755 --> 01:00:33.470
because sometimes it's elevated,
and we really don't know why.

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.540
But that HSC reactive
protein, especially

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.980
in somebody that's got a lot
of cholesterol risk factors,

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.590
et cetera, it can be useful.

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.480
And the way
traditional doctors use

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.300
it is because if that's elevated
and your cholesterol is high,

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.370
they have a lower
threshold for prescribing

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.470
a statin or a
cholesterol medication.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:51.350
In my practice, I have
a much lower threshold.

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:53.690
Well, I'm much more aggressive
about promoting lifestyle

01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:55.981
changes that lower inflammation
because often when they

01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:58.490
lower their visceral fat,
they manage their stress.

01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:59.750
That test does come down.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.610
So I will tell you
that some doctors might

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.310
be resistant to checking it
because if you don't have risk

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.518
factors, they'll be like, OK.

01:01:05.518 --> 01:01:06.650
This is a nonspecific test.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:08.784
But it is a pretty easily
accessible test to do.

01:01:08.784 --> 01:01:10.700
AUDIENCE: Because I had
done C-reactive tests.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.440
And my doctor looked
at it, and she

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.464
was skeptical about
what those numbers mean.

01:01:14.464 --> 01:01:16.880
RONESH SINHA: Yeah, it's not
part of the standard approach

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.490
right now.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:19.574
So I think that's why
there's skepticism about it.

01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:21.073
And the other thing
I would tell you

01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:23.030
is if your test comes
back completely normal,

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.890
that doesn't mean that you
don't have inflammation.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:25.490
It's not that.

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.790
Some people can have completely
normal C-reactive protein,

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.350
but they still have
other root causes

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.680
of inflammation in their body.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.680
And unfortunately, we
don't have a perfect test.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.263
But, for example,
if people are having

01:01:35.263 --> 01:01:37.400
a lot of digestive
system symptoms,

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.299
like bloating,
excessive acidity,

01:01:39.299 --> 01:01:41.090
that's a sign that
their gut health is off.

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.130
They have inflammation
from that root cause.

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.630
If they have
eczema, skin issues,

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:47.000
so even without the C-reactive
protein, I tell people,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.083
be a little bit more
intuitive about other sources

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:50.264
of inflammation in the body.

01:01:50.264 --> 01:01:51.680
Now coming back
to your question--

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.054
and it's an important one--
about that heart attack case,

01:01:54.054 --> 01:01:58.070
that particular case, so I
see all combinations of this.

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.420
But I am seeing
quite a few folks

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.680
that are developing heart
disease from overexercising

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.290
and chronic stress together,
even though those lab

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.400
results were fairly normal.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.490
So one thing is if you
are at high risk for heart

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.040
disease, what I would say is
make sure you see your doctor.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.695
And in some cases, if you've
got enough risk factors,

01:02:15.695 --> 01:02:18.320
it's recommended to get a stress
test or some sort of screening

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.230
done before you implement
intensive exercise.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.329
I've had a few tragic cases of
heart attacks on treadmills.

01:02:24.329 --> 01:02:26.870
I had somebody walk outside of
a fitness center and drop dead

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:27.890
in the parking lot.

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:30.230
And in many of these cases,
what happens is these guys

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:32.462
were carrying around very
large, unstable plaques.

01:02:32.462 --> 01:02:34.670
And now they're in a class
where their heart rate has

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.920
been taken up to 180 or 190.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.750
And in that context,
the exercise actually

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.440
pushed them over the edge.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.804
So with exercise, I tell people
be very gradual in ramping up.

01:02:43.804 --> 01:02:46.220
And if you've got a family
history and other risk factors,

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.350
talk to your doctor about
whether any baseline

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.390
assessments need to be done.

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:51.040
OK, yeah.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.860
AUDIENCE: My last comment,
going back to the doctors,

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.710
I'm surprised.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:00.170
So I became aware of this book,
I think, I would say a year

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.495
or two ago.

01:03:01.495 --> 01:03:02.930
It is interesting
to see that most

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.680
of the doctors in the
Valley are still not

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.990
aware of this kind of thing.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.840
So I think part
of your education

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.960
should be also tailored
towards other institutions.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.696
RONESH SINHA: Yeah,
and it's not just--

01:03:13.696 --> 01:03:15.100
it's global right now.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.440
This approach is more the
exception than the rule.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.190
And I'll tell you.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.273
One big problem-- because
I know all my colleagues

01:03:20.273 --> 01:03:22.100
mean well who are doing this.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.950
In today's health care system,
doctors get 10, 15 minutes

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:25.907
to see a patient.

01:03:25.907 --> 01:03:27.740
And I just gave you a
very detailed lecture.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.114
I do one-hour consultations.

01:03:29.114 --> 01:03:30.530
But the traditional
medical system

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:32.630
is designed for
10 or 15 minutes.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:34.550
It's much easier to
prescribe medications.

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:37.320
Most doctors have been trained
about medications and not

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.570
necessarily lifestyle changes.

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.245
That's starting to flip a
little bit because now there

01:03:40.245 --> 01:03:42.286
are fields like functional
medicine, where people

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:43.560
are learning more about this.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.226
But the main message
here is your doctor

01:03:45.226 --> 01:03:47.360
is sort of maybe a guide
to help you with issues

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.650
and order the tests.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.640
But your lifestyle
is in your hands.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.210
You're the one that has
to find the right content.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:54.809
Sometimes, my
patients, you know,

01:03:54.809 --> 01:03:57.350
they've got to assemble a team--
a personal trainer, somebody

01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.870
to help them with yoga, maybe
seeing a dietitian that's

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:00.779
aligned with them.

01:04:00.779 --> 01:04:02.570
And then their doctors
order the lab tests,

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:04.790
or they might consult with me
or a different practitioner that

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:06.090
sort of is aligned with that.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:06.590
But I agree.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:07.670
This is a systemic problem.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:09.270
It's not going to go
away anytime soon.

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:11.750
So it's sort of up to us to take
advantage of the information

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:12.250
out there.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:15.064
So thank you.

01:04:15.064 --> 01:04:15.710
Yeah, hi.

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:16.793
AUDIENCE: Good to see you.

01:04:16.793 --> 01:04:18.120
RONESH SINHA: Good to see you.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.830
AUDIENCE: I have
an 11-year-old who

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:22.920
sees the changes we have
made in how we eat and so on

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.860
but loves eating and
told me a few days ago,

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.120
I wish there was no such
thing as overeating.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.590
I wish there was no such
thing as bad sugar, et cetera.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.410
And he's a little bit on the
heavier side, does swimming

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:36.760
three times a week, and so on.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.150
I'm not sure how to help him.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:40.860
First, we don't
have any baseline

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.360
on his different cholesterol
levels and so on.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.390
It's not part of what
the doctor checks.

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:50.760
At the same time, it seems
pretty harsh to have anything

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.680
like this be something you
would propose to an 11-year-old.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.770
So I haven't got the
update from your book.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:02.767
Does it help with guiding
kids through this?

01:05:02.767 --> 01:05:05.225
RONESH SINHA: Shally, I'm going
to defer to you because you

01:05:05.225 --> 01:05:05.420
know how to deal with this.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.490
SHALLY SINHA: Yeah, I can talk
first about the parameters

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:09.560
that pediatricians use--

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.110
RONESH SINHA: You
can come up here now.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:12.330
SHALLY SINHA: --to check
lipid panels in kids.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.070
So every time you
go in for a checkup,

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.486
you might be
noticing that they're

01:05:15.486 --> 01:05:18.390
plotting your child's weight,
height on growth curves.

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:20.610
And then you're seeing
a third curve called

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.770
the BMI, which is
on percentiles,

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:24.780
not a cutoff like in adults.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:27.630
So what's normal depends
on the age and gender.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:31.020
Right now, the guideline
is that if your child is

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.650
85th percentile or higher, and
you have family history of, you

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.970
know, obesity, strokes,
hypercholesterolemia,

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:42.290
those kids will get a
fasting lipid panel done.

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:44.670
However, now there is also
a general recommendation

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.220
that, regardless of
family history and weight,

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.780
children between 9 to 13 should
probably get a baseline lipid

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.990
panel done.

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:55.320
So I think with
pediatricians, they

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.900
know parental
anxieties are real,

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.230
and if you just ask your doctor
to please order one, just

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.410
as a baseline so you know
what you're working with,

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:07.440
how seriously you need to
take your child's weight.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.210
And maybe your child's
weight is normal,

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.820
and he just looks a
little over to you.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.100
But that's why it's important
to plot the curves first

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.630
to see where you are.

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:17.190
And then I think
that what you said

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.950
first is that in your
household, you yourself

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:21.822
have implemented
those changes already.

01:06:21.822 --> 01:06:23.280
And that's the
biggest single thing

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.826
you can do to influence
your child's habits.

01:06:26.826 --> 01:06:28.200
So I always tell
parents that you

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.930
can't have a double standard
where you're doing one thing,

01:06:30.930 --> 01:06:33.970
and you're lecturing
your child to do this.

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:36.120
So I think just by example.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.690
Now I know it's tough with kids
because they'll go to school.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:42.444
Their peers are bringing,
like, really unhealthy lunches.

01:06:42.444 --> 01:06:43.860
They're going to
birthday parties.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.040
They're getting fed lots
of unhealthy treats.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.170
But I feel that on a
day-to-day basis, what

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.090
they're getting at
home, that's actually

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.890
building the foundation.

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:54.900
So I think that's
the single most thing

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.067
I would do for my own child.

01:06:56.067 --> 01:06:58.066
RONESH SINHA: And we're
not recommending, like--

01:06:58.066 --> 01:06:59.610
I know I talked
about grams of carbs.

01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:02.460
But we're not recommending
that for kids that are growing.

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.710
SHALLY SINHA: No, because
they're still growing, yeah.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:07.320
Yeah, so with kids, it's more
like that pictorial plate.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.730
You might have seen that.

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:11.490
So just teaching your child,
like Ron had a slide up there,

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:14.820
to fill most of it with
a source of vegetables,

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.980
so starting with a
salad or vegetable soup,

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.020
and then one quarter
of it the carb,

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.040
and then one quarter
of it the protein.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.500
And if they want
to take seconds,

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.990
then it should be in that
same ratio, so not just

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:27.826
taking seconds of the carbs once
they're done with the plate.

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:30.450
RONESH SINHA: And you're really
training their taste buds, too,

01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:31.950
for later because
many of the kids

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.690
are averse to eating
any vegetables.

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:35.460
So you often say to
just even give them

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.150
one piece or two pieces
of broccoli or something.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:39.483
SHALLY SINHA: Yeah, I get a
lot of concerns from parents

01:07:39.483 --> 01:07:41.940
that, oh, my child will
just not touch a vegetable.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.640
So I tell parents to just
start with, like, one broccoli

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:48.150
stalk or one baby carrot, and
then just go up from there.

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:49.980
So every day, just
add that to the plate,

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.580
and it's an acquired taste.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.700
And then also
growing vegetables,

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.020
I think you had mentioned
concern about pesticides.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.780
So I don't know if
your relatives in India

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.940
could grow their own
vegetables in the backyard.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.650
And with kids,
actually that motivates

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:05.780
them to try to eat the
vegetables as well,

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.080
so it's, like, a win-win.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.170
RONESH SINHA: Yes?

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:12.300
AUDIENCE: A question
about high blood pressure,

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.360
you didn't talk today.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.020
But I see a lot of my
South-Asian friends and family.

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:21.990
Even in 20s, the high blood
pressure is very much common.

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:24.750
So my question is, are
South Asians genetically

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.460
prone to high blood pressure?

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.750
And the second question
is can lifestyle

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.859
reverse somebody who is
on medication for decades?

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:38.160
Can lifestyle change help them
to go off and get the numbers

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:38.970
back?

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.219
RONESH SINHA: Good question,
yes, so blood pressure, I

01:08:41.219 --> 01:08:43.830
kind of put it on the list, but
I didn't focus on it directly.

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:45.359
What I would say
is blood pressure

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.939
does have a stronger tie to
genetics than the other issues

01:08:47.939 --> 01:08:49.080
that we talked about.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.250
But with blood
pressure, first of all,

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.124
it is tied to insulin
resistance because when

01:08:52.124 --> 01:08:54.840
your body has excess
insulin, your blood vessels

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.950
retain more fluid.

01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:57.236
And they become stiffer.

01:08:57.236 --> 01:08:59.069
So often when we reverse
insulin resistance,

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.390
blood pressure can drop down.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:01.890
The other issue
with blood pressure,

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:03.723
though, is a lot of it
has to do with stress

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.170
and sleep as well, too.

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:06.910
So if stress and
sleep aren't managed,

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.680
then often blood
pressure will stay high.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.340
And unfortunately, we live in
high-stress Silicon Valley.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.840
Many people, unless
they incorporate

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.109
those mindfulness
slower practices,

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:16.680
it will not get better.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.689
And then nutrient-wise,
too, paying attention

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:20.424
to the sodium-potassium
balance, so

01:09:20.424 --> 01:09:22.500
as we lower the amount
of processed foods, which

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.710
have more sodium, and we
eat more plant-based foods,

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:27.390
lower sodium and
higher potassium

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:29.238
naturally will lower
blood pressure.

01:09:29.238 --> 01:09:31.529
So there are definitely some
ways you can address that.

01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:33.569
But even having said that,
I have some elite athletes

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.260
in my practice.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.926
And they're on blood
pressure medication

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:37.529
because both parents had it.

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:39.600
They just genetically have
stiffer blood vessels.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.060
So I think there is a
potential for normalization.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.680
But in some cases, the genes
can play a strong role there.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.596
But, you know, definitely
the sleep and stress

01:09:46.596 --> 01:09:47.779
are major factors.

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:49.410
Yeah, thanks for
bringing that up.

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:52.410
AUDIENCE: So I have a few things
in common with what you said,

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:56.520
in terms of being
brought up in Calcutta

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.410
and also having twin boys.

01:09:58.410 --> 01:09:59.962
RONESH SINHA: All right.

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:04.120
AUDIENCE: My question
is this whole approach

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.960
to medicine seems to be very
cognitive and mechanistic

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.030
in the sense--

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.560
you know, I use the
word mechanistic just

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.250
to point out that
it's numbers based.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.710
And it's almost like
you have to have

01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:20.470
this app watching
you and advising you

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.330
through every
moment of your life,

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:25.930
versus a very intuitive
way of choosing your diet.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.320
Your body is speaking
to yourself, your mind.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.100
And that's how I
saw my grandparents

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.550
picking what they want to eat.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:36.100
So is that even feasible
in this day and age,

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.290
to allow your body
to speak to you

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:41.260
and point you to the right
choices, versus doing it

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.762
in a very numbers-driven,
cognitive way?

01:10:43.762 --> 01:10:45.970
RONESH SINHA: Great point,
you know, most of my talks

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:47.230
have a slide of my--

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:49.690
I literally have a slide of
my grandmother and then me

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:51.540
with all these wearables
attached to it.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.290
And I make the point
that our grandparents

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.802
have this sense of intuition.

01:10:54.802 --> 01:10:57.010
What I would say is the goal
was to get to that point

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.000
you're talking about.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.590
Right now, the
signal-to-noise ratio

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:01.840
is crazy, because of our
stress and sleep deprivation,

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.423
how much sugar and
stuff we're eating.

01:11:03.423 --> 01:11:05.950
So people don't even know what
it feels like to be healthy.

01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:08.230
So often, I drive
them with the metrics,

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.480
so then they have
something to hang onto.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.470
And that empowers them.

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:13.442
But as you can, I
haven't worn a Fitbit now

01:11:13.442 --> 01:11:15.400
for probably three months
because I intuitively

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.917
know when I'm being sedentary
and when I'm being more active.

01:11:18.917 --> 01:11:21.250
But at some point, yeah, you
listen your body's signals,

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.480
and you don't
become programmatic.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.604
And I've got to say that
Shally can attest to this.

01:11:24.604 --> 01:11:26.710
I can be very protocol-driven
with my workouts.

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.126
And she's like,
you know, you just

01:11:28.126 --> 01:11:29.650
need to chill out
and relax today.

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:31.460
So she knows better
than me sometimes

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.280
that there are days where I've
got to sort of do something

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.196
that's more intuitive
and based on my feelings

01:11:35.196 --> 01:11:36.850
and not based on
my schedule of I've

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.730
got to do boot camp
every Monday, Tuesday.

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:40.670
But I think it's
absolutely possible.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.340
And when I see patients
[INAUDIBLE] at a certain point,

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.860
I'm like, you know, just listen
to your body at this point.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.390
You've got some rough markers.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:47.540
How's your waistline doing?

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.190
How's your weight,
you know, et cetera?

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:51.440
But I think the goal is to
get back to that intuition.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.773
So I'm glad you brought that up.

01:11:52.773 --> 01:11:53.932
Thanks for that, yeah.

01:11:53.932 --> 01:11:55.390
So I'll go online
to this question.

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:57.580
"How do I find a primary
care physician who is aware

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.038
of the more stringent cutoffs
for measuring health of South

01:12:00.038 --> 01:12:02.860
Asians and/or work
with one who isn't?"

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.380
So luckily, these cutoffs now
have a lot of data behind it.

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:08.830
The World Health Organization
and other entities

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:09.850
have set these cutoffs.

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:11.810
So many doctors just
don't know about this.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:13.300
But this isn't off the cuff.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.234
So I think you can still
educate your doctor.

01:12:15.234 --> 01:12:17.650
Many of our patients have gone
and educated their doctors.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:19.810
Within our group, we're
pretty well versed in this.

01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.550
But if your doctor is
not aware of this--

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:22.540
you know, the main
thing you want

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.460
with a doctor is you want
a doctor to be open-minded.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.840
So even if they're
knowledgeable,

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.298
if they're willing
to learn and use

01:12:27.298 --> 01:12:29.170
some of these
cutoffs and things,

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:31.690
then I think that's
perfectly fine to do.

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.150
Next question,
"can you talk a bit

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:36.010
about why vegans
and vegetarians have

01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:39.260
much lower rates of diabetes
in population studies?"

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.420
Got a link there.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.490
A recent randomized study
showed a low-fat vegan

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:43.750
diet with no calorie
restriction was

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.310
more effective at
reversing type 2

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:48.867
diabetes than a controlled
diet with calorie control.

01:12:48.867 --> 01:12:50.950
Great question, so the
main thing I'm going to say

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:54.220
is, again, it depends on what
sort of vegetarian or vegan

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.340
diet is being consumed.

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.144
So I know I said a
lot of negative things

01:12:57.144 --> 01:12:58.810
about a vegetarian
diet, but I'm talking

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:02.200
about the typical Asian or
Indian-based vegetarian diet.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.960
If somebody is eating the really
plant-based type of vegetarian,

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.390
so if you look at a typical
Western vegan or vegetarian

01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:10.240
diet, usually that's
much more plant-based.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.610
Western vegetarians tend to
do more physical activity,

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.464
exercise, and the
other entities.

01:13:14.464 --> 01:13:15.880
So when you look
at those studies,

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.870
you're definitely going to
see a lower rate of diabetes.

01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:20.170
So I'm definitely not
anti-vegan or vegetarian.

01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:21.760
But people just have to analyze.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.704
Are they eating the
healthy version of that?

01:13:23.704 --> 01:13:25.120
The other thing
is when people are

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.730
eating a lot of the extra carbs
in the typical Asian diet,

01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:29.500
they're missing out
on micronutrients.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.300
And those micronutrient
deficiencies,

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.760
like vitamin D and
magnesium, et cetera,

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.712
those can also raise
the risk of disease.

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:37.420
But there are a lot
of studies out there.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:39.070
Now I tell people
a general point.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:40.480
You are your own study.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.270
You can find studies that
are pro-vegan, vegetarian,

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:45.880
anti-vegan, vegetarian,
but know the basics.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.000
Make the changes, and then
follow your numbers before,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.030
mid-term, and after to see
what the response is with you.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:54.679
And then go from there.

01:13:54.679 --> 01:13:56.720
AUDIENCE: I know you talked
about micronutrients.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.710
Can you elaborate a
little more about what

01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.220
is the spectrum
of micronutrients

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.330
we should focus on?

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:03.960
RONESH SINHA: Right,
so what I would say--

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.168
and you can fill in some
for maybe kids as well, too.

01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:08.990
But for adults, vitamin D
I've been talking about a lot.

01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:11.210
So vitamin D is a critical
one, so definitely that's

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:12.835
something we want to
assess, especially

01:14:12.835 --> 01:14:14.330
if we have an indoor lifestyle.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:16.617
Us that have skin
tones that are darker,

01:14:16.617 --> 01:14:18.200
we tend to be more
vitamin D deficient

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.320
because we're not getting
as much of the UVB rays.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.270
Iron deficiency is
something that I

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:24.490
guess you'd see more in kids.

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:26.240
But in adults, depending
on their risk factors,

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.580
that can be a factor, especially
with the vegetarian diet.

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:29.270
SHALLY SINHA: Women also.

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:31.320
RONESH SINHA: Women in
particular, too, obviously,

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:31.625
absolutely.

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:32.620
SHALLY SINHA: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.911
RONESH SINHA: Right, so that's
the other micronutrient.

01:14:34.911 --> 01:14:36.090
Now magnesium is tricky.

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:37.850
You know, magnesium is linked
to a lot of the conditions

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:38.724
that we talked about.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:41.714
But a standard blood magnesium
test won't give you that data.

01:14:41.714 --> 01:14:43.880
I tell people that if we're
having these, most of us

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.280
are magnesium-depleted,
just because of our soil.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.780
So I think making
sure you're eating

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.850
magnesium-rich foods is key.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.620
For vegetarians and
vegans and even some

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.260
of our non-vegetarians, we do
see B vitamin deficiencies,

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.450
too, so B12 and folate.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.430
It is worthwhile
to check for those

01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:01.170
and making sure you get
adequate sources of that.

01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:02.904
So those are at
the high level some

01:15:02.904 --> 01:15:04.070
of the major micronutrients.

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:05.030
Am I missing some,
maybe in the kids?

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:07.238
SHALLY SINHA: Yeah, I mean,
just to take a step back,

01:15:07.238 --> 01:15:08.930
so when we say
micronutrients, we're

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:10.670
referring to vitamins
and minerals.

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:13.430
And these are crucial in
all the enzymatic processes

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:14.510
in your body.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.990
So macronutrients are just
proteins, carbs, and fats.

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:20.960
So then to fill in on how
those are metabolized,

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.530
that's where your vitamins
and minerals come into play.

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:29.570
So aside from the examples Ron
gave, particularly in kids,

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:32.270
I would definitely emphasize
calcium and zinc as well,

01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:34.280
and iron for sure.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.290
And, you know, for
example, with iron,

01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:38.420
they've even shown that
iron-deficient kids

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.110
can perform poorly on
math and language tests.

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:42.860
So it even affects
their brain development

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.590
if they're low in any of these
micronutrients, so very key.

01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:49.700
And then just in general,
with even adults,

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:53.390
if you're low in micronutrients
like iodine and selenium,

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:55.070
it can affect your
thyroid function.

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:58.190
And it may not show up on
your thyroid hormone tests,

01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:00.020
but you may be
experiencing symptoms

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.794
of low thyroid function.

01:16:01.794 --> 01:16:03.710
So these are where those
micronutrients really

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:05.874
play a big role.

01:16:05.874 --> 01:16:06.540
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.915
Just a quick,
follow-up question,

01:16:07.915 --> 01:16:11.480
especially for the kids, if
we feel like through the diet

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.360
they're not getting a
full spectrum of these,

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.101
do you suggest just giving
them over-the-counter vitamin

01:16:19.101 --> 01:16:19.600
supplements?

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.880
SHALLY SINHA: Yeah, I
get that question a lot.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.940
The problem is that
they're just not absorbed

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.800
as well from a multi-vitamin.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.080
And a lot of times, it's
because it's complementary.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.997
So for example, taking iron with
something high in vitamin C,

01:16:30.997 --> 01:16:33.080
you'll absorb a lot more
of it than if you take it

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.280
with something that's
really high in calcium.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.190
So it's like synergistic.

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:39.021
And also the vitamins
are just maybe not

01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:41.270
going to provide all that
the child needs because they

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:44.360
do have growing bodies.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.070
And I think just
setting the good habits

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:48.470
early on on eating a
well-rounded diet, not just

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:51.634
kind of teaching them to take a
pill, that just will go-- yeah.

01:16:51.634 --> 01:16:53.300
RONESH SINHA: Yeah,
and one other point,

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.674
too, with the
vitamin absorption,

01:16:54.674 --> 01:16:57.650
so the fat-soluble vitamins
like A, D, E, and K,

01:16:57.650 --> 01:16:59.010
those are fat-soluble vitamins.

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:01.730
So when you're eating vegetables
with some healthy fat in it,

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:03.510
it does increase the
absorption of that.

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:04.820
So that's the whole
point about making

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.810
sure we've got the proper
nutrients around them.

01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:08.520
AUDIENCE: Can I just piggy
back off that question?

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:08.720
RONESH SINHA: Sure.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.386
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:17:09.386 --> 01:17:11.210
So how about
probiotics to improve

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:17.030
the brain-gut connection and all
of that, for kids, especially?

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:20.400
RONESH SINHA: For kids, yes, so
basically for adults and kids,

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.340
we're all fans of
gut-healthy diets.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.230
And we try to introduce
it through foods

01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:25.100
as much as we can.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.860
But some people, at
least in the adults,

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:30.680
they might need probiotics for
optimal gap sort of coverage

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.020
of those needs that they have.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.880
We always say that probiotics
are sort of a temporary place

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.710
holder strategy.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:38.990
While you're sort of eating
more gut-friendly foods,

01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:40.000
probiotics can help.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.026
But some people do find
that long-term-wise, they're

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:44.150
thriving on the probiotics.

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:46.250
And there's no reason why
they can't continue that.

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.080
SHALLY SINHA: I think in
kids, I don't normally

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.913
put them on probiotics
unless they just got,

01:17:49.913 --> 01:17:53.700
like, an antibiotic course for
an ear infection or something.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.550
But otherwise, I
normally recommend lots

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:57.824
of yogurt daily in the diet.

01:17:57.824 --> 01:17:59.240
And then in the
Indian diet, like,

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.190
any of the pickles,
that's also loaded

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:04.332
with probiotics, so just getting
it naturally from the diet.

01:18:04.332 --> 01:18:06.290
AUDIENCE: Like, for
attention deficit or things

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.390
of that nature that
are behavioral,

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.546
do you see a difference in
choosing that kind of diet

01:18:11.546 --> 01:18:12.920
and a correction
in the symptoms?

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.140
SHALLY SINHA: Definitely,
with my ADHD patients,

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.880
even lowering the sugar
content in their daily diet

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.370
sometimes makes a
huge difference.

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:22.310
I've had parents
of autistic kids

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:24.230
take out all the
preservatives in their diet.

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:25.850
That's made improvements.

01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:28.760
So I think the diet connection
with kids' brain development

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.870
is so key.

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.790
So definitely what
they eat definitely

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.070
manifests in the way
they behave and the way

01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:36.440
their cognitive
functions occur, yeah.

01:18:38.751 --> 01:18:40.500
RONESH SINHA: I'll go
online for this one.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.125
"Can you talk a little bit about
good carbs versus bad carbs?

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:45.000
We know from dozens of
interventional studies

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.291
that whole grains and legumes
are associated with lower

01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:48.667
risk of chronic disease.

01:18:48.667 --> 01:18:49.500
But these are carbs.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.260
Many people are afraid
nowadays of all carbs."

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.070
OK, so this is a
really important point,

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:56.640
because I did put carbs
at the center of this.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.365
But there clearly are healthy
carbohydrates out there,

01:18:59.365 --> 01:19:01.740
like lentils and beans, that
are part of our staple diet.

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.810
But what I was talking
about is especially

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:05.640
if you have an
insulin-resistant condition

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.870
and that parking lot is
closed or you're not active,

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.517
these even healthy carbs in
abundance are causing issues.

01:19:11.517 --> 01:19:13.350
Most of the patients
that I see in my clinic

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:15.420
are not drinking Coke
or eating pizzas.

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.394
They're having grains.

01:19:16.394 --> 01:19:17.310
They're having quinoa.

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:18.540
They're having lentils.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.070
And we're still seeing a lot
of these conditions happen.

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:22.980
The good news is once they
implement the right lifestyle

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.860
strategies-- they're
physically active--

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:27.068
then absolutely you can
reintroduce some whole grains

01:19:27.068 --> 01:19:28.620
and lentils and
see how people do.

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.979
It all comes down to that
individual experimentation.

01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:32.520
But I don't want
people to be afraid.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.430
And quite frankly, legumes
are very gut-friendly foods.

01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:38.332
Our gut loves that sort
of prebiotic fiber that

01:19:38.332 --> 01:19:40.290
sort of reaches them,
the healthy gut bacteria.

01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:42.660
So I don't want people to
become phobic about this.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.114
But just be aware that
quantity can make a difference.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.280
And if you have a condition
like insulin resistance,

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.321
we've really got to be
careful about the amounts.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.650
So for this protein source,
just a simple answer,

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:57.920
I put a couple of
options on that list.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.610
And then I would refer people
to my blog on the protein link.

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.040
Yeah, so if your diet
allows dairy, for example,

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.970
so even good quality
paneer is fine.

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.690
Obviously, yogurts for the
probiotic source are OK.

01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:13.770
Some quantities of cheese is OK.

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:14.832
Quinoa is fine, too.

01:20:14.832 --> 01:20:17.040
I mean, quinoa, I know, can
be high on the carb side.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.650
But it's a great
source of protein.

01:20:18.650 --> 01:20:21.100
Nuts, seeds, nut
and seed butters,

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.640
obviously, are good sources.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.010
If vegetarian diet allows
some egg consumption,

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:27.412
then we're big fans of having
eggs in there as well, too.

01:20:27.412 --> 01:20:28.870
So at a high level,
those are some.

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:31.430
And like I said, lentils
are a good protein source.

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:33.240
Yeah, and then
organic soy, you know,

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.050
if there's no issue with
soy, then doing non-GMO soy

01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:38.847
sources can be another
option as well.

01:20:38.847 --> 01:20:40.430
AUDIENCE: I mentioned
that I sometimes

01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:45.210
take whey or other
supplements after a workout

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:47.610
because they are calories.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.844
But they are protein-intense.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.885
RONESH SINHA: Yeah, for
a lot of my slender folks

01:20:50.885 --> 01:20:53.091
that are trying to add more
muscle mass, I'm a fan.

01:20:53.091 --> 01:20:54.590
You know, what we
do with our kids--

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:56.090
and I'll do it after
some workouts--

01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:58.174
I'll do a good quality
whey protein shake.

01:20:58.174 --> 01:21:00.590
And there's some good data
behind whey protein supplements

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:03.540
in terms of lowering
cholesterol, diabetes,

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.350
heart disease risk.

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:05.960
So just make sure
it's a good quality.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.793
What I mean by that is
a lot of whey protein

01:21:07.793 --> 01:21:09.230
shakes have
artificial sweeteners

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:10.190
and other ingredients.

01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:12.440
But especially for
vegetarians, where

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.624
it's tough to get enough protein
into the diet to build muscle,

01:21:15.624 --> 01:21:17.540
I think the whey protein
supplements are fine.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.290
AUDIENCE: That's even
on non-workout days,

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:20.831
like, to make up
for protein content?

01:21:20.831 --> 01:21:22.081
RONESH SINHA: You can do that.

01:21:22.081 --> 01:21:24.650
Yeah, but again, the whole
protein is more bioavailable.

01:21:24.650 --> 01:21:27.020
So as long as you're not using
it as a meal replacement,

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.310
because you want to
get the other nutrients

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:30.129
around that protein,
but I think, yeah.

01:21:30.129 --> 01:21:32.420
Sometimes, my vegetarians
might do a whey protein shake

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.730
when they're on the run or
as a mid-afternoon snack.

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:37.063
I'd rather have them do it
through that way than getting

01:21:37.063 --> 01:21:39.209
unhealthier sources of protein.

01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:41.750
SHALLY SINHA: I wouldn't do too
many protein shakes for kids.

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:44.285
It puts a lot of load
on their kidneys.

01:21:44.285 --> 01:21:46.910
RONESH SINHA: "Is eating Indian
ghee or egg yolk, three to four

01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:48.280
a day, OK?"

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.450
A lot of mixed opinions
on this, this all

01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:55.022
comes back to the point
about personalization.

01:21:55.022 --> 01:21:57.230
To give you an idea, there
was a "New England Journal

01:21:57.230 --> 01:22:00.200
of Medicine" study done on a
gentleman in a nursing home

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.050
who was eating 18 to 20
egg yolks every single day

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:04.532
for, like, 8 to 9 years.

01:22:04.532 --> 01:22:05.990
And he had a
perfectly cholesterol.

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:07.880
Like, it could not
even be better.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.082
So he has the genetic capacity
to actually metabolize that.

01:22:11.082 --> 01:22:13.040
But some people that have
those genetic markers

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.440
that I talked about, they
may not do well with that.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.367
Their cholesterol
might actually go up.

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:18.950
So again, I think
you'll want to start

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:21.152
probably not as aggressively
as three to four a day.

01:22:21.152 --> 01:22:22.610
You can up it a
little bit and then

01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:25.730
recheck your cholesterol to see
if you might be fat-sensitive.

01:22:25.730 --> 01:22:27.334
But again, the egg
yolks should be

01:22:27.334 --> 01:22:29.750
in the context of eating other
vegetables and other foods.

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.670
We don't want to
become just focused

01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:34.220
on excessive amounts
of fat in the diet.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.620
Eating Indian ghee in most
of our patients is fine.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.780
You know, it can actually
lower inflammation.

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:41.270
If they're not saturated fat
sensitive, in healthy amounts,

01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:43.850
we find that it is
good for health.

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:45.950
"Does duration between
meals, timing of meals,

01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:47.804
and combination of
certain meals matter?

01:22:47.804 --> 01:22:49.970
I hear a lot of Asian tips
to eat certain foods only

01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:53.720
at a certain time of day or
not to eat some foods together.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.680
What's the truth?

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.600
How does it relate to
intermittent fasting?"

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.770
Great questions,
I've done a couple

01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:01.520
of blog posts on fasting.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.431
I think it does make
a big difference.

01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:05.180
And, again, I'm giving
general guidelines.

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.540
But the overall approach to
eating every two to three hours

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.330
to speed up your metabolism,
I think that can really

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:13.610
be a negative pattern for
a lot of people because,

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:15.030
again, if you've got
insulin resistance,

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:16.850
and you're eating every
two to three hours,

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:18.470
you're spiking
insulin constantly.

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:20.270
So for many of
those folks, having

01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:23.657
more gaps between nutrient-dense
meals is a better approach.

01:23:23.657 --> 01:23:25.490
They're actually going
to burn more body fat

01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:26.780
by doing intermittent fasting.

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.120
So we have to think
about the context.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.800
For other patients,
for example, women

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.130
who might have adrenal
issues, nutrient deficiencies,

01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:35.692
they might have
to eat more often.

01:23:35.692 --> 01:23:38.150
They might have to eat more
frequently to get the nutrients

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:39.290
into their system.

01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:41.052
But meal timing is a
real critical thing.

01:23:41.052 --> 01:23:43.010
A lot of us are very
structured in our approach

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:44.360
to how we eat our meals.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.820
But sometimes longer
spaces to recover

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.890
from high-carbohydrate
meals maybe the night

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.524
before is a good way to do it.

01:23:50.524 --> 01:23:52.190
So don't be programmatic
that every day,

01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:53.870
I'm going to eat every
two to three hours.

01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:55.100
Our lives are very flexible.

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.901
Some days, you binge
eat the night before.

01:23:56.901 --> 01:23:58.400
Then we have to
correct the next day

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.590
by maybe doing some intermittent
fasting to allow our liver

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:01.270
to recover.

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:03.650
So that's a very
high-level point on that.

01:24:03.650 --> 01:24:04.949
There's more nuance to it.

01:24:04.949 --> 01:24:06.740
And like I said, refer
to the blog and book

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.870
for more information on that.

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:09.942
Great.

01:24:09.942 --> 01:24:11.900
So thank you to the people
online, in the room,

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:12.494
for joining.

01:24:12.494 --> 01:24:13.410
Hope that was helpful.

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:13.880
Thank you.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:14.380
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.030
Thanks, guys.
