how much time have you put into
 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.860
how much time have you put into
artificial intelligence and a lot we do

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870
artificial intelligence and a lot we do
 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.380
artificial intelligence and a lot we do
a lot of work in my lab on AI what about

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
a lot of work in my lab on AI what about
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.540

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.979
first let's took let's talk about your
children talking to Alexa okay so the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
children talking to Alexa okay so the
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020
children talking to Alexa okay so the
person who designs Alexa wants to make

pleasant and as part of the programming
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.080
pleasant and as part of the programming
of Alexa because they want to make Alexa

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
of Alexa because they want to make Alexa
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910

it doesn't require your child to say
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630
it doesn't require your child to say
please Alexa would you you know play the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
please Alexa would you you know play the
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.299

music for me your child can be as rude
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220
music for me your child can be as rude
as she wants to Alexa and Alexa will do

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
as she wants to Alexa and Alexa will do
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.139
as she wants to Alexa and Alexa will do
what she wants what you should be

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
what she wants what you should be
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.729
what she wants what you should be
concerned about however is not your

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
concerned about however is not your
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649
concerned about however is not your
child's interaction with Alexa what you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
child's interaction with Alexa what you
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.179
child's interaction with Alexa what you
should be concerned about is what your

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
should be concerned about is what your
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.590
should be concerned about is what your
child is learning from interacting with

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
child is learning from interacting with
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120
child is learning from interacting with
Alexa that then she takes to the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
Alexa that then she takes to the
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920
Alexa that then she takes to the
playground so now she's rude to other

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
playground so now she's rude to other
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.340
playground so now she's rude to other
children so Alexa is corroding our

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
children so Alexa is corroding our
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.679
children so Alexa is corroding our
social fabric Alexa in this example is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
social fabric Alexa in this example is
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410
social fabric Alexa in this example is
making children rude to each other so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
making children rude to each other so
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.249
making children rude to each other so
our concern is not so much do we make

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
our concern is not so much do we make
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.170
our concern is not so much do we make
and do we make you know like Asimov's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
and do we make you know like Asimov's
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450
and do we make you know like Asimov's
laws of robotics do we we it's not that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
laws of robotics do we we it's not that
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.920
laws of robotics do we we it's not that
we want to program the robot so that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
we want to program the robot so that
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469
we want to program the robot so that
they're don't harm you we'd it's true

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
they're don't harm you we'd it's true
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510
they're don't harm you we'd it's true
the first law we don't want the robot to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
the first law we don't want the robot to
 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130
the first law we don't want the robot to
through an act of commission or omission

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
through an act of commission or omission
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.840
through an act of commission or omission
harm or allow a human to come to be

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
harm or allow a human to come to be
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090
harm or allow a human to come to be
harmed it's that we're concerned about

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
harmed it's that we're concerned about
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.950
harmed it's that we're concerned about
how the robot in interacting with you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
how the robot in interacting with you
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.190
how the robot in interacting with you
might cause you to harm others the robot

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
might cause you to harm others the robot
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109
might cause you to harm others the robot
the robotic intelligence creates these

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
the robotic intelligence creates these
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.660
the robotic intelligence creates these
externalities these cascade effects so

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
externalities these cascade effects so
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.240
externalities these cascade effects so
in the Alexa example we might want to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
in the Alexa example we might want to
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359
in the Alexa example we might want to
regulate the programming of devices that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
regulate the programming of devices that
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.440
regulate the programming of devices that
speak to children not because we want to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
speak to children not because we want to
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929
speak to children not because we want to
deprive your daughter of the right to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
deprive your daughter of the right to
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060
deprive your daughter of the right to
speak how she wants but because we

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
speak how she wants but because we
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.190
speak how she wants but because we
recognize that that robot is gonna cause

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
recognize that that robot is gonna cause
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020
recognize that that robot is gonna cause
your daughter to be rude to other people

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
your daughter to be rude to other people

is it really do you really think yes the
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.750
is it really do you really think yes the
Alexa what's the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
Alexa what's the
 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.750
Alexa what's the
that that would make usually but surely

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
that that would make usually but surely
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.850
that that would make usually but surely
I think it will contribute so that's a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
I think it will contribute so that's a
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.350
I think it will contribute so that's a
it's an example it's not like I'm not

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360
it's an example it's not like I'm not
 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.880
it's an example it's not like I'm not
arguing that Alexis should become

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
arguing that Alexis should become
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.520
arguing that Alexis should become
ornately you think it's so novel to kids

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
ornately you think it's so novel to kids
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.410
ornately you think it's so novel to kids
that they know it's not a person I don't

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
that they know it's not a person I don't
 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.640
that they know it's not a person I don't
think it really alright but we're using

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
think it really alright but we're using
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.290
think it really alright but we're using
these examples to build a thing so let's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300
these examples to build a thing so let's
 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.930
these examples to build a thing so let's
talk about the sex robot okay so some

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
talk about the sex robot okay so some
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.290
talk about the sex robot okay so some
people believe that actually the the the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300
people believe that actually the the the
 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.210
people believe that actually the the the
the emergence of sex robots which will

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
the emergence of sex robots which will
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.710
the emergence of sex robots which will
surely appear in the next ten or twenty

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
surely appear in the next ten or twenty
 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.600
surely appear in the next ten or twenty
years will will be a fantastic boon they

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
years will will be a fantastic boon they
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.660
years will will be a fantastic boon they
think that you'll people be able to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670
think that you'll people be able to
 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.490
think that you'll people be able to
experiment you'll be able to experiment

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500
experiment you'll be able to experiment
 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.400
experiment you'll be able to experiment
with same-sex relationships for example

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
with same-sex relationships for example
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.509
with same-sex relationships for example
group sex

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519
group sex
 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.050
group sex
you might learn to be a better lover so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060
you might learn to be a better lover so
 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.460
you might learn to be a better lover so
you could practice with the robots and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
you could practice with the robots and
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.620
you could practice with the robots and
therefore you'd be more experienced when

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630
therefore you'd be more experienced when
 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.110
therefore you'd be more experienced when
you were having sex with a real human so

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
you were having sex with a real human so
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.460
you were having sex with a real human so
they say that you can't get venereal

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470
they say that you can't get venereal
 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.530
they say that you can't get venereal
diseases from a sex robots you can't

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540
diseases from a sex robots you can't
 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.339
diseases from a sex robots you can't
hurt their feelings

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349
hurt their feelings
 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.339
hurt their feelings
so people think that the argument based

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349
so people think that the argument based
 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.750
so people think that the argument based
on ethical grounds is that this would be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
on ethical grounds is that this would be
 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.190
on ethical grounds is that this would be
terrific

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
terrific
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.470
terrific
that this will be a benefit other people

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480
that this will be a benefit other people
 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.720
that this will be a benefit other people
have the opposite opinion other people

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
have the opposite opinion other people
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.250
have the opposite opinion other people
think that actually having sex with

again the lesson here is is that it's

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720
again the lesson here is is that it's
 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.150
again the lesson here is is that it's
not just about the one-on-one

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160
not just about the one-on-one
 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.650

us and in my lab we do many experiments

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050
us and in my lab we do many experiments
 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.529
us and in my lab we do many experiments
in social systems where we take a group

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539
in social systems where we take a group
 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.900
in social systems where we take a group
of people and we drop online we drop a

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910
of people and we drop online we drop a
 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.089
of people and we drop online we drop a
bot or in the laboratory we have a

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099
bot or in the laboratory we have a
 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.490
bot or in the laboratory we have a
physical robot and we watch how the

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500
physical robot and we watch how the
 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.730
physical robot and we watch how the
presence of the robot doesn't just

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740
presence of the robot doesn't just
 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.379
presence of the robot doesn't just
modify how the human interacts with a

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:22.389
modify how the human interacts with a
 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.450
modify how the human interacts with a
robot but how the humans interact with

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460
robot but how the humans interact with
 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.520
robot but how the humans interact with
each other so if we put a robot right

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530
each other so if we put a robot right
 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.400

would we you know would it change how

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110
would we you know would it change how
 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.570
would we you know would it change how
you and I talk to each other make us

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580
you and I talk to each other make us
 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.850

different mmm that's the experiments

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860
different mmm that's the experiments
 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.020

we're doing well

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030
we're doing well
 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.649
we're doing well
clearly in the sex robot realm that's

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659
clearly in the sex robot realm that's
 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.570
clearly in the sex robot realm that's
gonna be a problem I mean we see the

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580
gonna be a problem I mean we see the
 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.230
gonna be a problem I mean we see the
difference between humans that have porn

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240
difference between humans that have porn
 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.820
difference between humans that have porn
addictions yeah that's a good example

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830
addictions yeah that's a good example
 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.360
addictions yeah that's a good example
yeah

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.370
yeah
 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.249
yeah
porn addictions when people do they

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:50.259
porn addictions when people do they
 

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:52.680
porn addictions when people do they
develop this very impersonal way of

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.690
develop this very impersonal way of
 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.689
develop this very impersonal way of
communicating with people and they they

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:56.740
think about sex and the objectification
 

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.529

the way you flavors your expectations

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.330
the way you flavors your expectations
 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.540
the way you flavors your expectations
yes yes and it makes it difficult it can

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:06.550
yes yes and it makes it difficult it can
 

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.070
yes yes and it makes it difficult it can
make it difficult for you to have normal

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080
make it difficult for you to have normal
 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.260

sexual relationships it has come to see

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.270
sexual relationships it has come to see
 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.510

if your expectations are are guided by

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520
if your expectations are are guided by
 

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.510
if your expectations are are guided by
porn and that is going to be radically

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520
porn and that is going to be radically
 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.959

life form that you create that's
 

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.279
life form that you create that's
indistinguishable yes if you can have an

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:26.289
indistinguishable yes if you can have an
 

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:28.830
indistinguishable yes if you can have an
indistinguishable sex partner yeah it is

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840
indistinguishable sex partner yeah it is
 

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.230
indistinguishable sex partner yeah it is
you know some incredibly beautiful woman

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240
you know some incredibly beautiful woman
 

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.860

let's go man women quite happy to change

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:37.209
let's go man women quite happy to change
 

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:38.639
let's go man women quite happy to change
their spouses for robots

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:38.649
their spouses for robots
 

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:41.069
their spouses for robots
I wonder if women are gonna be as into

00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:41.079
I wonder if women are gonna be as into
 

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:42.920
I wonder if women are gonna be as into
it as men because I think women divide

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:42.930
it as men because I think women divide
 

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:48.720
it as men because I think women divide
desire more emotional intimacy I think I

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:48.730
desire more emotional intimacy I think I
 

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:54.040
desire more emotional intimacy I think I
mean on on a scale then men do I I think

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.050
mean on on a scale then men do I I think
 

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.050
mean on on a scale then men do I I think
I think the jury's still out on know

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.060
I think the jury's still out on know
 

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.329
I think the jury's still out on know
what what the relative balance between

00:08:58.329 --> 00:08:58.339
what what the relative balance between
 

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:00.340
what what the relative balance between
men and women we might be surprised that

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:00.350
men and women we might be surprised that
 

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.600
men and women we might be surprised that
that will be replaceable given x's

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.610
that will be replaceable given x's
 

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.490
that will be replaceable given x's
societal expectations and women

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:06.500
societal expectations and women
 

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.090
societal expectations and women
conformed those and yes a lot of men can

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.100
conformed those and yes a lot of men can
 

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.280
conformed those and yes a lot of men can
be sure so it could go both ways I don't

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.290
be sure so it could go both ways I don't
 

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.449
be sure so it could go both ways I don't
I'm not prepared to make a prediction

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:13.459
I'm not prepared to make a prediction
 

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:15.490
I'm not prepared to make a prediction
who's gonna be better off in the gender

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.500
who's gonna be better off in the gender

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.050
debate with the emergence of sex robots
 

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.750
debate with the emergence of sex robots
well maybe your way you suggest I don't

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760
well maybe your way you suggest I don't
 

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.120
well maybe your way you suggest I don't
know well we're also in this realization

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.130
know well we're also in this realization
 

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.480
know well we're also in this realization
genetically where they're doing genetic

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:24.490

experiments on humans and with the

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:26.750
experiments on humans and with the
 

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.079
experiments on humans and with the
advent of CRISPR yes emerging technology

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:29.089
advent of CRISPR yes emerging technology
 

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:30.519

in the book too

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:30.529
in the book too
 

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:32.320
in the book too
entirely possible that there's not gonna

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.330
entirely possible that there's not gonna
 

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.260
entirely possible that there's not gonna
be any frumpy bodies anymore that that's

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.270
be any frumpy bodies anymore that that's
 

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.690
be any frumpy bodies anymore that that's
hundreds of years away but yes yes I

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700
hundreds of years away but yes yes I
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.079
hundreds of years away but yes yes I
think so

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:38.089
think so
 

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:40.389
think so
I wonder I mean I don't know if it is I

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399
I wonder I mean I don't know if it is I
 

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.860
I wonder I mean I don't know if it is I
think if they start cracking them out in

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:41.870
think if they start cracking them out in
 

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.329
think if they start cracking them out in
China and they start giving birth to

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:43.339
China and they start giving birth to
 

00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:46.060
China and they start giving birth to
eight foot tall supermen yes 12 inch

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.070
eight foot tall supermen yes 12 inch
 

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.740
eight foot tall supermen yes 12 inch
dicks yes it's gonna have a real issue

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:47.750
dicks yes it's gonna have a real issue
 

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.210
dicks yes it's gonna have a real issue
yes yes we will yes that's the least of

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:52.220
yes yes we will yes that's the least of
 

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:58.420
yes yes we will yes that's the least of
it yes entirely possible that in the

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.430
it yes entirely possible that in the
 

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.920
it yes entirely possible that in the
future they're gonna have that that

00:09:59.920 --> 00:09:59.930
future they're gonna have that that
 

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.290
future they're gonna have that that
we're gonna that's likely humans yes I

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:02.300
we're gonna that's likely humans yes I
 

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.790
we're gonna that's likely humans yes I
think that is likely the debate is how

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800
think that is likely the debate is how
 

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.430
think that is likely the debate is how
far in the future so I don't think we're

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440
far in the future so I don't think we're
 

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.380
far in the future so I don't think we're
gonna start by using these technologies

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.390
gonna start by using these technologies
 

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.400
gonna start by using these technologies
to cure monogenic diseases so you know

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.410
to cure monogenic diseases so you know
 

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.530
to cure monogenic diseases so you know
like fallacy Mia for example so a

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.540
like fallacy Mia for example so a
 

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.120
like fallacy Mia for example so a
diseases or certain immune deficiencies

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.130
diseases or certain immune deficiencies
 

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.680
diseases or certain immune deficiencies
a disease where a single gene is

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:17.690
a disease where a single gene is
 

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.740
a disease where a single gene is
defective and and those will be the

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:20.750
defective and and those will be the
 

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.630
defective and and those will be the
initial targets but once we start with

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640
initial targets but once we start with
 

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.889
initial targets but once we start with
that eventually I think there will be

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:23.899
that eventually I think there will be
 

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:25.870
that eventually I think there will be
people who will want to genetically

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880
people who will want to genetically
 

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.540
people who will want to genetically
engineer other people their offspring

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.550
engineer other people their offspring
 

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.550
engineer other people their offspring
for example and modified them in the

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560
for example and modified them in the
 

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.230
for example and modified them in the
ways that you suggest maybe not 12-inch

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240
ways that you suggest maybe not 12-inch
 

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.940
ways that you suggest maybe not 12-inch
dicks but maybe you know ability to run

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:33.950
dicks but maybe you know ability to run
 

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.010
dicks but maybe you know ability to run
fast or something sure far smarter I

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.020
fast or something sure far smarter I
 

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.150
fast or something sure far smarter I
mean yeah isn't that one of these side

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160
mean yeah isn't that one of these side
 

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.550
mean yeah isn't that one of these side
effects they showed with the genetic

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560
effects they showed with the genetic
 

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.680
effects they showed with the genetic
manipulation of these Chinese babies to

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:41.690
manipulation of these Chinese babies to
 

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.110
manipulation of these Chinese babies to
eliminate HIV there that they made him

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120
eliminate HIV there that they made him
 

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.579
eliminate HIV there that they made him
smarter no I don't know if they made

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:45.589
smarter no I don't know if they made
 

00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:47.319
smarter no I don't know if they made
them smarter that what's clear from the

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:47.329
them smarter that what's clear from the
 

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:49.300
them smarter that what's clear from the
most recent findings I've seen from that

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:49.310
most recent findings I've seen from that
 

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.840
most recent findings I've seen from that
case is that unsurprisingly as anyone

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:52.850
case is that unsurprisingly as anyone
 

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.240
case is that unsurprisingly as anyone
could predict the technology is not good

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.250
could predict the technology is not good
 

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.910
could predict the technology is not good
enough to restrict the mutations to one

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920
enough to restrict the mutations to one
 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.430
enough to restrict the mutations to one
particular region of the genome so there

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440
particular region of the genome so there
 

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.230
particular region of the genome so there
were other changes in the genome and

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240
were other changes in the genome and
 

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.430
were other changes in the genome and
these children that occurred elsewhere

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440
these children that occurred elsewhere
 

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.740
these children that occurred elsewhere
rather than the targeted region which

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:05.750
rather than the targeted region which
 

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.810
rather than the targeted region which
was to increase their immunity

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:07.820
was to increase their immunity
 

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.060
was to increase their immunity
to HIV right and we don't know what

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.070
to HIV right and we don't know what
 

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.220
to HIV right and we don't know what
those are but those who kill those kids

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.230
those are but those who kill those kids
 

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.350
those are but those who kill those kids
quickly we could make them better in

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360
quickly we could make them better in
 

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.910
quickly we could make them better in
some ways we have no way of knowing yet

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920
some ways we have no way of knowing yet
 

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.650
some ways we have no way of knowing yet
but I think the conclusion was that it

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:17.660
but I think the conclusion was that it
 

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.630
but I think the conclusion was that it
increased their intelligence I don't I

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:19.640
increased their intelligence I don't I
 

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.100
increased their intelligence I don't I
think it's I have not seen those results

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.110
think it's I have not seen those results
 

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.960
think it's I have not seen those results
and I think it would be premature find

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:22.970
and I think it would be premature find
 

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.760
and I think it would be premature find
that it would because they re mature to

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:24.770
that it would because they re mature to
 

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.680
that it would because they re mature to
come to that go there because yeah there

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:26.690
come to that go there because yeah there
 

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.440
come to that go there because yeah there
the problem is also sensationalist

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.450
the problem is also sensationalist
 

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.700
the problem is also sensationalist
clickbait which is that's what you want

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:30.710
clickbait which is that's what you want
 

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.230
clickbait which is that's what you want
to click you know not just that they do

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240
to click you know not just that they do
 

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.760
to click you know not just that they do
the HIV and they made them smarter it's

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:33.770
the HIV and they made them smarter it's
 

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.230
the HIV and they made them smarter it's
gonna get like 40 percent more clerks

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240
gonna get like 40 percent more clerks
 

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.000
gonna get like 40 percent more clerks
yes versus you know yeah 40 percent that

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.010
yes versus you know yeah 40 percent that
 

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.570
yes versus you know yeah 40 percent that
mean that's

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:40.580
mean that's
 

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.520
mean that's
there's just the the nature of humans

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:42.530
there's just the the nature of humans
 

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.950
there's just the the nature of humans
right yes just be clear I talked about

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:44.960
right yes just be clear I talked about
 

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.830
right yes just be clear I talked about
the CRISPR example in in in blueprint I

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:47.840
the CRISPR example in in in blueprint I
 

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.850
the CRISPR example in in in blueprint I
actually talked about these how these

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:48.860
actually talked about these how these
 

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.690
actually talked about these how these
technologies again my lens on it is how

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:52.700
technologies again my lens on it is how
 

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.120
technologies again my lens on it is how
these technologies are gonna change how

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.130
these technologies are gonna change how
 

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.380
these technologies are gonna change how
we interact with each other and it goes

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:56.390
we interact with each other and it goes
 

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.220
we interact with each other and it goes
back to the example we were talking

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.230
back to the example we were talking
 

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.020
back to the example we were talking
about at the beginning when we invented

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.030
about at the beginning when we invented
 

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.420
about at the beginning when we invented
cities that was a technology that

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:01.430
cities that was a technology that
 

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.530
cities that was a technology that
changed how we interacted with each

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:02.540
changed how we interacted with each
 

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.220
changed how we interacted with each
other mhm

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.230
other mhm
 

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.380
other mhm
so human being said for a very long time

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.390
so human being said for a very long time
 

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.820
so human being said for a very long time
had been inventing when we invented

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:06.830
had been inventing when we invented
 

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.860
had been inventing when we invented
weapons that was a technology that

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:08.870
weapons that was a technology that
 

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.090
weapons that was a technology that
changed how we interact with each other

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.100
changed how we interact with each other
 

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.820
changed how we interact with each other
so we have previously done this kind of

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:12.830
so we have previously done this kind of
 

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.350
so we have previously done this kind of
thing he's invented a technology that

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360
thing he's invented a technology that
 

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.280
thing he's invented a technology that
change how we interact with each other

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.290
change how we interact with each other
 

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.800
change how we interact with each other
and I'm very interested in in the and

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:17.810
and I'm very interested in in the and
 

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.870
and I'm very interested in in the and
discuss some of those implications yeah

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880
discuss some of those implications yeah
 

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.790
discuss some of those implications yeah
I'm I'm incredibly interested in this

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800
I'm I'm incredibly interested in this
 

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.460
I'm I'm incredibly interested in this
because I I love to study history and I

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:24.470
because I I love to study history and I
 

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.220
because I I love to study history and I
love to study like how crazy the world

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.230
love to study like how crazy the world
 

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.040
love to study like how crazy the world
was four thousand five thousand years

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.050
was four thousand five thousand years
 

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.380
was four thousand five thousand years
ago a thousand years ago yes what it's

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:32.390
ago a thousand years ago yes what it's
 

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.790
ago a thousand years ago yes what it's
going to be like in the future I think

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800
going to be like in the future I think
 

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.040
going to be like in the future I think
our understanding of the consequences of

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.050
our understanding of the consequences of
 

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.020
our understanding of the consequences of
our actions are so different than

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.030
our actions are so different than
 

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.910
our actions are so different than
anybody has ever had before we have just

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920
anybody has ever had before we have just
 

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.690
anybody has ever had before we have just
such a broader first of all we have

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:43.700
such a broader first of all we have
 

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.850
such a broader first of all we have
examples from all over the world now

examples from all over the world now
 

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.460
examples from all over the world now
that we can study very closely which I

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:48.470
that we can study very closely which I
 

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.170
that we can study very closely which I
don't think really was available to that

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:50.180
don't think really was available to that
 

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.500
don't think really was available to that
many people up entirely recently you

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:53.510
many people up entirely recently you
 

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.640
many people up entirely recently you
mean I'm sorry you're saying the

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:54.650
mean I'm sorry you're saying the
 

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.350
mean I'm sorry you're saying the
examples are more numerous or a capacity

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360
examples are more numerous or a capacity
 

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.180
examples are more numerous or a capacity
to discern them as higher our capacity

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.190
to discern them as higher our capacity
 

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.460
to discern them as higher our capacity
to discern them and just our in-depth

understanding of these various cultures
 

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.330
understanding of these various cultures
all over the world like this like what

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:04.340
all over the world like this like what
 

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.710
all over the world like this like what
do you've been telling you today about

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720
do you've been telling you today about
 

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.470
do you've been telling you today about
these the divers and others we just have

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480
these the divers and others we just have
 

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.440
these the divers and others we just have
so much more data yes and so much more

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:11.450
so much more data yes and so much more
 

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.940
so much more data yes and so much more
of an understanding than ever before yes

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:12.950
of an understanding than ever before yes
 

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.230
of an understanding than ever before yes
I love the idea that we are I mean I

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240
I love the idea that we are I mean I
 

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.450
I love the idea that we are I mean I
believe that this is probably the best

debate which I don't know the answer to
 

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.110
debate which I don't know the answer to
on whether AI will you know is are we

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120
on whether AI will you know is are we
 

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.310
on whether AI will you know is are we
gonna face like a Terminator type

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:45.320
gonna face like a Terminator type
 

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.780
gonna face like a Terminator type
existence where you know the machines

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:46.790
existence where you know the machines
 

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.470

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480
rise up and kill us all or not and you
 

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.940
rise up and kill us all or not and you
know very smart people are on both sides

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:51.950
know very smart people are on both sides
 

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.560
know very smart people are on both sides
of that debate and I read them all and

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:53.570
of that debate and I read them all and
 

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.890
of that debate and I read them all and
like I'm like he's right and then they

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:56.900
like I'm like he's right and then they
 

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.030
like I'm like he's right and then they
read the guy that has the opposite pen

read the guy that has the opposite pen
 

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.220
read the guy that has the opposite pen
I'm like no no he's right and then it

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:00.230
I'm like no no he's right and then it
 

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.450
I'm like no no he's right and then it
goes back and forth I don't know who's

writing what goes back to nuance right
 

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.949
writing what goes back to nuance right
yes it is nuance but it's hard to know

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959
yes it is nuance but it's hard to know
 

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:07.900
yes it is nuance but it's hard to know
whether again we're not talking over our

whether again we're not talking over our
 

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.150
whether again we're not talking over our
lifetime over hundreds of years yes

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160
lifetime over hundreds of years yes
 

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.829
lifetime over hundreds of years yes
you know is there time a thousand years

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839
you know is there time a thousand years
 

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.390
you know is there time a thousand years
from now when the human beings will say

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400
from now when the human beings will say
 

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.920
from now when the human beings will say
what the hell were our ancestors doing

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:14.930
what the hell were our ancestors doing

they're wiping us out and I don't know

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:18.890
they're wiping us out and I don't know
 

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.620
they're wiping us out and I don't know
the answer to that question well I think

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:20.630
the answer to that question well I think
 

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.840
the answer to that question well I think
there's an issue also with the the

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:22.850
there's an issue also with the the
 

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.480
there's an issue also with the the
concept of artificial like artificial

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:25.490
concept of artificial like artificial
 

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.640

life artificial intelligence it's I

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:27.650
life artificial intelligence it's I
 

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.100
life artificial intelligence it's I
think it's going to be life it's just

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.110
think it's going to be life it's just
 

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.600
think it's going to be life it's just
going to be a life that we've created

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:31.610
going to be a life that we've created
 

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.760
going to be a life that we've created
and I don't think it's artificial I just

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:33.770
and I don't think it's artificial I just
 

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.470
and I don't think it's artificial I just
think it's a different kind of life I

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480

think that we're thinking of
 

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.620
think that we're thinking of
biologically based life of sex yes you

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:41.630
biologically based life of sex yes you
 

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.980
biologically based life of sex yes you
know reproduction in terms of the way

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:44.990
know reproduction in terms of the way
 

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.900
