00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.850
- Good afternoon.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.010
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin,
the dean of the Radcliffe

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.940
Institute for Advanced
Study at Harvard University.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome to our annual
Julia S. Phelps Lecture

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.760
in the Arts and Humanities.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.060
Julia Phelps was a
Radcliffe College alumna

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.380
and beloved teacher in
Harvard's German department

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.350
and the Harvard Extension
School and here at Radcliffe.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.360
When Julia retired
from Radcliffe,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.000
her family, friends,
and colleagues

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.620
established the Phelps
Lecture Series in her honor.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.070
I'm delighted that Julia's
daughter and son-in-law, Susan

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.790
Napier and Steven Coit
are joining us today.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.870
Welcome.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm also pleased to welcome
Kim Yonghyon, the consul

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.640
general of the Republic
of Korea in Boston.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.980
And I want to acknowledge
Kate Gellert, who's

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.990
here today, the entire Gellert
family, the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.590
Leadership Society, and all
our generous annual donors who

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.390
support the institute's work.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.980
Thank you.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.180
In a moment, I'll introduce our
Phelps lecturer, Min Jin Lee.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.640
But first, let me
extend one more special

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.630
welcome to Min's husband,
mother, father, and two

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.710
sisters.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.390
I'm delighted to have you here.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.070
Min Jin Lee is an acclaimed
novelist, essayist,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.830
and literary critic.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.380
She's the author of
two bestselling novels,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
Free Food for
Millionaires, and Pachinko,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.230
which was a finalist for
the National Book Award.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.910
Min is currently at work on her
third novel, American Hagwon,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.920
while in residence
here at Radcliffe

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.280
as our inaugural Catherine A.
and Mary C. Gellert fellow.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000
American Hagwon will complete
Min's thematic trilogy

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.680
on the Korean diaspora.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.610
And it'll be the central
focus of her work today.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.550
Min is a part of the
diaspora that she

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.620
chronicles in her novels.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.820
She moved from Seoul to Queens,
New York as a seven-year-old.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.870
From a young age, Min
found refuge in literature.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.410
And she has said it was the
writings of the novelist

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.360
Sinclair Lewis that inspired her
to attend Yale, his alma mater.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.670
Despite that
inspiration, it never

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.690
occurred to Min that
she could be a writer.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.315
A working class Korean-American
and couldn't pursue that path,

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:32.430
or so she thought.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.800
She went on to study
history at Yale

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.950
and earned her law
degree from Georgetown.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.150
So how did Min
become a novelist?

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.180
To understand Min as a
writer is to understand

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.050
how Pachinko came to be.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.630
Two years into a promising
career as a corporate lawyer,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.470
Min quit because of a
serious liver disease.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.040
As she tells it, it was
facing this illness that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.860
inspired her to write fiction.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.010
She soon set out to
document the Korean diaspora

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.890
in Japan, a community
that she had first

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.470
learned about in college.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.980
Min spent the next two-plus
decades, on and off,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.930
writing the story
that eventually

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.240
would become Pachinko.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.630
Along the way, she worked,
much like an academic

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.250
or a journalist, reading widely
across sociology, history,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.340
political science,
law, and economics.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.310
She drafted an
entire manuscript.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.930
Then she put it aside,
dissatisfied with result.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.200
At this impasse, Min
began a new book project

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.690
on the Korean
diaspora in America,

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.390
which evolved into
her debut novel, Free

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.670
Food for Millionaires.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.960
It tells the story of Casey Han,
a young, Ivy-League-educated

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.260
Korean-American from
Queens, who aspires

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.960
to a glamorous
Manhattan lifestyle

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.390
that she can't afford.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.060
Through Casey's
story, Min explores

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.080
how conventional ideas of
money, class, and ambition

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.950
may fall flat in lived reality.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.220
After the release of Free
Food for Millionaires,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.940
Min moved with her husband
and their son to Tokyo

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.410
and returned to her book
about ethnic Koreans in Japan.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.970
Dozens of interviews conducted
across Japan compelled Min

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.480
to toss out virtually
all of her earlier draft

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.140
and to rewrite Pachinko.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.420
Released in 2017, Pachinko
was an instant hit.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.940
It's a sweeping
yet intimate work

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.460
of historical fiction
that chronicles

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.000
four generations of triumphs,
tragedies, and everything

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.260
in between as experienced
by a Korean family living

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.500
as perpetual outsiders in Japan.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.110
Like Free Food for
Millionaires, it's

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.130
rigorously researched,
yet wonderfully readable.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.250
NPR described Pachinko
as "the kind of book

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.680
that can open your
eyes and fill them

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.860
with tears at the same time."

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.690
The story is animated by a
defiant opening sentence.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.650
"History has failed
us, but no matter."

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.500
Unusual for a
novelist, Min calls

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.310
the first line in each of her
novels her thesis statement.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.710
This reflects her
research-driven approach

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.160
and her keen awareness
of the power of fiction

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.780
to reveal complexities,
to tell important truths,

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.070
and to make arguments,
as any lawyer would.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.360
For Min illuminating themes of
homeland and exile, of identity

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.510
and belonging, and of
love and forgiveness

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.470
necessitates the coexistence
of many, often contradictory

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.040
perspectives.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.000
These perspectives are
articulated by her characters

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.520
and omniscient narration.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.810
Min's craft is scholarly,
interdisciplinary, ambitious,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.250
and creative.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.020
She's a natural fit for
Radcliffe's fellowship cohort,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.520
which spans academic
disciplines, the creative arts,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.080
and professional fields.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.890
I'm thrilled to have
her among us this year.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.100
In a moment, I'll turn
things over to Min.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.040
Following her talk, Min
will engage in conversation

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.830
with my colleague
Jeannie Suk Gersen, who

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.790
is the John H. Watson, Jr.
professor of Law at Harvard Law

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.260
School.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.060
Like Min, Jeannie immigrated
to Queens as a young child.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.860
Jeannie has said
that her own family

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.290
experience with
immigration and exile,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.910
from North and South Korea, has
informed her career, including

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.900
her pathbreaking legal
scholarship on trauma.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.000
After Jeannie and
Min's conversation,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.140
we'll open the floor
to your questions.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.650
Thank you, Jeannie, for
being with us today.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.340
And now, please join me
in giving a warm welcome

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.420
to Min Jin Lee.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.843
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:11.222
- [LAUGHS]

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.178
Thank you.

00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:22.990
Wow.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.310
You guys, it's snowing outside.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.590
Tomiko, thank you so much
for that introduction.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.880
I'm so impressed.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.820
And you mentioned
that my family's here.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.640
They're over there, my mother,
my father, and my two sisters.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.440
My husband's here.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.290
And I just want to pause
everything for one second.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.790
Mom, wasn't that impressive?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.856
She won the Bancroft Prize
for her history book, Courage

00:07:52.856 --> 00:07:54.710
to Dissent.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.880
Thank you, Tomiko.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.140
You did me a solid.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.790
And I also want to
thank all of you

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.060
for showing up today
because you made me look

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.770
less unpopular with my sisters.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.280
It's huge.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.820
Thank you.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.104
I really owe you one.

00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:12.062
I will sign whatever you
want me to sign today.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.200
I also want to thank the very
special people of the Radcliffe

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.980
Institute.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.970
I want to thank Meredith, and
Sharon, and Rebecca Haley,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.100
and Rebecca Wassarman.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.140
I want to thank Allyson, and
Caroline, and Jess, and Jeff.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.740
And so many more
of us fellows here

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.070
are so grateful because
you make us jolly and good

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.929
every single day.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.780
And I think it's fair to
say, of all the fellows,

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.919
we would like another year.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:45.811
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:48.230
- Right?

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.380
So if we could work on that--

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.350
Also, I really want to
acknowledge my research

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.100
partners, four Harvard
undergraduates whose

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.720
breathtaking intelligence only
confirms my actual research

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.710
about higher education,
that it must, indeed,

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.310
take quite a lot to get into
this august institution.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.650
So my favorite Harvard unicorns
are Sue Lee, Irene Kim,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.110
Guy [INAUDIBLE], and Emily Kim.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.220
So thank you.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.010
I want you to know, not
only am I grateful to you,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.640
I am really, really
proud of you.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:32.786 --> 00:09:35.840
As a Radcliffe fellow, on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.970
I get to listen to my incredibly
smart fellows give talks.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.950
And usually, you will
see me in the first row

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.530
of either this room
or another room

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.240
at Byerly Hall, slack jawed
with wonder and feeling

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.510
something called the imposter
syndrome, which all of you

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.380
inflict on me.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.440
But when you're not
inflicting that on me,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.360
because you guys
are the real deal,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.660
I want you to know that you
teach me to reach higher.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.260
So thank you.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.250
I also want to thank
my discussant, Jeannie,

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.660
who is one of the smartest and
most fair persons out there.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.370
And her mind is so impressive.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.410
And although she's younger than
I am, I do seek her approval.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.230
Thank you for hanging
out with me today.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.920
Finally, it should be noted
here that this event does not

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.670
work without the seemingly
invisible labor of so

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.360
many people who are never
recognized, people who put out

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.180
these chairs, who
keep these lights on,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.130
who keep us warm and
dry, who makes sure

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.000
that the snow is all shoveled
and that everything works.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.420
And I want to thank all of
you for your incredible labor.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.620
I'm really in your debt.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.420
Now, in March of 1976,
my mother, and my father,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.200
and my two sisters and I
immigrated to this country.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.860
And back in Korea, my father
was a marketing executive

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.820
for a cosmetics company, and my
mother was a neighborhood piano

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.040
teacher.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.280
And my father was
born, and he was

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.970
raised in Wonsan, which is
a northeastern part of what

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.690
is now considered North Korea.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.940
And he became a war refuge
when he was 16 years old,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.280
losing his entire family.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.680
My mother grew up
in Pusan, which

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.310
is a southernmost tip of
what is now South Korea.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.570
But when they were children,
there was only one Korea.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.620
Now, I mention the fact that
these two separate republics

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.690
were formed in 1948 because
it's a material fact.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.520
Now, for their
married life, they

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.010
lived in Seoul, where my
sisters and I were born.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.770
I was about 7 and
1/2 when we left.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:55.900
And I recall our modest,
middle class home in Sudogwon,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.850
in the Mope district.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.290
It was an ordinary middle class
house with a stone facade.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.400
It wasn't large, and it wasn't
very special in its appearance.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.300
And these standalone houses
are mostly gone now in Seoul.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.750
And they've been replaced by
these huge, large apartment

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.190
buildings.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.380
And that's too bad
because I would

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.720
like to see my old house again.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.690
When I recall my
childhood in Korea,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.490
I remember the sound of piano
playing, the loud plunking

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.690
of enthusiastic children who
tried to please my mother,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.710
who is a very gentle person
and a very fine musician.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.180
And I never once heard her
raise her voice at her students.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.460
And I think her
students loved her.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.450
And sometimes when
she wasn't teaching,

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.195
I could hear her play
Haydn and Mozart.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.960
I remember the smells.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.120
There was a time when
my mother decided

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.450
to learn how to make cakes
with her best friend.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.490
And during this
marvelous period,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:13.500
I recall the gorgeous scents of
eggs, and butter, and vanilla.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.710
And it made a really
happy impression on me.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.450
And I remember the tastes.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.150
At Christmas, my
mother would have

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.530
a Christmas party, serving ice
cream to all of her students.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.870
My younger sister sang,
and I couldn't attend

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.460
because we were too little.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.970
So we were sent off
to our uncle's house.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.470
And we would eat lots
and lots of tangerines

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.910
until we almost got sick.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.430
And we would watch television
until it was very late.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.240
I attended the local
elementary school.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.250
And I was the tallest
child in the class,

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.590
for both boys and girls.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.290
And everybody was
seated in size order,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.660
so I would sit all
the way in the back.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.630
And I had a tendency
to daydream,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.150
so I was not a
very good student.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.630
Whenever I was bored, I would
just get up from my seat

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.760
and try to wander.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.670
I hardly spoke.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.640
And I had no friends.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.670
And I did not have the words
to speak to other children.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.160
And I think in retrospect,
I must have had

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.200
some sort of learning issue.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.140
However, back then
in Korea, a child

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.700
like me was just
considered slow or odd.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.510
I was profoundly unaware
of my social environment,

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.620
and I could not accurately
perceive social cues

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.380
of my teachers or my peers.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.860
And one day, when I
was in the first grade,

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.880
and I was six years old,
I completed my assignment.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.090
And needing to move,
I got up from my seat,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.600
and I walked to and fro in
the back of the classroom.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.620
And my teacher called
my name and told

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.560
me to come to the
front of the classroom.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.540
So I went.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:06.160
And she told me to hold
out my hands like this.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.490
And I had no idea what
she was going to do.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.400
She picked up a ruler
and she struck my hands.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.830
And I don't recall
how many times,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.170
but it was more than once.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.580
I don't recall if it hurt.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.600
Mostly, I remember
being surprised,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.180
and I felt ashamed of myself.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.770
And later, the teacher
called my mother

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.810
and asked her to come in.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.780
And to this day, I don't
know what they discussed.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.040
But I suppose it must have had
something to do with the fact

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.560
that I was not a good learner.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.060
My mother worked all the
time, teaching piano.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.780
So the day my mother came to
school to talk with my teacher,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.020
it felt like a very
special day because we

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.300
could go home together.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.480
And after talking to
my teacher, my mother

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.720
took me to a cafe
near the school,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.780
and she bought me
a piece of pastry.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.000
She wasn't upset
with me, not at all.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.540
My mother just said that
I should remain in my seat

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.140
until my teacher
allowed me to move.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:26.010
So in school, I always
tried to do that.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:26.740
I still do.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.672
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.770
So those are a few of my
very persistent memories

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.960
of my childhood in Korea.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.720
And I share them with
you today because writers

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.700
need their memories the way
mathematicians need logic.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.650
I have written about
Koreans for most of my life.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.340
And I've been asked why
I write about Koreans.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.540
And it seems like such a
strange question to me.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.770
Because why wouldn't
I write about Koreans?

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.880
To me, Koreans are
mothers, and fathers,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.890
and daughters, and sons, which
means Koreans are like us.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:17.520
We are worthy of
consideration and reflection.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.450
About a year and a half
ago, a European journalist

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.650
interviewed me.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.920
And he asked me this question.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.541
What are Koreans like?

00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:30.961
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.920
What are Koreans like?

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.490
Now, the journalist meant well.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.840
And I work as a
journalist sometimes.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.220
And I know that we can
fumble with our words,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.770
even though we're supposed to
know them better than most.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.580
I think he was trying
to help Koreans, help

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.430
us tell our side
of the story, so he

00:17:54.430 --> 00:18:00.690
was asking a writer of Korean
ethnicity to explain my tribe.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.170
And as you know, if
and whenever Korea

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.740
is discussed in the media,
especially in the mainstream

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.100
news, it is so
often about that one

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.820
young Korean man
from the North who

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.210
is trying to hold
onto his power and is

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.320
taking desperate measures
in order to do so.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.500
And he does this much in
the vein of his father

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.590
and his grandfather have done.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.550
So his story is a story
of a dynasty, which

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.610
means that you know
that at its root

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.560
it is a story about a family.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.620
People around the world who
want to see more of Koreans

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.670
get such a small
and dark window.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.260
And that is, indeed, a shame.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.010
So what are Koreans like?

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.030
I thought about the
immensity of this question,

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:04.920
the fallacy behind it, and
the overwhelming likelihood

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.610
of falling into stereotypes
in answering him.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.050
And yet, not to reply
would have been rude,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.840
because I had spent some
time with this journalist.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.600
And I knew he was
not a bad person.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.480
So I answered him.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.297
I told him the Koreans
liked to dance.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:28.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.602 --> 00:19:35.530
Dance.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.050
I was only half kidding.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.669
Three months ago, I turned 50.

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:42.960
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.672
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:44.672 --> 00:19:48.160
And because I write
so much about Koreans

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.590
and have done so
for so many decades,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.060
I have now encountered thousands
of Koreans around the world.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.210
And wherever I go,
I do my best to take

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:03.160
the temperature of Koreans
from every age and group.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.920
So if you follow
Koreans in the news,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.040
you can find some
widespread generalizations

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.140
about the peninsula
and its people.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.760
And they go like this.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.380
You will know that there
was a miracle on the Han,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.400
a phrase used to explain South
Korea's incredible, superhuman

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.510
economic success as it
emerged from a catastrophic,

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.230
post-colonial, post-war
poverty, and all

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.700
in a matter of a few decades.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.420
Koreans are global leaders in
internet speed, shipbuilding,

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.600
steel, the manufacture
of consumer electronics,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.230
automobiles, memory
chips, and semiconductors.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.470
South Korea leads the
PISA scores, literacy,

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.630
secondary and
tertiary education.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.860
And Korea has produced world
class athletes, filmmakers,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.450
musicians, and artists.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.580
South Koreans also
have the highest rates

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.430
in plastic surgery, suicide,
cryptocurrency speculation,

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:08.140
youth dissatisfaction,
and elderly poverty.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.900
And for North Korea, according
to the 2018 Global Slavery

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:19.660
Index, North Korea has the
highest number of slaves today.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.020
Today, 1 out of every 10
North Korean citizens--

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.250
that is 2.6 million people--

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.580
live under slavery conditions.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.930
It can be argued very
logically and fairly that,

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.770
because all of its citizens
lack the freedom of movement,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.720
even at the very highest levels,
almost 26 million North Koreans

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.370
are actually hostages
to one leader.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.590
So whether it's the number
of churches being built,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.670
the number of
speedskating gold medals,

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.940
or noses being reconstructed,
or the trafficking

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.260
of human beings, Koreans
hold top positions

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.422
on important lists.

00:22:04.422 --> 00:22:09.140
But Koreans like to dance.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.110
And if you go to
festivals or weddings,

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:18.810
you will see Korean grandmothers
moving their arms elegantly,

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:24.570
and swaying their
shoulders and their heads.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.864
Koreans have
excellent rhythm, Ani.

00:22:28.864 --> 00:22:30.030
That's a little inside joke.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.220
[LAUGHS]

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.750
Koreans can be funny.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.280
We like to sing.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.710
And we love to eat.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.550
And we like a little dazzle.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.640
And if you know a bit
about the Korean psyche,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.600
you know that we're known
for carrying this thing,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.410
this feeling called han,
defined as a specific kind

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.550
of inexpressible anguish that
comes from having suffered

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.010
collectively as a people.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.820
And then there's nunchi, a
kind of emotional intelligence,

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.680
or the ability to
perceive subtext.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.850
And there's also the concept of
jeong, my favorite, the quality

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.320
of affection and attachment
that people develop with time

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.830
and common experience.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:24.820
Now, my job as a writer demands
that I avoid generalizations.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.900
But I fear that the very
prevalent generalizations

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.980
are so limited and negative
that I am anxious as

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.860
to how to correct
misrepresentations

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.000
and distortions of my
community of origin

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.580
and my diasporic community.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.810
In my experience, the Koreans
that I know are very romantic.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.340
They are full of
love and intensity.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.500
And they're physical
in their expression.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.460
So I want you to know that too.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.610
Now, I was a lawyer before
I began writing fiction.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.950
And I majored in history, and
then I went to law school.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.940
And I don't have a degree
in English or an MFA.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:15.150
It took me 11 years to write and
ultimately sell my first novel,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.100
called Free Food
for Millionaires.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.770
And it was a book about Koreans
in America, specifically

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.760
in New York City, where
class and money define

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.950
a specific reality with
hidden rules for outsiders.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.140
I wrote that book
because I wanted

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.070
to understand where
poor Koreans fit in

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.130
and what it would
mean for a poor Korean

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.750
to be accepted into an
elite Ivy League institution

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.470
and try to have bigger
dreams than the ones laid out

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.960
by her parents.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.430
Another 10 years passed
before I published Pachinko,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.800
a book about Koreans in Japan.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.400
Among many things, I
wanted to understand

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.190
the modern 20th century Korean.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.250
And I knew that I could
not understand her

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.860
unless I located her position
in the colonial history of Japan

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.030
and Korea and how that
post-colonial history informed

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.900
the Korean population in Japan.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.920
So now, to complete my
trilogy of the diaspora, which

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.210
I'm calling The
Koreans, I wanted

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.370
to know what is the most
important value for Koreans,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.750
not just in Korea,
but around the world.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.990
And I sensed what it was.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.990
Koreans value education.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.350
They value it like nothing else.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.930
For Koreans, since
the Silla Kingdom,

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:54.010
when national exams were first
administered to candidates

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.180
to become bureaucrats, Koreans
have regarded education

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.860
as a gateway and a path
to progress, distinction,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.100
and proof of one's value.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.240
Kingdoms have risen
and fallen in Korea,

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.890
this peninsula attached to
China, located east of Japan

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.330
and south of Russia.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.670
The nation was
colonized by Japan

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.860
and then later split
by foreign powers.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.730
And then from 1950 to
1953, not a long time

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.750
ago, the two Koreas
fought a civil war,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:36.680
which killed 2 million Korean
men, women, and children,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:43.570
over 600,000 Chinese, and
over 50,000 Americans.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.690
And as you know, although
the armistice agreement

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:51.340
was signed in July of 1953,
there has been a ceasefire,

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.290
but the war has not ended.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.500
The ancient civilized
nation, which

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.650
is now made up of two republics,
each only 71 years old,

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.210
has suffered through dictators,
the repression of human rights,

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.020
the systematic torture and
murder of university students

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.210
and labor organizers.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.400
And many South Korean
business leaders

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.300
have done incredibly good
things for their nations.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.220
And others have sought
only personal gain

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.340
and profited through corruption.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.900
South Korea is growing up to
be a great democratic nation,

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.410
as evidenced by the recent
Candlelight Revolution, where

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:43.010
several months, from 2016 to
2017, collectively, millions

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.830
of South Korean
citizens gathered week

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.640
after week, effectively
and peacefully,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.500
and ousted a corrupt regime.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.890
South Korean citizens
uphold and honor

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.770
a long history of protest.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.350
And they have excellent
voting turnout

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:07.270
and are deeply engaged in the
formation of their democracy.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.120
Both Koreas are global players.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.800
South Korea is a member
of the OECD and the G20,

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.520
as evidence of its status
as an advanced economy.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.640
It is the 12th largest
economy in the world.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.920
And North Korea insists on
taking the center stage.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.770
And in a few weeks,
the American president

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:35.200
will meet with him in Vietnam
for their second summit.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.650
How did Koreans
become global players?

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.310
And how did it happen so fast?

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.000
And if you ask Koreans
around the world,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.140
nearly everyone will
mention that Koreans

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.930
are willing to figure
things out and they

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.600
will work around rigid systems.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.440
We will read.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.130
We will study.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.320
We will try to solve problems.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.660
Koreans will go to great
lengths to learn more.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:06.020
In short, Koreans care
immensely about education.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.780
Well, education
is a vital subject

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.700
to every living creature.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.720
So from birth, every
infant has to learn skills.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.490
And gradually, if she has the
necessary biological capacity,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.800
she will learn how to hold
her head up, and crawl,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.780
and express herself.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.670
And eventually, she will
need to learn enough skills

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.450
to be independent and
productive for herself

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.530
and for her community.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.530
So if everyone
needs an education,

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.800
then how is the modern
Korean's value of education

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.260
different than,
let's say, someone

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.550
from Spain, or Palestine,
or Syria, or Ghana,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.740
or New Zealand?

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.580
Well, we can measure
the unique interest

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.240
in terms of sheer
investment, in terms of time,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.060
in terms of money or output.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:06.350
We can look at it through the
lens of culture or history.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:11.180
Now, from its Confucian roots
for well over 1,000 years,

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.450
Koreans have trusted
that one's status in life

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.530
can be improved markedly
by educational achievement.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:23.900
By passing exams, one can attain
a position near the ruler,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:28.430
become a political
leader, or serve one.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:32.210
And he can acquire status,
privilege, and security

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:37.160
for himself, his family,
and his descendants.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.850
Well, a millennia of
social conditioning

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.300
is hard to shake off.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.320
Despite the calamities that
Korea has suffered, or perhaps

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.580
because of the calamities that
Koreans have endured, even as

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.320
recently as the Asian financial
crisis and the IMF bailout,

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.630
education has become even
more valued in South Korea.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.110
In South Korea today, it is not
sufficient to send one's child

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.970
to school.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.180
No.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.880
Rather, the child
will begin to get

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.540
supplemental education,
private tutoring,

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.280
starting at the age of four.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.960
South Korean high
school students

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.410
sleep on average
five hours a day,

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.200
which means some sleep less.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.200
And when they are awake,
they are studying.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.310
Why?

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.480
Every year, the college
entrance exam, called the CSAT,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.500
or the [INAUDIBLE] is
offered exactly once

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.960
on a date in November.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.540
And 600,000 South Korean
students take this exam.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.090
And the score that she
receives will determine where

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.290
she can apply and be admitted.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.510
The top three
universities are widely

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.930
believed to be Seoul National,
Korea, and Yonsei University.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:06.800
And the initials SKY,
making up the acronym SKY,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.630
reaching for the sky--

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.620
the metaphor is not
lost on this crowd.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:20.210
And of the 600,000 examinees,
there about 11,000 spots.

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:24.440
So only 2% can attend
the SKY schools.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.410
And to be sure,
not every examinee

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.020
wants to attend a SKY school.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:35.780
Last year, about 108,000
applied to those three schools.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.840
And whether or not this
is an objective reality,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.590
the overwhelming majority
of the entire country

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.900
believes that SKY graduates
are the most desirable.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.320
SKY graduates and
their alumni networks

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.890
dominate the most prestigious
companies and government

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.210
positions.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.660
And also keep in mind that
the youth unemployment

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.740
in South Korea is hovering
officially around 9%.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.920
But because so many have
given up seeking employment,

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.550
most economists and
sociologists believe

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.940
that it's well over 20%.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.960
So if you are a
Korean parent, and you

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.410
want to help your
child, what do you do?

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:28.790
What would you do to help your
child to be part of the 2%?

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.030
If you have the means, you
may try to get your child out

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.780
of South Korea.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.150
And this is precisely what many
South Koreans attempt to do.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.250
They send their children
abroad at various stages

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.730
so they can avoid the
intense and suffocating

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.000
examination-based
paths to getting

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.730
a university-level education.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:55.390
And maybe, if that is not an
option for you, what do you do?

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:00.250
But more likely than not,
nearly every South Korean parent

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:05.380
of every socioeconomic
level sends her child

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.760
through hagwons.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.870
A hagwon-- H-A-G-W-O-N--

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:17.150
is the Korean word for a
for-profit tutoring business,

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:21.860
a place to receive private
supplemental education.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.659
There are hagwons in South
Korea to study anything.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:30.270
You can find a hagwon to
study any language, any exam,

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.969
and even non-academic fields
like Model UN, debate,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:41.900
video gaming, or even how to
boost your child's creativity.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.929
And if you think about
it, private tutors

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.239
have always existed.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.560
Universal public education,
or compulsory education,

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.810
is a modern concept
for many countries,

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.810
including the
United States, which

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.980
still varies its requirements
from state to state.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.920
In the United States,
we have Stanley Kaplan,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.390
or Princeton Review.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.640
Those are our national hagwons.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.290
And for elementary
school levels,

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.780
there's Kumon, a
Japanese export,

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.270
where children can start as
young as three years old,

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.590
in America.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.530
In South Korea, we
can safely assume

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.450
that the average
Korean household

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.640
income is somewhere
between $20,000

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.360
$30,000, depending
upon your calculation.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.960
So if you spend $300 a month
for your four-year-old,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.510
and if you continue to
pay $3,600 per annum--

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.270
and this amount will only
increase every single year

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:44.720
dramatically because she
will need other subjects,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.460
and there will be
tuition for high school--

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.780
you are spending a significant
portion of your income

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:57.910
over the lifetime of your child
for supplemental education.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:02.510
Now, my third novel, which I'm
researching and writing here,

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.110
and it is about the value
of education for Koreans

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.360
around the world.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.160
And I'm interested in what
an education should mean.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.360
And at this stage
in my life, I am

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.190
interested in the metaphysical
question of wisdom.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.890
How can I live a wise life?

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.110
What is a wise life?

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:27.745
And how is education
different than wisdom?

00:36:27.745 --> 00:36:29.770
So how do I work?

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.520
How do I write a novel?

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.187
When I write fiction,
I do a lot of research.

00:36:36.187 --> 00:36:37.770
And I look at the
relevant scholarship

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.740
in the fields of economics,
anthropology, law, education,

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.710
sociology, psychology,
and history.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.770
And then I review the
traditional mainstream media.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.430
And concurrently, I interview
hundreds of people and conduct

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.840
site visits.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.930
And for this book, I
have just done fieldwork

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:58.830
in New York, Seoul, Jeju,
Los Angeles, and London.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.710
And I will head to Australia
and New Zealand for the summer

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.560
because these
English-speaking countries are

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.340
among the many places that South
Koreans send their children

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.390
to learn English.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.070
And this past December,
I was in Seoul

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.720
with two of my
research partners,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.180
where I had the chance
to meet with hagwon

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.870
owners, private tutors,
parents, school teachers,

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.490
and all kinds of students.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.850
I've met with
[INAUDIBLE] fathers.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.010
And these are fathers
who live in Seoul,

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.320
or who live somewhere
in South Korea.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.470
And they send their money abroad
to their wives and children

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.500
who are studying
outside of South Korea.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.960
I have met homestay guardians.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.360
These are Koreans who
serve as guardians

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.980
for parachute children.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.860
And parachute children are
kids who are dropped off

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.120
in foreign countries to study.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.520
I visited
international students,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.250
international schools,
and cafes where

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:58.660
students go to avoid
studying, universities,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.690
international school fairs.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.680
And I've been to goshitels.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.910
Goshitels are cheap hotels
where students in South Korea

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.430
live in windowless rooms.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.350
That's about 40 square feet.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:18.570
I have visited a K-pop museum,
internet cafes called PCBang's,

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.550
and many, many, many hagwons.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.090
In the United States, I have
met their American counterparts

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.800
and talked with
admissions officers

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.490
from universities
like Yale and Harvard,

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.220
admissions officers of
elite private schools,

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.320
and interviewed
college presidents.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.440
And this past October, I
attended the Harvard admissions

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.930
trial.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.820
And I mentioned
some of my research.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.320
Because doing this kind of
work, as I write and rewrite

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.950
a work of fiction, humbles me.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:55.250
It teaches me to listen more.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.490
Reality corrects
my preconceptions.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:03.560
And my eyes and my ears
experience what my characters

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.840
may ultimately feel.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.620
Now, it may be true that a
Korean child studies from dawn

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.210
to dusk and that a Korean
parent may impoverish himself

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.740
to support his child's studies.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.910
And when I share
some of what I learn,

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:25.370
I noticed that people seem
alarmed at my findings.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.790
And sometimes I
share your alarm.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:33.530
However, I've noticed that
every single Korean I've

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:38.030
spoken with has specific
wishes and reasons.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.370
So I try never to judge.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:46.770
I try to ask more questions, and
I consider his point of view.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:52.050
I worry a great deal about
how Koreans are perceived,

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.900
not because I think
Koreans are ideal.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.510
No, far from it.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.770
I worry because when I encounter
the way Koreans are perceived

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.700
in the world by non-Koreans
and diasporic Koreans,

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.440
I find that the Koreans don't
get to tell their full story.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.780
And I'm hoping
that you and I can

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.530
be more fair if we realize
the Koreans have achieved

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.730
impressive outcomes and they
care intensely about education

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.485
because they have good reason.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.090
Why?

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:31.460
Why do Koreans care so
much about education?

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:38.270
Well, one reason is that
Koreans want power no less

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.970
than any of us in this room.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.760
Koreans want power because
the average Korean,

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.000
whether she lives
in Pusan or Toronto,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.680
may feel less than powerful.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.160
And who among us would
deny that we sometimes

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.180
feel less than powerful
and that sometimes life can

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.090
feel like a dead end?

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.900
So I ask myself,
what will a mother

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.990
do when she wants
her child to have

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.630
a little more than she has?

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.630
And how is she
different from me?

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.050
And how is she
different from us?

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:23.120
I am overwhelmed by the
complexity of my subject,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.070
and because I
realize that I am not

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.120
writing about education,
the diaspora, or Koreans,

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.930
I'm writing about humans.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.990
And we are very complicated.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.460
We are vulnerable.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.550
We are needy, and
we are frightened.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:43.300
We make terrible choices,
and we live with regrets.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:47.740
And more often than not, we
cannot give voice to our most

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.570
important feelings.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:55.250
When I teach writing, I set
ground rules in my classroom.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.300
We will respect each
other's privacy,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.590
and we will
encourage each other.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.570
Because we are writers and we
are developing our stories.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:07.520
The quest is for
each writer to work

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.310
on her most important
questions, even

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:16.010
if her questions are strange,
embarrassing, or peculiar.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.320
Because her most
important questions

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.900
will allow her to
finish her work.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.590
I want to know what drew
my writer to her subject.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:32.120
And more than that, I want my
writer to own her questions.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.370
And through her
process of writing,

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.600
I want the writer
to own her answers.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:45.590
Because I believe that, as a
society, we need these answers.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.870
When the European
journalist asked

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:53.260
me the question, what
are Koreans like, what

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:58.060
I heard in his question
was really the question,

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.240
are Koreans human.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.680
Are they like me?

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:09.300
So I had told him that
Koreans like to dance.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:15.800
And here, let me explain
more fully what I meant.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.670
Dance is a physical
allegory of our emotions.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:23.970
Our bodies are telling
our hearts' stories

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.250
without using words.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.430
I told the journalist that
Koreans like to dance because I

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:34.140
wanted him to understand that
a Korean cannot always say what

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:39.330
she means, and she cannot always
sit still until she is told she

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:40.900
can move.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.160
Dance requires twists
and gestures, backward

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.450
and forward motion.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:52.800
Dance requires reaching,
and stretching, and bending.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.460
And dance allows some
freedom of desire

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.470
and the manifestation of will.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.210
Perhaps the journalist
thought that I

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.810
was alluding to the
extraordinary choreography

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.020
and the dramatic execution
of synchronized movements

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.850
of K-pop.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:10.510
I was not.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.730
I was talking
about the old woman

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:20.770
who wants to roll her shoulders
while closing her eyes.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.240
I am writing,
though I'm a writer.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.900
Why am I talking about dancing?

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.720
I am talking about
ordinary people

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:37.060
dancing because I worry that
the literate and the elite,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.060
the ones who have
the fancy words,

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.020
are the only ones who
get to be considered.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:49.990
And if you think about that,
it is both absurd and immoral.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:54.550
Less than 100 years ago,
nearly all the women in Korea

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.780
were illiterate.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.110
In my mind, I was
thinking, why is it

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:04.560
that the poor, old, Korean
woman likes to dance?

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.680
Why is that?

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.620
Perhaps, despite all
the constrictions

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:14.090
of a nation geographically
bound by superpowers

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.470
and culturally bound
by ancient precepts,

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:21.590
and despite all the
difficulties of a people who've

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.600
been scattered around the
globe, Koreans from many corners

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.890
like to dance
because we are human,

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:35.250
and our physical bodies
crave expression.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:40.300
Even with the fear of censure,
and the fear of shame,

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:46.060
and the fear of exclusion, we
will express ourselves fully,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.942
even if it is for
just one dance.

00:45:48.942 --> 00:45:53.110
And we will do it with rhythm.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.700
More than our spectacular
accomplishments

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.900
or our catastrophic
failures, perhaps

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.870
it is our daily bodies, our
yearnings, our very weakness,

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:11.330
and our wish for expression
that makes us human.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:15.310
And I hope that is what
I will carry with me as I

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:18.499
continue to write about us.

00:46:18.499 --> 00:46:19.996
Thank you.

00:46:19.996 --> 00:46:23.489
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:41.135 --> 00:46:42.510
I'm so glad you're
here, Jeannie.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.630
[LAUGHS]

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.130
- I'm so glad I'm here too.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:48.830
- It's scary being up there.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.050
- So it's really amazing.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.630
I've often said to
Min Jin that I really

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.550
feel like we were twins
separated at birth because we

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.050
have--

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.466
- Well, your mom
and dad are here.

00:46:58.466 --> 00:47:01.806
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:01.806 --> 00:47:03.680
- There are so
many things that we

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.910
have had in common, including
the hometown of Wonsan

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.690
and many, many things.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.290
And I want to say,
first of all, I

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:17.240
am amazed that you're
writing about hagwon.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.790
It's kind of one of these shady
secrets that Koreans have.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:24.230
- I like hagwons.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:25.850
- Yeah.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.430
And I will come out and
say for the first time,

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:31.940
in front of a public
audience, I attended hagwon

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:37.040
when I was five years old and
going forward until probably--

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.770
- Your mom was just trying
to show her support.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:40.270
- Yeah.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.470
But in the American
culture in which

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:51.380
we operate, this idea, this
ethnically inflected, private,

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.870
after school venues
in which Asians

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:02.900
go to do more than what they
do in school, and probably

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.650
in these windowless
rooms, in basements,

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:12.720
so that they can pass
these standardized tests

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.580
and, in fact, score as
well as they possibly can,

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.230
there is something
very, I think,

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:22.735
stigmatized in our culture
about that phenomenon.

00:48:22.735 --> 00:48:23.780
- In Western culture.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.280
- Yeah.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.732
- In Korea, it's really normal.

00:48:25.732 --> 00:48:26.940
If you didn't send your kid--

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:27.790
- It's very normal.

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.460
- --to hagwon,
you'd be a weirdo.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:30.420
- Yeah.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:33.960
But in the United States,
it's not something

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.480
that, even as a person who was
a member of an elite university,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.790
a faculty member or
a student, it's not

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.330
something you openly bandy about
as something you're proud of.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:45.870
- Oh.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.030
- And I just think that
it's really amazing that

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:51.240
you're writing about this
because we need to know more

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.330
about what is up
with these hagwon,

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.890
and how do they fit into
our Korean-American,

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:03.570
Asian-American, and just
American educational landscape.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.570
What do they mean?

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.230
What are they about?

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.930
What is the stigma around them?

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:15.870
And what is it that makes them
just kind of vexing phenomena?

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:18.270
- Well, I actually like hagwons.

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.561
And the more I study them,
the more I like them.

00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:22.560
And it's kind of curious
because you would think

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.030
that I would dislike them.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.860
But I've met so
many people who've

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.630
gone to hagwons all their lives.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.260
And now I realized, it's
not just for studying.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.641
It's actually almost
like a community center.

00:49:33.641 --> 00:49:34.140
- For sure.

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.930
- It also serves as
a daycare function,

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.390
which is really important
to recognize for working

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.340
women and working men.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.380
So when I was just
recently in Los Angeles,

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.542
I went to this entire area where
you have all these strip malls.

00:49:46.542 --> 00:49:48.000
And then you have,
like, let's say,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.950
the pizza store, the drugstore.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.900
And you'll have this
weird looking building,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.000
and it'll have kind of
blacked out windows,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.370
with children looking sort
of happy, but I don't know.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:01.310
And there'll be all
these buses in the front.

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:03.030
And it turns out
that these buses

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.770
pick up the children after
school and bring them back in.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:10.890
And the kids stay at these
hagwons from 3 o'clock

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.940
until, let's say, 6:30 until
their parents pick them up.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.270
And the parents pay
about $300 a month.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:21.750
And that means that if
the parent is working

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.840
when the school is off, for
a public school especially,

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.800
well, what's a
working parent to do?

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.880
And we know that in this
country, we don't have daycare.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.930
So I was actually
quite happy with it.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.770
And these kids were not studying
a lot, especially the ones

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:35.711
in LA.

00:50:35.711 --> 00:50:36.210
I mean--

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:37.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.150
They were not studying.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:41.072
They were, you know, chatting.

00:50:41.072 --> 00:50:42.780
- I, too, used to play
hooky from hagwon.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.471
- Right.

00:50:43.471 --> 00:50:43.970
right.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.200
Yeah, I met some really
impressive people in London

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.460
when I was doing fieldwork.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.560
And I said, so did
you go to hagwon?

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.710
And this seemed like a
very attractive Korean man.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.070
He's like, in this 30s.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.362
You would hire him in a minute.

00:50:54.362 --> 00:50:55.861
And I said, so did
you go to hagwon?

00:50:55.861 --> 00:50:56.920
He was like, yeah.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.170
And I said, did you like them?

00:50:58.170 --> 00:50:59.253
He was like, I loved them.

00:50:59.253 --> 00:51:01.320
And I said, why?

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.020
And he said, well, because
on Wednesdays and Thursdays,

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.144
I would play hooky, and I
would see all my friends.

00:51:07.144 --> 00:51:09.060
And we would go to
PCBang's, and we would just

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.730
basically play video
games and eat [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.580
And I was like, OK, I get it.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.770
And it turned out the
teachers would sort of

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.470
turn a blind eye
because they knew

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.461
that these kids needed a break.

00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:22.960
And then I realized,
like, no, these

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.320
are very human institutions.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.700
So we have all this data, like
oh, kids study 18 hours a day.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.760
And some kids are studying
18 hours a day, absolutely.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.880
But for the most part,
there's a lot of hooky.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:41.560
- I wanted to return to
two different statements

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.460
that you made that juxtaposed
next to each other,

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.070
I just thought maybe
would be revealing.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.260
One was that you said
that reality corrects

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.320
my preconceptions,
that as you learn more,

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.550
you have these preconceived
ideas, they change as a result.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.300
- Right.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.700
- The other is
the idea that when

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.920
you describe the research
that you've been doing

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.420
and the findings, some of
which you shared with us today,

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:15.126
they are alarming, possibly to
you and possibly to the people

00:52:15.126 --> 00:52:16.250
who are hearing about them.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.160
Certainly, some of
them alarmed me.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:19.835
- Yeah.

00:52:19.835 --> 00:52:22.750
No, the Western audience,
like, that's crazy.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:23.830
These people are crazy.

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.960
They often say things like,
these people are crazy.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.490
And then I kind of
think, actually,

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.698
if you spent, like, six
hours with them, you wouldn't

00:52:29.698 --> 00:52:31.040
think that they're crazy.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.750
- Yeah, so what is this
relationship between feeling

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:38.970
like your preconceptions are
changed by more reality, more,

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.860
let's say, field work, more
talking to these people,

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.270
and really learning about
what motivates them,

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:49.980
and the idea that what is
happening as you do learn more

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.350
is that things get
even more alarming,

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:57.960
and that they are even more
surprising, and possibly

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.581
less reassuring?

00:52:59.581 --> 00:53:00.080
- Yes.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.970
I did have this one thing where
I interviewed a really, really

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.220
fancy hagwon tutor.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.230
And she teaches SATs.

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:08.310
And she's very private.

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.330
And I talked to her.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:13.170
And she worked--
she went to Harvard.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.852
And she worked at Goldman Sachs.

00:53:15.852 --> 00:53:18.599
[LAUGHS]

00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:20.140
And then now, she's
a hagwon teacher,

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.910
and she makes a lot of dough.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:22.970
And I was talking to her.

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:23.710
I liked her.

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:25.550
She was really kind
of cool and fun.

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:27.640
And if I needed a kid--

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.844
if I had a kid who
needed SAT tutoring,

00:53:29.844 --> 00:53:31.510
I could kind of see
why I would hire her

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:33.190
because she just
seemed really relatable

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:34.930
and kind of no nonsense.

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:36.820
But at the same time,
I'm kind of thinking,

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.490
you went to Harvard, and you're
working at Goldman Sachs.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:40.780
And she had a baby.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.270
And I said, so did you send
your daughter to hagwon?

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.280
And she said, yes.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.520
And because I had the data
point already that 85%

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.546
of four-year-olds in South Korea
start hagwons, I was like--

00:53:51.546 --> 00:53:52.170
I kind of knew.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:54.005
I was like, maybe
four, maybe five.

00:53:54.005 --> 00:53:55.630
But then again, she's
a hagwon teacher.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:58.812
Maybe she's kind of
like, I'm so above this.

00:53:58.812 --> 00:54:00.520
I said, when did you
start your daughter?

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.725
She said, age two.

00:54:03.725 --> 00:54:04.600
And I was like, damn.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:07.520
Seriously?

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.790
And of course, I try to
be a good ethnographer.

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:15.280
And I said, for what?

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.080
And she said, well,
she was trying

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.310
to get into a pre-school.

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:20.226
It was really hard to
get into this preschool,

00:54:20.226 --> 00:54:23.890
so she had private consulting.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:24.910
And I said, OK.

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.020
So like, this is a
situation where I'm alarmed,

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.770
because I'm kind of thinking,
you have your shit together.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:31.390
Why would you need this?

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:33.970
And she doesn't need daycare
because she has money.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.496
But she said it's
because she had

00:54:35.496 --> 00:54:37.120
to get into a certain
kind of preschool

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.536
because this
preschool is a feeder

00:54:38.536 --> 00:54:40.430
for a certain kindergarten.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:43.390
And so she had a
[INAUDIBLE] of a consultant

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:45.340
who knew about this school.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.960
And it was like $60 a thing.

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.810
And I said, so what did they do?

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:53.010
And she said, well, you'll
have, let's say, a pizza,

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:54.250
kind of like a wooden pizza.

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.080
And you cut out little
sections, and you

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.220
learn about percentages.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.740
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.897
And also how to hold
a writing implement,

00:55:02.897 --> 00:55:05.230
that was apparently something
that people get tested on.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.612
But again, if you hung out
with her, you'd like her.

00:55:11.612 --> 00:55:13.820
This is the thing I really
want to make as a defense.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.660
Because we have this tendency
to say, that's crazy.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.980
Why would you do that?

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.396
But you hang out
with them, you're

00:55:20.396 --> 00:55:22.700
going like, yeah, I guess
I could kind of see that.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:26.390
- Well, this process
of moving from empathy

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.020
to a real sense of
alienation, like,

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.630
I can't possibly
imagine why someone

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.970
would do that, that must be
a really interesting process

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:39.080
for you as a writer who, I
think throughout your talk,

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:47.690
you occupied both the position
of speaking of Koreans as them

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.920
and also representing an us.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.420
- Us.

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.380
Yes.

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:55.490
- And of course, you are also
working across national divides

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.830
like the Koreans in
the United States

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.620
and other nations,
diaspora Koreans,

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.020
versus the ones in Korea.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.360
And there is a very--

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.559
for lots of people,
a very stark divide.

00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:09.850
- LA Koreans are so different--

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:10.510
- LA Koreans versus
New York Koreans.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:11.593
- --than New York Koreans.

00:56:11.593 --> 00:56:13.430
Oh, my goodness, it's
like different gangs.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.770
- And the kind of
Koreans who get

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:19.340
into schools like
Harvard University

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:23.510
and their perceptions
of the kinds of Koreans

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:28.340
who don't have what it
takes to get here or we

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:32.270
don't really work hard, but
we don't have the special--

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:35.630
you don't have the special
creativity and the innovation

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:39.680
that Harvard University looks
for in its selection process.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.080
I think there's so many
different kinds of us

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.107
and them processes
going on within the--

00:56:45.107 --> 00:56:46.190
- Here's a generalization.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:47.930
Korean-Canadians, very nice.

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:50.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:54.320
Never met a Korean-Canadian
I didn't like.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.308
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:00.560
- I know.

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.120
So one of the things that I--

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.440
I didn't realize until in
the middle of your talk.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.760
When I saw the title,
Are Koreans Human?

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.500
And I think you told me
that some people said, wow,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.900
are you getting
pushback because it

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.140
sounds like you're suggesting
they might not be human?

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:18.650
And--

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:20.630
- We are.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:23.090
- Right, whereas I read
it totally differently

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:25.830
in that I thought you meant
like, are we superhuman?

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:26.570
- Right.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:27.970
- Not like are we subhuman.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:29.570
- You are.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:30.620
- No, no.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.470
But that's how I read
this title, especially

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.430
in light of the
idea of superpowers.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.960
And of course, now I understand
that part of what you're saying

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:44.300
is how flanked both the
Korean nation and the culture

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:48.130
have been by geopolitical
superpowers and how--

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:49.090
- Which makes Korea--

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:49.460
right.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.900
Which makes Koreans
feel like they

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:54.380
have to kind of be a superpower
in order to deal with the fact

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.270
that, for thousands
of years, you've

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:59.120
had these superpowers
constantly in their face.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:03.050
- Right, despite the name
for the country, which

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:09.860
was the Hermit Kingdom, the idea
that we are so separate that we

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.950
don't mix well with others.

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.200
- You and I mix well.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.930
- Now, we do.

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:20.680
And it's also one of the--

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.900
hearing you talk about your
almost mute childhood--

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.700
- Mm-hmm.

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.920
This can be confirmed
by my family.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.560
I didn't really start talking
until almost middle school.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.020
- I believe that because
that was the same for me.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:33.860
- Right.

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.500
We had rich interior lives.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:40.250
- The idea that I'm here
speaking with you to hundreds

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.490
of people, that's insane.

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:43.520
- Right.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.280
- Given the way I grew up and
the way I thought of myself.

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.770
- This is actually
virtual reality.

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:50.150
- Yeah, it can't be real.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:52.940
But yeah, I mean, how do you--

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:57.720
and is that something
about Koreans that--

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.220
- Sure.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:02.081
- Because that's how I always
thought about that muteness.

00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:03.580
- But I think a
part of it's Korean.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.296
But I have two
sisters, and so do you,

00:59:05.296 --> 00:59:07.170
because we were basically
separated at birth.

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:08.670
- Right.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.430
- And both my sisters,
all three of us

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.230
didn't speak any English
when we came to this country.

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.750
- Same.

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:13.250
- Right?

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:15.050
But my older sister
and my younger sister,

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:18.320
who I'm going to embarrass right
now, they're wildly popular.

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.060
And they picked up
English immediately.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:20.899
They had friends.

00:59:20.899 --> 00:59:22.940
They got tracked into the
smart class right away.

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.790
I was in a dumb
class for two years.

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:29.540
That's what they literally
called it at PS 102.

00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.280
And I just kind
of always thought

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.526
that I would have been
tempted to say it's

00:59:33.526 --> 00:59:34.775
a Korean thing for my silence.

00:59:34.775 --> 00:59:39.840
But because I had evidence in my
house that I was just a loser,

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.060
that it was very--

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.091
I knew that it was me.

00:59:45.091 --> 00:59:46.340
I knew that some of it was me.

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.890
So part of it's a fact
that, of course, in Korean--

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:50.720
if you look at
Korean fairy tales

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.410
or folktales, the fact the girls
speaking is not necessarily

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:55.880
a virtue.

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.340
The big virtue for Korean
girls is sacrifice.

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.950
[SNORES]

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.285
Endless fucking sacrifice.

01:00:02.285 --> 01:00:05.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.900
So I really don't like that.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.090
But I got it.

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.530
I mean, we get the
message, right?

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.738
We get the message that
you're supposed to sacrifice,

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:12.990
you're supposed to suffer.

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:16.300
However, as a child, I
think there was something--

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.480
I had something.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.232
I don't know what it is.

01:00:19.232 --> 01:00:20.690
- But what about
this juxtaposition

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:28.450
between the extremity of
the educational imperative

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:31.960
and the extremely high
rates of plastic surgery?

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.867
You mentioned this.

01:00:33.867 --> 01:00:34.825
Is there some relation?

01:00:34.825 --> 01:00:36.550
- Of course.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:42.700
- How do you think about both of
those sometimes alarming facts?

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.577
- Well, in Korea--

01:00:44.577 --> 01:00:46.660
I wrote an article about
this for The Chosun Ilbo,

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.550
and I got death threats.

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:52.960
Because I said that plastic
surgery is an option.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.340
I am not against it.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.260
If you want to get
it, that's fine.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.370
I'm 50.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:00.340
I've thought about it.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.460
Now, having said that,
what I wrote in my article

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.130
for The Chosun
Ilbo was that it's

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:10.790
something-- it's not really
consent technically if you

01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.410
make your child get it.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:13.790
Because you're a child.

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.862
So if you tell your
child, you are ugly,

01:01:15.862 --> 01:01:17.570
or you tell your child,
there's something

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:19.153
wrong with your
eyes-- so for, example

01:01:19.153 --> 01:01:20.960
my eyes are not desirable.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.180
They're supposed to
have another lid.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.880
So the most common
surgery for Koreans

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.956
is the eye surgery where
you sort of tuck it in.

01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:30.080
And sometimes, it can turn
out great and sometimes,

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.837
not so much.

01:01:31.837 --> 01:01:33.920
I had a friend of mine who
had her nose done twice

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.480
because it moved.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.010
And that was kind of a drag.

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.370
And her parents made her do it.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.670
Her parents literally--
her dad was a psychiatrist.

01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:43.310
And he actually said, there's
something wrong with your nose.

01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.460
We have to fix it.

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.040
So they put a bridge in there.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.800
And I kind of thought, you
know, if your father told you

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.620
that you're ugly, or
that your nose is ugly,

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.140
that's not consent.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.170
Right?

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:55.370
I mean, it's like trauma.

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:59.231
So it is absolutely kind of
a psychological terrorism.

01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:01.730
So I kind of wrote this, saying
that if you wanted to get it

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:04.730
as an adult, it's absolutely
fine, but as a child,

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:06.380
I had these reservations.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.100
Death threats.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.530
- Death threats from--

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.212
- The comment boxes.

01:02:11.212 --> 01:02:12.920
Like, die, bitch, and
that kind of stuff.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.539
- From the side of
people who are--

01:02:14.539 --> 01:02:15.830
- That's a death threat, right?

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:17.060
- People who want--

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.372
people who want to be more
supportive of plastic surgery?

01:02:20.372 --> 01:02:22.205
- I think they're plastic
surgeons, frankly.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:25.020
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:25.780
I do.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.260
I mean, it's a billion
dollar industry.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.510
It makes a ton of money.

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:31.630
And I'm like-- and I
wasn't saying don't do it.

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:33.730
I just said, if
kids are doing it,

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:36.490
and if parents are saying
you need to change,

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:38.230
that's a different
thing altogether.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.780
And I think I was kind of
making a legal argument.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.605
Having said that, the
thing with plastic surgery

01:02:43.605 --> 01:02:44.980
is that if you go
to South Korea,

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.930
people don't really think
of it as necessarily

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.637
moral or immoral.

01:02:48.637 --> 01:02:50.970
They don't even think that
they're trying to be Western.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.010
- I they think of it
like we think of braces.

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:53.510
- Right.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:54.970
- That is how I experience it.

01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:55.660
- Exactly.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.610
That's exactly what
they think of it.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:57.640
- I think that is
how they think of it.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.290
- They think of it as a
competitive advantage.

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:00.710
And I totally understand that.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.929
And actually, the US is
kind of following Asia.

01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:04.720
Now, I don't know if
you want to know this.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.840
But LinkedIn, you put
your photograph up there.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.770
It used to be--

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:12.920
I mean, in Korea, right now,
if you want to get a job,

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:17.040
you had to put a photograph on
the folder of your application.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.700
So your looks are
absolutely part of the.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.780
Application

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.490
So I think Korean
parents are kind

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:24.680
of thinking-- even
though I just, right now,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.700
kind of indicted them,
let me defend them now.

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.550
They're kind of saying, well, I
want my kids to be competitive.

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:32.791
I want to be competitive.

01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:33.290
Right?

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.927
So if you are an older man,
and you want to keep a job,

01:03:35.927 --> 01:03:38.510
and you're being discriminated
against for age discrimination,

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:42.614
and you want to dye
your hair, fair game.

01:03:42.614 --> 01:03:44.030
You're trying to
pay the mortgage.

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:45.220
I get it.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:45.800
Right?

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.841
So if you're trying to
get a job, and you decide,

01:03:47.841 --> 01:03:48.440
you know what?

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.610
They prefer to have
bigger eyes, bigger eyes.

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:53.280
Let's do it.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.590
It costs, like, $2,000.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:55.700
Let's go.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.310
So in that sense, I think
they're not thinking,

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:02.325
oh, it's because I want to
look like Gwyneth Paltrow.

01:04:02.325 --> 01:04:03.700
Because that's
often the argument

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.720
that's given in the US.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.744
And I totally understand
their argument.

01:04:06.744 --> 01:04:08.410
But for Koreans that
are kind of saying,

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:11.516
you know, I would just like
to be more competitive,

01:04:11.516 --> 01:04:13.390
I would like to get a
better looking partner,

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:14.764
I would like to
get a better job,

01:04:14.764 --> 01:04:19.310
if better looks is what you
want, I'll give it to you.

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.430
- So hagwon and then
to the plastic surgery,

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:23.904
- Sure, yeah.

01:04:23.904 --> 01:04:25.570
- I think we're going
to have a couple--

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.310
we have some time for questions.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.350
How much time do we have?

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:30.220
About 15 minutes.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.700
So it would be great if
you could walk to the mic

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.980
when you have your question?

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.990
And we'll take you one by one.

01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.990
- Hi, Min.

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.550
It's Ani Patel.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.050
So I was at Brown University.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.830
And they had these
mugs in the bookstore

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.590
with great first
lines of novels.

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:51.370
And I thought,
"History has failed us,

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.780
but no matter"
belonged on there.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.950
That's such a great first line.

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:54.490
- Thank you.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.650
- Can you just tell us
more about that line

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:59.920
and where it came from, and what
the bigger meaning of that line

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.900
was for you in the
context of that novel,

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.270
how it became the thesis
statement, so to speak?

01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:05.020
- Thank you, Ani.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.030
So each of my works,
the first line

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:09.200
serves as a thesis statement.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.250
So even my American Hagwon,
I have my thesis statement.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.140
I may actually make
a release right now.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.820
But to answer your
question, "history

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.710
has failed us, but
no matter," I am

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:21.370
arguing that history has
failed almost everybody.

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:24.520
Because in order for history to
work, in order for historians

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.290
to chronicle the
lives of people,

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.220
they need to have primary
documents and artifacts.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.180
And if they cannot, they
cannot record that history.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.210
So it's not that the
historians don't care.

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:36.100
As a matter of fact,
I'm always arguing,

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.112
because I've interviewed
so many historians,

01:05:38.112 --> 01:05:39.820
they're among the most
enlightened people

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.980
that you can find in the field.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.020
However, they can only
work with what they have

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.900
because they have to
go based on evidence.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.010
That said, most of us
in the whole wide world,

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:53.230
are not important enough
to leave documents

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:55.900
or to have our lives
recorded in real time.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.580
And therefore,
how is a historian

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.940
supposed to think about us,
those of us who are illiterate,

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.280
those of us who
are less powerful,

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.130
those of us who don't have
powerful connections or money?

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:09.417
So I'm saying that history
has failed us, all of us,

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:10.000
in that sense.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.150
And also for us to be
missing that history

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:15.940
is a loss for
everybody, not just

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.560
for those who weren't recorded.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.030
So that was my thesis.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.910
But I'm also saying,
"but no matter."

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:24.700
And I'm saying it as
a matter of defiance,

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.890
because even though
people are not

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:29.440
recorded, even though the
important people don't care

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.830
about us, we still persist.

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:34.720
We still try to
fight for our lives,

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.090
and our lives matter intensely.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.019
So I'm arguing that.

01:06:38.019 --> 01:06:38.810
- That's beautiful.

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:39.530
- So thank you.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:40.238
- Thank you, Min.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.980
- Hi.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.180
My name is [INAUDIBLE] Lee.

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.790
I'm at the Graduate
School of Education.

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:49.840
And--

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.930
- I just spoke there.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:51.430
- Oh.

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:52.120
- With Roberto.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.110
Roberto, are you here?

01:06:55.768 --> 01:06:57.790
- This is for the
immigration class.

01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:00.100
OK, anyways.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.600
And I was actually a
teacher at [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.325
I was a English native
teacher at a public school

01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:05.950
in [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:09.250
And I am so interested
that you're now

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:13.090
doing this on American hagwons,
because I clearly remember--

01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:16.540
I was teaching fourth grade--
a girl comes into my class,

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.950
and she's crying.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.810
And I stop her
before she enters.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.449
I'm just like, what's wrong?

01:07:21.449 --> 01:07:22.240
Why are you crying?

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.480
And she said, I got
a 90 on my test.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.342
And I was like, OK, well,
you know, are you OK?

01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:29.800
Are you worried
about your parents?

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.633
Are you worried about
your homeroom teacher?

01:07:31.633 --> 01:07:34.450
And she goes, no, I'm worried
about what my hagwon teacher is

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.220
going to say.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.240
And I'm worried about
the consequences

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.890
of getting a 90 on my test.

01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:41.230
And I think seeing
the prevalence

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:44.350
of the hagwon culture, not
only in America, where--

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:45.670
I grew up in Queens as well--

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:50.350
but in Korea, I think
it's a powerful thing

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:54.280
to create understanding
of why hagwons exist,

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.530
and why it's so important,
and why it's so prevalent.

01:07:56.530 --> 01:08:00.190
But I'm wondering how do you
balance between understanding

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:03.580
the darkness and the
unintended consequences

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.490
and the negative impact
it has on these kids,

01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:11.020
particularly because the
suicide rate is so high?

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.280
I'm wondering, how have you
seen in your research push

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.490
for change, a push for
change to stay away

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:21.700
and to strive away
from the hagwons,

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:25.060
while building
understanding of why that

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.010
exists in the Korean culture?

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:31.850
- Well, I'm going to say
something really controversial

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:32.930
right now.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:38.670
So if you believe in organized
sports, like football--

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.645
- Sure.

01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:41.720
- Like, if you
enjoy football, you

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.130
are witnessing the
destruction of young men.

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.750
That's what we're doing.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:51.330
I hope all of you guys
don't leave right now.

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.330
But every time I
watch a football game,

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.550
I literally think,
as a parent, how

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.960
could we do this to children?

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.479
Because you know, when they
start, like peewee football,

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.560
they're four or five.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.260
So before we start
judging other countries,

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.229
I think it's really important
to really rethink what we

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:10.910
think is OK and what's not OK.

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:14.140
So as for hagwons, I saw
really great things about them.

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.029
And I also totally
agree with you.

01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:18.970
The amount of pressure
that these children face

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:20.569
is absolutely unacceptable.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:23.830
And I do speak out against that.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:26.859
However, I think that to throw
away this entire concept,

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:29.080
to throw away this idea
that you could have daycare

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.529
for working-class
people that's affordable

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:36.010
when the state
doesn't provide it,

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:37.479
I think that's an
elitist argument.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:38.859
I do.

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:42.387
So I agree with you that
when I see these kids suffer,

01:09:42.387 --> 01:09:42.970
it's horrible.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.300
But I've also seen kids
from many other ethnicities

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.240
and countries who get
upset about the 90.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.300
So it's not just pathological
that Asian people

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.890
have this problem.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.940
I've actually seen
this in many groups.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.130
So you're an educator.

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:57.670
You know.

01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:58.630
But I love your question.

01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:59.130
Thank you.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.900
- Hello, my name is [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.220
But I go by JY here.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:06.790
- Jay?

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:07.290
- JY.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.240
- It's JY.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:08.740
That's good.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:09.040
I like it.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.831
- And then I looked at
the hagwon industry,

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:11.920
actually, for a newspaper.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.660
But I'm in the
Divinity School here.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.860
So I'm going to ask
about that instead.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.020
So Presbyterians
are protagonists

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.316
of Pachinko, right?

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.940
And I've heard you
talk in an interview

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.220
that being a Presbyterian
is important for you.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.816
And I'm wondering-- I'm
hoping Presbyterians

01:10:26.816 --> 01:10:28.690
will be protagonists
again in your next book.

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:30.310
I'm guessing probably not.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.550
But even then, I
want to hear you

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:36.460
talk about why Koreans love
being Christian, and then

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.960
especially a Presbyterian.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.405
- Wow, it's JY?

01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:42.770
So JY's question, for those
of you who didn't hear it,

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:46.460
is about my use of Presbyterian
characters, and also the fact

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.140
that, personally, I
am a Presbyterian.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.190
And it's true.

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:51.530
My grandfather is a
Presbyterian minister.

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:57.260
He was a headmaster for an
orphanage school in Busan.

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.890
And he taught orphans
who were repatriated

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:06.230
from Japan who had lost
their parents from Hiroshima

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.000
and Nagasaki.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.400
These were Korean boys
who were sent from Japan

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.540
and went to Busan.

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.520
And my grandfather
was the minister.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.880
So in my experience, my
knowledge of missionaries

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.600
is not just of the vantage
point of a person of color,

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.620
being angry at those who
want to colonize the savages.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.280
That is a point of view that's
absolutely true sometimes.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.380
There's a lot of
evidence for this.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.984
In my experience, I've
also seen missionaries

01:11:33.984 --> 01:11:35.400
do something really
radical, which

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.220
is to teach women how to read.

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.500
The education of
Korean women would not

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.300
have happened without
the introduction

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.590
of Western missionaries.

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:48.407
And I think about that as
a very important value.

01:11:48.407 --> 01:11:50.740
I also think it's important
to recognize that Christians

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.470
have had a very important
civil rights aspect in Korea.

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:56.530
Almost all of the
major protests that

01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:59.590
were conducted in
the history of Korea

01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:01.990
were started by ministers.

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:05.500
So before we start to think
of Christians as being jerks--

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.470
and some Christians
are absolutely jerks.

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:09.070
I know.

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.100
I'm a Christian.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.870
So I talk about that.

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:19.600
And I write because
the money's so good.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.210
No.

01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:25.800
I write because I want to.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.090
I have these questions.

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:30.560
And I have a lot of
questions about God.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.100
God vexes me.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.140
Like, I don't understand
God a lot of times.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.670
That said, I believe God.

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.800
I believe in the
existence of God.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.320
And for all of us who've made
the decision that God does not

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.110
exist, again, we know, all
of us who are enlightened--

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:48.230
there are people that are far
smarter than me in this room

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.910
about this issue--

01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:51.662
you have to make a decision.

01:12:51.662 --> 01:12:53.870
And for me, I've made a
decision that there is a God.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.970
However, I'm confused.

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:59.910
And sometimes, through
drama, I get to figure out

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:01.320
some of my questions.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.690
And the Bible is a work
that is very important to me

01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:04.710
as a source material.

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:06.540
So I write about that.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.780
And we have to
discuss Christianity

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.950
in American hagwon.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:11.682
It will appear.

01:13:11.682 --> 01:13:13.140
Because one of the
strangest things

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.480
about going to all
these hagwons is

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:21.650
that if you go to most hagwons,
they're very Christian-focused.

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:25.370
On the walls, you'll see all
these Bible verses everywhere.

01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:28.660
It doesn't mean that they're
Christian, just that there

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.200
are Christian influences.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.643
Thank you, JY.

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:39.140
- Not made for the
vertically challenged.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.850
Hi, my name is Leah.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.910
I'm originally from Japan.

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:44.900
Was born and raised in Tokyo.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.820
My father is a
Colombian immigrant

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.740
who grew up in Queens.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.700
And my mother is a second
generation Zainichi Korean.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.160
So when I started reading
your book-- admittedly,

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.440
I'm only about a third of
the way through Pachinko--

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.510
- Colombia appears in that book.

01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:00.290
- I'm sorry?

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:02.084
- Colombia appears in the book.

01:14:02.084 --> 01:14:03.500
- I'm excited to
get to that part.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.041
I'm sorry I haven't
gotten there yet.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.720
- I'm excited for you.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.777
- So one of the first things
I thought about three pages in

01:14:09.777 --> 01:14:11.360
was, like, the people
who need to read

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.580
this are Japanese people.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:17.900
This should be one of
the main audiences who

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.420
don't see Koreans as human.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.870
I feel like them being able to
kind of experience this book

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:26.210
and relate to characters
that they may not

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:29.240
see as someone that's
relatable to them,

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.042
I think that's really important.

01:14:31.042 --> 01:14:32.750
So I looked for a
Japanese copy because I

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.370
wanted my mother to read it.

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.770
And I found that there
is not a Japanese copy.

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:38.900
There's not a Japanese
translation of Pachinko.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.800
- Not yet.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.430
- Not yet.

01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:44.660
- So it's been purchased by
27 territories, I think, now.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:47.000
So it's going to come
out by Bungeishunju.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.857
And apparently,
it's in the works.

01:14:48.857 --> 01:14:49.440
- Interesting.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.530
OK, so that was one of
my first questions was,

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:53.390
was that in the works, and can
I help you make that happen.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.490
- But most Zainichi Koreans
have been reading it in Korean,

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:56.570
and that's already out.

01:14:56.570 --> 01:15:01.190
And that's by a publisher
called Munhak [KOREAN]..

01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:03.165
- So I think--

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.540
yeah, so my original question
was, was that in the works.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.370
It's great to know that it is.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:11.780
But what do you think
is the main message

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:16.700
that Japanese, non-Zainichi
Koreans, but Japanese folks,

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.860
what message should they be
getting from your lectures,

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:23.630
your works of writing?

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:27.290
How can we bridge that gap
between Japanese and Zainichi

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.090
Koreans through
fictional writing?

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.415
- Oh, Leah.

01:15:32.415 --> 01:15:35.684
[LAUGHS] I like your question.

01:15:35.684 --> 01:15:37.850
I think it's an important
question because I believe

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:39.830
in reconciliation and reunion.

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:40.955
With all my heart, I do.

01:15:40.955 --> 01:15:42.830
And I believe that the
only way we can really

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.290
think about other people
is through empathy,

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:47.040
and that's hard to do.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.270
And one of the things that I
really hasten all of us against

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:53.090
is to tell people what to do.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.410
I encourage.

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:56.540
I try to create drama.

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.540
I hope that you find
yourself in the story.

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:01.500
I sort of joke that my agenda
in life is to make all of you

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.000
Korean.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.275
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:03.275 --> 01:16:05.150
Because I think that if
I can make all of you

01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:08.720
Korean that you would see
that all of us are connected.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.340
But I think that being
didactic doesn't seem to work.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.530
And I think that forgiveness is
a difficult, difficult thing.

01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:17.642
It's difficult for
everybody, especially

01:16:17.642 --> 01:16:19.100
for those of us
who've been injured

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.960
and for those of us who injure.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.960
So again, I'm saying something
that's very "Christian."

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.050
Whether or not people
like that, I don't know.

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:29.320
You know what I mean?

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.710
Because I'm really angry
about a lot of things.

01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:35.530
So sometimes I'm not in
a position to forgive.

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:37.780
I'm still mad.

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.270
But I tend to work it
out through my drama.

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:41.800
But in terms of a
message, I don't

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.560
think I have a message
about the Japanese.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.290
I do think that what
I have tried to do

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:49.540
is to be honest
about the history.

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.640
And that's the reason why
I do so much homework.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.360
I do a lot of homework because,
even though I may start out

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.550
with a position of
an argument, I often

01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:00.520
find that my argument is
wrong in the face of evidence,

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.540
in the face of reality.

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.900
And this goes back to the
question of reality corrects

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.490
preconception.

01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:08.170
There are many
Japanese people who

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:11.830
are suffering in Japan
today because Japan

01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:16.700
has a myth of being a monolithic
nation, which it is not.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.730
As you know.

01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:19.440
- I am proof of that.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.870
- And you're proof of that.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.550
My husband is half Japanese.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.140
My son is a quarter Japanese.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:27.350
So clearly, I think it
would be preposterous

01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:30.680
for us to think that
Japanese people are evil.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.350
It's almost like saying that
anybody is evil if they've had

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:35.190
any kind of colonial history.

01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:36.305
And that's silly.

01:17:36.305 --> 01:17:38.720
But what I do think is
evil-- because I believe

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.710
in the existence of evil-- is
dishonesty about one's history.

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:46.400
So I think that if we are
honest about history, then

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.457
we can begin to
consider reconciliation.

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:52.540
- Thank you for your work.

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.850
I look forward to reading
it in Japanese too.

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:56.380
- Thank you.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.475
- Hi, I'm Jen.

01:17:57.475 --> 01:17:59.080
Hi, Professor Gersen.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.430
- Hi.

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:01.620
- Isn't she the greatest?

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:02.119
- Yeah.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.050
I had a couple of questions.

01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:09.040
The first one is, if you
have watched Sky Castle yet?

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:09.800
- Yes.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.480
- OK.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.600
I felt like--

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.530
- It's a K-drama.

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:13.610
- Yeah.

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.680
- You would have liked it.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.260
And my other question is, who do
you think you're speaking for?

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:23.800
Because your past
two novels have

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.040
been about Korean immigrants
and Korean-Americans.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.090
And the issues you just
spoke of now during this talk

01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:33.880
are, you know, plastic
surgery and hagwons, which

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.610
are very Korean Korean things.

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:41.140
So I was wondering, do you
have an internal, I guess,

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:41.950
perspective?

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:45.940
Or have you drawn a line
about whether you're

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:50.860
speaking about Korean-Americans
or Koreans, the people who

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.610
live in Korea?

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:53.240
- It's Jen?

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.350
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:57.600
- So I don't think
I speak for anybody.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:58.520
I don't.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.360
And I wouldn't take that on.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.510
That said, I think people think
I speak for a lot of people.

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:05.430
And all people of
color, all women,

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:08.310
tend to have the burden
of representation,

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.350
which I think is kind of heavy.

01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:13.260
I find it to be
a kind of a drag.

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.210
And I was just sort
of kidding earlier,

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:16.830
but I work on speculation.

01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:18.430
So I work on spec.

01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:21.400
And that means, literally,
that I don't have a contract.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.600
So when I write
fiction, I write it.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.460
And if the publisher
wants it, they buy it.

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.530
If they don't want to buy it--

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.480
and I know very well--

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.190
they say, no, thank you.

01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:34.480
I've had a lot of no thank yous.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.280
So I write it for me.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.090
And I write it--

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:38.290
actually, my sister is here.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:39.480
My sister Sang is here.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.790
And people often ask, who do you
think of as your ideal reader?

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:45.100
And I always say Sang because
Sang thinks I'm great.

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.189
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:50.230
It's really helpful to
have somebody in your life

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:52.230
who thinks you're great.

01:19:52.230 --> 01:19:53.230
And she likes my work.

01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:56.140
My older sister, she always
reads everything I write.

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.670
Very helpful.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:00.820
So I don't think I even
speak for my sisters.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:01.900
Does that make sense?

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.520
But I do think of
an ideal reader

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.650
who loves me and thinks that my
thoughts might have some value.

01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:12.160
Because Jen, you know,
you know that the world

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:17.030
isn't waiting for women
of color to start talking.

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.780
So we have to decide,
maybe we'll say something,

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.900
maybe they'll hear us, maybe
they'll come on a snowy day.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.360
I can't believe it.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360
But they did.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.070
So I encourage you to speak.

01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:32.360
And I wouldn't say that
you're speaking for me.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.764
But I would say that when you
do speak, it gives me courage.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.430
- Hello, my name is Sun.

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:47.320
And I'm from South Korea.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.150
And I love to dance,
so you were right.

01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:50.736
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:50.736 --> 01:20:51.610
- I didn't hear that.

01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:54.880
- I said, I'm from South Korea,
and I love to dance as well.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.380
- Oh.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.914
[CLAPS]

01:20:57.914 --> 01:20:58.830
- So you were correct.

01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:01.280
- By the way, I
actually asked my son.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.851
I said, OK, I think I should
do some sort of, like, dance

01:21:03.851 --> 01:21:04.350
gesture.

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:05.110
What should I do?

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:09.420
And he's like-- he looked
really embarrassed for me.

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.460
He goes, you could
do a shoulder roll.

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.920
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.960
So that was my
best shoulder role.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.220
- So I resonate with
your story in some ways

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.060
because I also came when I was
young to the United States,

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.770
at 16 years old.

01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:29.370
And I stayed here
since and studying.

01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:32.430
And now, I'm at grad school and
thinking more about my career.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:35.769
And I do see myself going back
to Korea at some point and--

01:21:35.769 --> 01:21:36.810
- Have you done [KOREAN]?

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.810
- For a career.

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:42.470
But maybe for [KOREAn] as well.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.310
- OK.

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:45.040
It means military
service, sorry.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.310
- Did you ask if I have gone?

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:47.030
- Yeah, have you gone?

01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.740
- I haven't, no.

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.000
- How old are you?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:49.581
- 22.

01:21:49.581 --> 01:21:50.080
- 22.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:50.746
That's adorable.

01:21:50.746 --> 01:21:53.185
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.810
And so as I'm thinking
more about possibility

01:21:58.810 --> 01:22:01.990
of me going back, and as a
social scientist, thinking

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:05.470
about, I will study
about the Korean policies

01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:07.510
and Korean society.

01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:08.890
And you are precise--

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:11.490
and I always have that
this sense of vulnerability

01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:15.550
and that because
I am Korean, but I

01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:17.440
don't know much
about Korean society

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.760
because I've been in the US.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.570
You know?

01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:23.920
And I was wondering if you
also share that component

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.919
of vulnerability in your story?

01:22:25.919 --> 01:22:27.460
Because you are
precisely doing that.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:32.220
You live in US for the
majority of your time,

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:36.490
but you're writing about
Korea and Korean society.

01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:39.490
So I was wondering if you had
that sense of vulnerability

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:44.700
in your work and how you have
navigated that, if you have.

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.000
- I am very vulnerable.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.220
You could hurt my feelings.

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:52.300
That's one of my problems is
that I'm constantly worried,

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.740
and anxious, and insecure.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.840
I have actually used
the verb several times

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.640
today of how I'm afraid.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.560
And actually, that's
actually an adjective.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.730
But I fear.

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:02.800
I worry.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.890
And part of it's
because sometimes people

01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:10.090
try to make me feel inauthentic
because my Korean language

01:23:10.090 --> 01:23:12.160
skills are actually quite poor.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.794
And I used to feel
really bad about it.

01:23:14.794 --> 01:23:16.210
And now, I don't
feel bad about it

01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:18.342
anymore, like, not
even a little bit.

01:23:18.342 --> 01:23:19.967
Like, if you just
try to do that to me,

01:23:19.967 --> 01:23:22.732
I'll just be like, whatever.

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:24.690
And the reason why I'm
saying this is because--

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:25.949
and I'm being a little flip.

01:23:25.949 --> 01:23:27.490
But I'm being a
little flip because I

01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:30.190
want you to have courage for
whatever people try to make

01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.390
you feel inauthentic about.

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:34.060
Because when people try
to make you feel ashamed,

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:36.340
because they may have
expertise and you do not,

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.130
you have to wonder, why
are they doing that.

01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:41.090
That's not encouraging anybody.

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:43.860
And it's certainly not
an educational idea.

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.270
Pedagogically, it's stupid.

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:49.360
So one of the things I want to
encourage you to think about

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.670
is that it's impossible
at the age of 22,

01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:55.060
or even at the age of 50, to
be an expert about everything.

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.676
But I have figured out this.

01:23:56.676 --> 01:23:58.300
There are people in
this room right now

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.360
who know a shit ton more
about Korea than I do.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.290
That's awesome.

01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.690
But the thing that I feel like
I can do better than most people

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:12.360
is that I could feel more
and use that feeling more

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.630
with my craft of fiction.

01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:16.940
And that's my little field.

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.290
And I can try to do
that as well as I can.

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:21.480
I don't know what your field is.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.890
But I feel like when
you do find your field,

01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:29.520
initially, you're going to be
stumbling, but that's normal.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.920
So my son is 21 years old.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.350
And very often, when he
feels like something is not

01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:37.410
going well, I think, well,
is it because it's difficult

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:41.250
or if it's because
it's unfamiliar to you.

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.540
It's a very different thing.

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.881
When you start something,
it's unfamiliar,

01:24:44.881 --> 01:24:46.630
but it doesn't mean
that you're bad at it.

01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:48.300
It just unfamiliar.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.760
But I really encourage
you to find your field.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.110
And if people try to
make you feel ashamed,

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:55.889
I want you to know that
it's their shame, not yours.

01:24:55.889 --> 01:24:56.867
- Thank you.

01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:02.015
- Hi, I'm Albert again.

01:25:02.015 --> 01:25:02.905
- Albert, what's up?

01:25:02.905 --> 01:25:03.985
- Good to see you.

01:25:03.985 --> 01:25:06.250
- [LAUGHS]

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:10.150
- So I'm a second semester
senior and a lot of my thoughts

01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:12.550
recently have been about
my family and my parents.

01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:16.000
And my mother, as we
spoke, she owned a hagwon.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.620
And she spent--

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.310
I don't know-- a lot of time
raising me, educating me,

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:22.060
She spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:27.680
on me, when we didn't have
enough for anything else.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.521
- But you're here.

01:25:28.521 --> 01:25:29.020
- I'm here.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.780
So this is my question.

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:35.260
As I graduate, and from
your experience as a mother,

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:40.030
a daughter,
ethnographer, a writer,

01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:43.120
how do I say thank
you to my mom--

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.100
[AUDIENCE AWS]

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:48.209
--and tell her I
appreciate what she's done?

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:49.000
- I'm going to cry.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.100
Albert, oh!

01:25:56.404 --> 01:25:58.400
- That's so beautiful.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.260
She must be very proud of you.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.340
I think you did that.

01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:25.930
I think you should go tell her.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:28.640
All of your education
was so frickin' great

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.060
that you made an author cry.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.042
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:33.042 --> 01:26:36.024
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.515
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.960
- Hi, Min Jin.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.240
My name is Charlie.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:45.790
- Charlie?

01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:46.289
- Yeah.

01:26:46.289 --> 01:26:47.020
- What's up?

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.076
- What's up?

01:26:49.076 --> 01:26:50.200
So I grew up in New Jersey.

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.010
I immigrated from
Korea in fourth grade,

01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:56.970
grew up in New Jersey
as my family came--

01:26:56.970 --> 01:26:58.510
- Where in Jersey?

01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:59.560
- Bergen County.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.059
- That's the promised land.

01:27:01.059 --> 01:27:01.850
- That's-- that's--

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:03.871
- No, I mean, if
you're a good Korean,

01:27:03.871 --> 01:27:04.870
you go to Bergen County.

01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:05.930
- Yeah.

01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:07.795
- No, my parents, we
were all in Queens.

01:27:07.795 --> 01:27:10.740
And then they made enough money,
and they went to Bergen County.

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.340
- Yeah.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.050
Yeah, so I actually
grew up in hagwons.

01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:17.170
And yeah, I had a ton of fun.

01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:19.266
I was one of those
kids who just--

01:27:19.266 --> 01:27:21.640
so they wouldn't let you leave
until you, like, memorized

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.300
200 vocab words a day.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:23.800
- Yeah.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.390
- But it was pretty fun
because I had my first--

01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:26.556
- I have a quiz if you want.

01:27:26.556 --> 01:27:29.410
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:34.390
- So my question is, I realize
you're a person filled.

01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:38.380
I guess, you have
a surplus of jeong.

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.240
And how do you explain that
to non-Koreans or Americans?

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.410
Because sometimes I feel like
I also have a lot of jeong.

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:51.110
A lot of people, I can't
really express what

01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:53.420
that jeong is to other people.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:58.170
So how do you kind of explain
that concept to others?

01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:00.712
- Tell them you love them.

01:28:00.712 --> 01:28:03.490
That's really what it is, right?

01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:04.450
It's a kind of love.

01:28:04.450 --> 01:28:06.880
It's a very complicated
and beautiful kind of love

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.964
that you have through hardship
and through experience.

01:28:09.964 --> 01:28:10.630
And it's a bond.

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:12.280
Because it's not just affection.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.261
It's also a bond and a covenant.

01:28:14.261 --> 01:28:16.510
One of the things that I
think is happening in America

01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:19.960
right now is that we have
so many broken covenants.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.500
Right?

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.874
We have so many social contracts
that are being violated.

01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:25.510
And when people are so
upset, they focus on the fact

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:27.070
that somebody broke a covenant.

01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:30.070
But they forget the
existence of a covenant.

01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:31.500
I expect something from you.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.100
You expect something from me.

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.420
And then we have an exchange.

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:36.430
But we also have a relationship.

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.410
It's also happening
right now in South Korea.

01:28:38.410 --> 01:28:39.790
Because you have--
for example, I

01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:42.010
mentioned the elderly poverty.

01:28:42.010 --> 01:28:44.320
The expectation
of so many parents

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.050
is that if I spend
all this money

01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:50.980
on this child for her education
or his education, then somehow,

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:53.350
this child will take care of me.

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:56.380
But of course, right
now, in South Korea,

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.680
you have greater, greater
delay of employment.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.740
Because after they've
finished going to university,

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.980
the number one preoccupation
of most young Koreans

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.560
is actually to become
a civil servant.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.120
I don't know if you knew that.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.760
And to be a civil servant,
you have to take more exams.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.289
And these exams take a lot
of time, a lot of money,

01:29:17.289 --> 01:29:18.080
and a lot of delay.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.850
And if you get one,
your income is actually

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:24.840
inadequate to
protect your family.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.750
So the child tries, right?

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:31.290
But then the child cannot
take care of his elders.

01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:35.850
And then so you have half of
the elderly in South Korea

01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:38.810
live below the
poverty line, half.

01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:41.100
And I talked to an
economist and a fund manager

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.690
when I was in South
Korea recently

01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:44.190
as part of my fieldwork.

01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.790
So I said, well, so John, why?

01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:51.420
Why is there so much
elderly poverty?

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.110
He said, hagwons.

01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:56.330
If you take that
money of $300 a month,

01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:58.760
starting at the age of
four, you start putting it

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:03.800
into, let's say,
Fidelity, Vanguard,

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.810
some no load mutual fund,
then you might actually

01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:11.150
have an enormous amount
of money by the time

01:30:11.150 --> 01:30:13.170
the child finishes college.

01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:16.490
And his proposition was
actually to not pay for hagwons,

01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:20.270
to take that money, and
give exactly half in cash

01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:21.990
to your kid.

01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:24.740
And I thought, that
kind of makes sense.

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:25.430
- Good idea.

01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:26.277
- Right?

01:30:26.277 --> 01:30:29.260
- Yeah.

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:29.980
Thank you.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.980
Thank you for your time.

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:31.556
- Thank you.

01:30:35.993 --> 01:30:39.150
- And thank you Min
Jin and to Jeannie

01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:41.670
for that wonderful exchange
and that wonderful lecture.

01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:42.270
Thank you.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.620
