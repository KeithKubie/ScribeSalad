This video is sponsored by brilliant.org check the link in the description for a discount on your first subscription. Hey guys

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.460
I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop today

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.130
We're going to be building a desktop version of a seized weapon called a trebuchet this applies to us a pretty basic

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.129
I have here a 1/2 inch thick piece of plywood which is about 2 feet by 2 feet, and this will actually be extra

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.810
We'll have some left over after our build

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.039
We've got some very strong string this will be used in a sling portion of our trebuchet

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.570
I've got a thin metal rod

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.439
Which are going to use as the axle if you don't have any metal rod available you can make this work

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.950
Just fine with a piece of wooden dowel

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.549
I'm using some scraps of leather for the pouch on our sling if you don't have leather any strong cloth will work

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.969
Just as well

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.549
I have an eye bolt a couple of nuts and a stack of washers that will become the counterweight in our trebuchet

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.788
We have an assortment of nuts and washers that will be used to help space our throwing arm in between our two support posts then

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.639
We also have some of these fruit candies, and these are going to be our projectiles

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.979
We'll also use a tiny eye hook and a small brad nail to attach our sling to our launch arm the design for this trebuchet

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.699
Is actually very basic and easy to make from this board we're going to cut four pieces

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.720
There will be a base a launch arm and two side support pieces

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.279
To be cutting out the pieces I do have a jigsaw and a circular saw if you don't have those

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.369
Most any kind of saw will work, but it might take a little longer

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.039
Let's start by measuring and cutting the piece of board that we'll use as the base for our trebuchet now for reasons that will become

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.509
Clear later. Let's make our board just over three and a quarter inches wide

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.400
I promise I have a good reason for it being this width but it's a bit of a surprise

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.820
Music

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.840
Cutting sound

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.760
With the base cut the next step is to cut a one inch strip at least 16 inches long

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.560
My board is about two feet long, so I'll cut my 1 inch strip 24 inches long and then trim it down to 16 inches

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.500
Cutting Sound

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.200
Music

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.860
Cutting sound

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.700
With our base in our launch arm cutout we now need to cut out the two side supports

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.209
These are going to be two triangle-shaped pieces that are tall enough that at 10 and 1/2 inches we can add the axle

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.669
It's not terribly important that you match any particular shape with these supports, but it is good

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.820
If it extends to the left and right of the axle a little bit to add support

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.060
Now all of this will get removed and I'll have to sort of A shaped support pieces

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:53.760
Cutting Sound

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.570
Now with all four of our pieces cut to the right size shape and sanded

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.539
Let's drill holes in the two supports and the swing arm on the swing arm we want the hole to go right through the center

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280
Of the board about four inches from one end

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.700
Drilling sound

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.560
With our two support pieces and our swing arm attached together with our axle we now want to permanently attach our support pieces to our

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.600
Base to make sure we don't crack our base board. Let's pre drill our holes before we add the screws

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:42.040
Drilling Sound

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.320
The basic construction shape of our trebuchet is now assembled

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.579
Let's trim off the axle, so it's not sticking out and good six inches out of the way

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.850
Our throwing arm is now attached in between the support posts

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.790
But you can see that it will easily slide from side to side

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.080
This is where we'll use those nuts and washers to help keep it centered right in the middle

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.880
Hammering

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.140
We've got some nuts and washers on our axle it still spins beautifully

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.630
But now it has no play to either side as a next step

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.799
Let's attach a hook to the back of our throwing arm that we can use to hang our weight from now

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.229
I've driven that I hook almost all the way down the loop is now touching the wood

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.260
To be sure we have a way to attach our weight now

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.799
Let's use a small pair of pliers and try our eye hook open a little bit

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800
So it's more of a hook and less of an eye

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.760
To make sure it's open far enough. Let's see if our large. Eye bolt can fit down into the gap

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.210
Looks like it fits. Just great now to make our weight

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.860
Let's take our eye bolt load it up with washers and add a few nuts on the bottom to hold them all in place

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.420
We now have a nice weight try hanging that on the end of our trebuchet and see what happens if we let go

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.280
Well partly, that's what we wanted to happen I guess we need to close the hook over our loop once

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.479
It's attached before I close that on though I'm looking at the speed of this

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.109
And I think it would be better if we could get it to launch just a little bit

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.720
Faster than that that's not a ton of speed on there

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.809
So I think I want to increase this weight by a little bit these are very small thin nails that are designed to go in

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.140
An electric nail gun, but I'm just gonna use them as a little bit of weight today

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.939
So I'm just going to take several of them put them together and tape them onto our weight that we've already made

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.068
All right that is considerably heavier almost double the weight that I had before

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.799
Let's see if our launch speed seems to have changed at all

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.539
That's a much better swing around I like that way more all right

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.859
Let's attach our weight and then close off our eye hook, so they can't fall off on back

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.399
And boom

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:56.369
Beautiful

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.240
Launches and it doesn't fall off

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.990
The two things we were looking for now we need to add the sling that will connect to the other end of the swing arm

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.989
Let's use our string and the material we're using for our pouch to make the sling before we attach it to the swing arm

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.689
When you're choosing a string for your trebuchet you want to find one that you can't easily break by pulling on it

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.069
Now for our trebuchet to launch the way

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.809
it should one inside of the string should be permanently attached to the swing arm and the other one should come off as

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:41.740
It's swinging through the air

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.549
so let's drill a small hole in the top of our swing arm and tie one end of our string to that and then we'll

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.609
Make a small ring and a little peg coming out of the top

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.029
To make sure that the other string can release when it's supposed to

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.028
Positioning our sling we want the pouch to be at the very end of our track

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:04.469
And then we'll lower the swing arm down, and that's where we know we need to attach it

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.439
Let's just make a mark in our string for how long we want it to be while it's tied around the hole

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.440
To make our hold and release mechanism

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.839
Let's add a small peg at the top of the swing arm made from a very small nail and a little ring on the end

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.410
Of the other string now this nail does not have much of a head

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.880
But we want a smooth peg with no head at all, so let's get a file and take the head off of this

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.689
So it's all smooth the head of our nail has now been completely removed

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.690
It's really just more of a smooth metal stick

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.788
We now need to drive this small Brad nail

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:48.409
Down into the wood until there's only about half an inch maybe a centimeter of it sticking out

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.979
That looks like it should work pretty well now

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.399
Let's use a small washer as the ring to attach to the other side of the string

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.979
This will slip over the peg and should release nicely when our sling is at the top of its arc

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:17.780
We can now see how our trebuchet loads and will launch as the weight pulls it down the pouch will swing up and around

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:24.229
The washer then we'll slide off of the post and it should take our projectile and launch it through the air

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.109
At this point I think we need to do a test run

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.269
I have this small piece of candy which I've sort of smushed into a little bit more of a ball shape this will be our

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:36.199
projectile, we'll load that into the pouch bring it all the way down and

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.750
When I release the pouch this should fire one note about this before I fire it

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.899
Currently the nail at the top of the swing arm is pointed basically straight up the angle of that nail has a lot to do

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:52.999
With at what point the washer will slide off of it, so it's entirely possible that right now with the angle

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.469
It's at it might shoot too straight up or even launch early. Let's find out

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.750
All right first test fire in three two one

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.120
Wow

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.500
Well, it didn't shoot straight up it shot at just about a 45 degree angle

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.329
Which is kind of what we want so it's working pretty. Well. We just need a better launch space

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.649
Guess let's take this outside and see how far it goes now. We let this go in three two one we oh wow

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:24.589
I worked pretty great

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.669
23 23 feet not bad. Let's see if we can do it again

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.310
Firing in three two one

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.540
whoo

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:39.949
Launched one and a half 19 and a half last time 23 this time 19 and a half, so it's not perfectly consistent

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:46.219
But that's still pretty good wonder anyone firing a full-size trebuchet back in the Dark Ages

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.579
Ever said we as they launched it they were missing out on a great opportunity if they didn't

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.089
Working pretty good our trebuchet is launching these candies a good distance

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.220
I think we've shown that the counterweight on the trebuchet is working pretty well, but I also want to try

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.410
Taking this up to another level

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.149
I want it to really launch these things far, and I have a thought for that all right

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.590
That was pretty cool this thing has some pretty good distance on it, but there's a little modification

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:21.290
I want to make I want to add some real power onto this and I guess I could just keep adding more weight

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.290
I think there is a limit. I think it's around

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.660
130 times the weight of the projectile is how much weight you should have on the back for ideal launching

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.259
But I want to see what happens if we add spring power to it

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:33.950
Not just a weight

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:39.740
But something really pulling on the string as hard as it can to add a little bit more power to our trebuchet

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:46.189
We're going to try using a spring loaded rat trap this thing will pull on our trebuchet arm with a ton of power

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.100
Hopefully it doesn't break it, but we should be able to get some incredible distance and maybe some larger projectiles using this

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:05.279
Now to make sure the rat trap is pulling the string the right direction

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.500
when it fires our trebuchet

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.750
Let's add a small eye hook down at the bottom that will help direct the string so it's pulling in the same direction as gravity

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.180
instead of pulling sort of sideways

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:21.749
Okay, I've got the eye bolt installed, and I offset it a little bit

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.829
so it's not quite in the middle of the path this I'm hoping will allow the

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.169
Firing mechanism to still pass through a whole trebuchet without getting caught on the eyeball as it swings

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.289
We can see now that with the eye bolt in place no matter what angle

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:43.019
I pull this string at it's always pulling down on the back of the trebuchet arm the same way I can pull it straight up

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:44.320
And it still pulls straight down

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.059
So I pull it out in the direction that the rat trap will be we have a great angle

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:50.909
Pulling the same direction as gravity, so I'm hoping this will work pretty well

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.940
All right here we go let's take this tape off load it properly and see if it'll fire

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:22.979
All right now our trebuchet is not loaded at the moment because I think if we fire it indoors

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:29.699
We'll just end up breaking stuff, but we'll see if we can get it to fire even though. There's no projectile in it

00:12:32.589 --> 00:12:33.600
Now to set it off

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.389
I have some popsicle sticks wrapped in some paper towel

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.199
Wrapped in some tape, and I'm doing this because I don't want to tape my fingers

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:44.939
But this is fairly soft and should be able to activate the trap. Let's see how well this works

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:54.719
Hmm, I snapped the string it might be a little too powerful and need some reinforcement

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.969
We've got some much thicker stronger string

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.540
I'm gonna try tying that in the same way attaching it to both the trap and hook on the back

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.540
And hopefully this will be up to the challenge

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.299
Our stronger string is now attached to the trap and the hook on the back

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:10.049
Let's try launching it again and see if we can get it to not break apart this time

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:17.099
There's still no projectile in it, but it should work as a test here goes Wow

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.909
Yeah, yeah that launched

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.319
Very quickly very powerfully I'd say that'll do it

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:32.430
And we're back outside our rat trap is attached to the trebuchet the string is attached to the swinging arm and the trap is set

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.050
So now let's load up some ammo

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:40.889
And hit the trigger and see what kind of distance we can get on this bad boy all right here goes three two one

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.350
Where'd it go

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.230
Did you see where it went I didn't even see

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.560
Well guess we'll just have to try again three two one

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200
I didn't keep a better eye on it

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.689
We had two shots where we launched them out of the trebuchet

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.999
but we couldn't really see where they went they launched off so quickly that we lost track of them and

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.909
Even looking at the high-speed footage of the camera we couldn't really see where they were going because they left the frame pretty fast

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:22.389
So I actually had my cameraman stand behind the trebuchet just to watch and pay attention to where the shot was going

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.950
Because we couldn't find it and we finally managed to track where one launched

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.750
After we launched it and I was amazed at where it ended up how far back is that thing?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.620
There it is there we go. This is where it landed

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.669
so the trebuchet way over there and

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:45.970
So it's possible that our first couple shots went about as far as well, and they just have blended it into the grass so far

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.320
But I am amazed

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.100
I'm amazed at how far that went like I thought we'd get maybe two or three times as far and well

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.450
Maybe that is two or three times as far

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.330
It just seems like a lot if our first shot was 20 feet

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.699
Then this is now I have to measure it's gonna take a while because it's a long ways, but see how close one

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.110
almost

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.970
73 feet

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.970
That's pretty great

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.110
3 2 1

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.729
This thing is working great with the counterweight on it

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:30.820
We get shots 20 to 25 feet away with the rat trap on it. We are getting shots up to 80 feet away

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:35.740
that's pretty nuts this is certainly the kind of project that deserves to be scaled up something bigger and

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.880
Possibly with projectiles that are on fire if you wish that learning science

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.720
We're as exciting as watching us demonstrate all of these applications, then you should check out this quiz about various BMX tricks
