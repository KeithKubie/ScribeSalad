00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that we've generated our key
pair locally, we still need to place

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.880
the public key on our remote server,
so SSH can use it to log in.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.830
There are multiple ways to do this and
there are even some applications

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.258
that will do most of the work for you,
but we're going to do it the manual way.

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:19.030
First we want to make sure we're
logged into our server as the student.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.960
I'll first create a directory
called .ssh using the mkdir command

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.180
within my home directory.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.830
This is a special directory where all of
your key related files must be stored.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.710
I'll then create a new file within
this directory called authorized keys.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.370
This is another special file that
will store all of the public keys

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.580
that this account is allowed to use for

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.980
authentication, with one
key per line in that file.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.130
Now, back on my local machine I've read
out the contents of linuxcourse.pub,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.270
and I just want to copy that.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.520
Then, back on my server
as the student user,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.360
I went to edit this authorized key file.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.510
And in here I'll just paste
in that content and save it.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.459
The final thing we need to do is set
up some specific file permissions

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.800
on the authorized key file and
the SSH directory.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.110
This is a security measure
that SSH enforces to ensure

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.150
other users cannot gain
access to your account.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.530
We'll discuss file permissions
in a lot more detail shortly.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.320
For now we'll set the permissions
using the following commands.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.760
We'll run chmod 700 on
our SSH directory, and

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.070
chmod 644 on the authorized keys file.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.820
Finally we're all done and we can
now log in as the student user, but

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.000
instead of using user name and password.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.580
This I flag and the definition here
of what key pair we want to use

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.950
will allow me to login
using that key pair.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.860
If you set a passphrase for your key
pair, you'll be asked to enter that.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.130
But, once you're done, you'll see
you've logged into the server and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.220
you did not have to enter your
remote password for this user.
