00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.920
All those stick-thin models
you see in the magazines?

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.720
Look at them for
only 60 seconds,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.230
and they will change your brain.

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:12.880
Hello, hello, friends.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.088
Laci Green here with another
"D News" update for you.

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:17.110
When it comes to men,
society glorifies

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.460
being large-- muscles,
height, dominance.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.100
For women, we glorify being
small-- fragility, delicacy,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.670
and the less space you
take up, the better.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.380
The trend is troubling,
and it's notoriously

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.070
aggressive with
imagery of women.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.680
These days, we regularly see
images of underweight women

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.540
as one of many beauty standards.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.620
In reality, the levels
of thinness we're told

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.190
are beautiful can be pretty
dangerous for your health--

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610
things like brittle
bones, constant illness,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.670
ongoing fatigue.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.069
Being underweight is no
healthier than being obese.

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.610
The truth is that
seeing these images

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.680
affects us in ways that
we don't fully realize.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.305
It's been directly
linked by scientists

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:55.110
to depressive moods,
lower self-esteem,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.370
and eating disorders,
among other things.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.710
But the question has remained.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.334
We know we see this
stuff all the time.

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:02.570
Just how many times can
I look at these images

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.250
before they start to affect me?

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.970
The answer, according to a new
study, published in PLOS ONE

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.170
is one minute.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.224
That's it.

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.640
To conduct the
study, participants

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.600
were put into groups and primed
with images of plus-size models

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.730
or underweight models.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.688
They were then asked to
rate the attractiveness

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:21.299
of manufactured images of
women, with subtly varied BMIs.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.340
They found that those
exposed to plus-size models

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.170
found a BMI of 18.4
most attractive,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.280
while those exposed
to underweight models

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.410
found a BMI of 16.9
most attractive.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.520
FYI-- anything under
18.5 is considered

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.600
underweight for women.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.920
So both preferences
are underweight.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.900
But 16.9 to 18.4 is
quite a leap for only one

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.910
minute of exposure.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.190
What does this say about beauty?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.480
One implication is that what we
find attractive is pretty fluid

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.870
and it's easily influenced.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.270
We already know this just by
looking at other cultures.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.480
Different cultures find
different features beautiful.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.521
One common example of this
is a tribe in Thailand

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.180
that puts a lot of
focus on a long neck.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.300
So they wear these
happy brass rings

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.960
throughout their lives that
slowly elongate their necks.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.380
Another place, which is kind
of the opposite of the West,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.580
is Mauritania, where
women are encouraged

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.789
to gain as much
weight as possible.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.850
A heavy woman symbolizes
wealth and abundance.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.830
This standard was more common in
the preindustrial west as well.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.540
So when we're talking about
unhealthy imagery as beautiful,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.450
we can shift what's
considered beautiful,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.100
perhaps pretty easily,
by simply shifting

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.370
what we portray as beautiful.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.911
In the case of this
study, that would

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:29.360
mean making more sizes of
women visible in the media.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.520
However, that might not
fully resolve the problem.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.340
This was a short-term study.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.200
Many of the more insidious
effects on a person's physical

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.900
and mental health happen
from long-term exposure--

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.344
seeing the sort of imagery
all throughout their life.

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:43.510
So definitely something to
think about next time you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.825
open one of those women's
or men's magazines.

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:46.950
Thanks for watching, folks.
