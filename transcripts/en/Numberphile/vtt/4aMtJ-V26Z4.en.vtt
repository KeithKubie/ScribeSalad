00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.600
RIA SYMONDS: I've chosen NUMBER
153, or 153, because

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.385
it's very special to
me, because it's a

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.090
narcissistic number.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.610
To be a narcissist, you
need to basically be

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.700
in love with yourself.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.660
And 153 is in love with itself
because it has a mathematical

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.620
property which makes it so.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.090
MALE SPEAKER: While you're
fixing your hair there, can I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.235
ask you, are you a narcissist?

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.020
RIA SYMONDS: I think all
mathematicians are a little

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.290
bit of a narcissist.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.620
We're all in love
with ourselves.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.509
So, rubbish pen.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.630
1, can I change pens?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.260
5, 3.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.280
MALE SPEAKER: I can't see
why that number's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280
in love with itself.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.490
RIA SYMONDS: Hang on.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.220
Now, depending on how many
digits the number has, so this

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.590
has one, two, three digits,
I'm going to take each of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.960
those digits and raise
it to that number.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.700
1 to the power of 3.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.810
5 to the power of 3, and
3 to the power of 3.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.680
And I'm going to add
those together.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.930
So I've got 1 cubed.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.090
1 cubed is pretty simple.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.640
It's 1.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.730
5 cubed, 125.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.140
That requires a little bit more
mathematical knowledge.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.410
3 cubed is 27.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.970
So we add them up.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.760
Lo and behold, we'll get
1 add 125 is 126.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.170
Add on 27, and we get 153,
a number that is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.420
in love with itself.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.940
Let me give you a four-digit
narcissistic number.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.200
8,208.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.820
OK, this time, there are
four digits to a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.430
narcissistic number.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.840
So 4's the important part.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.880
That's what we're going to raise
each of these numbers

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.440
to, the power.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.180
So let's take 8 to the power of
4, 2 to the power of 4, 0

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.750
to the power of 4, and 8 again
to the power of 4.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.060
Add these up in your head, or
using a trusty calculator, lo

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.952
and behold, you get 8,208.

00:02:10.952 --> 00:02:12.400
Check it at home.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.110
It's the same number.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.700
It's in love with itself.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.095
MALE SPEAKER: Is this
useful or important?

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.160
Or is this just fun
and games for you?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.130
RIA SYMONDS: This is
just fun and games.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.630
This is just one area of why
math is so brilliant.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.570
And there is a limit.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.540
There are 88 narcissistic
numbers, to be precise.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780
The largest is a very
big number that I

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.920
can't actually say.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.350
There's too many things.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.220
But the most it has is 39
places to that number.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.445
So you can't get any numbers
bigger than 39

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:40.695
numbers within it.
