one of the challenges of these new

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
one of the challenges of these new
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730
one of the challenges of these new
technologies is not just that we're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
technologies is not just that we're
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.010
technologies is not just that we're
living in denial over what's going on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
living in denial over what's going on
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.620
living in denial over what's going on
but that we're often sort of overwhelmed

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
but that we're often sort of overwhelmed
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.560
but that we're often sort of overwhelmed
by them and one of the groups that I met

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
by them and one of the groups that I met
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.150
by them and one of the groups that I met
with for the book where people at the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
with for the book where people at the
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.650
with for the book where people at the
Red Cross and then another one was at

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
Red Cross and then another one was at
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.060
Red Cross and then another one was at
Human Rights Watch there was an

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
Human Rights Watch there was an
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.170
Human Rights Watch there was an
interesting thing that someone at the

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180
interesting thing that someone at the
 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.670
interesting thing that someone at the
International Red Cross said to me about

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680
International Red Cross said to me about
 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.950
International Red Cross said to me about
this where I said you know what there's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
this where I said you know what there's
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.080
this where I said you know what there's
so much bad going on in the world right

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
so much bad going on in the world right
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.890
so much bad going on in the world right
now how can we waste time on thinking

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900
now how can we waste time on thinking
 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.570
now how can we waste time on thinking
about the laws that surround these new

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580
about the laws that surround these new
 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.250
about the laws that surround these new
things like unmanned systems and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
things like unmanned systems and
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.710
things like unmanned systems and
robotics and it's completely valid

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720
robotics and it's completely valid
 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.450
robotics and it's completely valid
answer there is a ton of bad things

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
answer there is a ton of bad things
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700
answer there is a ton of bad things
going on in the world but for me what's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
going on in the world but for me what's
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110
going on in the world but for me what's
interesting is you could have said the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
interesting is you could have said the
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.149
interesting is you could have said the
exact same thing in 1939 or 1944 there's

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159
exact same thing in 1939 or 1944 there's
 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.520
exact same thing in 1939 or 1944 there's
so much bad going on in the world why

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
so much bad going on in the world why
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.079
so much bad going on in the world why
should we waste time trying to figure

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089
should we waste time trying to figure
 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.910
should we waste time trying to figure
out what's going on with this new thing

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
out what's going on with this new thing
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640
out what's going on with this new thing
called atomic bombs that's just you know

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
called atomic bombs that's just you know
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890
called atomic bombs that's just you know
fantasy that's just science fiction and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
fantasy that's just science fiction and
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.870
fantasy that's just science fiction and
so the result is we weren't ready for it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
so the result is we weren't ready for it
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.810
so the result is we weren't ready for it
there's a broader question of the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
there's a broader question of the
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.190
there's a broader question of the
ethical issues that surround these

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
ethical issues that surround these
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.260
ethical issues that surround these
systems is does it make war crimes more

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
systems is does it make war crimes more
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.740
systems is does it make war crimes more
or less likely that is some people think

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
or less likely that is some people think
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.920
or less likely that is some people think
you can put morality into these machines

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
you can put morality into these machines
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.649
you can put morality into these machines
you can put ethical codes into them sort

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
you can put ethical codes into them sort
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.690
you can put ethical codes into them sort
of equivalent to like isaac asimov's

three laws and so you could have as one

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
three laws and so you could have as one
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.639
three laws and so you could have as one
scientist put it more ethical killing

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649
scientist put it more ethical killing
 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.969

devices and that they would follow rules

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
devices and that they would follow rules
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859
devices and that they would follow rules
that maybe soldiers wouldn't so for

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
that maybe soldiers wouldn't so for
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109
that maybe soldiers wouldn't so for
example a lot of war crimes happen when

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
example a lot of war crimes happen when
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359
example a lot of war crimes happen when
a soldier's buddy is killed and rage

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
a soldier's buddy is killed and rage
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.219

local civilians robots don't have

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679
local civilians robots don't have
 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.770
local civilians robots don't have
emotion so you wouldn't have that happen

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
emotion so you wouldn't have that happen
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.060
emotion so you wouldn't have that happen
they can also be a lot more

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
they can also be a lot more
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.539
they can also be a lot more
discriminating they soldier has to burst

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
