probably isn't perfect you know it take
 

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.830 align:start position:0%
probably isn't perfect you know it take
to<00:18:12.290><c> Wednesday</c><00:18:12.950><c> to</c><00:18:13.010><c> its</c><00:18:13.640><c> rebooted</c><00:18:14.150><c> here</c><00:18:14.540><c> we</c><00:18:14.660><c> go</c>

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
to Wednesday to its rebooted here we go
 

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
to Wednesday to its rebooted here we go
if<00:18:15.140><c> you</c><00:18:15.320><c> look</c><00:18:15.560><c> at</c><00:18:15.680><c> it</c><00:18:15.800><c> kind</c><00:18:15.950><c> of</c><00:18:16.070><c> like</c><00:18:16.220><c> that</c><00:18:16.250><c> I</c>

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:16.610 align:start position:0%
if you look at it kind of like that I
 

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.910 align:start position:0%
if you look at it kind of like that I
think<00:18:16.880><c> it</c><00:18:16.940><c> actually</c><00:18:17.090><c> works</c><00:18:17.540><c> much</c><00:18:17.870><c> better</c><00:18:17.920><c> cuz</c>

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
think it actually works much better cuz
 

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.670 align:start position:0%
think it actually works much better cuz
yeah<00:18:19.100><c> it</c><00:18:19.310><c> does</c><00:18:19.490><c> get</c><00:18:19.670><c> redundant</c><00:18:20.210><c> but</c><00:18:20.480><c> so</c><00:18:21.290><c> yeah</c><00:18:21.650><c> I</c>

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it does get redundant but so yeah I
 

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.730 align:start position:0%
yeah it does get redundant but so yeah I
we<00:18:22.490><c> greatly</c><00:18:23.120><c> enjoyed</c><00:18:23.540><c> it</c><00:18:23.720><c> so</c><00:18:24.050><c> that's</c><00:18:24.290><c> yeah</c><00:18:24.500><c> I</c>

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740 align:start position:0%
we greatly enjoyed it so that's yeah I
 

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
we greatly enjoyed it so that's yeah I
