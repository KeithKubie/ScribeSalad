00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.550
Since we have all the coordinates of the games in an array,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.590
we can now use D3's mean function to compute the average.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.390
The D3 mean function, just like everything else we've been seeing,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.310
follows the exact same pattern where we pass it some array, and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.850
some callback function, which defines the operation we want to perform.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.860
In this case every element of coordinates gets passed to our callback function,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.630
and whatever we return from this callback function gets averaged by the D3

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.800
mean function and stored as a single value.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.420
In our case, in center_x.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.510
And remember the coordinates array represents the X and Y coordinates.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.730
Return from the projection function,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.320
which gets stored in an array where the first element represents the x value and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.060
the second element represents the y value.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.955
So our coordinates array is simply a bunch of

00:00:55.955 --> 00:01:00.020
x,y pairs representing the pixel values.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.750
Where each game occurred.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.760
And by summing and then dividing by the total number of all the x values,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.680
we simply get the mean, which gets stored in center_x.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.460
We can do exactly the same to find out the center_y pixel value,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.850
to then return from our rollup function.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.140
So we know the attendance to plot.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.820
And the x and y, to actually plot it out.
