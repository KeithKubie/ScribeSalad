GUEST SPEAKER: I'm here
to talk to you today

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.350
about why mission
of the World Bank's

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.120
new Office of
Sustainable Development

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.510
should be to promote sustainable
economic development.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.989
First I'll explain what
sustainable development means

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.030
in the context of global
investment in developing

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.180
countries.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.080
Then I will discuss why
the World Bank ought

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.610
to put a premium on these
particular kinds of investments

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.260
and why it ought to promote
environmental protection

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.509
in its work.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.740
To understand
sustainable development,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.630
we must first understand
that the well-being

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.280
of the economic system
is intrinsically

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.690
tied to the well-being
of the environment.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.110
The economy's
functioning depends

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.610
on inputs from
nature, which is then

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.990
exchanged among
various market actors

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.570
and eventually output is
waste into the environment.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.202
The economy grows at
a unsustainable rate

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:53.160
when the rate of resource
consumption and waste

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.010
production exceeds the rate
in which the environment can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.716
regenerate and absorb
waste products.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.090
It is also important
to note here

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.065
that economic growth is simply
a measure of total resource

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:03.780
throughput.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.080
It says nothing about happiness,
health, safety, or sense

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.090
of community within a region.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.810
Now that we've
defined growth, we

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.912
can contrast it with the
concept of development.

00:01:13.912 --> 00:01:16.120
Development is the quality
of improvement of resource

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.160
efficiency within a region.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.080
To invest in projects
that promote development

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.420
in poor countries is
to invest in projects

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.450
that allow people to produce
more with the resources they

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.890
already have.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.130
These kinds of projects might
involve investing in education,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.820
investing in the construction
of local hospitals and clinics,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.620
or investing in research and
development of crop seeds

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.965
that are less
resource intensive.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.970
While projects that
promote growth simply

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.790
increase production
and consumption,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.230
projects that
promote development

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.180
increase the efficiency of
production and consumption

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.460
towards some end that
enhances human welfare.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.080
Economic growth
is less important

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.330
than economic development
because growth,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.280
usually measured
in terms of GDP,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.477
is a flawed measure of progress.

00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:01.060
There is nothing
inherently beneficial

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.180
about economic growth.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.720
This is because growth only
implies an increase in resource

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.219
throughput.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.050
But It doesn't take into account
whether the resources are being

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.830
used in ways that efficiently
maximize well-being

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.440
while minimizing
resource consumption.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.260
On the other hand,
economic development

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.750
does a far better job of
indicating economic progress.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.970
Development implies that
resources are being used

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.942
in increasingly efficient ways.

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:25.650
The more developed a
country is, the more

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.024
of benefits from
the resources it

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:31.100
has while minimizing its total
consumption of these resources.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.140
As it becomes more and
more clear to people

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.570
across the world that
development, not growth, should

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.480
be our top priority, then
the base investment goals

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.130
would be in line with the
goals of the rest of the world.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.350
This is because investors
will want the same thing

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.710
as anyone else, the
maximum amount of benefit

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.020
they can get at the lowest cost.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.030
Likewise, individuals
who recognize development

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.520
as their goal want to
receive the greatest benefit

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.000
from natural resources they use
while minimizing these risks

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.530
consumption.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.350
As the UN's international
financial institution,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.960
the World Bank's mission
is to reduce poverty.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.540
It should do this by promoting
economic development which

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.860
insures the long-run
integrity of economic systems.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.610
If the bank instead chooses
to promote economic growth,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.970
it will be investing in projects
that contribute to constructing

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.540
an unsustainable economic
and social paradigm

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.520
with incredible inertia.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.094
The longer economic growth
remains the dominant measure

00:03:22.094 --> 00:03:23.510
of progress, the
more difficult it

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.884
will be to change
our consumption

00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:27.590
patterns in business
practices to ones

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.750
that are more sustainable.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.670
The World Bank may
not look very far

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.750
in seeking out
philosophical justification

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.380
for taking this measure.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.120
Utilitarianism, the common
philosophical foundation

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.670
for much of existing
environmental policy,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.030
tells us that we should take
the forward-looking utility

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.660
maximizing action.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.770
Choosing to make investments
that promote development, not

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.070
growth, is just such an action.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.270
This is because human
well-being, in the long run,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.400
is maximized when the very
goal of the economic system

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.380
is to provide for human
needs while maintaining

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.680
the integrity of the
environment in the long run.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.960
Human welfare is
certainly not maximized

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.150
when the goal of
the economic system

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.160
is to simply
maximize consumption

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.520
without regard to the
system's long-run viability.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.920
Such economic growth reduces
our collective welfare

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.279
because it leads to
depletion of economic inputs,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.370
natural resources, and it
uses raw materials, as well

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.260
the accumulation
in economic outputs

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.950
which are manifested by
landfills and garbage patches.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.677
Neither of these outcomes are
ones that anyone would want.

00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:30.260
If the World Bank's goal is to
reduce poverty in the long run,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.500
then let's take a
long-run view of success.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.346
As a UN initiative with
a moral imperative,

00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.720
the World Bank should work to
ensure that it's investment

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.050
decisions are based on the
utility maximizing philosophy

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.576
that promotes long-run
human welfare.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.640
Indeed investments and
development related projects

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.660
pay dividends over many
years, while investments

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.280
in growth related
projects may only

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.610
provide for human needs
for a short period of time.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.200
It is the World
Bank's responsibility

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.910
to take into
account the long run

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.640
well-being of the environment
because the viability

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.620
of economic systems depend
on its sustained integrity.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.410
To promote growth is to promote
the idea that the economy can

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.330
continue to flourish
independently

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.420
of the environment, an
idea that is a fiction.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.210
However, to promote
development means

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.830
to promote human
progress that is

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.580
sensitive to the environments
carrying capacity

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.580
and actively works to promote
environmental stewardship

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.560
while tending to human needs.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.784
This is the goal on which all
economies should be based.

00:05:28.784 --> 00:05:30.200
To that end, the
World Bank should

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.880
work to promote this idea
in our newest economies

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.870
so that they take no
time in choosing the best

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.060
method to promote the
progress of their people.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.910
Thank you.
