&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A lot of people have trouble remembering what complement and supplement mean.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.245
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here are some tips that you can use to help you remenber. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Complement

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:12.235
angles form a corner, or a 90 degree angle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So the C stands for corner. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:16.411
Supplementary angles form a straight line. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So the S, for straight. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And, if

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:20.853
you remember to list the letters alphabetically, you can also list the degrees

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:25.236
numerically in order, increasing. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; C goes with 90, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; S goes with 180. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:29.898
Complimentary angles add to 90. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Supplemetary angles add to 180.
