You’ve probably seen preserved deer and
antlers displayed on the walls of wood cabins,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:13.559
but the type of preservation scientists are
involved in is a whole different story.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.000
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews. Just recently,
the California Academy of Sciences gave us

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.509
an inside look at what happens behind museum
exhibits. We had the opportunity to participate

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.000
in the live preservation of a hummingbird
and got an up-close look at preserved animals that 
are now EXTINCT.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
For more on the process of taxidermy, head over to Seeker Stories

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to see how merging your love of science and art can lead to an awesome career.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.960
Now that you got the skinny on mammal preservation, let us know how you feel about preserving your own body.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.600
Is cryogenics something you’d consider? Share your thoughts in the comments

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.340
