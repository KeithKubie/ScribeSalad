00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.330
We're talking today about the
role that entrepreneurs play

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.660
in shaping the future of work.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
We're talking with Professor
Scott Stern, the Chair

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.210
of our Sloan School's
Technological Innovation,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.210
Entrepreneurship
and Strategy Group,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.470
and with Barbara Dyer,
the President of Hitachi

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.710
Foundation.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370
The foundation works
with entrepreneurs

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.760
to build both good
companies that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.770
are financially successful,
as well as ones that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.280
provide good job opportunities.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.100
Can entrepreneurs build
a good job strategy

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.600
creating good opportunities
for the full workforce

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.110
in from the beginning?

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.190
So I think one of the
greatest misconceptions

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.860
is that being a
good entrepreneur

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.190
and building a company that
really scales is actually

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.670
in opposition to
building a company that

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.920
creates great jobs.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.440
In fact, I'd claim that
exactly the reverse is true.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.000
To attract the
really best people,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.720
to really create meaningful,
innovative value for consumers,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.630
to really be in a situation
where ultimately you

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.950
are able to charge a
price well above your cost

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.330
and create that
kind of value, means

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.610
that you need to be
attracting, nurturing,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.680
investing in employees
in meaningful ways.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.550
If everyone who shows up
to your company is simply,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.350
all it is about cost,
well, then, there's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.770
not much of a company at all.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.180
There's not much of
an organization there.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.770
What we've observed at
the nearly 100 companies

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.000
that we've looked at across
health care and manufacturing

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.150
is at the businesses that
create great quality jobs don't

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.870
begin with the premise that
this is a good HR strategy.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.540
They start with,
what is excellence?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.310
And they very quickly figure out
that the workforce piece of it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.710
is a critical part
of operations.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.840
They have to invest
in their people,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.289
and they have to
create systems that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.620
provide ongoing support, ongoing
learning, ongoing incentives

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.300
so that their people are
really delivering in the best

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.230
possible way.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.400
We hear that many investors have
a mindset that labor is a cost

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.960
and it ought to be minimized,
and put a lot of pressure

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.680
on entrepreneurs.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.910
How can we overcome
that resistance?

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.090
We have to do the hard work
of persuading investors

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.990
that it's not a choice
between lower profits,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:50.010
but a better workforce versus
higher profits and a cheaper

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.080
workforce.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.030
Instead, the choice is for
equally viable businesses,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.200
we get to choose the kind
of organizations we build.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.340
Successful venture
capitalists who

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.400
have built successful
companies, they meaningfully

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.910
talk about the great
organizations they've built.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.890
Entrepreneurs are uncomfortable
talking to investors

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.470
about a workforce strategy.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.610
They are concerned
that investors

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.810
will view this as excess, as
having too high a burn rate.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.890
They don't have fully at their
grasp the economics of it.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.910
They can't really
make the business case

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.990
as well as they might
like to as to why

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.950
it is that building
a strategy like this

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.410
will end up achieving the
numbers in the next two, five,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.700
ten years.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.400
There is a tendency to expect
that at the startup phase,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.050
the founders will certainly
work for below market rates,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.750
and that the people
that are hired

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.520
will work for
below market rates.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.950
They'll work around the clock.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.860
There should be no expectation
of salary increases or benefits

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.670
because the company hasn't
started generating a profit.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.860
Now you're a scholar.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.580
You know that the
research tells us

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.380
that if you build into
the DNA of a company

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.680
from the very start
this kind of commitment,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.399
this kind of strategy, it'll
be the driving framework

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.110
for the company over time.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.220
And so that's where
all the evidence

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.050
from other
organizations plays in.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.400
If you can help them
to make that business

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.072
case, to understand
the potential,

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:31.030
then there's some hope.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.940
And so we have to find
ways to deal with that.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.810
Could you give us an example
of an organization or two

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.330
that has really
invested in this way?

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.000
Take for example, Beepi.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.490
Beepi is an online
car marketplace

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.210
that's really kind of fixing the
lemons problem for used cars.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.740
Basically, right now you can
think of the used car industry

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.570
as definitely not associated
with a good job strategy, not

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.500
even a good service.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.506
One of the key choices
that Ale Resnik, one

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.880
of the founders
of this firm, had

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.550
to make was whether or not the
technicians, the people who

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.060
would be inspecting the
cars, was going to be hiring

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.700
a series of
contractor inspectors,

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.680
or whether or not
he'd be investing

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.160
in long-term employees.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.400
He got different advice
from different investors

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.380
about that choice.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.000
He ultimately decided that
the strength and the quality

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.820
and the innovations
of his company

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.360
could best be made by
investing in employees.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.120
All those employees
get extensive training.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.810
They're upping
their skill level.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.750
They get some equity
in the company.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.380
And as that company
has grown, all

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.890
of a sudden they are the
single most visible and single

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.190
most memorable and single
best advocates for the company

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.270
as it scaled across
the United States.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.780
Jessamyn Rodriguez, who is the
founder of Hot Bread Kitchens

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.650
started with a long-term vision.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.630
The idea was to enable primarily
immigrant, but other women

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.830
and men, who have
an ethnic bread

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.520
to take that to the
market, to create

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.410
real economic opportunity
through baking bread,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.640
and to enable them to
build their own businesses

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.970
around their particular craft.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.010
And so Hot Bread Kitchen, now
a very successful operation

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.300
in Harlem, is incubating bread
businesses throughout New York

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.120
and beyond.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.180
So it's a bakery, yes, but
it's far more than that.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.730
And to help individuals
to kind of build

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.310
math skills while
they're creating breads,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.250
to build business skills
while they're creating breads,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.110
to build marketing skills
while they're creating breads,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.770
was a brilliant touch.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.130
The bakery is a great example,
a place I should clearly visit.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.070
How about other examples?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.530
Recently we were
supporting a sector

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.110
of energy entrepreneurs
looking to address

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.780
issues of climate change.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.560
And one company, Rebound, is
a remarkable refrigeration

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.350
company that has the potential
of saving supermarkets

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.270
enormous amount of money
in refrigeration costs

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.010
and dramatically reducing
the amount of CO2.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.440
The founder of that company is
eager to build a business that

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.320
is focused on good people,
great jobs, pathways

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.480
of upward mobility.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.300
It's who he is, it's where
he wants to take his company.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.760
Entrepreneurship can be
used to provide good jobs.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.230
How do we get this
to become the norm?

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.540
People need to vote
with their feet.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.760
When you think about joining a
company, when you think about--

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.130
say you're in a big company
thinking about which kind

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.630
of companies to partner with--

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.980
when you think about,
even as an investor,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.119
make sure you're having
that conversation,

00:07:58.119 --> 00:07:59.660
and understanding
as you're selecting

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.220
among different groups to work
with, different firms to work

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.400
with, even different
portfolio companies

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.190
to invest in, go one layer
beyond the simple value

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.040
creation, value capture logic,
and get to the organization

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.070
and the team.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.570
You are more likely
to be investing

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:23.970
in a long-term play that really
delivers fundamental value

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.740
and really delivers
strong returns

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.710
if you're investing
in the kind of company

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.220
that people are going
to be attracted to

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.480
and allows people
to nurture and grow.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.370
Well Scott, I think this
is an important message

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.250
for entrepreneurs, for
investors, and for young people

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.310
who really do want to build
great companies that address

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.040
big problems in society,
that are successful,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.310
and that provide
good jobs and career

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.602
opportunities to their peers.

00:08:52.602 --> 00:08:53.560
So thank you very much.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.010
Thank you very much as well.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.830
Thank you so much.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.080
Thank you for your time today.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.690
You're welcome.
