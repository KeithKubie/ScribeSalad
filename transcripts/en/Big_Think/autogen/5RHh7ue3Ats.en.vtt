very interested in it my younger sister

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820
very interested in it my younger sister

is autistic and when I was a child the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130
is autistic and when I was a child the
 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.220
is autistic and when I was a child the
only thing I knew about autism was the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230
only thing I knew about autism was the
 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.830
only thing I knew about autism was the
fact that Karen was autistic now it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840
fact that Karen was autistic now it
 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.350
fact that Karen was autistic now it
seems to be in the news everywhere

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
seems to be in the news everywhere
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.150
seems to be in the news everywhere
what's known about autism the number one

what's known about autism the number one
 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.680
what's known about autism the number one
thing that's known about autism is that

thing that's known about autism is that
 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.420
thing that's known about autism is that
it seems to be largely genetically

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
it seems to be largely genetically
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.080
it seems to be largely genetically
determined

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090

if one identical twin is autistic then

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120
if one identical twin is autistic then
 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.939
if one identical twin is autistic then
the odds of the other twin having some

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949
the odds of the other twin having some
 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.799
the odds of the other twin having some
kind of autism spectrum disorder is

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809
kind of autism spectrum disorder is
 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.990
kind of autism spectrum disorder is
between 50 and 80 percent and that's

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000
between 50 and 80 percent and that's
 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.970
between 50 and 80 percent and that's
just a tremendous probability and that's

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980
just a tremendous probability and that's
 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.189
just a tremendous probability and that's
not the case for non identical twins for

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199
not the case for non identical twins for
 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.110
not the case for non identical twins for
fraternal twins and so that's a major

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120
fraternal twins and so that's a major
 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.060
fraternal twins and so that's a major
piece of evidence that autism is largely

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070
piece of evidence that autism is largely
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.220
piece of evidence that autism is largely
genetic and one big story in the last

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230
genetic and one big story in the last
 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.319
genetic and one big story in the last
five years has been the identification

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329
five years has been the identification
 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.899
five years has been the identification
of genes that that increase the risk of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909
of genes that that increase the risk of
 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.910
of genes that that increase the risk of
autism and it's not one gene it seems to

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
autism and it's not one gene it seems to
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.770
autism and it's not one gene it seems to
be some more complex polygenic disorder

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780
be some more complex polygenic disorder
 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.570
be some more complex polygenic disorder
where you get dealt a bunch of genes

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580
where you get dealt a bunch of genes
 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.220
where you get dealt a bunch of genes
from your mother and your your father

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230
from your mother and your your father
 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.920
from your mother and your your father
from your father and if you draw the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930
from your father and if you draw the
 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.420
from your father and if you draw the
wrong combination of genes say between

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430
wrong combination of genes say between
 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.819
wrong combination of genes say between
two and ten genes then that increases

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829
two and ten genes then that increases
 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.920
two and ten genes then that increases
the risk of being autistic so that's the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930
the risk of being autistic so that's the
 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.090
the risk of being autistic so that's the
main thing that's known as far as as far

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100
main thing that's known as far as as far
 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.069
main thing that's known as far as as far
as the the later development of it

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079
as the the later development of it
 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.770
as the the later development of it
people are starting to look at

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
people are starting to look at
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.240
people are starting to look at
structural differences between the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250
structural differences between the
 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.740
structural differences between the
brains of autistic people and what are

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750
brains of autistic people and what are
 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.899
brains of autistic people and what are
called neurotypical people and those are

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909
called neurotypical people and those are
 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.850
called neurotypical people and those are
changes that take place in the neocortex

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860
changes that take place in the neocortex
 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.770
changes that take place in the neocortex
which is the largest part of our brain

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780
which is the largest part of our brain
 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.620
which is the largest part of our brain
and also in the cerebellum which people

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630
and also in the cerebellum which people
 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.209
and also in the cerebellum which people
used to think of as being a sensory or

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219
used to think of as being a sensory or
 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.190
used to think of as being a sensory or
motor structure but seems to be perhaps

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200
motor structure but seems to be perhaps
 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.230
motor structure but seems to be perhaps
important also for for more advanced

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240
important also for for more advanced
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.420
important also for for more advanced
cognitive tasks and so the cerebellum as

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430
cognitive tasks and so the cerebellum as
 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.550
cognitive tasks and so the cerebellum as
has been fingered in the last few years

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560
has been fingered in the last few years
 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.950
has been fingered in the last few years
as far as treatments for autism right

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960
as far as treatments for autism right
 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.599
as far as treatments for autism right
now the one kind of treatment that seems

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609
now the one kind of treatment that seems
 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.730
now the one kind of treatment that seems
to be somewhat helpful is behavioral

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740
to be somewhat helpful is behavioral
 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.560
to be somewhat helpful is behavioral
therapy especially when children are

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570
therapy especially when children are
 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.480
therapy especially when children are
diagnosed and identified as needing the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490
diagnosed and identified as needing the
 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.779
diagnosed and identified as needing the
help young and so that is interesting

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789
help young and so that is interesting
 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.789
help young and so that is interesting
because it's the one way that seems to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799
because it's the one way that seems to
 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.830
because it's the one way that seems to
possibly help kids who have autism and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
possibly help kids who have autism and
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.950
possibly help kids who have autism and
it may be part of why diagnosis rates

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960
it may be part of why diagnosis rates
 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.050
it may be part of why diagnosis rates
have gone up because it's recognized

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
have gone up because it's recognized
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.060
have gone up because it's recognized
that those therapies can help kids and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070
that those therapies can help kids and
 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.460
that those therapies can help kids and
so people are motivated to identify

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470
so people are motivated to identify
 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.750
so people are motivated to identify
these problems in their kids when

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760
these problems in their kids when
 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.490
these problems in their kids when
they're young because that's when it's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
they're young because that's when it's
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.190
they're young because that's when it's
possible to maybe catch these things and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
possible to maybe catch these things and
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.350
possible to maybe catch these things and
and help these kids integrate better

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360
and help these kids integrate better
 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.630
and help these kids integrate better
into the rest of society

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
 
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 
one characteristic of autism therapy in

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550
one characteristic of autism therapy in
 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.340
one characteristic of autism therapy in
the last few years has been basically

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350
the last few years has been basically
 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.890
the last few years has been basically
taking autistic kids and seeing what can

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
taking autistic kids and seeing what can
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.570
taking autistic kids and seeing what can
be done to help them and I think that's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
be done to help them and I think that's
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.020
be done to help them and I think that's
sort of I wouldn't call it palliative

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
sort of I wouldn't call it palliative
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.240
sort of I wouldn't call it palliative
but it's it's in the category of helping

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250
but it's it's in the category of helping
 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.070
but it's it's in the category of helping
kids who are already diagnosed with

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
kids who are already diagnosed with
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.810
kids who are already diagnosed with
autism who have already been through a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820
autism who have already been through a
 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.940
autism who have already been through a
lot of the developmental stages that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
lot of the developmental stages that
 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.730
lot of the developmental stages that
lead to autism and it's um and in some

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740
lead to autism and it's um and in some
 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.140
lead to autism and it's um and in some
sense the horses out of the barn and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
sense the horses out of the barn and
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.310
sense the horses out of the barn and
then it's a question of what you can do

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320
then it's a question of what you can do
 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.340
then it's a question of what you can do
to help these kids - to bring to them

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
to help these kids - to bring to them
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.960
to help these kids - to bring to them
the kind of social skills that would

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
the kind of social skills that would
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.090
the kind of social skills that would
help them work much better in society I

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
help them work much better in society I
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.520
help them work much better in society I
think treatment is a ways away it's um

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
think treatment is a ways away it's um
 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.160
think treatment is a ways away it's um
it's not in the next five years or even

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
it's not in the next five years or even
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.770
it's not in the next five years or even
next ten years but I think that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
next ten years but I think that
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.330
next ten years but I think that
understanding the mechanisms in

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
understanding the mechanisms in
 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.520
understanding the mechanisms in
development that lead to autism could

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
development that lead to autism could
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.170
development that lead to autism could
eventually lead to some kind of therapy

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180
eventually lead to some kind of therapy
 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.199
eventually lead to some kind of therapy
that could perhaps nip autism in the bud

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209
that could perhaps nip autism in the bud
 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.350
that could perhaps nip autism in the bud
when kids are you know when their brains

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360
when kids are you know when their brains
 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.880
when kids are you know when their brains
are making these developmental choices

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890
are making these developmental choices
 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.100
are making these developmental choices
early in life so I think it's a ways off

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110
early in life so I think it's a ways off
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.170
early in life so I think it's a ways off
but I think the research starts pointing

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
but I think the research starts pointing
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.430
but I think the research starts pointing
towards better therapies

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
 
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530
 
there are cases of people who can

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540
