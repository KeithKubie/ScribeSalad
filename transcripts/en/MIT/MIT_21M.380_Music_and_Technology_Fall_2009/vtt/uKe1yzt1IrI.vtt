00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:22.360
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.260
So, welcome back.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.530
Today we continue our
look at musical interfaces

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.570
by examining the turntable
and its various contemporary

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.230
formations and a
variety of controllers.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.280
What we're going to do
is look at a little bit

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.940
of the history of the
development of turntablism.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.590
We're going to talk about some
of the technologies involved

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.260
including turntables proper, DJ
mixers, look at a few scratch

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510
techniques.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.090
We'll cover a little bit about
the development of hip hop

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.750
extending back through
the Jamaican sound system

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.740
tradition from which it seems
it came on to early hip hop

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.879
innovators coming out of
the South Bronx in New York

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.660
and onto a bit of contemporary
turntable practice.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.990
At the end I'll sort of argue
that what we see now going on

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.900
is sort of an abstraction
of the turntable interface,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.320
extracting and abstracting
out the key control interface

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.360
components of the turntable, and
we'll see some examples of that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.285
as we move forward.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.810
A brief reminder, remember
Thursday your Sonic systems

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.320
projects.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.850
We're going to bring
those in next week.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.790
Some prototype, some draft,
sketches, circuits, code,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.310
pictures, ideas,
bring something in.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.170
Be prepared to
show us something.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.490
We'll spend about five to
10 minutes on each person.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.910
So have something to share.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.030
And that's the next
thing coming up.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.780
I have almost all of your drafts
in for the for the case study

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.970
paper.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.910
Now that you've
turned that in, try

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.250
not to stop thinking about it.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.597
Continue thinking about it.

00:02:07.597 --> 00:02:09.430
We'll get a little bit
of time away from it,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.300
but continue to
do your research.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.040
I'll get you guys comments back,
hopefully within a week or so,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400
and that'll give you more to
work on as we move forward.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.100
Questions?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.600
Comments?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.830
One of your listenings for
today was a track by People

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.350
Under the Stairs.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.570
This is the hip hop
group out of Los Angeles

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.900
who speak about the
folklore of hip hop.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.381
Let's listen to a little bit of
this track to remind ourselves.

00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.381
[MUSIC - PEOPLE UNDER THE
 STAIRS, "STAY HOME."]

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.270
In case you didn't catch
all those lyrics there,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.390
a couple things to point out.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.100
What they're doing is
talking about the folklore

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.116
of the foundations of hip hop.

00:04:04.116 --> 00:04:05.490
It turns out that
it's not really

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.110
folklore in that it's
colored by imagination.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.170
It's actually part
of the real history

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.890
of the development of hip hop.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.740
They describe 40
days in the studio,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.470
struck water from ADATs
on top of a mountain made

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.870
of milk crates.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.810
Going on, people who still
live in the folklore of DJ Cool

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.014
Herc, Bam Grand Wizard Theodore.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.680
We're going to talk
about all those guys

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.110
as we move forward today.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.040
We're going to use
this as a way to frame

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.270
our discussion of the
development of hip hop.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.270
Before any punk with a
keyboard could do it,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.230
yo Apache was the and
every B-Boy knew it.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.720
We're going to
look at Apache, one

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.870
of the most famous breaks
of all turntable breaks.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.430
And finally, yo
it's number one rap,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.990
I'd rather hear an eight-o-eight
hand clap than that.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.090
We already know what
that's a reference to,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.030
the famous
eight-o-eight hand clap.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.400
So before we go on,
let's review our history

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.620
of the turntable
of the phonograph.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.730
Remember 1877, Edison
comes out with his cylinder

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.400
based recording mechanism.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.620
1887, Berliner releases
his disc based gramophone.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.040
The disc ultimately wins
out primarily because

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.250
of-- why, why did
the disk win out?

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.750
Yeah?

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.791
AUDIENCE: Because you
could record more, and then

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:27.724
because it was horizontal versus
vertical wedges, or edges,

00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:28.658
whatever.

00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:32.394
Basically it made
it so that amplitude

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:33.800
wasn't really affected as much.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.966
PROFESSOR: Well there's a
little bit more regularity

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:39.670
in doing the transverse rather
than the lateral cut, right?

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.170
But--

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.110
AUDIENCE: Isn't it easier to
encode larger amplitude swings

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.320
with less amplification.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.500
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.415
We can regulate the
amplitude more better

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.960
and the cutting of the record,
but more importantly, we

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.510
can make copies.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.130
We can press copies super
easily of this flat disc

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.260
and sell those
pre-recorded copies.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.610
That's probably the number one
reason why the disc won out,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.100
because it was
easier to reproduce.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.100
And we talked about that
as sort of a flattening

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.032
of the dimensions of
the recording medium

00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:10.490
from three dimensions
on a cylinder

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.910
to two dimensions on a disc.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.880
By 1948 Columbia releases
the 33 and the third.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.130
That's the large format LP, and
that gets back pretty much up

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.670
to where we've talked about the
phonograph in the gramophone

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.040
so far.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.830
1969 Technics releases the
SP-10, the first direct drive

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.990
turntable.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.720
This direct drive
mechanism turns out

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.060
to be a fairly important
technical feature.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.190
Previous turntables had
used a belt mechanism.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.180
And the belt, while effective,
tended to wear out over time

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.890
and slow down.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.100
The rate wasn't
always as constant

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.640
and posed some other
technical problems.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.640
With this direct
drive turntable,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.420
the performance of the turntable
was a little bit more rigorous

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.930
and could handle a little
bit more abuse, namely,

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.890
the kind of abuse we see
with contemporary practice.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.130
1969, Technics releases a less
expensive model, the SP-1100.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.130
1972 they release the SL-1200.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.420
And it's this
turntable that really

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.290
defines the modern
turntable practice.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.430
If you go find a DJ
somewhere, and you

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.040
look at their turntables,
probably six to eight out of 10

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.230
will be using this turntable
or some variation of it.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.840
Now they have the SL-1220
and SL-1260, et cetera.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.120
But the SL-12 is still
the leading model

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.840
and, in fact, you'll hear
hip hop artists refer

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.390
to the SL-12 as the
turntable of choice.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.840
This model allows you to select
different rotation speeds

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.310
depending if you have a 78
or 45 or a 33 and a third.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.540
And it has this nice
variable speed adjustment

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.440
slider here on the right.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:06.420
Why would you want to smoothly
vary the speed of playback?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.140
Slow things down,
speed things up.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.889
AUDIENCE: Skip ahead
to the next track.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.180
PROFESSOR: Fast forward,
well, yeah, you could do that.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.320
OK, that's one approach.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.190
Yeah you always just grab
the needle and throw it over.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.690
Yeah?

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.150
AUDIENCE: If you're playing
two at the same time,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.070
if you want to get them
to be about the same pitch

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.080
or if you want them to
be about the same speed,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.300
you can always just
adjust one smoothly.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.320
By adjusting the rotation
speed here and changing

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.336
the rotation speed-- go ahead?

00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.419
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if that was their intent

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.409
or if it was actually
intended to just

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.873
be able to adjust for
fluctuations in line frequency?

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:46.028
Because, you know,
you may need to do

00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:48.670
that if you need it to go
exactly 33 and a third.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.420
PROFESSOR: I think
with the direct drive

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.950
motor and the
modern design, they

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.200
were able to pretty regularly
get the speed that they wanted.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.460
So I think the
motivation, maybe,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.320
and certainly the
most common use

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.960
is to match beats,
to match tempo.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.490
So that you could slow
down a track a little bit

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.920
and move into another
track and match the beats,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.410
align the beats, which leads
to the whole practice of beat

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.960
matching which used to
be done manually by ear

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.116
but is more often done
with software now.

00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:18.187
AUDIENCE: Were people
doing that in '69

00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:19.395
when this turntable came out?

00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:22.745
PROFESSOR: Not '69 but
the late '70s, early '80s.

00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:24.620
AUDIENCE: What's the
response to that ability

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.571
or was the ability a
response to a desire?

00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:27.570
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.865
That's a good thing to look at.

00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:33.390
This is a modern, this
isn't the 72 model.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.890
Yeah.

00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:38.060
I mean, that's a
great question to ask

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.040
and something to look at.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.620
Now combined with the modern
SL style of turntable,

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.250
DJs often add a slip
mat, and this slip mat

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.400
is really the, sort of, secret
ingredient to modern turntable

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.920
technique.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.570
It's simply a
circle of felt that

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.660
goes under the record
that permits the record

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.830
to spin independently
of the platter.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.960
Now this allows us to
do a number of things

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.810
with our record.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.010
The so-called baby scratch is
the most basic scratch-- oops,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.010
this is the
transformers-- either way,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.620
we're going to look at a couple
scratches that don't require

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.930
using the mixer, that
just employ manipulating

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.900
the disc on the platter.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.625
And this is only possible
because of the felt of the slip

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.990
mat, or at least, more possible.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.770
So this is the transformer--
oh, sorry, this is a bad clip.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.380
This is not what I wanted.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:36.880
Sorry.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.315
Let's go to the phases,
maybe this is it.

00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:41.800
There we go.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.790
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.626
DJ QBERT: OK, phrases are
just the same thing as lasers,

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:48.991
but you're holding the record.

00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:51.650
PROFESSOR: [GIGGLING]
So here he's

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.560
showing a technique
where he's just

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.095
adjusting the
rotation of the disc.

00:10:56.095 --> 00:10:57.720
He's not doing anything
with the mixer.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.690
He's just using the
ability for the disc

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.345
to turn independently
of the platter.

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:04.170
Let me pull up the
baby, this is the one

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.360
I was going to show before.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.874
There we go.

00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:12.040
DJ QBERT: So the first
scratch you're going to learn

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.222
is the baby scratch.

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:16.736
It's basically the
easiest scratch to do.

00:11:16.736 --> 00:11:19.196
You don't need a fader.

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:21.164
You just move the
record back and forth.

00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:24.312
There was a deal in 1975,
and this is how it sounds.

00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:30.950
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.160
PROFESSOR: So a very
simple scratch, again,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.060
just being able to manipulate
the movement of the record

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.800
on the platter
allows us to do this.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.500
There's this other one here
called the waves-- hopefully

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.540
I have the right
link here-- which

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:52.600
adjusts the rotation in
a quick and slow fashion.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.009
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:54.884
DJ QBERT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:02.907 --> 00:12:03.740
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.790
PROFESSOR: What's
interesting about that

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.290
is the movement
of his hand looks

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.630
like it's mapping the cutoff
frequency of a low pass

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.130
filter which is
kind of interesting.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.921
I don't think it's the
movement of his hand

00:12:12.921 --> 00:12:14.790
that's making this
technique effective.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.680
It's really adjusting
the playback speed

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.360
in a smooth fashion
up and down that

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.810
makes this technique effective.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.830
Questions?

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.620
AUDIENCE: What's on the record?

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.830
PROFESSOR: In that example?

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.439
DJs like him and
others sometimes

00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:32.980
use battle records or records
that are configured with things

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.660
really good for scratching.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.640
In that case, it sounded sort
of like a vocal sample, somebody

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.110
saying something, which often
gives those good white noise

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.610
sounds.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.260
We'll hear more examples
of that in a little bit.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.100
Now the DJ mixer is one of
the other really important

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.560
components of the
turntable's set up.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.610
And particularly,
the cross fader.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.080
The cross fader and the toggle
switches found on a modern DJ

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.460
mixer allow the turntablist
to apply variable amplitude

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.636
envelopes to the sound.

00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:07.260
We've already looked
at the development

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.520
of modular synthesizers.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.270
We can think of the cross
fader and the toggle switches,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.570
the cross fader located here
and the toggle switches located

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.810
here, as various ways of
applying amplitude envelopes

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.895
to the sound the DJ is
capturing from the disc.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.490
Now there's a wide
range of other tools

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.070
available on the DJ mixer.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.640
Another important
one is the ability

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.240
to listen to more sources
than are being played.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.920
This is often described
as the queueing

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.350
of the record or
the queue input.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.120
What this allows the DJ
to do is play one record

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.850
and then play another
record and listen

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.940
to that record in
their headphones

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.090
before they play it
out to the audience.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.910
This leads to the sort
of stereotypical DJ

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:06.430
pose of having one cup of a
headphone ear on their head

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.970
while doing something.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.540
They're queuing up
the next record.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.130
They're listening to the next
record which may be a record

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.020
or may be a digital audio file
or may be some other source,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.850
they're playing an
existing record,

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.350
listening to another
record, adjusting

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.910
where the records going to play,
maybe adjusting the playback

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.840
speed, and doing that
all in the headphones

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.700
before they send that out to
the main mix to the house.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.020
So the ability to queue
up another channel

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.000
before sending it out is a
critical feature of DJ mixers.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.140
Now some modern DJ mixers
have a wide variety

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.550
of different effects.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.130
Some have delay, some have
reverb, some have samplers,

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.880
some have various
other technologies.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.550
For instance, this Mackie d.2
features an optical cross fader

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.170
which is advertised as never
changing its performance.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.530
The cross fader always
performs the same way

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.880
because there's no friction.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.380
There's other designs
that are using

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.440
magnetic technologies
for the cross faders.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.560
This Numark DXM09 has some
beat synchronized affects

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.480
so it allows you
to set the tempo

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.040
and then echos and
delays and other effects

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.980
are synchronized to the beat
which is a pretty nice feature.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.200
This Numark 5000FX features
an integrated sampler

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.480
which allows you to, while
you're playing something,

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.280
simply trigger a record,
sample something,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.096
and then play it back either
in reverse or forward later on,

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.470
which as you
imagine, could offer

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.780
some nice creative techniques.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.050
We already saw
another example where

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.480
DJs work with something
like an MPC sampler.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.260
So seeing a turntable next
to an MPC is not uncommon.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.750
Some DJs might work
with an external sampler

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.520
next to their turntable,
but we do see some cases

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.080
where the sampler is
integrated into the mixer.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.480
This device is very cool.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.100
It seems to have
been discontinued,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.560
but this Vestax QFO
has a single turntable

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.570
with a mixer built it.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:08.019
This provides a DJ to do a
solo set without a mixer.

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:09.435
It has the essential
functionality

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:14.890
of the cross fader of a mixer
built into the turntable

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.580
so that with just this
and an MP3 player,

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.740
you can put down
a background track

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.140
and then scratch over this
and have your cross fader.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.510
Now working with the
turntable and the mixer

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.100
is how most of the
turntable techniques

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.800
that we of have come about.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.630
I showed you guys some examples,
the baby and the waves,

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.910
that don't use the mixer.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.690
These examples use the mixer to
create the various scratching

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.640
techniques.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.806
So this is the one I
accidentally brought up before.

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:47.060
This is a transformer.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.500
As you might expect,
this is named

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.470
for making the type
of transforming sound.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.300
So there we're basically taking
a noise source from the record

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.150
and then applying a
variable amplitude envelope

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.690
to that noise source in
a rhythmic fashion which

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.277
provides that very nice
quasi transformers sound.

00:17:21.277 --> 00:17:23.235
Or maybe they use it for
the real transformers,

00:17:23.235 --> 00:17:25.800
I'm not sure.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.140
The chirp, another technique,
check this one out,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.620
that makes use of
the cross faders.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:29.920
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.544
DJ QBERT: OK, this next scratch
is called a chirp scratch which

00:17:32.544 --> 00:17:35.812
was made popular by Jazzy Jeff
on a song called Magnificent.

00:17:35.812 --> 00:17:41.330
Jazzy Jeff made a whistle
sound like a bird.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:47.120
Anyway, this scratch is kind of
tricky so you let a sound play,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.842
and you've got to turn it off
right when it plays and just

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:57.857
move your hand backward
in, like, a mirror fashion.

00:17:57.857 --> 00:17:58.690
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.000
PROFESSOR: Can anybody summarise
what that technique is there?

00:18:06.976 --> 00:18:09.475
We'll listen to it a little bit
more then you can try again.

00:18:09.475 --> 00:18:10.141
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:15.525
DJ QBERT: And then turn
it off and take it back.

00:18:15.525 --> 00:18:16.358
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:19.810
AUDIENCE: It seems like it's
basically amplitude modulation

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.440
or modulating the amplitude
with a really high attack.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.024
PROFESSOR: Well the
attack is gradual.

00:18:25.024 --> 00:18:26.856
You can see that the
attack of the amplitude

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:27.640
is gradual, right?

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.110
You can see him feeding it in.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.310
Anybody else want to
take a stab at describing

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.735
what this technique is?

00:18:33.735 --> 00:18:35.620
AUDIENCE: Without
saying what he just did?

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.540
It basically links
amplitude and pitch.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.550
So amplitude is faded in
as the record is sped up,

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.120
and then amplitude is faded
out as a record is slowed down.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.780
So those two
parameters are linked,

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.240
and that allows him to create
this distinctive sound.

00:18:56.021 --> 00:18:56.520
Right?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.430
So amplitude and the change
in playback speed are linked.

00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:04.075
Ever hear that before?

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.470
Of course, DJ Qbert's
quite good at this.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.810
The crab gives us
an example of some

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.070
of the really crazy
extended techniques that

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.050
develop using the cross fader.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.680
If you've ever seen a
Flamenco guitarist use

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.730
all their fingers, this
should remind you of this.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.266
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:28.682
DJ QBERT: Where I
use two fingers,

00:19:28.682 --> 00:19:30.158
and instead of
using two fingers,

00:19:30.158 --> 00:19:33.602
why don't you use five fingers.?

00:19:33.602 --> 00:19:36.080
So instead of the
tapping like a twiddle,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.320
it's slide your
fingers across kind

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.745
of like snapping my fingers.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:42.595
PROFESSOR: Easy, right?

00:19:42.595 --> 00:19:46.664
DJ QBERT: And it was actually
called the [INAUDIBLE] scratch

00:19:46.664 --> 00:19:49.620
because me and him [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.286
PROFESSOR: OK, it
goes on a little long.

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:52.744
DJ QBERT: This is
the crab scratch.

00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:01.010
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.844
You guys can go home
and do that now, right?

00:20:02.844 --> 00:20:03.676

00:20:03.676 --> 00:20:05.370
You just use your
thumb as a spring.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.690
But that's a great
example of how

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.210
the DJ mixer and particularly
the cross fader combined

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:20.310
with the variable
playback of the turntable

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.740
really provides a wide
range of different sounds.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.540
Again, we can think of it
as having variable playback

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.060
speed and some frequency
modulation from the turntable.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.440
And we can think of the mixer
as providing a way for us

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.080
to play envelopes and
do amplitude modulation

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.770
to our sounds.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.385
Questions?

00:20:37.385 --> 00:20:37.885
Yeah.

00:20:37.885 --> 00:20:39.480
AUDIENCE: The design of
like two disc turntables

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.240
with the cross
fader was something

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.990
just for queueing and
playing for parties,

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.850
and they made it spinning later?

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.656
PROFESSOR: The
original cross fader?

00:20:47.656 --> 00:20:48.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:48.946
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:48.946 --> 00:20:51.130
It came out of,
I think, the need

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.464
to want to have two records
and have continuous music.

00:20:54.464 --> 00:20:55.880
AUDIENCE: But they
had these kinds

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.010
of things in radio
stations long before--

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.468
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
we're going to get

00:20:59.468 --> 00:21:02.710
to some examples of why
that came about in a bit.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.580
So when we look at the
development of hip hop,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.250
and we look at the
development of turntablism,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.090
it's essential for
us to look back

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:14.930
to the foundations in
Jamaican sound systems.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:20.830
Many of the modern practices
of turntablism, of DJ culture,

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.360
come out of the
Jamaican traditions.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:30.310
You may not know that in
the '50s and into the '60s,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.210
the Jamaicans
developed a wide range

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.110
of different musical
practices and developed

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.210
a very large and robust
recording studio system where

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.630
there were numerous
studios, there

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.910
were numerous independent
Jamaican releases, not only of

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.630
reggae, but a wide variety
of other musical genres.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.650
The genres that we are
concerned about come out

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.692
of a tradition from these
things called sound systems.

00:21:55.692 --> 00:21:57.150
Now you may think
of a sound system

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.340
as a sort of boom
box or something

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.880
you buy at the store, that's
essentially what these were.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.450
But, at the time in
Jamaica, not everybody

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.940
had access to turntables
or amplifiers and speakers,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.350
so those that did
started to hold parties.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.440
And they would have a
sound system, a turntable,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.140
and speakers, and
amplifier, and would

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.850
use these as community
record players.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.480
People would get together and
dance, have fun, have a party,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.850
and this really led to the
culture of the person who

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.480
ran the sound system being in
charge of providing the music,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.370
being in charge of
running the party,

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.750
being in charge of
selecting the music.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.670
The DJs even began to be known
as selectors because they would

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.640
select the music being played.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.210
Clement Dodd, aka
Coxsone, was credited

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.900
with the invention of
this sound system concept.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.230
In the 1950s, he established
a sound system called

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.590
the downbeat sound
system, and he later on

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.850
went to open Studio One
in Kingston in 1963.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.320
So we have this sort
of mixture of somebody

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.920
who starts off sort of as
a performer, as kind of

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.590
like a party organizer,
then moving into the studio

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.240
and becoming a producer and
a studio engineer working

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.230
with people like Bob
Marley and others.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.290
Now the Jamaican
recording industry

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.400
was very active in the 1960s.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.410
They would often release
b-sides of 45 RPM singles.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.040
These b-sides, very often,
were instrumental versions

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.220
of the a-side track.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.820
And these b-sides
offered an opportunity

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.690
for people to remix
and experiment

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.440
with these instrumental tracks.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.250
Two types of experimentation
went on with these b-sides.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.390
One involved manipulating
the sound on these records

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:57.830
and producing remixes and, what
we later began to call, dub.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.130
Another practice that
came out of these b-sides

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.950
was vocalizations, spoken word
over these instrumental tracks.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.810
And many credit the development
of the spoken word traditions,

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.160
often called toasting, as one
of the foundations of modern hip

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.730
hop.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.770
So musicians such
as King Tubby would

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:23.490
take either these instrumental
b-sides or four channel source

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.240
tracks and remix them.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.940
And using basic
studio processors

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.080
available at the time,
things like reverbs,

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.920
echo machines, and
the like, often things

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.500
as simple as variable low
pass and high pass filters,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.150
they would remix tunes
and often manipulate

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.260
the vocals, manipulate
the instruments,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.670
in a way that created
these instrumental

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.550
tunes that we know as dub.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.110
One of the pieces we listened
to for today's class,

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.110
"555 Dub Street,"
is a collaboration

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.340
between Augustus
Pablo and King Tubby.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.780
Pablo was known
for his performance

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.020
on-- what instrument
was that in this piece?

00:25:05.822 --> 00:25:07.970
Is it up there?

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.570
The melodica, an instrument
where you blow air

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.885
into a small little
keyboard that

00:25:13.885 --> 00:25:16.010
allows you to control the
amplitude with your mouth

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.740
and change pitch
with your fingers.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.910
Augustus Pablo performed
on the melodica

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.560
on produced whole recordings.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.090
And in this track, King Tubby
comes in and sort of remixed

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.570
and modifies this track
on top of all of that.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.350
Let's listen to a
little bit of this.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.455
[MUSIC - AUGUSTUS PABLO, "555
 DUB STREET"]

00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:48.670
PROFESSOR: OK, right there,
what did we just hear there?

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.725
AUDIENCE: That's the melodica.

00:25:50.725 --> 00:25:52.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah that's
the melodica entrance,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.922
but did the melodica
sound normal?

00:25:54.922 --> 00:25:57.991
What was going on?

00:25:57.991 --> 00:25:58.990
AUDIENCE: Some feedback.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.100
PROFESSOR: A feedback,
a delay, there's

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.920
a delay that has a high
feedback level that's making it

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.540
you hear an initial
sound, and then it

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.256
continues into a
constant texture.

00:26:08.256 --> 00:26:09.380
Let's listen to that again.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.785
That's probably one of the
most signature sounds of dug.

00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:17.090
First we have a beat, of course,
but then this use of delay

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.980
and echo to smear a sound.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.526
Let's listen to that again.

00:26:21.526 --> 00:26:24.977
[MUSIC - AUGUSTUS PABLO, "555
 DUB STREET"]

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.350
PROFESSOR: Right there.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.010
What we just heard
there can be done

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.380
with basic studio equipment.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.580
You need a delay unit.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.880
You need some faders.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.440
You send the signal to the
delay unit with a high feedback.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.160
It starts to feedback and
produce that continuous sound.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.825
And then he dropped the source
signal the rest of the beat

00:26:54.825 --> 00:26:58.160
so we got that very nice gesture
where we had the feedback going

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.950
on of the melodica and
then beat drops out,

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.700
the beat comes back in, a little
anticipation and response.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.182
Let's hear that again.

00:27:06.182 --> 00:27:09.640
[MUSIC - AUGUSTUS PABLO, "555
 DUB STREET"]

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.100
PROFESSOR: What did we just
hear on the high hats there?

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:36.910
Yeah.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.250
Moving the filters.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.830
Maybe a peak notch or parametric
filter or a low or high pass

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.200
filter with a high resonance
moving across the high hats

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.580
to create that change in timbre,
another very common technique.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.650
[MUSIC - AUGUSTUS PABLO, "555
 DUB STREET"]

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.560
PROFESSOR: So dub exploited
these relatively simple

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.060
techniques of cutting
in and out of parts

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:08.460
using feedback and delay, using
variable filters to create

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.950
really interesting
instrumental music.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.680
That was one tradition
that came out

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.200
of the Jamaican sound systems.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:21.430
Another is this focus on
taking an instrumental track

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.900
and doing something over
that instrumental track.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.930
In the sound system tradition,
the leaders of the sound system

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.350
would want to encourage
people at their party

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.300
to have a good time
and often would

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.360
start toasting or shouting
out to the audience

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.860
as the music was playing.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.550
Often these toasts
would be rhythmitized

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.260
chants of some sort.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.820
And as I said
before, many people

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:49.670
credit this as a key
development to the existence

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.840
of American hip hop.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.710
But more than the sound
system the key person

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.060
that's often looked
to as connecting

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.310
Jamaican sound system
traditions to American hip hop

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.450
is DJ Kool Herc, Clive Campbell.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.760
If we think back to the
People Under the Stairs track

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.430
we started with,
people who still

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.590
live in the folklore of DJ
Kool Herc, the first person

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.810
they mention.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:17.930
Herc moved to the Bronx from
Jamaica in the late '60s

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:23.560
and really transplanted
this sound system concept.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.190
He began throwing parties
in the South Bronx.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.530
He worked with an
MC, Coke La Rock who

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.010
would do some of the
toasting and began

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.490
experimenting with using
two turntables each

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.930
with the same recorded material.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.810
This led him to
develop a technique

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.930
that he called the merry
go round which allowed him

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.750
to cut back and
forth between two

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.930
excerpts from the
same record and extend

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.310
the music for the
sake of dancing,

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.350
for the sake of the party.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:01.430
In an excellent interview
with Terry Gross from 2005,

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.180
he describes this technique
and the development

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.990
of his practice in
detail better than I can.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:12.054
So let's listen to a
little bit of this.

00:30:12.054 --> 00:30:12.720
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.520
TERRY GROSS: You're such an
interesting figure in hip hop.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.150
Everyone who was
there in the beginning

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.660
seems to agree that
you started it all.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.990

PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.390
Yeah his attitude
about what's supposed

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.180
to go on at these
meetings, at these parties

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:07.070
is different than we think of
many hip hop or DJ performers

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.880
these days.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.300
It's not about himself--
well, it is, you see the pride

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.620
he has-- but it's also
about, well, he's a shepherd.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.300
This idea that he's really
concerned about getting people

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.710
to have a good time.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:24.610
His attention to his audience
is what led to his interest

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.640
in the merry go
round in the breaks.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.550
What is he talking about there,
this merry go around technique?

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.725
Ideas?

00:31:30.725 --> 00:31:32.975
And these breaks, first of
all, what are these breaks?

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.820
AUDIENCE: What he was
saying is that people have

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.122
their favorite parts of
the songs that they were

00:31:42.122 --> 00:31:45.632
able to dance to and that have
a little special move and a way

00:31:45.632 --> 00:31:47.630
to do that special
move, and so he just

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.197
figured why not repeat it over
and over again so you can get

00:31:50.197 --> 00:31:52.530
people back on the dance
floor, play their special move.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.196
PROFESSOR: That's
right the breaks would

00:31:54.196 --> 00:31:57.350
be the instrumental break
in a tune, a place where

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.080
the vocals would drop out,
and the rhythm section

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.042
would come forward.

00:32:01.042 --> 00:32:03.042
These would generally be
relatively short, 4, 8,

00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:06.860
16 bars, relatively short parts
where the rhythm section would

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.190
come forward, and these would
have a little bit more energy.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.720
And Herc realized that this
inspired people dance more.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.710
So he developed a technique
to extend the breaks.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:21.230
His technique was to use two
copies of the same record,

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.900
and then while one was playing,
he could spin the other back

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.710
and play the other and switch
back and forth between two

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.620
records with the same
material and extend the break.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.480
He called this the merry
go round technique.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.810
This led to a whole
attention to these breaks,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:45.070
and he mentions a very important
one called Apache which is also

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.510
mentioned by our
friends the People

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.440

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.420

The link for the whole
interview is there.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.250
It's really a great interview.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.590
So, Apache, every b-boy knew it.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:08.110
Apache, probably the most
famous break of all breaks.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.435
It has a long and
complicated history.

00:33:10.435 --> 00:33:14.750
A study of the history of
Apache was done by an author

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.620
by the name Matos called,
"All Roads Lead to Apache."

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.010
You can find the
complete article here.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.720
The history of this
tune is complex

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.390
and comes from various sources.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:30.150
In 1960 there were two
versions of this tune, Apache,

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:35.160
that don't bear much relation to
what we think of now as Apache,

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.387
but we can hear a
little bit of these.

AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.080
PROFESSOR: So that was one
version by Bert Weedon.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.219
Cliff Richard and the
Shadows did another version

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.988
closely related to that version.

00:34:12.988 --> 00:34:15.071

that's closer to rockabilly

00:34:15.071 --> 00:34:16.490
or closer to like Jamaican?

[MUSIC - CLIFF RICHARD AND THE

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.603
PROFESSOR: It's hard
to describe what it is.

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.360
It's hard to say what it is.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.350
But you'll see where it gets
into hip hop in a second.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.496
So here we hear the same melody,
slightly different rhythm

00:34:30.496 --> 00:34:30.996
section.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.760
Now those were the sort
of foundations of Apache.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:45.840
It was the incredible bongo band
with their album, "Bongo Rock"

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:49.090
that provided the break that
excited people like Herc

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.130
and so many others later on.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.260
You'll hear the same melody
there from the 1960 tunes,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.200
but here he adds this
bongo rhythm section

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.617

people's attention.

put this in something

whole study could

be done not only on the
evolution of this tune,

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.400
but the distant and complex
associations and references

Another popular break is often
referred to as the amen break.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:16.820
This again was nicely
taken into a single context

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.530
by the study of someone,
this one was this guy named,

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.350
Harrison, this idea of
studying the history of a break

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.650
as looking at the lineage of
either a sample or a break,

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:32.920
I think, is a really interesting
approach to studying music.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.320
He produced this little audio
documentary called, "Can I

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.070
Get An Amen" where he
looks at this 4 bar

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.210
drum solo from this group
called, The Winstons, that

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.110
was found on a track on
the b-side, a relatively

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.330
unknown tune that
sounded like this.

[MUSIC - THE WINSTONS, "AMEN

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.440
So there we can
really clearly hear

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.440
the break, the part where
the brass section drops out

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.690
and the rhythm
section steps forward.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.800
Does that beat sound
familiar to anybody?

The Nate Harrison
documentary nicely

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.220
describes the different
ways that this was used,

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.340
not only how it was used
in its original form,

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.530
but how was chopped up,
sold, and commodified

in various sampler
libraries and other tools

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.790

and rearranged.

this in different ways.

are maybe a little
bit more distant.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.740
Like the idea of
this beat, I think,

as the original beat,

to suggest that that beat led
to whole genres of music that

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.320
use that style of beat
which gets a little bit more

said for that approach.

is true is hard to say,

hanging out in his basement

listening to a record, and his
mom yelled, hey Grand Wizard!

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.800
of scratching techniques.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.450
He was known for extending
numerous techniques,

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.980
for developing his
own electronics.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.500
He built some basic
electronics, and some

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.980
say that he invented, or at
least refined, the cross fader

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.530
itself.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.200
He, like many
turntablists, came up

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.710
with names for his techniques.

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.590
He describes something
called the quick mix theory,

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.090
or sometimes called a back spin
technique, which is actually

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.750
very similar to Herc's
merry go around.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.540
He also describes techniques
such as the punch phase where

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.340
he would drop in
and out of a record

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.700
to sort of grab
one sample from it.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.630
His well known
composition, "Adventures

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.650
of Grandmaster Flash
on the Wheels of Steel"

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.280
was one of our listenings
for this class.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.628
Let's listen to a little
bit of that to remind us.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.805
PROFESSOR: So
we've already heard

00:43:37.805 --> 00:43:46.090
him switch between three
or four different records.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.710
He was also dropping in and
out doing that punch phase

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.730
technique.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.060
I think that was
the queen example.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.830
In another interview
with Terry Gross,

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.670
Grandmaster Flash
narrates his techniques

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.370
as he listens to this
tune which provides us

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.040
with a really great view
into what he was doing here.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.130
Let's listen to this.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:05.910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.250
GRANDMASTER FLASH: Punch phase.

[INAUDIBLE] Punch phase.

00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:20.291

PROFESSOR: Apache again.

GRANDMASTER FLASH: Cutting
it up, cutting it up.

00:44:46.795 --> 00:44:48.292
Knocking it in.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.405
Punch phase.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.160
PROFESSOR: So there
he's gone around

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.304
in a sort of circle starting
with that good times tune,

00:45:30.304 --> 00:45:32.220
taking a little trip on
these different tunes,

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.500
coming back to where he started.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.930
And this would all
have been done live.

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.260
So not only was he
manipulating his turntables,

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.790
he would also be changing
records, queueing up

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:44.585
the records to just
the right spot,

00:45:44.585 --> 00:45:46.960
and of course having the timing
and skill to execute this

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.174
all without flaw.

00:45:49.174 --> 00:45:51.007
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask what exactly it

00:45:51.007 --> 00:45:52.754
means to queue up a
record, but I guess

00:45:52.754 --> 00:45:55.160
it's just to just
the right spot.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:55.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.960
Well if we have a mixer,
and we have headphones,

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.830
we can listen ahead and get
the record at the right place.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.150
But with the development
of the art of turntablism,

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.940
these DJs would start to
know their records so well,

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.389
that they would simply be
able to see the groove.

00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:12.680
Herc was talking about being
able to see the difference

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.002
in the grooves to know
exactly where to put

00:46:15.002 --> 00:46:16.960
the needle in the right
spot at the right time.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.334
AUDIENCE: So it's usually like
two turntables, one that's

00:46:19.334 --> 00:46:21.612
playing the current record
and one to queue up the--

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:22.320
PROFESSOR: Often.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.810
Some DJs may even
use more than two.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:30.330
But with techniques such as the
merry go round and the like,

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.500
the idea of having two
turntables, I think,

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.860
becomes really widespread.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.490
Other questions?

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:41.350
Now we start to see the DJ
take on the role of a soloist.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:45.080
That Grandmaster Flash, "On
the Wheels of Steel" was 1981,

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.970
but that didn't completely
spread this idea of the DJ

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.440
as a soloist.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.940
And it's with Herbie
Hancock's tune, "Rockit,"

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.650
with DJ grand mixer
DST that we start

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.840
to see the turntablist start to
take on the role of a soloist.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.670
This tune, "Rockit," was
tremendously popular,

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.640
one, because it's a good tune.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.230
Two, it has excellent
scratching and very prominent

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.090
soloistic scratching.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.920
And three, had an
outrageous video which had,

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.570
well, I'll just show it to you.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:26.660

on this video.

What are some interesting
things going on here?

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.430
Anything you see off
the top of your head?

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:30.655
AUDIENCE: Rhythmically
he had the visual rhythm

00:48:30.655 --> 00:48:32.514
along with the acoustic.

00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:33.180

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:33.910
Visual rhythm.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.610
I think that's one
of the key things,

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:40.380
is that the movement of
the automaton, if you will,

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.410
the mannequins and the like,
is synchronized to the rhythm

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.650
and some of the cutting
of the turntable which

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.200
sort of visualizes what's going
on in the turntable in a way

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.830
that people can grasp.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.304
Other things going on in this?

00:48:56.304 --> 00:48:58.400
Do you see any humans?

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:01.140
PROFESSOR: Through
the TV, right.

The only human you
see is Herbie Hancock

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.040
in the distance on black and
white TV, sort of, removed.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.960
And you have these
mannequins, these androids,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.120
sort of, taking over.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.730
You have this sort of
removal of the human which

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:20.200
could be interpreted in a
wide range of different--

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.580
and he's vocoded also.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.790
You can see that he
has a little-- it's

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:28.229
going to be hard to find his
picture-- there's his hands.

It's great.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.140
That video did a lot
to popularize the DJ

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.970
and to allow people
to start to think

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.870
of the turntable as
a solo instrument.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.840
Some people have
tried to transcribe

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.740
what a turntablist
does, and this

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.950
has led to something, an attempt
to this, called the Turntablist

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.730
Transcription Method.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:03.760
This group has produced some
transcriptions of famous DJ

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.850
tunes which allow us to see
a little bit about what's

going on.

[MUSIC - HERBIE HANCOCK,
 "ROCKIT"]

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:18.170
PROFESSOR: Here we can see
a transcription of the solo

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:22.620
from that very
tune, from "Rockit".

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:28.392
We can hear a little bit of the
turntable solo in that tune.

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:30.528
Let me see if I
can find it here.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.060
So the way this works,
it shows the name

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.290
of the sample on the left.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:52.640
So we can see that he's cutting,
scratching over the word fresh.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.130
And these lines represent
changes in pitch

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.330
that happen over time.

00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:00.010
So time is represented
on the x-axis.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:02.300
The y-axis is
showing the time it

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.740
takes to move the sample
over that duration.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.091
Let's look at a little bit.

[MUSIC - HERBIE HANCOCK,

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.550
PROFESSOR: So, pretty cool, huh?

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.380
Now the traditional criteria
we use to evaluate music

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:27.060
often use ideas about a motific
development, presentations

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:32.140
of themes and variation,
repetition, contrast,

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.000
and forward movement.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.203
Do we see any of those
things in this solo here?

00:52:38.203 --> 00:52:38.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:39.867
PROFESSOR: Like what?

00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:42.349
AUDIENCE: You had motifs in
dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:44.890
PROFESSOR: Right, which is an
elaboration of the drum rhythm,

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:47.230
but it's like another
motific thing.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.590
And we can see quite
clearly transcribed here

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:53.220
that it comes at the beginning
of each of the four bar groups.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.840
So we have a very
clear structure

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.050
with an opening motif, a little
bit of variation at the end.

00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:58.550
Good.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.930
What other motifs or
ideas repeat in this tune,

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:02.698
in this solo?

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:10.150
We see this little repeated
rub come back again and again

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:11.510
in different places.

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:15.340
Finally, at the end, and
then in the closing phrase,

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:17.230
we have some nice
variation where

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:19.810
the expectations that have
been established so far,

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:24.540
this opening motif,
is cut up and broken

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:29.120
which creates a little
suspense, a little expectation

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.690
for the final
resolution at the end.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:36.050
This is all done with a
turntable and with scratching.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.020
There are some more
transcriptions here

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.900

briefly to see a little bit

about how this works.

were transcribing cases

one sample being used.

basically one word.

Here they're trying to show
the use of different sources,

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.400
and we can see that he's
going back and forth

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.817
between different sound sources
in the transcription here.

PROFESSOR: So what he's
scratching here though

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.120
is good time.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:26.020
So you see this very clearly
so that the transition

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.740
to the good times becomes very
clear where he's giving you

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.320
a little taste of
it ahead of time.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.287
Yeah, there's more here.

00:55:34.287 --> 00:55:36.370
There's some other
transcriptions on that website.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:37.490
I encourage you to check it out.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:38.990
It's a very nice
approach and really

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:42.500
helps you see a lot of
different things going on.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.560
There are many ways
in which the turntable

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.170
are used in
contemporary practice.

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:52.949
We're going to look
at two in particular.

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.490
The first is probably
the most common

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:58.380
where the turntable is used
in hip hop in combination

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.590
or in alternation with
the drums and the vocals

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:06.450
as a sort of rhythmic
element, as a sort of counter

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:12.480
interjection between the vocals
and between the rhythm section.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.480
Sometimes we see
the turntable take

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.130
on a special role in
the chorus of a song,

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.190
whereas in a rock or
other popular context

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:22.740
the chorus would be filled
by a big sing along.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:26.490
In a hip hop track,
the chorus might simply

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:29.190
be the DJ scratching
or manipulating

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:31.120
some sort of refrain.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.680
Let's listen to a little bit
of Eric B. and Rakim's "I Ain't

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.860
No Joke."

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:39.360
[MUSIC - ERIC B. &amp; RAKIM, "I
 AIN'T NO JOKE"]

00:57:01.994 --> 00:57:03.910
PROFESSOR: So how is the
turntable used there?

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.623
Did you hear the turntable?

00:57:08.623 --> 00:57:12.004
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's sort of
like a secondary track, but.

00:57:12.004 --> 00:57:14.411
The drumbeat's probably
running on a turntable too.

00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:16.410
PROFESSOR: Right, we have
the main beat probably

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.860
on a turntable, but
the scratching here

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.118
is the key thing.

00:57:20.118 --> 00:57:21.993
[MUSIC - ERIC B. &amp; RAKIM, "I
 AIN'T NO JOKE"]

00:57:23.604 --> 00:57:24.600
PROFESSOR: Right there.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.100
Right there.

00:57:32.812 --> 00:57:33.982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:33.982 --> 00:57:34.940
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.648
AUDIENCE: I imagine
the horns [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:36.648 --> 00:57:37.870
sample is spinning over?

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:38.210
PROFESSOR: They could.

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.850
Yeah.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.750
That's a good idea.

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.560
Maybe the horn cut
right there, but how's

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.410
it been used in the
larger musical context?

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:45.090
Did you have an idea?

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:47.715
AUDIENCE: I agree with
[INAUDIBLE] point.

00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:51.460
He gives you a little
bit of that sample.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.210
PROFESSOR: Right so
it's sort of a preview

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.390
like we saw with the
Grandmaster Flash track.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:57.330
Other ideas?

00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:59.330
AUDIENCE: It's sort of
like he's said something,

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.914
it's like it's a response
to what he's saying.

00:58:01.914 --> 00:58:03.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah it's
sort of a response,

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.030
and it's filling this
gap after the verse

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:09.350
before it comes down to the
downbeat of the next phrase.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.390
So it's sort of a
little rhythmic tension

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.920
to push you at the
end of the phrase

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.450
into the downbeat
of the next phrase.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.325
[MUSIC - ERIC B. &amp; RAKIM, "I
 AIN'T NO JOKE"]

00:58:21.442 --> 00:58:23.900
PROFESSOR: He's getting in
right where the vocals drop away

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.066
with these little scratches.

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.480
Now let's listen to the chorus.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.250
So that's so weird.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.000
That's the weirdest thing.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.560
So we hear there the
chorus being taken

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.250
or by this role of scratching.

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:25.444
Instead of, again, the sort
of big unified singing portion

00:59:25.444 --> 00:59:27.860
we typically associate with
the chorus, we have the chorus

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:32.010
replaced by DJ scratching.

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:34.730
Now for an example of some of
the most modern techniques,

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:39.190
I had you guys listen
to DJ Babu, DJ Qbert,

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:43.080
DJs [? Mellow ?], a group
called D-Styles doing a tune

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.860
from 2002 called
"Felonius Funk".

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.488
Let's listen to a
little bit of this.

00:59:47.488 --> 00:59:50.974
[MUSIC - D-STYLES, "FELONIUS
 FUNK"]

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:41.030
PROFESSOR: So we heard
there probably two DJs each

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.920
taking solo breaks.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.910
This is a solo DJ
tune, and they're

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.740
treating this sort
of as a jazz context.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.540
There's a rhythm section
going on, a rhythm, a beat,

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.960
and they're each taking
solos over this beat.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.770
Can you generalize
about the techniques,

01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:57.240
or what musically is going
on in those passages there?

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.650
AUDIENCE: Are they
cutting up the main beat?

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:02.220
PROFESSOR: The main beat
seems pretty constant.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.280
It seems like they probably
have one DJ probably playing

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.740
the beat, and then they're
cutting up other things.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.264
What are they using as
their scratch material?

01:02:11.264 --> 01:02:12.719
AUDIENCE: Some vocal words.

01:02:12.719 --> 01:02:14.760
PROFESSOR: Some sort of
vocal word, that's right.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.170
And how was it
musically deployed?

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:20.880
Did you guys notice
what's going on?

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.090
Does it sound unified?

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:23.050
Does it sound musical?

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:23.910
Do here a phrase?

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:27.310
Does it sound like a solo?

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.910
Did it have coherence,
or did it sound

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.810
like it was wandering just
scratching and revving

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:32.520
over the place?

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.610
AUDIENCE: You heard
the repetition

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:37.455
and some special motifs
going back and forth,

01:02:37.455 --> 01:02:39.704
so it definitely had
some musical qualities.

01:02:39.704 --> 01:02:40.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:43.160
Anybody else hear anything
in particular in this?

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.450
I think this is a really great
example because in many ways

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:50.620
it shows what we've seen
many times in our look

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.840
at music and technology.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.870
It shows an attention to
an economy of resources.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.340
Using a small bit of
something and extending it out

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:02.360
and manipulating it
in a variety of ways.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.297
The opening solo here.

[MUSIC - D-STYLES, "FELONIUS

01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:08.710
PROFESSOR: After this
little part here.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.930
This whole passage from here
to the end of this phrase

01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:21.930
is all one phrase,
someone saying, oh my god.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.140
So it's a woman
saying, oh my god,

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.140
and the DJ is
scratching that one

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.140
phrase for this entire passage.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.550
And in a way it's
sort of a game.

01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:33.410
You start to hear the words come
out until finally at the end

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.814
you hear it very clearly.

01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:36.314

PROFESSOR: The
[? goddess ?] transformed

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.920
into the melodic passage, yeah.

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:22.360
So three words used as a sonic
and motific source, carefully

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.090
deployed, built
upon, and extended

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.970
to create what, I think,
is a very coherent solo.

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:29.710

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.220
PROFESSOR: What is the
phrase being cut up here?

[MUSIC - D-STYLES, "FELONIUS

01:04:57.929 --> 01:04:59.720
PROFESSOR: Everybody
hear it now, say what.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.980
Again this economy
of resources, this

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.694
using a small bit of
material as a source

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.360
for an extended
composition is something

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.585
you've seen time and time
again, in many of the works

01:05:11.585 --> 01:05:12.460
that we've looked at.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.490
Think of Hugh Le
Caine's "Dripsody"

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.710
a composition that
used one sample,

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.820
one taped piece of
sound as a source

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.660
for the entire composition.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:25.210
Think of the rigorous
application of tape techniques

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:27.590
by Cage or others.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:31.260
This idea of using a small bit
of material and extending it

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:35.460
is so common in the
tradition of music and one

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:38.802
then we see here employed
on the turntable.

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:40.510
Now the last thing
we're going to look at

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:44.040
is what I consider the sort of
abstraction of the turntable,

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.804
pulling out the most essential
feature of the turntable.

01:05:48.804 --> 01:05:50.470
And as we talked about
in the beginning,

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:54.230
the most essential features
seem to be the ability

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:58.450
to control the speed of a
rotating disc that combined

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.420
with a mixer and a cross fader.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.730
But this idea of a
rotating disk that

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:09.810
somehow gives a useful interface
for controlling musical time.

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:13.800
One reason the rotating disc
is useful for controlling

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.950
musical time is because
it has momentum.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:19.220
When you have a
rotating disc, there's

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:23.490
a very tactile connection,
and you gradually

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:25.510
can speed it up or slow it down.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:28.140
It has a sense of
momentum because it's

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.100
going so that it takes
force to slow it down.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.370
And if you let go it
gradually speeds up.

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:38.910
That issue of momentum of
rotation tied to musical time

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:40.120
is very important.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.640
It's not found on a
digital audio file.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.130
We can start and stop
a digital audio file.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:49.190
There is no momentum to the
playback of digital audio,

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:53.730
unless of course we build
models that incorporate that.

01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.420
So various approaches
have been proposed

01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:01.860
to keep this rotating disc, this
rotating platter, available.

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.310
This Technics SL
D7-1200, this device

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:07.290
seems to be
discontinued, allowed

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:11.530
you to enter a CD into this slot
here and control its play back

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.210
with the rotating disk.

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:16.780
This is very much like
the SL-1200 turntable.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.180
It's the exact same
platter, but the platter,

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.600
notice there's no tone arm,
there's no record needle,

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.980
the platter is controlling,
exclusively, the playback

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.940
of the content found on a disc.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.370
Another approach, this
one by TASCAM, the TTM 1

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:38.370
uses a little component
to ride on the disc

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.150
and track its motion.

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:43.750
That tracked motion of
the rotation of the disk,

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:46.520
again, incorporating any
changes in playback speed

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.770
by the operator, is used to
provide a control signal that

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:54.650
works only with their
proprietary CD players found

01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:55.290
here.

01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:58.200
But this allows you
to use the turntable

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.303
as a controller for the playback
of stored digital audio.

01:08:01.303 --> 01:08:03.594
AUDIENCE: It looks like the
most expensive possible way

01:08:03.594 --> 01:08:05.280
to do that.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.440
PROFESSOR: Expensive, well,
and also probably error

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.440
prone, right?

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.780
Because you could
imagine the contact here

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.560
may not be very reliable.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.060
This wheel might slip.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.939
They still make this product.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:22.370
The approach that has found
the most widespread use

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:23.600
goes under various names.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.459
It's now owned by the
Rane Corporations.

01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:27.439
It's called Serato Scratch.

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:28.960
There's various
versions of this,

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.750
but the way that
this system works

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:33.347
is you use your
conventional turntables

01:08:33.347 --> 01:08:35.180
that you've invested
hundreds of dollars in.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.529
You use your mixer which you've
already invested a lot of money

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:39.100
in.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.890
But instead of playing records
that have music on them,

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.830
you play records that have
a specially encoded control

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:46.609
signal.

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:49.540
This control signal
is tracked out

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.680
of the output of the
turntables by the computer.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.460
The control signal is
formatted in a way such

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.140
that variations in
playback speed which

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.930
may result by you changing the
playback speed with the slider

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:06.279
or by scratching are
captured by the computer

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:09.779
and can be applied to
any digital audio file.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:12.910
So this allows you to
use your old turntables

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:18.859
as control surface for
digital audio files stored

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:20.529
on your computer in any format.

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:24.504
This literally lets
you scratch your MP3s.

01:09:24.504 --> 01:09:28.974
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
still has the problem of wear?

01:09:28.974 --> 01:09:32.350
Old discs wear out and then you
still have to buy more records.

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.460
But I think it's more
probably more accurate,

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.950
and these control records
are relatively inexpensive

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:40.120
and probably last as
long as any record does.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.723
So it may not be
a major concern.

01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:43.264
AUDIENCE: Do you
know of anyone who's

01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:45.579
used the degradation of
these control devices.

01:09:45.579 --> 01:09:46.370
PROFESSOR: I don't.

01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:49.020
But that's a really
interesting thing to look at.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:53.084
I don't also know exactly how
the control signal is encoded.

01:09:53.084 --> 01:09:54.500
We could imagine
a couple of ways.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.750
It could be some sort of
binary spacing of clicks

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.642
that it looks at, how close
the clicks get together.

01:10:00.642 --> 01:10:02.350
They might try another
approach, but it's

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:05.500
interesting to think about
how that system works.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.730
The control software
for this is fantastic.

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:11.270
It not only shows
you the waveforms

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:14.410
coming through which makes
it easy to beat match

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.640
by matching up the
lines here, and it

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.860
lets you queue up other songs
for each virtual turntable

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.740
and do a lot of
other fun things.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.890
If you go to guitar center,
go to the DJ section,

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.300
you can try this out,
it's quite a bit of fun.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.700
Now that's expensive
because you still

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.630
have to have real
turntables, and a lot of DJs

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.310
really like this
approach because they

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:39.010
can use their
existing turntables.

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:42.290
Furthermore, if they
want to combine a vinyl

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:45.900
disc on one turntable and a
digital audio file on another,

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.670
they can mix and match with
the Serato Scratch system

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:54.430
Other sort of hybrid systems
are things like this Numark NS-7

01:10:54.430 --> 01:11:02.030
which combines-- notice these
are 78 size disc-- which

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.980
combines this.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:06.970
Notice there's also
no tone arm here.

01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:10.970
So this device provides
an integrated control

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:12.450
where you can
control the playback

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:14.260
speed with these discs.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.200
The mixer and other
tools are built in,

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.040
but again, it's all
controlling digital audio

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.610
stored on the computer.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:26.080
Here, presumably, the actual
movement of the platter

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.780
is what is used to
control the playback

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.640
speed of the digital audio.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.240
But this, again,
is another approach

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.690
of abstracting out this
essential feature of momentum

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:39.170
based playback model.

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.780
So I like to look at what
we've looked at here as sort

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.910
of trajectory from
first coercion.

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.790
Taking a device that
was not intended

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:52.040
to be used as a
soloistic instrument

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.610
and refining the
number of techniques

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:58.220
out of this process of
coercion and then, now

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.900
that that's sort of
solidified, what would the term

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.250
be that Biker might
give to that sort

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.475
of the scratching techniques?

01:12:04.475 --> 01:12:07.010
Sort of reach a
sense of closure,

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:09.630
we see a sort of
next stage where

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:12.290
now the essential
features of the turntable

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:15.270
are being abstracted,
pulled out, and made

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.420
into a number of
devices that provide

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.300
similar control but a
totally different playback

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.760
mechanism that is
reading digital audio off

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.300
of a computer or
other stored data.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:26.800
Ideas?

01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:34.200
Can you imagine other types
of momentum based controllers

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.440
we might have if we imagine
what the next stage.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.270
Will people continue to
use things like Serato

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:44.010
with conventional
turntables, or might we

01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.360
imagine other
interfaces that will

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.110
allow DJs to do what
they've done for the last 30

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:52.237
or 40 years but in
alternative ways?

01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:53.820
AUDIENCE: Like surface
tables that you

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:57.942
could sort of show
images and work off that.

01:12:57.942 --> 01:12:58.900
PROFESSOR: That's true.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.483
I mean, we do see this interest
in touch screens and the like,

01:13:01.483 --> 01:13:04.660
and you could
visualize the screen.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.370
But I think the
problem there would

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:10.410
be that you don't have momentum,
you can't feel the speed,

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:12.860
and I think that's a
very important feature

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.072
of turntablism.

01:13:14.072 --> 01:13:15.530
And I think that's
something that's

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:18.080
retained in the abstractions
that we see there.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.370
I think that really illustrates
a good point because there's

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:24.580
something in the contact,
in that sense of momentum

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.820
of having to physically
spinning disc,

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.810
that seems to be really
important to turntable

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:29.310
practice.

01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:30.605
AUDIENCE: Do all of those
actually rotate though?

01:13:30.605 --> 01:13:32.474
I know some of the
CD DJ interfaces

01:13:32.474 --> 01:13:33.390
don't actually rotate.

01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:35.880
PROFESSOR: Some don't rotate.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.360
There are some
that don't rotate.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.580
They just give you a big
button that you can move,

01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.100
but it doesn't seem like DJs
are really attracted to those.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.730
The ones that DJs
seem to be attracted

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:47.250
are the ones that actually
represent playback time

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:51.190
in some sort of
rotational sense.

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:53.710
Other ideas?

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:55.180
AUDIENCE: What about DJ Hero?

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.890
PROFESSOR: DJ Hero,
how does that work?

01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:00.680
AUDIENCE: It's one
turntable, a cross fader,

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.170
the turntable has
buttons on it, and you

01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:05.460
scratch like the
two outer buttons

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.320
you hold down while scratching.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.840
And that's how you can--

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.735
PROFESSOR: Do you have to move
the cross fader to succeed?

01:14:11.735 --> 01:14:12.630
Do you have to--

01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:15.164
AUDIENCE: Move the cross
fader into the three positions

01:14:15.164 --> 01:14:15.984
or whatever.

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.400
But the weird thing with the
scratching is it doesn't spin

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.328
or anything.

01:14:19.328 --> 01:14:21.542
It's a lightweight
turntable hand.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.500
It's hard to press a
button and scratch a thing

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.840
at the same time.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.690
PROFESSOR: That's great.

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:30.650
Well you can all play DJ Hero
or just go to guitar center

01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:31.930
and tryout Serato Scratch.

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:32.860
It's really fun.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.910
Great, I'll see
you guys next time.
