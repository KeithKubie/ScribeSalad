because the spacecraft to be going very

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
because the spacecraft to be going very
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.930
because the spacecraft to be going very
very fast in order to get out there and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
very fast in order to get out there and
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.110
very fast in order to get out there and
get an orbit around Europa without just

smashing into it so when you said the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
smashing into it so when you said the
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.979
smashing into it so when you said the
Earth's surface I bet you meant the

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
Earth's surface I bet you meant the
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.889
Earth's surface I bet you meant the
Europan Ian surface you'd the Europa and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
Europan Ian surface you'd the Europa and
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.210
Europan Ian surface you'd the Europa and
surface so along this line I'm reluctant

believe and he wants it so that she will

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
believe and he wants it so that she will
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240
believe and he wants it so that she will
know whether or not there were life on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
know whether or not there were life on
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980

it there's life on Europa just like you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
it there's life on Europa just like you
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.870
it there's life on Europa just like you
and so he he has put in the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
and so he he has put in the
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.830

tether a big cable so this thing would

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
tether a big cable so this thing would
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.500
tether a big cable so this thing would
melt through 20 kilometers of ice

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510

there's a very

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
there's a very

fifteen miles of ice and look around in

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300
fifteen miles of ice and look around in
 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.800
fifteen miles of ice and look around in
the your romanian ocean it would be an

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810
the your romanian ocean it would be an
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390
the your romanian ocean it would be an
extraordinary thing then this is a cool

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
extraordinary thing then this is a cool
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.100
extraordinary thing then this is a cool
thing and we're very excited about it at

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
thing and we're very excited about it at

other side will cancel that that money
 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.730
other side will cancel that that money
set aside but we'll see

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740
set aside but we'll see
 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.100
set aside but we'll see
either way there is a mission going to

either way there is a mission going to
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770
