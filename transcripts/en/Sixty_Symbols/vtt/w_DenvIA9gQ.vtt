00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.900
So c, little c, the speed of light, probably one of the most famous symbols in physics.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.400
Certainly it appears in the most famous equation: E=m c squared

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.500
The c in there is the speed of light.
It really is one of the most fundamental constants.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.700
- c, small c, means the speed of light.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.900
That's what, three times ten to the eighth metres per second.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.400
So three hunderd million meters per second. So it's fast, but not infinitly fast.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.900
- It really is the ultimate constant in physics.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.800
In the sense that it really is the same, whoever measures it.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.550
That's what lies at the heart of special relativity,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.600
this idea that the universe is a relative sort of place.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.600
One of the precepts of special relativity is that the laws of physics

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.100
are the same in any reference frame, if you're stationary or moving

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.200
you should see the same laws of physics.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.700
- Why is the speed of light c?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.500
- Why is it said to be c or called c? That I don't know.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.800
I really don't know why that constant has been defined as being called c.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
I'd be interested to know if Mike knows.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.500
- Maybe because it is thought to be a fundamental constant.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
c for constant, but I don't really know.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.700
- People are kind-of used to the idea that speeds add.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.500
So that if you see an aircraft taking off from an aircraft carrier,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
if you want to know how fast the aircraft is going,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.400
you have to add how fast the aircraft is moving relative to the aircraft carrier,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.400
to how fast that was moving forward, so the total speed is the sum of the two.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.500
People are very used to that and you use that kind of calculations,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.000
eg. to calculate how fast a car is coming towards you.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.000
You're measuring realtive speeds of things.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.200
But the weird thing about light is, because the speed is always the same, it doesn't add in that way.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.500
So if you're moving in a train and shine a flashlight from the train,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.700
and you measure the speed that the light comes out of the flashlight at,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.100
it comes out at exactly the same speed as if you weren't on the train.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.800
So, speeds don't add. The speed of light, whoever measures it,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.500
however you produce the light, always is the same value, c.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
That's not quite true, that's the speed of light in a vacuum.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.100
There are ways to slow light down.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.500
If light travels through air it travels a little more slowly.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.800
It can never go faster than in a vacuum, you can make it slow down.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.900
People will do sophisticated experiments in a laboratory, to slow down light to a snails pace,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
by messing around with the refractive index of a material.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.200
Messing around with the properties of the material it is propagating through.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.500
You can make it slow down, you can never exceed the speed that it goes in a vacuum.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.300
So c is in that sense a cosmic speed limit, it it the fastest there is.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.900
- Does it have much to do with in your speciality, is c very important to you?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.900
- For my evening, weekend thinking about physics, yes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.400
Because I like to read books about cosmology and thinking about things like that.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.800
For most of the experiments we do in this lab, we're looking at electrons in semiconductors

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.100
which are moving well below the speed of light, typically about one hunderdth of the speed of light.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.300
- How do we measure the speed of light?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.900
- It's a quite difficult thing to measure, for a long time the experiments were quite crude

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.900
and the constraint we had on the speed of light were quite limited.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.300
Some of the best measurements we have today are by using radar echos off things.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.800
You can bounce a radarbeam of things, because it is called the speed of light,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
but ofcourse all the electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.400
If it is a radio wave, an x-ray, optical light it all travels at the same speed.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.400
By bouncing radio waves off things, we can measure the speed pretty accurately.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.300
Because light travels extremely fast, 3 times 10 to the eighth metres per second,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
that's 300 million metres every second light travels at.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.300
Obviously you can't sit there with a stop-watch and measure it that way, it's too fast.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
Unless you can find something that's a long way away.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.800
So bouncing light off the moon or other planets is by using strong radar signals,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.400
is a very good way of measuring how fast that light's going.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.200
- Do you know exactly what it is?

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.400
I can't tell you exactly because it is defined with an afwul lot of decimal places.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.800
And one of the nice things about astronomy is we rarely need to know things very accurately.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.400
For astronomers purposes it is 300 million metres per second,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.500
but actually it isn't exactly 300 million metres per second.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.300
Yes, it's something like 2.99 ... eight ... times ten to the eighth metres per second.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.600
but I can't remember that exactly, three point zero zero or 3.00 times 10 to the 8th is a very good approximation.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.100
- Oh yeah 3 times ten to the eighth metres a second.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.200
- I cheat, I've a pocket calculator with all these physical constants in it.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.600
I just press the little button marked 'c' to get it in the display.
