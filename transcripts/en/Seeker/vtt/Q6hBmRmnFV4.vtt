00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.939
Do galaxies form because a bunch of baby stars
were all born at the same time, or are they

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:11.980
hideous frankenstein monsters of galaxies
past?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.900
Hey space surfers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.400
You’d think we know everything there is
to know about galaxies by this point.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.980
I mean, we live in one, and when we look outside
of it, we think there are at least 2 trillion

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
more.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
And that’s just in our slice of universe
that we can actually observe!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.390
So there’s no shortage of samples to study,
and yet we still have some very basic, very

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.650
unanswered questions.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.949
Like, how do galaxies form?

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.149
There’s no definitive model, but we thought
we had a pretty good idea until recent discovery

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.960
has raised some eyebrows.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.429
Scientists studying a protogalaxy 10 billion
light years away known as the Spiderweb noticed

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.999
that the large cloud of gas had young stars
popping up all across it.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.660
They were jumping to life out of the -200
celcius gas, which surprised the astronomers

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.749
who were expecting something completely different.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.839
This discovery supports something called the
top-down approach of galaxy formation, which

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.499
posits that the first galaxies started from
huge gas clouds that had enough internal gravity

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.890
to collapse and begin star formation until
the clouds fragmented and became separate

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.890
galaxies.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.890
The other bottom-up model is more widely accepted.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.420
It says stars formed in smaller clumps early
after the Big Bang.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.680
These clumps then mashed into and merged with
other clumps, getting bigger and bigger until

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.141
they reached galactic proportions and settled
into orderly structures like the spiral and

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:31.899
elliptical shapes we see in more recent galaxies
around us.This idea is supported by the fact

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.960
that we observe a lot more small galaxies
than large ones, and when we look back we

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.929
see clumpy looking galaxies and plenty of
mergers.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.020
In fact we think that nearly all massive galaxies
went through a merger at least once by the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.329
time the universe was 6 billion years old.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.820
So there’s evidence that supports both models.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.330
And of course, there are combinations of the
two models, and some even incorporate dark

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.890
matter maps to help explain why the gas clumped
where it did.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.829
But these are just ideas, we need to look
back even farther to actually see what was

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.819
going on in newborn galaxies.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.479
Right now the Hubble telescope’s infrared
instruments can look back to within hundreds

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.540
of millions of years after the Big Bang, but
that’s not quite far enough.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.920
That’s part of why the James Webb Space
Telescope is such a big deal, it’ll allow

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.970
us to look farther into the past than we ever
have before.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.790
Happily I will leave you with a mini mystery
that scientists think they’ve solved.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.270
The question of the roles supermassive black
holes play when a galaxy is first emerging

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.040
from the cosmic soup was long the chicken-and-egg
dilemma of galaxy formation.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
We find these extremely dense points in space
at the center of most galaxies, and it’s

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.820
thought that their gravity anchors the whole
thing.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.980
So do the galaxies condensing cause a black
hole to form, or does the black hole come

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.510
first and help to pull the gas cloud together?

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.750
For that pickle, it looks like it’s the
latter.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.840
While galaxies today appear to be proportional
to the mass of their central black holes,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.410
early galaxies have disproportionately large
black holes by comparison, suggesting the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.290
black holes come first.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.340
That answers that, but there are plenty more
mysteries out there, and maybe one day we’ll

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.910
know just how our cosmic home came to be.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.880
So our galaxy has almost definitely been through
a merger before, and we’re going to do it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.010
again with our galactic neighbor, Andromeda.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.130
Now to brush up on it before it gets here,
check out Julia’s video right.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.660
So are you team top-down or a bottom-up kinda
guy or gal?
