&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.840
My name is Kevin Larimer.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.730
I am the editor in chief of
Poets and Writers Magazine

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.660
and I am delighted to
be here with you all.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.610
I want to thank the
Library of Congress

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.850
for bring us all together
to celebrate books

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.170
and the authors who write them.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.480
At Poets and Writers, I've
devoted the last 19 years

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.040
to doing exactly that, so I'm
especially happy to be here

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.560
on this stage in the
country's capital.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.970
I'd also like to acknowledge the
national endowment for the arts

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.050
for sponsoring this specific
event, and I'm honored

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.080
to be joined here today by two

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.670
of the country's
brightest literary minds,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.280
Lorrie Moore and Richard Russo.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.960
So I'm going to offer a sort
of brief introduction for both

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.660
of them just to remind us all of
their amazing accomplishments,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.550
and then we will talk for a
bit about writing and reading

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.290
and books, and then we will
pause for ten or 15 minutes

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.970
of questions from the audience,
so certainly, you know,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.270
be thinking about what you'd

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.010
like to ask these
esteemed authors here.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.310
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And
how about the lights?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.610
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: The lights?

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.910
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Can we
ask about the lights?

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.210
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: I'm being
asked if the lights could come

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.510
down just a little bit.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.810
We're kind of a little --

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.110
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
Blinded by the light.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.410
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.710
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
Blinded is the word.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.010
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: That's a great
song, blinded by the light.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.310
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I feel
like I'm about to be beaten

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.890
with a rubber hose, actually.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.430
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: I don't
know if it's possible to --

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.730
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
It might not be.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.530
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: --
lower those a little bit.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.830
Okay.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.130
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: They're
not listening to us.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.630
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Okay,
well, hopefully they'll --

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.930
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Oh, well.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.210
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
-- dim as we go.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.030
Okay. So Lorrie Moore is the
Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.770
professor of English at
Vanderbilt University.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.720
She is the recipient of the
Irish Times International Prize

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.350

Foundation fellowship,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.890
and a National Endowment for
the Arts fellowship as well

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730
as the PEN/Malamud
Award and the Rea Award

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.530
for her achievement
in the short story.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.310
Moore has written five story
collections, including Birds

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.470
of America and most recently,
Bark, and three novels,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.360
including Gate at the Stairs.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
Her new book is See What Can
Be Done: Essays, Criticism,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.820
and Commentary, published
earlier this year by Knopf.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.600
Richard Russo's novels
included Everybody's Fool

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.870
and That Old Cape Magic.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.570
In 2002, he was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize in Fiction

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.660
for Empire Falls,
which was adapted

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.140
into a award-winning
miniseries by HBO.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.740
He's also published
story collections,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.890
most recently Trajectory
in 2017.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.570
His new book of essays
is The Destiny Thief:

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.040
Essays on Writing,
Writers, and Life,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.880
published earlier this
year again by Knopf.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.510
How about a round of applause
for our esteemed author?

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.430
[ Applause ]

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.380
Okay, so I have to say I had
to chuckle just a little bit

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.980
when I discovered the
title for the conversation

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.370
that we're supposed to
be having, which is --

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.280
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You
chuckled, we cried.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.580
We wept.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.210
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: But the
title here is How Writers Think

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.510
and Work.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.810
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.110
I passed out briefly.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.410
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: So we have

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.710
about 45 minutes
left, so Richard --

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.330
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: They
rejected the If Writers Think

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.560
and just went to, yeah.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.860
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: So how do
you think, Richard, you know?

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.160
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: What's that?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.460
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
And if writers work.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
How do you think?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.060
No, just kidding.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.360
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.660
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Okay, so.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.960
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Slowly.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.260
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: I've
been reading, you know,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.560
the two new books, and
they're both fantastic reads.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.970
If you guys haven't picked
them up, I really recommend it.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.690
It's like sitting
down and talking shop

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.800
with two real masters
of the craft,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.100
so thank you for these books.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.730
They're great, and it's been
really interesting to read them

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.000
in preparation for this evening

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.020
because there are some
really interesting points

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.320
of intersection.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.350
For example, humor.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.280
Okay, so Richard, in a
chapter titled The Gravestone

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.670
and the Commode in
your book, you write --

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.070
I know, it's a great
chapter title --

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.470
"Because humor looks easy,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.140
people want to know
how it's done.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.510
My writing students used to ask,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.280
'How do you make
things so funny?'

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.260
to which I usually replied,
'I don't make anything funny.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.180
I'm simply reporting the world
as I find it.'" And you know,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.530
earlier this week, I was
actually in Tennessee

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.510
and southwestern Virginia for
work, and I was eating dinner

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.290
at a diner, and I was the only
one there who was eating alone,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.640
and I was the only one eating
alone while reading a book,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.150
and I was the only one
reading alone, reading a book,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.520
and laughing out loud to myself.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.860
It was your story
collection, Bark.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.160
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Oh.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.800
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: And the
first story in that collection,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.720
Debarking, I believe
it's called, --

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.020
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Right.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.320
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: -- is
just laugh-out-loud funny.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.060
They looked at me
like I was crazy.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.360
So it's very funny.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.660
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Nobody
came in and shot you.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.960
It wasn't a Waffle House.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.260
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: No.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.560
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Okay.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.860
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: It was
not a Waffle House, no.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.160
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: All right.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.460
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: But you know,
you've both been rightly praised

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.160
for the humor in your fiction,
and I won't ask how either

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.090
of you do it, you
know, to your point,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.170
but I would like to know
whether you can sort

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.330
of identify anything in your
life that has made you able,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.380
you know, as Richard writes
to, you know, report the world

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.680
as you find it in this way.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.440
You know, was humor valued

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.030
in your family during your early
life in a way that sort of kind

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.160
of programmed you to see
the world in this way?

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.070
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Why are you
looking -- you're looking at me?

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.370
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.670
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Should I start?

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.970
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You begin.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.270
You begin.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.570
We're both from upstate
New York.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.870
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.170
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: So clearly,
it's in the water up there.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.470
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
That's what it is.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.770
That's it.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.070
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: That's it.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.370
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: We can
leave it right there.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.670
If you're from upstate New
York, you got a chance.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.550
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: It's in
the Hudson River valley.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.310
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I think I
discovered my voice as a kind

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.670
of comic writer when I
began actually to look

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.020
at my father differently,
because my parents separated

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.800
when I was a kid in
small-town upstate New York.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.300
I didn't know anybody else
whose parents had separated.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.510
My parents hadn't divorced yet,
but I was living with my parents

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.470
and my maternal grandparents,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.810
and they were all
wonderful, wonderful people.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.110
I wouldn't have said necessarily

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.870
that humor was their
strong suit,

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.960
but they were wonderful
people, and I owe them more

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.810
than I could ever express, but
because I was living, I think,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.970
with them, who my father was

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.970
and what his story was wasn't
immediately apparent to me

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.470
when I was growing up, and I
only really kind of met him

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.090
when I was -- I don't know.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.830
I mean he was always around
on the periphery of my life,

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.220
but he wasn't really part of
my life until I was a teenager,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.700
and it was only then that
I began to process the fact

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.610
that he was really funny.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.180
He was a wonderful storyteller,
just a magnificent bullshitter,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.250
and for any of you who
have read the two novels

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.360
that Donald Sullivan
is in, Sully,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.570
those two books were
based on my father.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.660
I took wide, deep liberties,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.370
but he was a magnificent
storyteller,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.870
and I used to listen
to him tell stories

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.950
because he was a little bit
like Mark Twain, in the sense

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.080
that he used every
single audience, you know.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.670
He paid attention to
when people laughed

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.330
and when their attention
began to drift away.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.630
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And
he fine-tuned it.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.930
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.230
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.530
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
And the next time --

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.830
and it was always from
one bar to another

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.650
that we were going to, usually
on the way home from work,

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:57.020
and I began to understand,
and a lot of the guys,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.040
a lot of the guys
that he worked with,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.960
all road construction workers,
they were all funny, too.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.670
They lived hard lives,
but they were all funny,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.320
funny guys, and I would listen.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.430
I would watch my father tell
stories, and he was so --

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.670
and he was so funny,
and he got funnier,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.990
and always the best thing about
him was that there was a --

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.300
usually after he'd told
the story about 20 times

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.720
and he'd really,
really fine-tuned it,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.740
then the next day, he
would tell it to me,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.220
having completely forgotten
that I was there, you know.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.830
And so what happened to me at
some point was that I began

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.470
to have, I think,
my own, and I was --

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.130
now we're fast-forwarding
probably to almost the age of 30

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.560
and when I'd been trying
to be a writer for a while,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.830
and we finally -- and I finally
got to the point where it began

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.810
to dawn on me that
all of that stuff --

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.790
that I'd been listening
to my father tell stories,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.710
his mannerisms, his
vocal mannerisms,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.070
also the way he revised, the way
he paid attention to audience --

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.960
that all of that was stuff
that I could actually use,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.200
and I'd been completely
ignoring it,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.000
as if it were absolutely
valueless.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.140
So that was a turning -- that
was a turning point for me.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.370
I really wanted to
be a serious writer.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.280
I take comedy seriously, but I
wanted to be a "serious" writer,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.370
and it was when I began to
understand what my father was --

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.810
what my father had to offer me
and my life, not just as his son

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.010
but as a writer, that some
of that began to crystallize.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.220
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: How
about you, Lorrie?

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.270
Did you have something
in your --

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.460
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You know,
I think everyone I knew

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.530
from the beginning
of my life was funny.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.440
My father, too, was very
funny and would tell --

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.390
he was also a great storyteller.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.810
I was never a great storyteller,
but I paid attention

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.920
to how he told jokes, how
he told funny stories,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.160
and I told -- and I
paid attention to how --

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.050
-- everyone at a gathering, just
like if you're getting together

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.460
with friends for drinks,
if you're getting together

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.060
with your family for dinner,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.170
everyone around the table
is funny at least once,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.260
at least once, and then
if you pay attention

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.970
to what makes it funny,
then you start to sort

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.160
of understand comedy a
little more and understand it

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.520
as the grammar of
conversation --

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.820
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.120
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
-- and socializing.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.420
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.030
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: No one gets
together not to have a laugh.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.910
Everyone gets together
to have a laugh,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.780
and there's nothing funnier
than a memorial service, right?

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.080
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Absolutely.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.070
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: It's totally a
cross between standup and death.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.370
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, yes.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.670
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
It's really crazy.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, and
sometimes standup winning,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.360
too, you know, strangely.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.490
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah, yeah,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.950
and so comedy's just
there in our DNA.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.530
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And writers
become alert to it, I think,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.690
and want to sort of put it
in there with the tragedy

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.590
and with the other
things that --

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:09.890
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.250
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: --
life consists of.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.550
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: So it sounds

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.670
like what you're both saying
is it's sort of a natural way

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.330
of perceiving things and of
course it's going to show

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.310
up in your work,
rather than like a tool

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.610
in your toolbox that --

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.910
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Right.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.210
That's what I think.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: --
you're pulling out.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.810
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
That's what I think.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.110
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.410
Okay.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.710
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Although
it does beg a question

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.310
of why we don't see
more of it --

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.610
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.910
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: -- if it's
a tool in everyone's toolbox,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.210
and as Lorrie says, and I
completely agree, that no,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.510
we don't get together
to have a bad time.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.810
We get together to have laughs.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.110
We get to --

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.410
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.710
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: And it is.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.010
I love what you said about
being the grammar, the language

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.310
of how we -- of how
we communicate.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.790
It does seem to me curious,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.120
given how important
we both believe it is,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.220
that there isn't
more of it out there.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.520
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I think
there's a lot of it, though.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.120
There's a fair amount.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.420
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I think, yeah.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.760
I mean someone once asked me
how it was that I used humor,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.350
like when did I know
how to use it,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.130
and I said I would
never use humor.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.360
I mean that would be a mean
thing to do to humor, you know.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.660
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.960
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Humor is there

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.610
in the story that
you're telling.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.810
You have to sometimes
find humor --

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.110
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.250
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- and let it
drift and let it come alive --

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.550
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.850
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
-- in your text.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.150
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.450
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But you
shouldn't use it necessarily --

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.750
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.050
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- like a tool.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.350
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.650
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: It's
just it's kind of there

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.950
in your people and
in your world --

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.250
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.550
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- and in
your way of looking at things,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:40.010
and as we know also,
humor is a form --

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.040
well, the old saying
comedy is tragedy plus time.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.340
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.260
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But humor then
obviously means you've survived,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.430
so it's an expression
of survival.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.730
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: That's great.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.260
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And
that's a nice thing, --

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.560
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.580
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- to
express your survival.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.090
So no matter what
happens to you,

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.160
you can make a funny
story of it eventually.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.460
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.770
Well, Richard, to speak to
your question, you know,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.800
you mentioned something about,
you know, always wanting

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.130
to write serious fiction.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.430
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.010
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: And I wonder
if that's something that a lot

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.050
of people or a lot of writers
might even unconsciously think,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.350
that you can't have serious --

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.320
it's not serious literature
if it's also funny,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.320
which I don't think is true
at all, but I just wonder

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.050
if there's, you know,
a misperception there.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.760
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I think for
me, it was almost as much --

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:38.270
it wasn't that I -- when I say
I wanted to be a serious writer,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:43.170
"serious" in quotation
marks, I think more

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.430
than anything else was that I
wanted to be taken seriously,

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:56.800
that is, and that that was --
maybe for me the surest sign

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:03.370
of being taken seriously was
becoming a serious writer,

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:09.940
and I think that
just has something do

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:16.670
with my psychological profile as
a young man more than anything.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.080
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Shifting
gears just a little bit, --

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.380
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.040
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: We don't have
to give up on the humor, but --

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.790
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I never do.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.650
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: We're going to
have to give up on these lights.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.950
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: I'm sorry.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.620
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I'm going to
put a -- I'm going to have to --

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.350
it's going to be like
saluting you all --

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.650
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.950
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: It's a
little -- it's a little bright.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.380
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- but now
I can see you, but I'll --

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.680
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: I know.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.980
We can't see --

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.280
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Oh, well.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.580
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: -- the people.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.880
But in a review of Charles
Baxter's Shadow Play,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.180
which is included in
your new collection, --

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.480
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You okay?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.780
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.080
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: -- you write,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.380
"Often when short
story writers go

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.680
to write novels,
they get jaunty.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.110
They take deep breaths
and become brazen,

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:59.870
the way shy people do on wine,"
which is a very funny line,

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.170
but you know, you've gone back

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.740
and forth throughout your
career from, you know,

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.870
stories to novels and back
again, and I'm just wondering

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.270
if you could talk a
little bit about the kind

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.740
of different modes of writing in
both these short and long forms.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.240
You know, do you approach
the work differently

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.480
when you know you're
sitting down with a novel,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.590
writing a novel versus a story?

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.890
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.300
I mean there are writers, and
Alice Munro is apparently one

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.500
of them, who sometimes begin

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.020
and they don't know whether
something's a short story

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.320
or a novel.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.620
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.920
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And she's
ostensibly always trying

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.060
to write a novel, and that's
why her stories are so huge

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.820
and compact and dense
and straddle time,

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.240
and they're like
little miniature novels.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.340
I've never had that issue.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.640
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: No?

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.940
Okay.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.240
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I've always
known that it's either going

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.180
to be a story or it's
going to be a novel.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.480
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Okay.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.180
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But I mean
I have very few novels.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.780
The novel gives you a
chance to really spread out.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.580
See, because of the lights, I
can't see what baby this is.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.410
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
That's all right.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.570
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Maybe
the lights are too bright

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.870
for the baby.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.820
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: The
lights are too bright.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.560
I agree. But you know, a novel
obviously offers you just more

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.880
space, simply.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.180
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.390
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And so you can
-- and time is often the subject

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.260
of a novel, and you have
more space to explore time.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.680
You can handle time differently.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.320
There's some stereophonic
quality always to a novel.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.810
You may have a couple
different points of view,

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.690
or you may have different
points of time, or you're just,

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.950
you know, carrying
a cast of characters

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.810
through a longer period of
time, unless it's Ulysses,

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.270
and that's just a day, but --

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.570
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.820
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But I
actually like writing novels,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.930
and I'm working on one
now, but every time I --

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.350
the published one,
it gets reviews

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.570
that say she should go back
to writing short stories.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:13.860
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.380
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But I persist.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.330
You know, it's just
resilience and stubbornness.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.840
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Do you think
it's because the first book

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.380
that you had was a
story collection?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.070
Is that it?

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.370
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
No, I think it's

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.490
because the first
novel I had was bad,

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.860
and then people just think
all the other ones are bad,

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.160
too, but I don't think so.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.480
I think the other ones
are better than that.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.780
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.180
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
So I don't know.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.480
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Okay.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.130
Richard, how about you,
because you also have two story

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.180
collections, but I guess
I would argue to say

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.160
that you're more
well-known for your novels.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.460
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.760
No, definitely.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.060
Definitely.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.660
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: And I would
agree with what Lorrie said,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.120
in the sense that most
of the time, I know, too.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.820
When I begin working on
something, it has a certain feel

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.440
to it, whether there's a
little material or a lot,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.900
and I can usually tell, but
there was one exception,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.350
and that was my novel That
Old Cape Magic, which is kind

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.730
of interesting, because I think
that the reason it wasn't --

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.340
it was always going
to be a novel,

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.880
but I think that the reason
that I didn't recognize it

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.800
as such had to do
with something else,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.190
and that is that it was
the novel that I wrote

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.460
after my longest and
most difficult novel.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.800
Not all novels cost
you the same thing,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.680
and this particular
novel, Bridge of Sighs,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.260
was not only probably
my most ambitious book,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.150
but it was also my most
problematic, and I made the kind

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:55.380
of serious mistakes in it
that cost me sometimes 75

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.930
or 100 pages at a time.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.430
It wasn't that there wasn't
anything in those pages,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.340
but clearly the book
was not working, and --

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.310
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And what do
you mean by that, not working?

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.610
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Well, it just --

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.220
I mean I could just
tell it wasn't working.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.880
One of the things that I did was

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.320
that there were three main
characters in it, and it seemed

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.750
to me that I was going to
tell one character's story

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.400
and then another
character's story

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.900
and then another character's
story, but it was --

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.230
and so one point of view,
then another point of view,

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.100
then another point of
view, and it just wasn't --

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.400
it just wasn't working.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.700
It was a bad decision.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.480
That point of view decision
was bad, and it cost me

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.430
at least a year, and then I
made other mistakes like that,

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.940
just huge, huge mistakes,
and long story short,

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.170
by the time I got
to the end of it,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:49.000
I had spent about five years,
which is even long for me,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.050
and it was also dispiriting,
because I was making the kinds

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.440
of mistakes that at that point,
for somebody who'd written

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.500
as many books as I
had, I shouldn't be.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.040
At least it seemed
to me that I --

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.290
-- should not be making those
kinds of rudimentary mistakes,

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.780
and it really upset me that I
was faithful to those mistakes

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.910
for so long, you know.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:15.770
By God, I was going
to make it work.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.520
And so at the end
of it, I was just --

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.060
the needle on my gas gauge
was just bouncing off the E,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.770
you know, and so when I finished
that book and turned it in

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:31.020
and it came time to do something
else, I started a short story,

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.080
and it was about a guy
who was going to take --

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.080
it was going to take -- it was
going to be a one-day story,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.790
not like Ulysses, but a one-day
story, and it was about a guy

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.880
who was going to --

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.820
he'd recently been given his
father's ashes, and he was going

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.040
to put them in the trunk
of the car and drive

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.340
over the Sagamore Bridge.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.640
He was living in
the Boston area.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.770
He was going to drive
on to Cape Cod

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.540
and scatter his father's
ashes and come home.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.840
That was going to be the --
that was going to be the story,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.980
and it was -- so I
figured going into it,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.020
maybe 15 pages, 20 at the tops.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.080
Well, it got to be 15, 20,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.010
and suddenly the character's
mother was introduced,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.980
and the character's wife was
introduced, and then it got

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.340
to be page 35, and I'm thinking
well, I can't fob this off.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.510
Even in the New Yorker, I'm not
going to, plus it wasn't ending,

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.230
and then it was at 125 pages.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.530
Now I'm a novella.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.500
What am I going to do with this?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.250
And then it got to be about
175 pages, and I thought --

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.340
this was about the time that
On Chesil Beach came out,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.640
and I thought --

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.940
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Oh, yeah.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.240
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: --
maybe I can fob this off

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.070
on an unsuspecting
public as a novel.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.370
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: That's
not very nice to say

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.950
about On Chesil Beach.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.250
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: And
I love Chesil Beach,

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.730
and I love the fact
that he was able --

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.030
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I know.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.330
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: -- to.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.150
And anyway, the book turned
out to be about 400 pages.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.430
Now my point in saying
the reason

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.080
that I didn't recognize it
as a novel I think had to do

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.870
with the fact that if I had
recognized it as a novel,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.970
I probably wouldn't
have begun it.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.270
I was exhausted.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.570
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Right.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.950
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I
was kind of dispirited.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.110
I would have thought to
myself oh, I'll write a couple

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.130
of essays, I'll write a book
review, I'll write a short story

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.510
and wait for some
more gas to appear

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.470
in the tank, and
then I'll start.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.310
So basically, I think I just --

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.190
something in me fooled me
into beginning a novel.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.490
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Right.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.790
It had to come in
from another --

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.090
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.390
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- angle.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.690
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.990
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.290
I just had dinner with Ann
Patchett the other night,

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.590
because we both -- I live
around the corner from her

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.480
in Nashville, and she said
she had just completed a novel

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.670
and tossed it away.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.740
She very ostentatiously
said and I threw it away;

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.800
I realized I was young
enough to write a bad novel,

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.740
and I said well, how
much would you sell it

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.390
to me for, and she said $1.69.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:04.280
I said sold, and so there's
going to be a novel coming out.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.580
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Your
first collaboration.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.880
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: It's mine.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.180
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: No,
it's going to be yours.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.480
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I caught it.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.780
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
You did pay for it.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.080
You paid for it.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.380
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I bought it.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.220
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: It's like
an acknowledgment, I'm sure.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.520
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
She doesn't want

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.820
to acknowledge it, but whatever.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.950
It'll be fine.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.160
But the idea of like
-- yeah, of backing up

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.420
and realizing you made
all these mistakes

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.880
and throwing things away,
it's so alien to me,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.900
but to me it's a sign of a true
novelist, which maybe I'm not,

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.410
but I'm accumulating all kinds
of things when I'm working

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.900
on this novel that I'm
working on, and I don't want

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.260
to throw anything away.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.560
I just won't.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.640
I'm like a hoarder, you know.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.940
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.950
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I
write by hoarding,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.380
you know, so that's not good.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:57.240
That's why I had
to buy Ann's novel.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.160
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: That's right.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.500
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: She
sold it so cheaply.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.800
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: But
the other point, though.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.100
Do you ever fool yourself?

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.510
Have you ever discovered
that you've --

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.290
the back of your brain has
down something to the front

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.400
of you brain to just
allow you to do something

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.280
that you otherwise
wouldn't have done?

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.180
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I have no
idea what you're talking about.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.480
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I'm
sure it's happened,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.420
that you just didn't
recognize it.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.910
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: The back of
the brain is doing something?

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.320
Oh, does something come in?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.620
Yeah, no.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: See, I think
writers fool themselves all the

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.120
time about various things.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.420
I just don't --

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.650
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Well, I do walk
-- and you know this feeling.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.030
You can walk around
for a very long time

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:39.120
with either an entire book or
a completed book in your head,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.020
and you feel like it's
completed, and you feel

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.050
like it's all there,
but you haven't put it

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.010
into the sentences yet.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.540
You haven't put it into the
pages yet, or not entirely,

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.390
and then when you go to do that,

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.980
you write a very
different book --

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.280
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.580
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- from
the one you were walking

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.880
around with in your head.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.470
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Sure, sure.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.380
Well, one's a book
and one isn't, right.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.680
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I
guess that's right.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.980
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.280
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But it's too
bad you can't get the one that's

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.580
in your head out there.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.080
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.820
But it does remind you of
those people who come up to you

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.330
and say I have this great book.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.630
Oh, I just --

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.930
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
This great idea.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.230
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I
have this -- yeah.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.530
Yeah, well, sometimes
they say it's a book, --

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.830
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And they
want you to write it.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.130
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: -- and it's
an idea and they want you --

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.430
and they want you to write it.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.730
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Right.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.030
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: And they say
the only thing I haven't --

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.330
the only thing I haven't
done yet is the words.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.630
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah, the word.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:30.220
A very minor problem.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.520
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: So Richard,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.520
the mistakes that
you mentioned --

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.120
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: --
that you had made,

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.420
did anybody help you realize

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.720
that you had made
those mistakes?

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.650
Did you have a reader
or an editor or anyone

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.550
that you could -- that maybe
pointed some things out,

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.610
or was it all on your own?

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Well, for this
particular book, I have my agent

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:54.910
to thank, Nat Sobel, who has
been my agent throughout my

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.500
career, and with a lot of --

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.350
with a lot of Nat's
other writers,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.360
and with me if I
would allow it --

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.670
with a lot of his other writers,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.730
many of them are thriller
writers, but with a lot

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.220
of his other writers, they
will send Nat pages, you know,

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.330
chapters at a time,
and he'll comment,

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.880
and I think it's
particularly helpful

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.560
if you're writing a mystery
or a thriller to get that kind

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.190
of help sometimes
in the early going.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.090
I'm very resistant to that,
and I don't let him --

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.050
I don't let him see anything
until it's done or until,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.250
as is the case with Bridge of
Sighs, where I wasn't finished,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.480
but I was done -- I
mean I was ready to --

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.020
I was waving the white flag.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.320
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:44.820
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: And so I
gave him the 450 pages or so

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.860
of the book, which was probably
two-thirds, and he read it,

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.460
and we went for a
long walk during,

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.330
and basically what I was
asking him to do was --

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.560
because I thought I might have
had three different books,

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.960
three different characters,
three different books,

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.590
and he very patiently said
no, it's the same book,

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.150
but you've got three
different --

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.310
we've got three different
characters here.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.970
They're equally important,

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.400
and you've got two
different locations.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.880
There's an American story
and an Italian story,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:25.020
and it takes place when
they're young and then

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.130
when they're older, so there's
no middle in it in terms

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:33.220
of their ages, and he said what
you're not doing is integrating

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.270
those three things, and he
said what you really need

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.400
to do is tell what's going
on at the end, what's going

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.500
on at the beginning, what's
going on when they're young,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.500
what's going on when
they're old, and you need

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.220
to be going back and
forth from points

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.210
of view every 20 or so pages.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.220
And I spent the next hour as
we were walking explaining

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.060
to him why that simply could
not be done, and by the end

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.990
of that time, I realized, of
course, that it could be done.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.290
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: It could be.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.590
Right, yeah.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.890
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: And
perhaps it was the only way --

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.190
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.490
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
-- it could be done.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.790
That doesn't happen
to me as a rule,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.200
but I've never been more --
I've never been more thankful

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.220
to anybody for explaining my own
book to me than I was to Nat --

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.520
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah, right.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.820
Right.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.120
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
-- at that point,

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.420
because I really
was at my wit's end.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.720
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.020
How about you, Lorrie?

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.230
Do you have early readers or
an editor that you work with?

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.160
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You know,
I really believe in that.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.750
I believe in showing
your work to people,

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.500
but I used to never
show my work to anyone

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.290
until it was time
to sell the book.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.590
You know, --

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.890
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.190
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- the
deadline was -- and I would --

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.690
and so my agent would be
the first one to look at it,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.340
and she's paid to say
nice things to me.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.640
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.440
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: So at any
rate, she's a good reader,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.650
but more recently,
I've relied on a couple

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.510
of writer friends to read.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.770
I mean it's a huge imposition.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.070
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.860
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But if you
can get friends to do it,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.850
and they won't say
the same things.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.150
They'll say --

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.450
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Right.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.750
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- different
things, but you can kind

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.970
of figure it out from the
different things they say what

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.090
it is you should do
or can do or might do.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.680
So if you have some
people you trust,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.070
it's very important
and lucky and good.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.370
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:24.500
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I did not
work that way for a long time,

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:30.770
because I was quite stubborn
and I didn't believe --

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:34.350
you know, I had gone to
graduate school and gone

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.660
through that MFA workshop
process and listened

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.170
to everybody's criticisms and
that, and I was so, you know,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.140
dutiful and attended all those
classes and never missed a one,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.760
and at the end of
those two years,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.960
I said I'm never showing my
work to anyone ever again.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.350
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Until
you want to, right?

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.650
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: No, ever.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.780
Ever. I didn't want to hear
one word about my work.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.080
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.950
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But now
I'm a little more flexible.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.650
Well, and you write
a lot of reviews.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.950
I mean you --

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.250
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.550
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: You know.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.850
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Well,
not a lot, but yeah,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.330
I've been doing it
for a long time.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.630
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah, right.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.930
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: So
it looks like a lot.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.230
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
Right, right, right.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.530
But you know, so we
talked a little bit

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.010
about the difference between,
you know, the different modes

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.430
of writing in terms of stories
and novels, but what about --

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.710
you both have -- you're both
very well-known and acclaimed

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.960
for fiction, and your two
new books are nonfiction.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.980
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
Yeah, what about that?

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.280
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.610
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
What are we doing?

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:39.910
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I don't know,

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:45.890
but I'm never going
to do it again.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.190
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: But you know,

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.440
what's it like to approach
your nonfiction work

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.740
versus your fiction?

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.390
Is it a different switch
that you kind of flip

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.540
to a totally different
head space?

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.370
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Well,
Rick's books are really

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.610
about the writing life
and personal essays

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.910
about the writing life.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:05.210
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.790
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Mine are
critical pieces, by and large.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.250
There's some personal
essays, and they're very few.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.660
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: There's a
great one called On Writing,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.270
which is very good, in there.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.570
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Oh, thank you.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:19.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.170
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.470
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah,
there's one on writing,

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.210
there's one on my honeymoon,
because here's the difference

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.910
between nonfiction and fiction.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.100
When I got married, we
went to the courthouse

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.730
and the 60 Minutes
crew was there

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.440
to film us getting married.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: It's
such a lovely story.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.040
It is, and I love it.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.340
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Beautiful.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.640
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You
cannot make that up,

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.280
and that's the difference
between fiction and nonfiction.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.620
So that's why I had to write
a personal essay about that.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.920
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right, right.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.400
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And that is
in -- that is in the book.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.940
Then no one would publish it,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.820
but that's a different
story, but you couldn't --

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.230
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Nobody
wanted to publish that?

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.850
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Well,
someone commissioned it,

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.150
and then they killed it.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.680
I got a kill fee for it.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.580
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Oh, that's terrible.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.620
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And then my
poor agent said let's just --

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.470
I think she found it so
depressing, you know,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.710
and she said let's
just put this aside.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.310
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: And so then
I put back in this book,

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.390
so it's one of the few pieces
that had never appeared before,

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.590
but in writing a
work of fiction,

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.170
you couldn't very well
have a fictional couple --

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.470
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.770
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- go to
get married at the courthouse

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.750
and then take off
for their honeymoon

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.050
and there's a 60 Minutes --

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.350
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.650
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: --
camera crew who wants them

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.150
to pose as a welfare couple.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.920
That's what the 60 Minutes
crew wanted us to do.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.220
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Did you know
they were there when you --

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.520
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: No.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.820
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: -- arrived?

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.120
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: No.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.990
That's why you can't
make this up.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:49.220
They said we're doing a
story on the governor's

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.640
"wedfare" program, you know,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.570
where if welfare couples get
married, they get more money.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.360
This was a Clinton thing, too.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.280
He adopted it from the
Wisconsin governor.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.400
But we forgot to get footage
of a couple getting married.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.490
Would you pose as a welfare
couple getting married?

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.230
And I said -- and my
husband, my then-husband,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.930
said yeah, let's do that.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.550
I was like, are you
out of your mind?

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.850
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: That's right.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:16.590
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: No, no, no.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.450
So you know, the first --

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.750
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah,
that's better nonfiction.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.050
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.350
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.650
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: One of my
first words, you know, --

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:27.950
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.250
No.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:30.550
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- in the
courthouse was "no, no, no,"

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:36.960
and we were divorced ten years
later, so there, but you can't,

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.100
and the camera crew
was so disappointed.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.400
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.700
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Because they
said no one will know it's you,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.400
and then of course my
father was disappointed,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.460
because I then phoned him that
night and said, you know --

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: He
wanted you to do it, yeah?

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.060
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: He said
you should have posed

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.570
as that welfare couple, because
then I could have seen you

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.410
get married.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.710
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: All right.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.010
Sure, sure.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.310
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: But if
you put this in fiction,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:01.300
it's not only -- it's
just unbelievable.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.600
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah, right.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.900
Right.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.200
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
It's kind of insulting

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.500
that they thought you
would pass, isn't it?

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.040
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: They were
going to film from the back.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.800
You should have seen my back.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.100
I don't know.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.600
I don't know what -- I mean
anyone can be on welfare.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.460
We should have been on welfare.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.760
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Well,

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.060
I was going to say you're
a writer, so you're --

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.360
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.800
We had no money, but we were, --

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.100
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.400
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: --
you know, whatever,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.700
not technically on welfare.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.000
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Richard,
how about you, just in terms

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.440
of the nonfiction
versus fiction?

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.740
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Well, what I discovered

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.630
in the two nonfiction books,
because I've written a memoir

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.270
which is supposedly -- it's
supposed to be nonfiction,

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.890
and then I wrote this book of
-- this book of personal essays

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.900
which are also supposed
to be nonfiction.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.650
What I discovered to my
delight and, I have to say,

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:51.400
a little bit embarrassment
is that I didn't find them

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.540
as different as I
thought I was going to

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.420
and as I probably should
have, because for me,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.000
the storytelling, the
storytelling urge kicks in,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.820
and when I was writing
the memoir,

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.730
I mean obviously I wasn't
going to make things up.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:14.200
The story that I was telling was
too important, and it was more

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.210
about my mother than me,
and I wanted to do right

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:18.180
by her even though
I was writing a book

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:25.030
that I knew she would hate, but
still, I was writing a story,

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:31.500
and I found myself, for
instance, making decisions

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.480
that a fiction writer makes,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.340
where a different writer telling
a story would have told --

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:43.610
would have told a part of
the book through narration

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.350
that I just decided
to tell in scene.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:50.920
I slowed the narrative down.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.110
Could I remember exactly
what my mother and I said

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.870
to each other 30 years ago?

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.020
No, but I did know
the conversation

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.760
that we had been having
all of our adult lives,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:10.940
and I could reconstruct that
in a way that was true in terms

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.250
of the way I -- it was the
kind of truth that I was

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.470
after in the book, and
I think that as people,

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:21.190
as readers read that, you
either accept that or you don't.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.790
I mean one kind of reader would
say there's no way in the world

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.280
that Richard Russo can remember
what he and his mother said

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.200
to each other in the car
on the way to Arizona

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.110
from upstate New York
when he was 18 years old.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.420
That just doesn't happen, and
it certainly doesn't happen

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.910
if you know me, but there were
other readers who were willing

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.970
to give me that license even
in nonfiction and say okay,

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:51.500
he's not asking us to believe
exactly this moment in time,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.780
but that's what it was like, and
I found that -- I found that --

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.680
in the most personal of
the essays in this book,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.070
I found that to be true as well.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:08.310
The most personal essay in
it is called Imagining Jenny.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.980
It's about my dear friend Jenny
Boylan and what she was going

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.850
through about ten or 15
years ago, between ten

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.630
and 15 years ago as she
transitioned from male

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:26.790
to female, and I was actually
a character in her memoir

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.720
about all of this, and it
came, and so I wrote this

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.150
as the afterword to her
book, and I wanted to --

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.220
I really wanted to write
that and tell it as a story

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.150
and did it completely before
I even showed it to her

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.510
because I really wanted it to
work as a story, and afterwards,

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:48.960
fortunately there was nothing
in it that she objected to,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.260
but I'm sure that if we
were talking literal truth,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.890
there were probably times
when she would have said oh,

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:00.130
I don't remember it
quite that way, you know.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.480
I think actually, it
was more like this,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.570
and once in the memoir,
where I'm talking

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:12.820
about my daughter Kate's
wedding, I wrote a scene in that

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.270
in which -- and I have it at
the wedding, at the reception

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.060
after the wedding, and both
of my daughters came up to me

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.130
and said yeah, that's
kind of what happened,

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.430
but actually it happened before,

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:29.030
the night of the rehearsal
dinner, and so I had a choice,

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.410
and I kept it right where I --

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.710
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: --
right where I had it.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.310
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.610
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
That's where it worked.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.910
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: That's right.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.210
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Right.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
You're the writer.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.810
You're the writer, right.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.110
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: The
sloppy memories --

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.410
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.710
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- of
fiction writers, yeah.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.010
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.310
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: That's
why we go there, you know.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.610
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.910
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: You
don't have to be careful.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.210
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Right.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Well, we're
starting to run out of time.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.810
I have a whole lot of
questions, but I want to get

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.110
to some audience questions, but
before we do, one quick one.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.410
This is the National
Book Festival.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.710
It's all about books.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.010
What are you guys
reading right now?

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.710
Any book recommendations
for everyone?

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.880
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I'm making
my way through Prairie Fires,

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.860
the biography that won the
Pulitzer Prize, I think, --

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.160
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.460
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: -- of
Laura Ingalls Wilder.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.630
It's a great history
of the Midwest.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.400
Brutal, brutal history.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.310
It's not a sweet Little
House on the Prairie story.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.610
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right, right.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.050
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
It's quite bloody

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:28.070
and awful and fascinating.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.370
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yeah.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.670
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Yeah.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.970
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Great.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.270
Richard?

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.570
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I
am now reading a novel

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.530
that I've been wanting to
read since it came out,

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.170
and I'm blanking on
the author's last name.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.050
Somebody in the audience
is going to be able

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.360
to provide it, though.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.810
It's called Only in Sleep,
and it is by an author --

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.900
I've read a couple of
other of his books --

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.170
a couple other of his
books which I liked a lot,

00:39:55.170 --> 00:40:00.150
but this book was commissioned
by Raymond Chandler's --

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.570
-- estate, and he
was commissioned

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:08.270
to write another Philip Marlowe
-- another Philip Marlowe novel,

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.590
and boy, does he nail it.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:14.820
I'm about halfway through,
and he imagines Marlowe --

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.650
as the novel takes place in
1988, which makes Marlowe,

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.180
who's been in retirement
for many years --

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.700
he is in his early 70s.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:32.780
Imagine Philip Marlowe in his
70s, having retired to Mexico.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.960
Lawrence, anybody?

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.260
&gt;&gt; Osborne.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.560
&gt;&gt; Osborne.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.860
&gt;&gt; Osborne.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.160
Osborne.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.460
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Osborne.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Osborne.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.060
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
Lawrence Osborne.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.360
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yes,
Lawrence, Osborne.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.660
Thank you.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.960
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Great.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.260
Okay.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.560
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I
mean who would dare?

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.860
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: This is
a really literate crowd.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.160
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Who
would dare to pretend

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.460
to be either Philip
Marlowe or Raymond Chandler?

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Right.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.060
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: It's not
for the faint of heart,

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.360
and it's a lovely --
it's a lovely book.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.660
You'll like it.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.960
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Excellent.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.260
Okay, and I just want to plug --

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.560
Barbara Kingsolver has a
novel coming out in October.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.860
It's called Unsheltered.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.160
I finished it.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.460
It's great.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.760
Absolutely great book.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.060
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Okay.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: So be
on the look-out for that.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.860
Okay, so we have a few
minutes, about seven minutes

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.730
for some questions
from the audience.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.420
Does anybody have a question?

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.590
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: No, they're
taking the opportunity to leave.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.890
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Anyone?

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.190
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Keep in mind

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.490
that we can barely
see the audience.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:23.790
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Yes.

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.090
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: We can't
see who you are, so.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:26.390
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
We have someone

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:27.690
at the microphone here, though.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.990
&gt;&gt; Yes. A bunch of us,
Richard, are looking forward

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.180
to hearing you on
-- I'm over here.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.480
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Well, where is here?

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.780
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
Over to the right.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.080
&gt;&gt; Over here.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.380
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: To the right.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.680
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: We can't see.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.980
It's over there.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.280
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Okay.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.580
Oh, okay.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.880
&gt;&gt; We're looking
forward to hearing you

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.180
at the F. Scott Fitzgerald
celebration

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.480
where you will be honored
this year as our honoree,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.040
and I know that towards
the end of Trajectory,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.350
there's a beautiful passage.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.780
There was a passage
in one of the stories

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.190
where you reference Nick
Carraway, but I'd like to sort

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.960
of spin off of the question
on what you're reading now

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.820
and ask what shaped
both of you .

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.240
What literary lights
made you the way you are?

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.710
Which is wonderful, both of you.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: No, go.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.530
Go, go.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.790
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
You know, I don't --

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:21.450
personally, I don't really
feel that I'm shaped.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.980
I know I'm shaped by everything.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.830
Is the question really
over here?

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.130
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer:
She's right there.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.430
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Over there?

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.730
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Oh, yeah.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.030
Oh, hi.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.330
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Okay.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.630
All right.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.930
But I'm sure I'm shaped by
everything that I really like.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.230
It's all food.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.530
It all goes in.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.950
It all nourishes you.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.900
There are some times
when I've explicitly sort

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.280
of done a bounce off of
another writer's story,

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.160
and it still doesn't
seem anything

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.890
like that writer's story.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.940
It's not. So I mean one
has literary heroes.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:02.840
I don't think that one's
work is necessarily formed

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.680
by them at all.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.260
If only. That would be so great.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:14.420
But you take a little
inspiration just by virtue

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.930
of the fact that you know
there are things in the world

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.450
that are this beautiful
to read, and you just want

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.730
to also be part of that project.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.370
So go ahead.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.670
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: My
novel Straight Man begins

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:32.690
with an epigraph
from Fitzgerald.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:33.990
Is it Myrtle, I think?

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.290
Who is it?

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:38.420
Early in the book, they're at
a party and Nick is talking

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.020
to this woman, Myrtle, who
has a dog, and she says --

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:48.230
it's just such brilliant
dialogue.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:53.610
She says they're nice to have,
a dog, and I love the way

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:59.680
that goes from the plural
"they" to the singular "a dog."

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.680
There's something about
that that's just so rich

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.410
with that woman's voice.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:09.530
That shift from the plural
to the singular locates her

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:16.280
in terms of class, and it's
just wonderful, and you pick

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.260
up little things like
that wherever you go,

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.560
wherever you read.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.960
You find little things.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.050
I think most writers read
with larceny in their hearts,

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.350
and it's not that
you're going to --

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.370
it's not that you're going to
steal it now and use it now.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:35.930
It's that you put it away
in that little closet

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:41.180
and you think that'll, you
know, do me well at some point

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.270
if I remember it, and
I remember, I think --

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.860
I remember thinking that
way about Fitzgerald, too,

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.410
in terms of The Great
Gatsby, understanding really

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:51.140
for the first time
what the difference is

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.640
between a book being about
a character and a book being

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.460
that character's story,
because that's a stark example

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.240
of that, isn't it?

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.500
It's about Gatsby, but
it's not Gatsby's story,

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.470
it's Nick's story, and I think
it was that book that I began

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.320
to -- I mean I understood
it kind of intellectually,

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.620
the way we do sometimes.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.000
You'll understand something.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.430
But it made sense to me, I
think, for the first time.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:17.260
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Okay,
another question over here.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.590
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:22.050
Thank you for a wonderful
and funny conversation today.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.340
I didn't expect it
would be this funny.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.710
So I was wondering -- you
talked about how stories grow

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:32.680
up in your hands, and sometimes
they turn into short stories

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.580
or novels, but I was
wondering, what is that moment

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.430
like when the story
is born in your head?

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.080
Like one minute, it's not
there, and the other minute,

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.070
it's there, and what is that
-- where is it coming from?

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:50.280
Where is that light of
ray coming into your head

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.870
and bringing this
beautiful story to existence?

00:45:54.870 --> 00:46:00.190
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I think for
me -- I mean for every writer,

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.850
it's a little different.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.290
For me, stories begin
with an emotion.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.390
I mean sometimes it's language
and characters and voice

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.580
and setting that sort of
spur you on, but for me,

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.150
I'm very interested in
a complicated emotion

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.530
and what kind of story
could contain that --

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:26.560
not express it, not describe
it, but actually contain it,

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.860
so that a reader could
walk into a narrative

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.700
and have that same feeling.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.400
I think I've lost the
questioner in the lights.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.700
There you are.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.110
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: She sat down.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.410
There she is.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.710
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore:
Wrap it up, it says.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.010
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.310
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Okay.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.610
Here, you go.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.490
So and then once you have that
emotion and you build a world

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:53.800
that can contain it and
a voice, you wrap it.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.150
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Wow.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.450
Wrong lights.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.750
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo:
Yeah, now they're --

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.050
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Wrong lights.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.350
Okay.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.650
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Yeah,
we're supposed to wrap it up,

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.040
so I'll just say very
quickly I agree with Lorrie.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.930
Those moments, the aha
moment in the story,

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:15.250
it'll come at different
times in different books.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.190
Sometimes it'll be a
character revelation.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.360
Sometimes it'll be something.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.890
I remember very distinctly
in Empire Falls,

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.990
there was a moment, and I was at
least halfway through the book,

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:30.810
when I thought to myself oh,
this book is about cruelty,

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:36.010
and I didn't know that
before, and so we love those.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.240
We love those, when suddenly
we know something today

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.420
that we didn't know yesterday,
but it comes, and it's different

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.720
in each book, I think.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.380
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: Rachel Cusk
says every good story is

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.680
about cruelty.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.780
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: I wouldn't
necessarily disagree with that.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.080
&gt;&gt; Lorrie Moore: I know.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.830
I know. I think it's
worth thinking about.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.980
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Thank
you all for coming.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.280
&gt;&gt; Richard Russo: Thank you.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.600
&gt;&gt; Kevin Larimer: Thank
you, Richard, Laurie.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.900
Thank you.
