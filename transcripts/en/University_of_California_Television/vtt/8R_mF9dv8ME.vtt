00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:05.292
(mouse clicking)
(computer beeping)

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:08.375
(gentle piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.873
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.713
alone the master of
fire, tools and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.863
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.243
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.790
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.430
Carta brings together experts

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.690
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.703
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.713
of humans like you.

00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:25.012
(light music)

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:30.479
(bright music)

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.860
- There actually are no
chimpanzees in this image,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.220
but I wanted to start
with it to remind you,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.260
as both of our previous
speakers very nicely

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
and eloquently told you,
humans are hyper cooperative.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.681
And in addition to the many ways

00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:00.320
in which we depend on cooperation,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.743
including for the construction
of auditoriums like this,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.480
we also have, what I think
is compelling evidence

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.450
for an increase in meat consumption

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.610
from the paleo-archeological records,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.480
starting by about two million years ago,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.120
at for example this site of Kanjera South,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.698
or several sites in
Kanjera in western Kenya,

00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:24.711
where there's good evidence for hunting

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.440
of small to medium sized antelope

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.130
at about two million years,
and then later at Olduvai

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.840
and other sites in East Africa,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.330
further evidence for an
increase in meat consumption,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.120
including that image in
the upper right there,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.420
of a recreation of presumably homo erectus

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420
butchering a very large
animal, in that case,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.622
probably scavenged not hunted but,

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:56.480
and then we have chimpanzees.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.480
And chimpanzees are, along with bonobos,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.270
the closest living relatives of humans,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.270
and they eat more meat than
any other non-human primates.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.720
So humans eat the most
meat of all primates,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.505
but chimpanzees are second,
by quite a distance.

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.530
And when they hunt and succeed,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.280
and when they have meat,
another resemblance to humans

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.910
is that they typically
engage in meat transfers.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.150
And I use that term rather
than they share meat,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.150
or food sharing, because we
might want to reserve sharing

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.200
for peaceful exchanges of meat,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.650
but meat is not always,
individuals who don't have meat

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.382
don't always get it peacefully.

00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:51.385
This is, there are various categorizations

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:54.490
of food transfers, and this is most of one

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.520
that Andreas Jaeggi and Carl van Schaik

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.060
used a few years ago, in
which they distinguished,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.810
first of all, forced transfers

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.630
that involve aggression, so meat theft,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.560
or prey theft, and then
a transfer that happens,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.550
but it happens passively, which is to say

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.060
that someone possesses
meat and someone else

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.800
takes some of it peacefully or maybe

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.568
with some minor aggression and resistance

00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:23.900
and some degree of tolerance,
varying degrees of tolerance

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.680
by the possessor, and then
there's what they called

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.610
reactive transfers, that
is someone possesses

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.610
some meat and someone else
requests or begs for meat,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.810
and the possessor then makes it available

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.110
by something like that, and
then there's really true

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.940
proactive sharing, where
someone has some meat

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.940
and of its own accord offers
it to another individual.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.280
And here is a sequence of an attempt

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.070
at getting a passive transfer.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.640
This is an adult male chimpanzee at Ngogo

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.620
who is in possession of about half

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.720
an adult female red colobus monkey

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.290
and this is an adolescent
male who is hoping

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.130
to get some of that
meat, and very patiently

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.290
sitting there like this,
afraid actually to try

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.160
to touch it, he did get meat eventually,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.200
and in fact, eventually the adult male

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.603
handed him a piece of meat.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.332
Just to complicate matters slightly,

00:05:28.332 --> 00:05:31.390
to simplify matters slightly,
I'm just going to talk

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.300
about active and passive sharing.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.306
So active sharing or active transfers,

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:42.220
the possessor actually offers
the meat to someone else

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.497
and passive transfer is someone has meat

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:46.800
and allows someone else to take some,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.720
but that'll complicate things slightly

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.790
by talking also about
what I call co-feeding.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.790
Where someone clearly controls some meat,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.660
in this case, that male controls

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.900
half a blue monkey,
here this male controls

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.539
an adult female red colobus monkey,

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.827
and there, that male controls
this yearling red duiker.

00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:10.482
And as long as they have firm control,

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:14.940
they are comfortable letting
others take what they want.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.290
So, make contact with the
carcass or with the meat package,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.271
even feed from it directly
or tear pieces off,

00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:23.963
so long as they don't try
to take the entire thing.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.630
There have been a number,
I should say first of all,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.020
that when it does come to the question

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.341
of why do chimpanzees hunt,
I think as Ian explained,

00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:37.563
they hunt because meat is good food.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.510
But because meat is
nutritionally so valuable,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.960
that then opens possibilities for meat

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.683
to take on social importance.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.460
It may be that actually transfers

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.300
don't have great social importance,
even though they involve

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.500
social interaction,
because what's going on

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.090
is that someone, again, has meat,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.850
they are trying to eat it and someone else

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.130
is trying to get some of
it, and harassing them,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.570
and they can, the possessor can improve

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.689
usually his foraging
efficiency, his ability

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.700
to use the meat, by simply
giving into the pressure

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.668
and allowing someone
else to take some of it.

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:21.360
Also, there are diminishing returns

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.860
to someone who has acquired the meat

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.951
and perhaps has a large amount of it,

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:29.340
and has already been
feeding on it for awhile,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.960
when someone else comes along
and asks for some of it.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.430
It's also possible though, if that meat

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.130
assumes an important role via exchanges,

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.870
either meat for meat, so if
one chimp has meat now today,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.730
and allows someone else to have some

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.520
or even gives some to
that other individual,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.230
then in return, again, usually
he will be able to get meat

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.730
in the future when they don't have some,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.392
and the recipient does.

00:07:58.392 --> 00:08:01.870
And it's also possible
that they exchange meat

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.869
for other things, notably grooming

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:08.869
between males especially,
and also coalitionary support

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:13.390
between males and then there is this idea

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.110
that males could exchange meat for matings

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.210
with females, and in
that case, transfers are,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.294
to some extent actually contingent.

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:25.420
They're made selectively
to certain partners,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.970
and then received in return,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.100
selectively from certain partners.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.540
These are not mutually
exclusive possibilities,

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.040
and in fact, from, based
on what I see at Ngogo,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.010
I would say that sometimes individuals

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.690
get meat by harassing whoever has it,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.060
and the chimpanzee being harassed

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.180
might try to avoid the beggar,
but eventually just gives in,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.452
allows them to have some meat,

00:08:49.452 --> 00:08:52.944
but that does not rule out the possibility

00:08:52.944 --> 00:08:55.430
that they also use meat strategically

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.363
as a kind of social tool.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.670
Clearly, the recipients of meat get

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.363
nutritional benefits from obtaining it.

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:08.610
The question here is,
do the donors benefit

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.450
from allowing others to
have some of the meat,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.880
and if it's a question of tolerated theft

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.860
or harassment, the benefit,
again, might simply be

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.060
that I have some meat, and
by allowing someone else

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.930
to take it, I can now utilize what I have

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.920
more efficiently, because
I don't have to deal

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.220
with the harassment, and possibly the risk

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.044
that if I don't allow them to have it,

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:34.333
they'll try to steal all of it.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.730
When it comes to possible social benefits,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.170
again, there are various possibilities.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.603
Reciprocity in meat transfers,

00:09:43.603 --> 00:09:48.603
so pairs of individuals
showing some balance

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.720
in how often each can
get meat from the other

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.720
when the other has meat,
also, male chimpanzees

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.972
resemble humans in that
males, and differ from

00:10:00.972 --> 00:10:03.580
almost all other mammals, in that males

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.080
form very strong social
bonds with each other,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.053
and they depend on each other,

00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:10.830
they cooperate in various ways.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.840
They also spend extended periods of time

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.510
grooming with each other and
grooming provides hygienic

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.970
benefits, it also can provide
other health related benefits

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.043
via its calming effects.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.710
In addition, males
sometimes form coalitions

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.540
with each other to back each other up

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.840
in contests with third parties,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.180
and when they do that often enough

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.090
and reciprocally, we call them allies.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.890
So here, for example, you
see two former alpha males

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.210
at Ngogo, who were each other's allies

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.660
for a long period of time.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.760
Initially, he backed him
up when he was alpha male,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.350
and then when things had switched,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.921
he, Mweya, backed up
Bartok, who had replaced him

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.803
with one intervening male as alpha male.

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:02.960
So males need social partners in contacts

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.880
other than hunts or meat
sharing opportunities,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.551
and they need partners for grooming,

00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:12.480
or certainly can benefit
from having partners

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.240
for coalitionary support,
and all the males

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.150
of a given community are
allies with each other

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.740
against outsiders, and relations

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.900
between neighboring chimpanzee communities

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.003
are intensely hostile, which
is a topic for another talk.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.900
Not all partners, not
all potential partners

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.920
are equally valuable, and we could expect

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.130
that male chimpanzee
psychology has been subject

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.840
to selection for tolerance generally,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.740
at least towards familiar
male chimpanzees,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.430
and for higher tolerance
towards valuable partners.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.250
And that would then provide a basis

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.350
for selectively transferring
meat to valuable partners.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.269
It might sound a little strange

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:58.010
to talk about male
chimpanzees as being tolerant,

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.440
but again, compared to
males in other mammals

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.143
other than humans, they are.

00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:08.840
And this is an intriguing indication

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.140
that desperately needs replication.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.990
That there is something going on socially,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.140
a paper by Roman Wittig and colleagues

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.869
came out a few years ago in
which they managed to get

00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:23.020
a small number of urine samples

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.879
following meat transfer events

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:30.230
and they did assays for oxytocin

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.701
which is a hormone that is arguably

00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:36.617
involved in social
bonding, in reducing fear

00:12:36.617 --> 00:12:41.617
and potentially promoting
cooperation in various ways,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.590
and they found that oxytocin levels

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.860
were higher after meat transfers
than in other contexts,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.490
including even when
individuals had been grooming

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.990
with each other or than when
they had been feeding socially,

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.420
that is, in a group with other chimps,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.860
but no transfers of food.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.860
And the authors here propose
that sharing of food,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.700
and this was not just meat, in fact,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.030
they had few cases of meat transfers,

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.620
which is one reason why
this needs replication.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.547
But they proposed that sharing food

00:13:14.547 --> 00:13:19.547
is, can provide a basis for cooperation.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.660
Alternatively, but not
mutually exclusively,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.209
it could be that we find
that close social partners

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:33.200
get food from each other relatively often,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.540
but it's just because
they're more comfortable

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.820
with each other, so someone is more likely

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.240
to approach a meat
possessor if he already is

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.420
a close social partner
and then via harassing

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.629
the partner or tolerated theft,
gets some meat from them.

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:53.090
If that's the case, though,
we wouldn't expect to see

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.430
variation in begging success as a function

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.570
of partner value, nor would
we expect similar variation

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.280
in active sharing or in the amount of meat

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.570
that beggars acquire,
so I'm going to take us

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.050
now to Ngogo for awhile.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.250
Ngogo is one of several research sites

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.100
in Kibale National Park in western Uganda,

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.503
at three of which there are
chimpanzee research projects.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.240
And in Kibale National Park
there are seven species

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.020
of diurnal primates, not
all of them shown here,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.980
and also small forest
antelope like red duiker,

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.370
all of the animals in this image are prey

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.927
for chimpanzees, but as Ian told you,

00:14:34.927 --> 00:14:38.483
mostly they prey on red colobus monkeys.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.974
And this is the results of about

00:14:42.974 --> 00:14:47.230
2,800 some bouts of begging, that is,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.780
one individual trying to get meat

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.840
from someone else and
in most cases, actually,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.220
succeeding, in the
great majority of cases,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.300
although there's some
interesting variation.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.950
For example, females are
less likely to get meat

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.330
from males who are the major possessors

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.010
than other males are
to get meat from them.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.580
And sometimes a transfer is made

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.970
because someone steals meat
from someone else, so theft.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.710
What stands, and in most
cases, it's passive transfer,

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.900
so that's what's been reported
for other chimpanzee sites,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.900
but one thing that stands out here

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.530
is that quite a few of
the transfers are active.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.190
That is, someone else, someone offers meat

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.373
to someone else, and they
could choose not to do that.

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:39.730
And when I looked at the
results of all the attempts

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.760
to get meat, and then put that together

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.250
with data for a given study period

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.910
on how much grooming the
possessor got from whoever

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.630
was begging for meat, it
turned out that the likelihood

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.700
of getting meat went up as the amount

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.860
of grooming that the
possessor was receiving from,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.490
not at the moment, but in general,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:04.100
from the beggar went up, so
more likely to transfer meat

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.503
to mean grooming partners
than to other males.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.170
And, this doesn't look so dramatic,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.500
but I'll make a more
dramatic point in a moment.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.370
Males are also more likely to allow

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.070
their allies to have
meat than they are males

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.383
who are not currently their allies.

00:16:22.777 --> 00:16:27.777
Importantly, they're more
likely to give their allies

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.840
meat than they are to
give other males meat.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.920
So this is the big difference here,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.040
active sharing much more
common between males

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.653
who are allies of each other
than between males who aren't.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.340
Also, males who groom
meat possessors a lot

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.520
are more likely to get large
shares of meat from them

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.436
and a large share is this
kind of a fuzzy definition,

00:16:54.436 --> 00:16:58.280
but a small share would be
a small piece of a carcass,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.480
and maybe just a small scrap of meat.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.410
A large share would be
something like an entire limb

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.633
or half an adult female
red colobus monkey,

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.230
and actually transfer of large shares

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.560
is quite common at Ngogo,
again they go more often

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.510
to top grooming partners
than to other males

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.664
who are not top grooming partners.

00:17:18.664 --> 00:17:22.180
And they particularly go to allies.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.180
So again, this difference
here, fairly close to half

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.490
of the bouts with transfers between allies

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.150
involved one male getting
a large share of meat

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.460
from the other, and it's
a considerable amount

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.000
in other bouts also, but not so common

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.943
between males who are not allies.

00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:49.330
Back to females, and there's
a lot more to be said

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.730
about females, I'll just briefly
cover this one hypothesis

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.390
which has been called for better or worse,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:00.350
meat for sex, and I don't have
time to go into the details

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.550
of the chimpanzee mating system here,

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.560
it's quite complicated,
but most mating takes place

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.382
in situations where a
female is sexually receptive

00:18:09.382 --> 00:18:13.420
and is with multiple males
and has an opportunity

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.892
to mate with all or most or all of them

00:18:15.892 --> 00:18:18.800
and it doesn't make any difference

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.270
whether a female is sexually receptive

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.490
when it comes to the odds
that she gets meat from males.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.590
This is new data from
Ngogo, but it substantiates

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.630
what we've already said about Ngogo,

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.130
and what Ian and colleagues
have said about Gombe.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.793
So just to tie together a few things here,

00:18:40.576 --> 00:18:43.560
that I think makes it clear
that data from chimpanzees

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.810
don't support arguments
that meat provisioning

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.294
formed part of hominin
male mating strategies,

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:52.900
prior to substantial increases in hunting

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.160
and meat consumption and real dependence

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.350
on meat consumption for subsistence.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.920
More importantly though,
I think that chimpanzee

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.200
hunting and meat sharing, despite all

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.460
of the differences from
humans, some of which,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.583
again, we heard about earlier today,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.350
do tell us, and probably
have something important

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.490
to tell us about the
psychology of tolerance

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.086
and cooperation that underlies obligatory

00:19:18.086 --> 00:19:21.283
hyper cooperation in humans.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.523
So, thank you.

00:19:24.924 --> 00:19:27.924
(audience applauds)

00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:31.695
(bright music)
