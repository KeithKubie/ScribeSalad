00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:10.809
A Lesson in Failure: The Rise of the Mars
Candy Company

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.940
The legendary Roald Dahl’s book Charlie
&amp; Chocolate Factory from 1964 (and its subsequent

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.090
two film adaptations from 1971 and 2005) told
the story of a magical candy factory and its

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.240
eccentric and mysterious owner Willy Wonka.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.660
A chocolate river, gum that is a whole turkey
dinner, never-ending gobstoppers, and, of

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.100
course, the singing and dancing oompa-loompas
are just a few of the surprises that waited

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.280
inside the doors of the famously secretive
factory.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.810
Of course, in a real life candy empire, there
are a lot more failures, hard work, father/son

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.980
disputes, and an unfortunate lack of oompa-loompas.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.040
What follows is the tale of how the Mars candy
company went from a small candy business started

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.870
by a polio stricken teen to one of the largest
candy companies in the world.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.440
The story of Mars candy starts in Newport,
Minnesota (southeast of St. Paul) with the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.640
birth of Franklin Clarence Mars on September
23, 1883.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.170
Frank was the son of a gristmill operator
(grinding grains into flour) who only moved

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.900
to Minnesota from Pennsylvania with his wife,
Alva, months prior to Frank’s birth.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.460
When Frank was little, he battled polio which
left him disabled the rest of his life.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.150
As you might imagine from this, he was rather
immobile as a kid, so he spent a lot of time

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.250
watching his mother bake and cook, including
watching her go through the difficult and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.960
tedious process of making fresh chocolates.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.700
He got so into candy, that he began selling
Taylor’s Molasses Chips and creating his

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.310
own candy recipes while still in high school.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.659
By the time, he graduated, he had a pretty
successful career going selling candy wholesale

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.030
to stores in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.520
In 1902, he married Ethel G. Kissack, a schoolteacher.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.850
About a year later, Frank’s first son – Forrest
– was born.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.810
It was also around this time that the candy
market became oversaturated.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.390
With the Hershey Bar having been first introduced
in 1900, the United States’ first mass produced

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.329
candy bar, a host of other locally owned candy
chains popped up.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.120
The competition was fierce, especially in
the Minneapolis area.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.230
Brands like Chick-O-Stick, Pearson’s, and
Cherry Hump started in Minnesota and all are

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.230
still around today.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.360
So, it wasn’t a huge surprise when Frank’s
wholesale business went under.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.540
To add a little lemon juice to his fresh wound,
in 1910, Ethel divorced Frank for being unable

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.659
to support her.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.029
She also won sole custody of Forest, who she
promptly sent to live with her parents in

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.029
Saskatchewan, Canada.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.549
The ugliness of the divorce wasn’t a good
omen for Frank and Forrest’s future relationship.

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.569
They would rarely see each other until years
later, with tensions still running high.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.099
Frank, never a man to get too down, tried
again, this time marrying another Ethel – Ethel

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.769
V. Healy – and moving to Seattle, Washington
to go back into the candy business.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.569
He failed again with wholesaling and creditors
started taking his stuff.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.950
He moved thirty miles south to Tacoma and
again struggled.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.519
In 1920, Frank and Ethel the second moved
back to Minnesota to be closer to their families.

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.519
At this time, Frank had only four hundred
dollars to his name.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.620
But despite his constant struggles with candy,
he continued to try, this time making his

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.099
own at three am every morning with his wife
doing the selling.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.640
The candy bar was the Mar-O-Bar, made out
of chocolate, nuts and caramel.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.730
It was tough, but they started to make a little
money and then a good amount more.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.579
After years of trying, Franks Mars had finally
carved out a somewhat lucrative career in

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.579
candy.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.699
They were even able to buy a house and would
have been comfortable being local candy suppliers.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.200
But the invention of the Milky Way changed
all of that.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.319
It was also around this time that Frank’s
son, Forrest, was establishing a mighty fine

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.609
business sense.

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.329
After attending college at Berkeley and, later,
Yale, he became a traveling salesmen for Camel

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.329
cigarettes.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.699
As the legend goes, in Chicago one night Forrest
went a little overboard plastering ads across

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.069
the city for Camel.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.230
He was arrested, but his estranged father
bailed him out.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.389
While at a soda counter, Forrest looked into
his chocolate malt glass and said, “’Why

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.779
don’t you put a chocolate-malted drink in
a candy bar?’”

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.969
Nougat had been invented in Italy in the 15th
century (see: What Nougat is Made Of), but

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.540
a variation of whipped egg whites and sugar
syrup (instead of the normal honey) was invented

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.060
by the Pendergast Candy Company in the early
20th century.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.060
They were based in, yes, Minneapolis and the
nougat became known as “Minneapolis Nougat.”

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.060
Frank Mars had started using nougat in his
candies in 1920.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.090
In fact, he called his company “the Nougat
House” for a time.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.550
But this time, in 1923, he mixed it with chocolate
and put caramel on top of it.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.569
Using his cosmic name as inspiration, he called
it a “Milky Way.”

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.520
It was introduced in that same year.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.220
Within a year, Mars’ sales jumped by ten-fold,
grossing about $800,000 (about $11 million

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.350
today).

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.710
Said Forrest later, “that damn thing sold
with no advertising.”

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.550
Mars Company quickly launched into orbit.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.490
They moved their headquarters to near Chicago
and by 1928, just five years after introducing

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.539
the Milky Way, they were making $20 million
in gross revenue (about $273 million today).

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.990
In 1930, they introduced the Snickers bar
(named after Frank’s favorite horse) and,

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.440
soon after, the Three Musketeers.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.990
Frank started living in grand fashion, buying
fast cars, big houses, and a horse farm for

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.060
his wife.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.460
Meanwhile, Forrest didn’t like what he saw.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.830
Knowing that there was more profit, and security,
to be had by cutting costs and expanding the

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.479
business into other areas, he tried to convince
his father to give him a third of the company

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.000
and let him expand to Canada (Forrest’s
home country).

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.970
Frank refused and Forrest, later recounting
a conversation with his father, ”I told

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.289
my dad to stick his business up his ass.

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.030
If he didn’t want to give me a third right
then, I said, I’m leaving.”

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.300
In the end, Frank gave Forrest $50,000 and
foreign rights to the Milky Way to basically

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.889
leave his company alone and move to Europe.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.620
Fortunately for the company, that is exactly
what Forrest did.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.510
While in Europe, Forrest learned from Switzerland’s
Nestle chocolate company about how to make

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.690
good, sweet, European-style candy.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.449
He tweaked the recipe of the Milky Way to
make it more sweet.

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.539
He called it the “Mars Bar.”

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.520
It sold even better than the Milky Way in
Europe, amassing Forrest his own considerable

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520
fortune.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.409
Frank passed away in 1934, at the young age
of fifty.

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.810
His wife, Ethel, took over the company, then
Frank’s half-brother , William L. (Slip)

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.340
Kruppenbacher when Ethel was too ill to run
it.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.389
In 1945, Ethel passed away.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.150
The company moved to the next of kin, the
business savvy Forrest.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.180
Forrest took over the company and immediately
diversified, turning Mars into more than a

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.180
candy company.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.319
He worked with a European pet food supplier
and, eventually, created Whiskas Catfood.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.310
He worked with a Texas salesmen to create
ready-to-make rice.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.669
That became Uncle Ben’s Rice.

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:53.050
Besides being a brilliant money-making business
man, he was known to have a violent temper

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.560
and a demand for perfection.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.009
For example, he was known to throw chocolate
bars out of windows if he felt they didn’t

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.090
meet his quality expectations.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.599
Remarkably quickly, he turned a regional candy
maker into a world-wide food empire.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:09.379
Today, it is his three kids who are reaping
the benefits.

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.360
John, Forrest Jr., and Jacqueline.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.301
They are among the richest people in the world,
each owning a third of Mars, Inc, which currently

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:21.669
employs over 75,000 people and is valued at
around $70 billion, making it approximately

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:27.699
the sixth largest privately held company in
the world.

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:33.280
In 1941, Forrest Mars Sr. struck a deal with
Bruce Murrie, son of famed Hershey president

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.749
William Murrie, to develop a hard shelled
candy with chocolate at the center.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:41.530
Mars needed Hershey’s chocolate because
he anticipated there would be a chocolate

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.409
shortage in the pending war, which turned
out to be correct.

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:49.550
As such, the deal gave Murrie a 20% stake
in the newly developed M&amp;M; this stake was

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.160
later bought out by Mars when chocolate rationing
ended at the end of the war.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.479
The name of the candy thus stood for “Mars
&amp; Murrie,” the co-creators of the candy.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:02.539
The “M&amp;M” was modeled after a candy Forrest
Mars, Sr. encountered while in Spain during

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.259
his quasi-exile from Mars in the 1930s.

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:09.669
During the Spanish civil war there, he observed
soldiers eating chocolate pellets with a hard

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:11.189
shell of tempered chocolate.

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:15.099
This prevented the candies from melting, which
was essential when included in soldiers rations

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:16.099
as they were.

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:20.219
Not surprisingly, during WWII, production
of M&amp;Ms skyrocketed due to the fact that they

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:25.349
were sold to the military and included as
part of United States’ soldiers’ rations.

00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:43.219
This also worked as great marketing; when
the soldiers came home, many were hooked.
