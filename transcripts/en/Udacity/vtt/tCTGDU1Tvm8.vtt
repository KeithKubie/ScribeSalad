00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.520
Junction objects are useful when you want to have a

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.980
many to many relationship. You've seen one to many

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.950
relationships already, with festivals and attendees. In fact, you

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.790
could say that a festival can have many attendees.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.010
But you wouldn't necessarily say an attendee can have

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.960
many festivals. Then we got to this situation with

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.698
stages and bands. Once. One stage can have multiple

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:26.540
bands, and one band can not play at multiple stages.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.300
This is a many-to-many relationship. To make

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.850
this relationship happen, we needed to create

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.640
the set time junction object. Now let's

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.540
think back to Facebook, who uses Salesforce

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.091
to manage some of their hiring processes.

00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:41.660
I'm going to give you a few situations,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.250
and I want you to tell me which ones would require a junction object?
