JOHN ORWANT: My
name is John Orwant.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm with the Google Cambridge
Tea Party Republicans Club.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.120
And it's a pleasure and an honor
to introduce our guest today--

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.610
a man whose fame rises to a
level of the kind that renders

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.110
the standard introduction
pattern completely obsolete.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.090
I could tell you
about his 123 books.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.106
I counted.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:30.480
The seven books
have been written

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.812
about him, the 38 doctoral--
honorary doctoral degrees--

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:35.770
that he's been granted.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.150
I could tell you about
the species of bee

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.520
that has been named after him.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.960
Instead, I'm actually going to
talk about tenure, because it's

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.230
actually the thing
I think of first

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.610
when I think about
our guest today.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.621
We tend to think of tenure
today as an entitlement.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.120
Right?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.530
So, professors--
they work really hard

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.190
for some amount of time.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.450
And then they're kind of
granted this lifetime protection

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.960
from being fired.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.300
And, the institution of
tenure has been around

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.780
for many decades.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.570
It really started to solidify
around the time of the McCarthy

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.340
era, where a lot of
professors in this country

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640
were being asked to
take oaths of loyalty

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.760
as part of the
anti-communist fervor that

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.500
was sweeping the nation.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.030
And it wasn't that the
University administrations

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.110
wanted them to take those oaths.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.080
They were worried.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.250
The universities were worried
about pressure from government.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.707
They were worried about
wealthy donors saying,

00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:36.665
I'll give you this check
for a million dollars,

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.390
but you have to fire that
professor over there.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.130
And so that's why
universities kind of lept

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.240
into this institution
with gusto.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.740
And yet, when you
look at professors

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.900
today, they very rarely
take advantage of tenure

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.864
to speak on popular views.

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:54.530
But of course, our
guest today, I think,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.300
is the world's best
example of doing that.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.290
And I think that getting
tenure perhaps today

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.980
should come with
a mild obligation

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.620
to speak truth to power.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.890
So anyway, with that,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.330
I want to introduce a man who is
to the left of Julian Assange,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.010
but with a less restrictive--
but with fewer travel

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.867
restrictions-- Noam Chomsky.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.302
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.220
INTERVIEWER: Well we're
very glad to have you back.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.230
You were here in 2008.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.070
And now, Google's
grown considerably.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.830
You have a
considerable audience.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.960
And as was mentioned
earlier, the questions

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.140
I'm about to pose to
you are from Googlers.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.780
So you guys went online
and you posted questions,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.630
and you voted on them.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.400
All right-- so the first one.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.420
Your early view of
the potential abuse

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.010
of the internet as a political
medium seem to convey a wait

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.380
and see attitude.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.630
How has your view
evolved, and where do you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.870
think the balance
of power is headed?

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.180
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, the
internet is obviously

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.120
a tremendous research tool.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.040
We use it all the time.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.510
I assume by internet, you mean
more generally-- the whole kind

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.870
of IT system that's developed.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.820
And, it's certainly useful
for activists and organizers.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.320
Almost all activist
efforts and enterprises

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.080
involve intercommunication
through the internet.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.020
On the other hand, we don't
have to talk about the fact

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.800
that it's a tremendous
tool for power systems

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.062
to control and dominate
in all sorts of ways.

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:45.970
I by now, hardly have to
mention the NSA revelations,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.290
Edward Snowden's revelations.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.200
Commercial institutions,
like Google, for example,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.870
use it to undermine
privacy and independence

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.200
in all kinds of ways.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.770
So the balance of power is where
it always was, and expending.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.890
Any technology that's
around is going

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.150
to be used by systems
of concentrated power

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.250
to dominate and control.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.400
And you can't open
a newspaper now

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.339
without new things appearing.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.740
Take this morning.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.040
If you happened to look at
this morning's newspaper,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:29.340
there was an associated press
report on some revelations

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.770
that they've dug out
recently about efforts

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.520
to develop by the US government
through USAID, US aid, which

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.850
is supposed to be
a aid organization

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.430
to carry forward the intensive
US efforts to undermine

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.250
and overthrow the
government of Cuba.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.550
Read the report.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.480
It's interesting for what it
says and what it doesn't say.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.410
What it says is that the
government through US aid

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.930
has set up-- tried to set
up-- a kind of social media

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.390
inside Cuba that could be
used to organize the crowds

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.780
to protest with the
people, not really knowing

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.410
who they're working
for what they're doing.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.080
And the original AP
report, most of which

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.960
didn't get printed, at
least from what I saw,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.750
says that this has
already been used

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.320
in many other places--
Philippines, Ukraine,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.210
and so on-- to try to organize
anti-government protests,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.250
which raises quite a few
questions about what's

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.910
going on around the world.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.540
Well this is one of
the techniques that's

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.580
being used for subversion,
domination, control.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.530
This is an Obama
program, incidentally.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.310
Not Bush.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.460
And what's said is interesting.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.800
What isn't said is interesting.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.680
And here, the power
of the internet

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.620
looms in the background.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.670
You can quickly find out what
isn't said on the internet

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.540
if you look for it.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.040
What isn't said is that
this program-- of course,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.450
it's not called subversion.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.380
It's called bringing
democracy and so on.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.500
But this program of trying to
subvert the Cuban government

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.260
is part of a longstanding
war that the US

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.890
has been conducting
against Cuba.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.890
Longstanding.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.350
You look at the history
of the US and Cuba--

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.240
it starts in the 1820s.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.040
Cuba was regarded by
the founding fathers

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.330
as the next conquest
that we have to make.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.540
Cuba was waiting there.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.890
We had to take it for ourselves
as we expand and become

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.430
the greatest empire
in the world.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.290
Well we couldn't do it in 1823.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.870
There was a deterrent--
the British.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.810
They were too powerful.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.610
The British were the main
enemy through the 19th most

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.720
of the 19th century
but the big thinkers,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.250
like John Quincy Adams--
great grand strategist--

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:19.350
he recognized and said, while
we can acquire Cuba now,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.180
it will fall into
our hands by the laws

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.430
of political gravitation,
just as an apple

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.170
falls from the tree.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.080
Meaning, over time, the US
will become more powerful.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.110
Britain's power will decline,
And we'll be able to take Cuba.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.880
And in fact, that's
what happened.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.470
In 1898, Cuba was liberating
itself from Spain,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.360
and the US intervened in what's
called here Liberation of Cuba,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.170
but in fact, was the prevention
of the liberation of Cuba

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.660
by Cubans.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.940
The US took over the
island-- one of several.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.610
Puerto Rico, Hawaii was
stolen from its inhabitants

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.035
the same year, and Cuba became
a colony-- a virtual colony.

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:08.530
Well, something
quite interesting

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.330
happened that's
highly relevant today.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.290
Highly relevant.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.200
But never mentioned, but you
can find it on the internet

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.360
if you like.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.140
At gun point, the
US imposed a treaty

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.470
on Cuba, Platt
Ammendment, it's called,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.470
in which Cuba granted
the United States control

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.490
over eastern Cuba-- so
what we call Guantanamo.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.659
Happens to include
Cuba's major port-- it's

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.929
only port oriented
towards Europe,

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.409
which is where its
main trade would be.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.820
Of course, the Cubans
had no voice in this.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.590
We just took it over.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.370
And we've had it for 110 years.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.400
Cuba's been trying to get
it back, but we refuse.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.570
The purpose has no
strategic interest for us.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.740
It's used for
storage of refugees,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.080
like if Haitians flee from
monstrous dictatorships

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.130
that we support in Haiti,
we're supposed to accept them

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.130
under international
law's refugees.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.320
But instead, you send them
off Cuba-- to Guantanamo--

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.930
as a storage place, of course,
used as a torture chamber.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.170
The Cubans want it back.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.470
We won't give it to them.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.060
Does this remind
you of something

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.568
that's happening in
world affairs right now?

00:09:22.568 --> 00:09:25.430
Yeah.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.080
Russia took over Crimea.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.292
Just as we've taken over eastern
Cuba for 110 years at gun

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.510
point.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.070
We don't formally annex
it, but we dominate it.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.790
Russia has a much stronger case
than the United States does.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.130
Crimea is primarily Russian.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.660
Its population overwhelmingly
supports Russia.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.920
It's got major
strategic significance.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.460
It's Russia's only
warm water port.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.190
It's the base for their fleet.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.840
It's right on the
border of Russia.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.830
Russia's surrounded by hostile
military alliance-- NATO.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.320
And for them, it's of great
strategic significance.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.030
Cuba for us is nothing.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.740
Guantanamo.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.370
It's just a means of
trying to undermine

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.340
Cuba-- prevent
Cuban development.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.100
And the United
States, of course,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.920
has been at war with
Cuba since 1959,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.230
when Cuba finally
did liberate itself.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.060
Immediately, the US began an
attack on Cuba under Kennedy.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.360
A massive terrorist
operation was

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.650
organized "to bring the
terrors of the earth to Cuba,"

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.560
was Arthur Schlesinger's
phrase describing it

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.110
in his biography of
Robert Kennedy, who

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.460
was in charge of it.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.760
It almost destroyed the world.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.150
It was a major factor that
led to the missile crisis.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.540
And it's gone on.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.582
It went on afterwards.

00:10:58.582 --> 00:11:03.770
The terror based in Florida has
gone on almost without a stop.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.460
On top of that, there's
an economic embargo

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.390
to strangle the country,
opposed by the entire world.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.600
Take a look at the votes--
annual votes in the General

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.800
Assembly, which don't
get reported here.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.480
It's 180 to two-- US
and Israel sometimes.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.040
The Marshall Islands
or something.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.390
Well, all of this is part of
the background to the AP story

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.110
about today's effort to
subvert the government of Cuba.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.080
Well, coming back to the
internet, what's interesting

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.000
is what is available, and
what isn't readily available,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.760
because people don't see it.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.930
Like, you won't find
a word about anything

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.680
I said in the press, or in
commentary, or discussion,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.960
although it's all
extremely timely.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.560
Very timely.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.080
Not arcane scholarship.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.740
But it's right in front of
our eyes, but not there.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.130
And when you come back to
the power of the internet,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.710
I think it comes back to us.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.370
We don't use it.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.240
We don't use the resource for
the purposes for which it could

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.720
be used-- to break through
the silence, oppression,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.520
domination, terror,
violence, and bring

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.690
the reality of the
world to people.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.580
So the internet, potentially,
is a wonderful tool,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.320
but only if you
decide to use it.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.160
If you decide to leave it in
the hands of private power,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.060
of power systems whether
state or private,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.630
sure-- it'll be used as a
way to oppress, undermine

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.940
and dominate.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.090
But that's a choice.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.610
Don't have to.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.106
INTERVIEWER: Well,
on that note, we

00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:42.439
will be posting this on YouTube.

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:43.410
NOAM CHOMSKY: What?

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.909
INTERVIEWER: We're going to be
posting this talk on YouTube,

00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:48.010
so your comments will
be on the internet.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.950
Happy to say.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.325
NOAM CHOMSKY:
Internet-- but they

00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:52.060
won't be in the New York Times.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.540
Well our channel is getting
more and more popular,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.570
so hopefully people
will find this.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.790
Switching gears a
little bit, what

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.850
is the most interesting insight
the science of linguistics

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.290
has revealed, but that
the public at large

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.322
seems to not know
about or appreciate?

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:18.490
Well, there are a number of
dogmas about language, which

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.100
I think are being
systematically refuted.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.700
And they're held by
linguists, too, I should say.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.000
Not just in the general public,
which are probably false,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.650
which I think are being
undermined by current research.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.960
This is a minority view.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.470
I'm not speaking
for the profession.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.590
The introductory
comments said that I'm

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.710
supposed to be a contrarian,
so I try to keep to that.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.290
But for example, one
general assumption

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:55.290
about language-- almost
a dogma in philosophy.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.230
Common understanding, the
linguistics of psychology,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.070
is that language is primarily
a means of communication,

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.240
and that it evolved as a
means of communication.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.360
Probably, that's totally false.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:17.620
It seems that language is
evolved and is designed

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:23.170
as a mode of creating
and interpreting thought.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.870
It's a system of
thought, basically.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.430
It can be used to communicate.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.360
Everything people do can
be used to communicate.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.320
You can communicate
by your hairstyle,

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.660
style of walk, everything.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.320
And yes, language can
be used to communicate,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.930
but it doesn't seem to
be part of its design.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.620
It's design seems to
be radically different,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.920
and in fact, even seems to
undermine communication.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.900
If you look carefully at
the structure of language,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:56.480
you find case after case, right
at the core of language design,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.160
where there are
conflicts between what

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.830
would be efficient
for communication,

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:08.160
and what is efficient for the
specific biological design

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.260
of language.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.940
And in every case that's
known, communicative efficiency

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.770
is sacrificed.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.100
It just isn't a consideration.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.830
I think that's a
conclusion that has

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.370
very widespread significance.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.830
In order to establish it, you
have to look at technical work.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.750
It's not the kind
of thing you can

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:33.160
explain in two
minutes of exposition.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.540
But it's not profound.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.745
It's not quantum physics.

00:15:35.745 --> 00:15:37.370
A half an hour would
certainly suffice.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.460
Suppliers And I think
it's a pretty far-reaching

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.160
consequence.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.440
Another general
belief about language,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.020
again, almost a dogma in all the
relevant fields-- philosophy,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.840
linguistics, and so on--
is that the meaningful,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.360
the minimal meaningful
elements in language,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.870
sort of word-like
things, pick out

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.100
entities in the
extra-mental world.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.970
So the word, say, river
picks out the Charles River,

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.240
and so on-- something that
a physicist could identify.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.410
That turns out to be
true for animal systems--

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.700
animal communication systems.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.490
The symbols that appear-- the
actions that are carried out--

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.560
do apparently have a
one to one correlation

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.640
with mind independent events.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.120
So some particular
call of a monkey

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.490
will be related to
leaves fluttering,

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:44.210
predators coming, sort of-- I'm
hungry, some hormonal change.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.550
It's just not true of language.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.690
Linguistic elements do
not have that property.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.712
Actually, this was
understood by Aristotle.

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.800
It was understood in the
17th and 18th centuries.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.710
Interesting work on it.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:03.710
The entities that we construct
in our communiques, discourse,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.720
expression, interpretation--
are largely mental-- partially,

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.359
mental object.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.540
There are ways in
which they are--

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.170
modes in which we
interpret phenomena.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.424
But they don't pick out
entities in the world

00:17:20.424 --> 00:17:24.010
that a natural
scientist could identify

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.359
without looking into our minds.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.670
That tells us a lot about
the nature of language,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.490
and about our own nature.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.590
Language is the
core human property.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.330
And this was
understood by Darwin,

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.630
by a long tradition before him.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.700
And it's very different from
the way it's usually conceived.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.300
I think those are among
really conclusions that

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.670
have pretty widespread
significance.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.210
Let me stress again,
a very minority view.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.730
Very few linguists
would agree with this.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:02.309
But I think, over time, I
suspect it will become clear.

00:18:02.309 --> 00:18:03.580
OK.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.970
In hopes and prospects, you
mentioned your colleague

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.986
Kenneth Hale and his work
with Native Americans.

00:18:08.986 --> 00:18:10.860
In your opinion, how
important is the problem

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.340
of language extinction?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.870
That is, how important
is it for humanity

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.340
to preserve the current level
of linguistic diversity?

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.200
Well, Ken Hale, who was a
friend of Anne's as well.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.570
The teacher was a fantastic
linguist and person, also.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.610
He worked extensively
with indigenous languages

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.580
all over the world.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.170
Australia-- he was
one of the founders

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.910
of Australian
linguistics-- worked

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.230
with Native American
languages, Central American,

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.210
African, and so on.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.610
And he did really amazing work,
but this particular aspect

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.680
of his work was something
that greatly concerned

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.490
and interested him--
trying to protect.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.050
And as he pointed
out, correctly,

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.130
when a language
disappears, a lot is lost.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:07.130
A language is a repository
of cultural wealth.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.860
It's a way-- this
actually relates

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.800
to what I was saying
before-- each language is

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.380
a way of understanding and
interpreting the world.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.150
It carries the
wealth of tradition

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:24.440
in history, oral history,
which can be extremely rich.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.360
Take the Bible, for example.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.770
For years, that
was oral history,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.540
before anything
was written down.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.960
Homer is oral history.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.130
And that's all over the world.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.984
And we're losing those
treasures every time

00:19:39.984 --> 00:19:40.900
a language disappears.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.520
And for the people themselves,
they're losing their identity.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.670
If English disappeared, we would
lose our cultural identity,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.260
and the same is true if it's
a small group somewhere.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.840
Well, one of Ken's
achievements in this regard,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:04.280
which was quite spectacular,
was to take the language, which

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.390
was one of the major
languages spoken

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.100
right here before
the colonists came.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.270
Remember, the
United States is not

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.190
an ordinary form of imperialism.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.900
The United States is a
secular colonial society.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.460
In fact, that's true
of the whole-- what's

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.510
called the Anglo sphere,
the countries that grew out

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:30.140
of Britain's
imperial domination.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.180
The United States, Canada,
Australia, mostly New Zealand--

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.920
these are countries where
the settlers who came in

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.850
didn't just run the country the
way the British did in India.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.700
British in India
provided the bureaucrats,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.120
you know, the officer
corps, and so on.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.480
But Indians ran the
country under British rule.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.270
Secular colonial societies
are different, like ours.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.530
If you go back to the founders
of the country-- like,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.330
say George Washington.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.680
He understood very well that
we have to, as he put it,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.220
extirpate the Iroquois.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.510
They're in our way.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.890
We have to wipe them out.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.500
They're and advanced
civilization.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.270
They, in fact, were
the basis for much

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.480
of the American
constitutional system.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.950
But we had to extirpate them.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.400
They were in our way.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.800
Thomas Jefferson said,
we have to exterminate

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.980
the native populations
because they're attacking us.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.340
And why are they attacking us?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.320
Well, because we're taking
everything away from them.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.020
He didn't say that.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.550
But in general, the
settler colonial societies

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.360
have to pretty much exterminate
the indigenous populations,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.160
or else marginalize them.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.710
Well that's happened here.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.810
So where we're
sitting was a place

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.990
where the indigenous
population was

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.580
close to exterminated--
pretty close to it.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.950
There are survivors.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.290
One of the major languages
spoken was one Wampanoag.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.660
It hadn't been
spoken for a century.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.290
The last speaker
was a century ago.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:07.330
Ken, and some students, and a
woman from the Wampanoag tribe,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.970
which still exists,
Jessie Little Doe,

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.650
managed to reconstruct
the language using

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.710
comparative evidence
from other languages,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.780
and missionary texts that
were taken and preserved.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.760
And from this, they
were able to reconstruct

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.740
what the language
must have been.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.965
And it now has its first native
speaker-- Jessie Little Doe's

00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:34.310
daughter, who's a native
speaker of Wampanoag.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.900
This has revitalized the tribe.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.660
They're now studying it.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.430
They're reconstructing
their history.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.390
They're reviving.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.810
It's a pretty
amazing achievement.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:51.610
Jessie got her Ph.D. with
us, with Ken, her department,

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.490
it's the first time this
has ever happened, I think.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.270
Now there are efforts to
do it In other places.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.690
But if you can
revive-- right now,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.140
there's enormous
destruction going on.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.030
Species destruction,
for example,

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.430
is taking place at a
level that hasn't happened

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:15.030
for 65 million years,
literally-- the time

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.280
when an asteroid hit
the earth, apparently,

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:24.191
and wiped out the dinosaurs, and
the majority of living species

00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:25.180
were destroyed.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.780
Mammals survived.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.840
That's why we're around.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.640
But, right now, the
same thing's happening.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.220
Species destruction is
happening, about at that level.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.950
And now, we're the
asteroid, of course.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.310
We're destroying the
species at a massive rate.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.160
Language destruction
is kind of a little

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.780
like that at a cultural
and human level.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.806
You're destroying the
richness of human civilization

00:23:53.806 --> 00:23:55.840
and understanding of the world.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.715
It's disappearing fast.

00:23:57.715 --> 00:24:00.350
It's disappearing
in Europe-- not just

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.210
in indigenous cultures.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.360
So if you go to,
say, Italy, there

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.770
are people all
over the place who

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.910
can't talk to
their grandmothers.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.410
The grandmothers speak
a different language.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.400
They're called dialects,
but they're actually

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.010
different languages.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.780
The number of
languages in Europe

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:21.170
has contracted radically
over recent years

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.980
through the policies
of state formation.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.120
When states are formed,
the formation of states

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.060
is an extremely violent process.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:36.832
It imposes a rigid
form on societies,

00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:38.540
bringing together
people who have nothing

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.200
to do with each
other, and separating

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.100
people who have everything
to do with each other.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.530
That's why Europe was
the most savage place

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.730
in the world for centuries while
the process of state formation

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.220
was taking place.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.970
You look around the world
today, and just about

00:24:54.970 --> 00:25:00.320
every major conflict is based
on the imperial borders.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.360
Borders were imposed
by the imperial powers

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.370
for their own interests,
forming states

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:11.800
which have no significance
for most of the people.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.640
So take, say, Pakistan
and Afghanistan.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.400
We talk about terrorists
crossing Pakistan

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.090
to Afghanistan.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.330
They are, many of them,
are just Pashtun--

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.830
moving from one part
of Pashtun territory

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.480
to another part of
Pashtun territory,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.200
which is separated by a line--
that the British imposed--

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.560
the Durand line-- which the
Afghans have never accepted

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.210
and the Pashtun
have never accepted.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.210
Now that happens everywhere.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.430
President Obama, one
of his achievements

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.380
has been to break all
records in deporting

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:54.120
undocumented immigrants--
almost two million.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.220
They're crossing a border--
the Mexico US border--

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.710
which, like state
borders generally,

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.330
was established by brutal
violence and aggression.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.550
The US conquered half of Mexico.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.280
President Grant described
it as, who fought in it,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.140
described it as the most
wicked war in history.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.940
Well, OK, that
established the border.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.210
It was a pretty open border.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.540
The same kind of people
living on both sides

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.410
until pretty recently.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.600
It's been heavily
militarized now.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.980
Primarily since NAFTA.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.790
When NAFTA, the North
American Free Trade Agreement,

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.710
was instituted, President
Clinton, his advisers,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.910
understood very
well that this is

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.650
going to devastate Mexican--
the Mexican economy.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.400
And it's going to destroy
Mexican agriculture.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.100
It's going to undermine
small business, and so on.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.250
Mexican compacinos can
be quite efficient,

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.210
but they can't compete
with highly subsidized U.S.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.167
Agro-business.

00:26:56.167 --> 00:26:58.000
So there's going to be
a flow of immigrants.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.210
So we've got to militarize
the border to prevent them.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.630
Send them back.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.150
Right now, to this day,
right here near Boston--

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.790
right around us--
there are people

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.360
fleeing from the
Guatemalan highlands.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.830
Mayan Indians, fleeing from
the Guatemalan highlands.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.340
Their languages are
also being destroyed.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.840
Why are they fleeing from
the Guatemalan highlands?

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.980
Well, under Ronald
Reagan, the US

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.900
supported a genocidal attacks
on the highlands, and the Mayan

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.900
Indians by the
military dictatorship

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.050
we were backing in Guatemala.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.260
And the devastation
was so extreme

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.170
that they're still fleeing.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.130
Well, they're fleeing.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.010
We deport them.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.110
They're coming
across from Mexico.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.800
We deport them.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.870
That's a state border.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.500
That's the way borders work.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.050
All over the world,
that's the way it works.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.750
Take a look at the horror
stories all of the world.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.420
Almost entirely, the result
of the imposition of state

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.240
borders, which also
has the consequence

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.590
of wiping out lots of languages.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.380
When you impose a state
border, it constitutes, say,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.580
France, or Italy, or
Germany, or Guatemala,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.060
or whatever it may be, or the
United States for that matter,

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.950
you're wiping out huge
numbers of languages

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.760
which are internal to them.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.820
Well, this is a kind of--
it's not species destruction,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.745
but it's kind of
analogous to it.

00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:26.940
And it's going on all the time.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:33.640
And the effort to save species,
cultures, societies, languages

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.260
is a major effort.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.120
Happening in Europe, too.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.290
So right now
there's a referendum

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.080
coming up in Catalonia.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.740
Another one in Scotland
asking about autonomy,

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.180
or independence.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.350
That's dissolving the European
state system, something

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.590
which has been
going on for awhile,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.840
and reconstructing
the languages.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.710
Actually, I visited
Barcelona in the late '70s.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.180
You couldn't hear
a word of Catalan.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.820
It was spoken, but secret,
because under the dictatorship,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.930
which the US backed,
it was barred.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.010
10 years later, if
you go to Catalonia,

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.890
all you hear is Catalan.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.890
It revived.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.170
The Basque languages revived.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.030
Other regional
languages are reviving.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.510
If you walk around Wales,
kids walking out of school

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.190
are talking Welsh.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.710
Things like this are happening.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.880
Ken's achievement
was unique, but it's

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.520
a kind of a natural development.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.990
I think it should be
stimulated myself.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.380
But we should
recognize that there's

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:51.110
enormous loss when the cultural
wealth of a society disappears.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.600
That's encapsulated
crucially in its language.

00:29:57.672 --> 00:29:58.630
INTERVIEWER: All right.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.630
So I'm going to change
gears a little bit again.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.290
Can you comment on
the contribution

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.550
of research and statistical
natural language processing

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.520
to linguistics?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.650
And that's a yes/no question,
I realize, but-- OK.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.910
NOAM CHOMSKY: One of the
early proponents of it,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.630
maybe the earliest
in 1955, when I

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.190
was working on
linguistic theory,

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.290
it seemed to me the
only possible way

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:30.900
in which a, let's say, a
child, could identify words

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.310
in continuous text-- you know,
you're not hearing single words

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.520
when you live in the world.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.190
You're hearing continuous text.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.600
It seemed to me the only
way that is could be done

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:50.230
was by detecting transitional
probabilities of sounds

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.030
or syllables.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.930
If you get to a word
boundary, the predictability

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.330
of the next sound is lower
than if you're inside a word.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:01.930
Right?

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.450
For obvious reasons.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.840
So if you check these
transitional probabilities,

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.590
it looked as if you ought
to be able to detect words.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.640
That's probably
the first proposal.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.840
Maybe the first
proposal of literature.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.690
It turns out not to be accurate.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.900
Just in the last
couple of years,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.250
there's been some
really careful work

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:28.200
on statistical
analysis of texts.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.960
Charles Yang, who got
his Ph.D. At MIT-- he's

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.712
now at Penn, a computational
linguist cognitive

00:31:34.712 --> 00:31:39.270
scientist-- he showed
that if you actually

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:42.610
use this technique on connected
text, that what you get

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.640
is syllables, not words.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.190
So that doesn't work.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.870
He also pointed out that if
you add a linguistic principle,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.820
you do get a better
approximation to words.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:00.100
Linguistic principle is that
a word-- well, real words,

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.460
tend to have stress
peak within them--

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.730
stress pitch peek inside them.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.010
So if you add that
principle, and then you

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.470
do the statistical analysis,
you get a better approximation.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.150
There's subsequent work by a
number of cognitive scientists

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:19.350
which has shown
that if you add what

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:23.390
are called the prosodic
structure-- the whole pitch

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:27.800
stress structure of a
sentence-- it goes up and down,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.730
but really reflecting
phrases pretty much,

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.380
if you look at the
pitch structure.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.330
If you add all of
that, and then you

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.160
do the statistical
analysis, you get

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.470
and even better approximation.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:42.770
Now this is one of the very
few cases where there's

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:47.300
any results from
statistical analysis.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.690
There has been-- there's
a kind of a industry

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:57.890
in computational cognitive
science and computer

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.810
science trying to
show that you can

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.480
get significant
knowledge of a language

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.100
by statistical analysis of text.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.710
Antecedently, that's
extremely unlikely to succeed.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.450
You do not get discoveries
in the sciences

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:22.030
by taking huge amounts of data,
throwing them into a computer,

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.860
and doing statistical
analysis of them.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.900
Try to think it through in
the history of the sciences.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.910
It just doesn't happen.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.840
That's not the way
you understand things.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.490
You have to have
theoretical insights.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.290
You have to know what
kind of experiments

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:40.580
to carry out-- what kind of
data are worth looking at,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.170
which kind of throw
away, and so on.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.950
That's the way the sciences
have always worked.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.860
If you wanted to, say,
study the laws of motion,

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.700
you could take a huge
number of videotapes

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.050
of what's happening
outside the window,

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.380
and subject them to
statistical analysis.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.360
You could get a
pretty good prediction

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.296
of the next thing that's going
to happen outside the window--

00:34:04.296 --> 00:34:05.920
actually, a better
prediction than what

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.150
the physics department can give.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.710
But it's not science.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:17.020
It's a way of matching data, and
maybe predicting some new data.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.440
But that's not what
understanding is.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.409
And it's very unlikely to
work for language, either.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.840
And I think the record shows
that it really fails totally.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.730
I could run through examples.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.790
But every example that's
been carefully studied,

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.770
it simply doesn't work,
for pretty much the reasons

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.850
that Charles Yang and his
successors discovered.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:43.040
You have to have the-- have to
understand the principles that

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.204
determine what
underlies the system.

00:34:47.204 --> 00:34:49.620
And then if you look around
the edges of those principles,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.480
you can find some sometimes
useful statistical data.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.139
I think that's probably the
way it's going to continue,

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.300
but certainly is the
way it has so far.

00:35:00.622 --> 00:35:02.580
INTERVIEWER: We're going
to change gears again.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.190
What, in your opinion, are
the most effective strategies

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.836
for building a more and
just peace-- I'm sorry,

00:35:08.836 --> 00:35:11.460
start over again-- for building
a more just and peaceful world,

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.100
and in your view, what are the
best-- the most significant

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.800
takeaways-- from
Occupy the Arabs bring,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.540
and the Ukrainian
Euromaiden uprising.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.520
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, those are
all quite different events,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.660
and I don't think you
can consolidate them.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.460
Over time, there has--
you know, history

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.600
doesn't just go in
a straight line.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.090
There's progress,
there's regression.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.650
And they're often in parallel.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:46.910
So say, take the last say, 50,
60 years in the United States.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.730
There's been
significant progress

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:54.410
in developing a more peaceful
and just and equitable society.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.810
Probably the most dramatic
example is women's rights.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.400
Totally different from what
it was 50 or 60 years ago.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.430
It may be kind of
hard to remember,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:07.820
but if you look at US
history, at the time

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.540
of the American Revolution,
the women were not people.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.110
They were property.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.020
The United States took
over British common law.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.720
And under British
common law, a woman

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.050
is the property of
her father, and it's

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.590
transferred to her husband.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.500
So for example, one of the
arguments against giving women

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.330
votes was that it would be
unfair to unmarried men,

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:38.380
because a married man would
have two votes, since obviously

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:42.480
the property votes the
way the owner votes.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.760
That was US law.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.130
If you look at the
chipping away of this,

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:53.760
it literally was not until
1975 that this principle

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.320
was abandoned.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.300
in 1975, the Supreme Court
ruled that women have the right

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.610
to serve as peers
in federal jury.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.860
Peer means a person
just like you.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.130
OK, that goes back to the Magna
Carta in the 13th century.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:17.740
Women were accepted as
peers legally in 1975.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.340
Now that was part of
a major change that's

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:25.200
taken place in American
culture since the 1960s--

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.240
one of the main outgrowths
of '60s activism.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.570
And there are plenty of
other things like it.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:34.060
So opposition to, say,
violent aggression

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:39.750
is far above what it
was 50 or 60 years ago.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:44.350
Take, say, Kennedy's
invasion of South Vietnam.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.100
It's a phrase you've
never heard, I suppose,

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.870
because it isn't
in consciousness.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.210
It happened in the world,
but it wasn't reported

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.080
and it isn't part
of American history.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.560
In the 1962, Kennedy sent
the American Air Force

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.270
to start bombing South Vietnam.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:07.160
Authorized chemical
warfare to destroy crops,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.470
so to drive the people
out of the countryside.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.111
Began big programs to
concentrate people, and put

00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:15.550
them out at the
concentration camps,

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.420
to prevent them from supporting
the guerrilla movement, which

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.660
was overthrowing the US
installed government.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.340
That's an invasion.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.520
It happened, but not
in our consciousness.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.230
The reason it's not
in our consciousness

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.380
is there was no opposition.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.340
It was recorded.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.590
It was kind of known.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.680
You know, like it wasn't a
total secret, but nobody cared.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.812
You couldn't get people
to talk about it.

00:38:40.812 --> 00:38:42.270
I mean, literally
I remember trying

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:46.890
to give talks in the early
'60s in people's living rooms.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.650
You could get more people
than that together.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.530
Well that was the early '60s.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:59.208
In 2003, the United
States invaded Iraq.

00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:03.880
It's the first time in the
history of the imperial world

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.420
that there have been massive
protests prior to the invasion,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.640
prior to the invasion-- huge
protests all of the world.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.300
Here, too.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.710
My classes were called off
because the students wanted

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.610
to call them off to go
down to the demonstration.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.360
That was 2003.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.590
Well, it didn't end the
war, but it limited it.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.469
It's often believed
that the demonstrations

00:39:30.469 --> 00:39:31.260
didn't do anything.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.000
That's a mistake.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.030
The United States could not
begin to carry out the policies

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.360
that Kennedy and
Johnson could carry out

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.280
without a second thought.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.530
It was bad enough, but
it wasn't B52 bombing

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.110
of heavily populated
urban centers.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.350
It wasn't chemical
warfare destroying crops.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.670
Many of the atrocities
of the Vietnam War

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.020
simply couldn't be contemplated.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.090
Horrible enough, but not that.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.080
OK, all of that is progress.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.200
There's also a regression.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.510
There's been a big
backlash from power centers

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:09.780
against the civilizing
effect of the '60s.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.870
Now, that's the
neoliberal attack

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.370
on the population which has
been going on for a generation.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.870
That's why, say,
real wages, real,

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:25.550
for male workers-- real wages
today are at the level of 1968

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.770
for the general public.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.840
And real wages are about
the level of 30 years ago.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.000
There's been some
stagnation or decline

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.750
for the majority
of the population.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.770
Tremendous concentration
of wealth in tiny number

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.710
of-- tiny sector
of the population.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:49.530
Mostly a fraction of 1%,
which feeds politics.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:53.170
Political power
reflects economic power.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:58.530
The Supreme Court just yesterday
just struck another blow

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.700
against democracy and
its committed effort

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.450
to try to undermine
the functioning

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.470
of a democratic system
by placing power

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.352
in the hands of those
who are super rich.

00:41:11.352 --> 00:41:12.870
OK, that's going on.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.960
That's the McCutcheon
case a couple days ago.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.970
Well, that's regression.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.130
And they're going
on in parallel.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.120
That's the way history works.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.130
So what's the way to go forward?

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.050
Well, you know, as
Martin Luther King

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:30.750
put it-- shift
the arc of history

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.250
by your own efforts in activism.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.820
That's the only way
it's ever worked.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.629
The arc of history bends the
way we decide to bend it.

00:41:39.629 --> 00:41:41.170
INTERVIEWER: In
"Hopes and Prospects"

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.470
you compare Obama and Bush II.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.350
That's four years ago.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:46.480
What would you say today?

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.100
NOAM CHOMSKY: Like
what I just said

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.870
about the arc of history--
both better in some ways, worse

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.470
in others.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:03.400
So, for example, I
mentioned Guantanamo.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.280
Guantanamo is a
major torture center.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.480
OK, today, probably
torture isn't

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.280
taking place in Guantanamo--
at least what we call torture.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.720
Remember, the United States has
a special definition of torture

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.510
which is different from
the world's definition.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:26.480
So for example, in the
world, a solitary confinement

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.730
is considered torture.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.470
You take a look at the
torture convention--

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.610
international
torture convention.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:36.100
Solitary confinement
is regarded--

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.220
and other forms of
mental torture--

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.050
are regarded as torture.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.220
And they are.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.640
You try to lock yourself up in
a room for a couple of days,

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.800
and you'll see what happens.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.370
So it's kind of torture.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.970
In the United States, it's
surely going on in Guantanamo.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:53.410
But it's also a routine.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.290
It goes on in the
prisons all the time.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.280
You go to the maximum
security prisons,

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.820
they are torture chambers.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:06.900
People are confined 23
hours a day in a small room.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.850
It drives you insane.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:11.860
So torture-- what
we call torture

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.660
isn't going on in Guantanamo.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.190
What is torture is
going on, but it's

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.540
going on in the incarceration
system generally.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.850
And that system is a real
international scandal

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.620
on scale [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.490
So that's an improvement.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.770
No magnificent,
but an improvement.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:37.590
On the other hand, there's
the surveillance programs,

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:41.842
which are-- I don't have
to talk to you about them.

00:43:41.842 --> 00:43:42.900
You know about them.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.930
They're mostly Obama.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.580
The subversion of Cuba
that I mentioned-- that's

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.020
a new Obama program.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:57.430
The worst global terrorism
campaign under way right

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.520
now is Obama's global
assassination campaign.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.070
The Drone Campaign.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.570
Notice that there's a
debate in the United States

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.240
when he decides to
murder Americans.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.205
Like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:16.205 --> 00:44:18.190
You know, is that
legitimate or not?

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.500
And what about the other people?

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.960
The people that are being
murdered are suspects.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.350
Go back 800 years
again to Magna Carta.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:30.720
We're going to commemorate
its 800th anniversary

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.600
next year-- probably
morn its disappearance.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.630
The core concept
developed in Magna Carta

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.870
was what we call
presumption of innocence.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:48.960
What it stated is that a
free man cannot be subjected

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.380
to state punishment
without due process--

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:58.040
without trial by
a jury of peers.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.540
OK?

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:04.060
Now, free man was a very limited
concept in the 13th century.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.140
Of course, it excluded women.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.480
It excluded people who
weren't free and so on.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.470
It gradually expanded
over the centuries.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.580
So it's embedded
in the Constitution

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:19.830
also with limits-- the 14th
Amendment, other limits.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.000
But now it's being contracted.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.450
The Drone Campaign eliminates
presumption of innocence.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.150
The way it works is,
Obama and his advisers

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.430
get together Tuesday
morning and decide

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:37.560
who they're going
to kill that day.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.830
The concept guilty means
Obama decided to murder you.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.440
That's the meaning of
the concept guilty today.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.530
That's a regression that
goes back 800 years.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:53.160
That's pretty serious.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.450
And what's even more serious
is, it's not discussed.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:46:01.980
The only thing that is discussed
is the killing of Americans.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.520
Are Americans different species?

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.990
Who says you can
kill other suspects?

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.544
There's some talk about
collateral damage.

00:46:10.544 --> 00:46:12.960
What about the people who are
just standing around and get

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.870
killed?

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.125
Well, yeah-- that's bad.

00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:17.660
But what about the
people you're aiming at?

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.130
They are suspects.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.930
You haven't shown a proof
of anything about them.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.820
Just somebody the
government wants to kill.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.030
That's true of
domestic law, too.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.750
Actually, I'm one of
the plaintiffs in a suit

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.830
that I'm not entirely happy
about for this reason.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.820
It's a suit about the NDAA
brought by Chris Hedges.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.150
A couple of other
people are plaintiffs.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:44.310
The NDAA legislation
under Obama--

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:47.400
he says he doesn't like
it, but he signed it.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.370
It permits indefinite detention.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.860
It extends the principle
of indefinite detention

00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:01.280
for suspects who are, under
this relatively new legislation

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.660
under Obama.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.310
In includes-- it is
written in such a way

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:07.455
that it could include
American citizens.

00:47:07.455 --> 00:47:09.180
It's not explicit.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.380
That's what the suit is about.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:19.220
But the concept is-- it permits
indefinite detention of people

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:24.880
charged with providing support
for enemies of the United

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.060
States.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.110
What's support?

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.870
Well, like saying maybe they got
a case, or something like that.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.710
Is that support?

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.700
It's not a joke, incidentally.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.985
The narrow case--
the very narrow case

00:47:39.985 --> 00:47:42.780
is against one part--
the fact that is

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.370
might apply to
American citizens.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.280
I think it's way too narrow.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.544
It shouldn't apply to anybody.

00:47:48.544 --> 00:47:49.960
There should never
be such a thing

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.805
as independent
indefinite detention.

00:47:52.805 --> 00:47:54.380
It's criminal.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.280
And the idea of
supporting enemies

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.920
is so meaningless, that such a
concept shouldn't exist as law.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.990
But it's a narrow
case about Americans.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.990
And that's the framework
of discourse here.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.790
You shouldn't accept
it, I don't think.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:15.670
In fact, take another
Obama case-- one

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.090
of Obama's major attacks
on civil liberties.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.210
It's a case that probably most
of you haven't heard about,

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:25.009
but I'd look it
up if I were you.

00:48:25.009 --> 00:48:26.550
It's a nice thing
about the internet.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:32.440
Holder v. Humanitarian
Law Project-- case

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:38.340
brought by the government to the
Supreme Court Government One.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.260
Holder is the Attorney General.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.020
Humanitarian Law
Project was a group

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.930
that was giving legal
advice-- legal advice--

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:50.470
to a group that's on
the US terrorist list.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:54.400
The group happened to be
the PKK-- Kurdish group.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.930
The US government calls
it a terrorist group,

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.930
so it's on the terrorist list.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:04.520
Humanitarian Law Project was
giving legal advice to them.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.870
Obama's Justice
Department decided

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:12.360
to condemn that as material
assistance to terrorism.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.530
Material assistance
of terrorism used

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.110
to mean giving a gun to
somebody in Al Qaeda.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.050
But this extends it
to giving legal advice

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.790
to someone on the
government's terrorist list.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:32.660
And if you look at the
court discussion colloquy,

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.790
it could maybe apply
to somebody who

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:38.780
has an interview with
Nasrallah, you know,

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.140
the head of Hezbollah.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:45.990
Or just talks to,
maybe advises, a group

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:48.020
to turn to non-violence.

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.350
That could be regarded
as material assistance

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:51.810
under Obama.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.350
That's a tremendous attack
on the freedom of speech,

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:59.810
and just ordinate
elementary justice--

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.360
passed almost without comment.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.300
Now we might ask
ourselves-- why should

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.940
we even takes the
terrorist list seriously?

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.210
What's the terrorist list?

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.480
The executive branch
of the government

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.230
simply determines
you're a terrorist.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.480
I put you on the list.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.500
No review.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.850
No judicial review.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.370
No defense.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:26.122
It's just an executive act
of an authoritarian state.

00:50:26.122 --> 00:50:28.330
And if you look at the
history of the terrorist list,

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.140
it's mind-boggling.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.550
Like, Nelson
Mandela, for example,

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:37.560
was on the terrorist list
because Reagan administration

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.610
condemned them as-- his group,
the African National Congress,

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.409
as one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world

00:50:46.409 --> 00:50:47.950
because they were
opposing apartheid,

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.220
which Reagan supported.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.930
OK, so that's the
terrorist list.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.650
And Mandela was on until
about four years ago,

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.600
when it took a special
Act of Congress

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.430
to get him off the
terrorist list.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:03.370
On the other hand, take,
say, Saddam Hussein.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:08.144
He was taken off the
terrorist list in 1982,

00:51:08.144 --> 00:51:09.810
because the Reagan
administration wanted

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:14.230
to provide arms to Iraq,
so in order to be legal,

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.450
he had to be off
the terrorist list.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:19.670
Actually, that left a gap
in the terrorist list,

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.560
so they put Cuba in.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.550
Why?

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:27.270
Because Cuba has been the target
of more terrorism than the rest

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.790
of the world combined
in the years before it,

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.790
mostly based in Florida.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.650
That's the terrorist list.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:37.250
So apart from being kind
of ludicrous in the way it

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.290
actually works, the very
concept is an abomination.

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:43.560
Why should the
state have the right

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.936
to determine unilaterally
who's a terrorist?

00:51:47.936 --> 00:51:49.900
Do they have that right?

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.470
No, they don't.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.400
Do they have the
right to murder people

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.850
who they put on
the terrorist list?

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.210
No they don't.

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:01.280
Do they have the right to
charge people with material

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.760
assistance to terrorism if
they give legal aid to somebody

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.330
that they've designated
as a terrorist?

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:11.810
This gets more and more
extreme as you go on.

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:14.410
These are Obama innovations.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:18.180
Well, history doesn't
go straight line.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.600
And I think, myself,
Bush would've been worse,

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.400
but not that there's much to
cheer about in this regard.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.710
AUDIENCE: With cultures that
didn't have a written language

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.720
until another culture
came in that did,

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.890
and they adopted
their writing system.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.620
Is there any systematic
effect on languages

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.460
that adopted someone
else's writing system?

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:45.400
NOAM CHOMSKY: There is a
systematic effect of literacy.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.680
It's not so much adopting
the writing system

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.280
as using it for reading.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.140
So if we actually want,
there's a-- Ken Hale,

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:57.610
same guy we talked
about before-- he

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:02.490
did a very important study in
the 1970s in which he showed

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:08.670
that-- an article that appeared
on what's called cultural gaps.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:13.080
He studied the languages that
he worked on, mostly Australian,

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:18.380
and found that many of
them had all kind of what

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:19.430
looked like gaps.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.600
Like, they didn't
have number words.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.369
They didn't have color words.

00:53:23.369 --> 00:53:24.910
Or they didn't have
relative clauses.

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:27.800
A lot of other things
they didn't have.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.450
And what he showed
was that all of this

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.940
was just totally superficial.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.780
The people had all the concept.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.580
They had no problem with
dealing with any of them.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.790
They used them all the time,
but just in more indirect ways.

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:44.630
So if they didn't
have number words,

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:49.280
they would still be
able to say five, ten.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.160
They had no problem dealing
with market societies.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.470
They may not have
had the color red,

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:56.580
but they could say blood-like.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.980
And the same was true
even of structural things,

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.260
like embedded relative clauses.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.620
Well, that was an
important study.

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.450
Ignored, like most
important studies.

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:11.060
But, shortly after it, somebody
else in our department, Wayne

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:15.480
O'Neil, another friend
of Anne's and mine,

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.080
who studies the
history of English,

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.510
he did a study of
middle English.

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:24.490
And he investigated, and if
he was looking for something

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:30.460
similar, he discovered that the
use of complex constructions,

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:34.140
which had embedded
elements in them,

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.840
increased as literacy increased.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.290
There's a natural
reason for that.

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.900
When you speak,
you're constrained

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.950
by short term memory,
which is pretty small.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:50.920
Short term memory is around
seven or something like that.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.560
The same for humans
and other organisms.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.060
And that means
you can't do much.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:59.920
So ordinary speech tends to
be what's called para-tactic.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.070
You just kind of tack things
on one after the other,

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:06.550
because you can't embed.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:10.400
On the other hand, once
you move to literacy,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.990
you begin to use capacities that
you always had but never used.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:21.560
It's like, when
the people learn.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.220
You go to school and, you
say, first grade or something,

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.200
and they teach you
how to multiply.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.600
You begin to use a capacity
which you always had.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.190
It's not taught.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.430
It's part of your
intrinsic capacities

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:38.300
that you have the
capacity for number.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.240
Every society has it.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.410
Every human being has it.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:47.680
It's kind of a mystery that
bothered Darwin and Wallace--

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.790
the founders of
evolutionary theory.

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:53.440
They asked, how could it
evolve since it's never used?

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.280
But it's true that
everyone has it.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.410
But you can't do
it in your head.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.764
Like, you can't multiply
big numbers in your head.

00:56:01.764 --> 00:56:02.550
Right?

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.820
You'd collapse after
a very short period.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.630
But you can multiply them
once you learn the technique,

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.380
because you've
got the knowledge.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.210
You just have to exhibit it.

00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.920
And the same thing
happens with literacy.

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.450
Once literacy spreads,
you get much more complex

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:22.440
linguistic usage, even in
speech, because it carries over

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.090
from writing to speech.

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:27.720
So that effect I think
is real and documented.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.790
But the effect of just using.

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:35.870
If you just use the letters
to say, write things,

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:38.086
but you never read,
I'd doubt if it

00:56:38.086 --> 00:56:39.510
would have much of an effect.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.760
AUDIENCE: I'm curious as to
your thoughts, because I'm

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.210
standing now, as
to your thoughts

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.530
on-- I guess some
people have said

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:48.250
that the effect of technology
on certain languages

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.370
has made us dumber.

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:52.510
So like, texting,
LOL, or hash tags.

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:54.470
And if that's actually
true, or if it's

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:56.380
just the same as
any appendians, like

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.565
new words being
added to languages.

00:56:59.565 --> 00:57:01.190
NOAM CHOMSKY: I think
the real question

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:04.650
about the, what might be
the cognitive effect--

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:11.130
the current kind of teenage
technology-- it does

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:14.450
have a very superficial
aspect to it.

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:20.060
So, that's true, for
example, of Facebook.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.600
People think they
have lots of-- I

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.620
mean I know of
cases, teenagers, who

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.260
think they have lots of
friends, hundreds of friends.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:33.840
Because if they write,
I've got an exam tomorrow,

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.180
they'll get 100 letters saying,
I hope you do well, and so on.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.710
And the communication
is very restricted.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:46.470
A simple formula is
things like that.

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:51.070
So does it have a
dumbing down effect?

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:53.050
I kind of doubt it, frankly.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:56.340
But, you know, it is a
topic that could be studied.

00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.130
It is being studied, in fact.

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:01.920
But as far as I know,
there are no real results,

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.950
and I think it
would be surprising,

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:07.470
because it's all
kind of superficial.

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:09.830
It does add a kind
of superficiality

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:13.920
to life, which may
not be a good thing.

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.660
I think it's probably
harmful in the long run.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:22.950
But to try to-- I feel like I'm
bringing coals to Newcastle.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:24.540
You people know a
lot more about this

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.030
than I do, because I don't
use any of this stuff,

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:31.366
except with my grandchildren,
when I have to.

00:58:31.366 --> 00:58:32.490
Is there one last question?

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:35.070
We have time for
a quick question.

00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:35.570
There.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.640
Is the-- so the diversity
of languages and cultures

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.630
is wonderful, but if there is
on the other side, if you would

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:49.330
say anything, if you
would, sort of allow

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:55.110
that having a unified
language and common culture

00:58:55.110 --> 00:59:00.110
helps communication and
may advance world peace?

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:02.340
Well I don't if
it advances peace.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.300
In fact, it seems to have
the opposite, because you're

00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:10.540
forcing people into
situations of conflict.

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.310
And the one language
that dominates

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.030
is just the most powerful
state in the world.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.740
But there's an advantage,
to having, say,

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.130
a single language for science.

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:24.940
OK, so by now, English is pretty
much the language of science.

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:28.590
When I got to MIT
60 years ago, I

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:33.570
was teaching scientific French
and scientific German-- all

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:36.690
graduate students
in every field had

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.950
to pass an exam in
French and German.

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:44.010
It was a complete fake,
but that was kind of

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.280
like a residue of the
pre-second World War period.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.890
But it was true.

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:52.840
You go back 70 years,
a civil engineer

00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.630
had to know French or German.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:57.930
OK now, that's all gone.

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:00.625
All around most of the world,
the language of science

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:01.760
is English.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.310
That's helpful.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:05.110
On the other hand,
exactly as you say,

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:11.380
there's also-- if that
extend from just some mode

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:15.390
of communication to the
actual languages of life,

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.530
it would be a real loss.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.860
We would lose cultural wealth.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.085
Actually, if you live
in the United States,

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:25.880
and you travel abroad,
you see it very quickly.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.020
The United States is an
extremely insular society.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.570
People don't know anything
about the outside world.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:39.110
Students in colleges don't
know where France is.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:41.310
It's just-- they
don't know anything.

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:45.070
It's remarkably different from
Europe and other countries.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.470
And part of the
reason is that, you

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:50.710
can go 3,000 miles
in the United States,

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:54.360
and it looks exactly
like where you came from.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.960
Go to Boston to Los Angeles, the
weather's a little different,

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.800
but everything else is the same.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.760
The accent is
slightly different.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.490
You go 100 miles in Europe, and
you're in a different society.

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:07.740
So you just kind
of automatically

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:13.200
gain comprehension of the
richness and complexity of life

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.690
that's missing when
societies are homogeneous.

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:20.110
Of course American society
isn't literally homogeneous.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:23.290
But, comparatively
speaking, it is.

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.700
And I think that's
the kind of loss

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.490
you would get if,
in fact, you moved

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:32.830
towards a universal language.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:36.410
Also, I just don't think
there's any possibility that's

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.960
happening.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.960
As I said, in
Europe, there's now

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.810
actually a reaction against
the unifying tendencies

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:45.830
of the European Union--
more regionalization,

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:48.390
regional languages, cultures.

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.020
It's not just
languages, incidentally.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:53.060
So take Catalonia,
which I mentioned.

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:58.280
Under the Franco dictatorship,
Catalonian language and culture

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.420
were totally suppressed.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.660
They could not be
exhibited in public.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.860
But, if you go to
Barcelona today,

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:11.590
let's say, you can
on Sunday morning,

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:15.500
if you're downtown in Barcelona,
take a look at the cathedral.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:21.500
There's people swarming towards
the cathedral-- folk singers,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.610
folk dances, Catalan
cultures being revived.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:28.130
It's a rich culture
being revived.

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:29.950
It was kind of
there, underground.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.480
Now it's open.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.960
And I think that's
just healthy for life.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:41.167
[APPLAUSE]
