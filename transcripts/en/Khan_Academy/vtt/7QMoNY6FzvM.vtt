00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.080
We're asked to graph the
equation y is equal to negative

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.470
2 times x minus
2 squared plus 5.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.400
So let me get by scratch pad out
so we could think about this.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.730
So y is equal to negative 2
times x minus 2 squared plus 5.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.420
So one thing, when you see a
quadratic or a parabola graph

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.200
expressed in this way, the
thing that might jump out at you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.680
is that this term
right over here

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.495
is always going to be
positive because it's

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:30.690
some quantity squared.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.940
Or I should say, it's always
going to be non-negative.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.550
It could be equal to 0.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.677
So it's always going to
be some quantity squared.

00:00:36.677 --> 00:00:38.510
And then we're multiplying
it by a negative.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.380
So this whole quantity
right over here

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.160
is going to be non positive.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.550
It's always going to be
less than or equal to 0.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080
So this thing is always
less than or equal to 0,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.750
the maximum value
that y will take on

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.430
is when this thing
actually does equal 0.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.590
So the maximum
value for y is at 5.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.430
The maximum value for y is 5.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.750
And when does that happen?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.485
Well, y hits 5 when
this whole thing is 0.

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:11.860
And when does this
thing equal 0?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.570
Well, this whole thing equals
0 when x minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.910
And x minus 2 is equal to
0 when x is equal to 2.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.870
So the point 2 comma
5 is the maximum point

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.990
for this parabola.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.400
And it is actually
going to be the vertex.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.290
So if we were to graph this,
so the point 2 comma 5.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.690
So that's my y-axis.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.800
This is my x-axis.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.420
So this is 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.660
So this right here is
the point 2 comma 5.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.670
This is a maximum point,
it's a maximum point

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.152
for this parabola.

00:01:47.152 --> 00:01:49.610
And now I want to find two more
points so that I can really

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.568
determine the parabola.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:54.360
Three points completely
determine a parabola.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.021
So that's 1, the vertex,
that's interesting.

00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:58.520
Now, what I'd like
to do is just get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.430
two points that are
equidistant from the vertex.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.960
And the easiest way to do
that is to maybe figure out

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.940
what happens when x is equal
to 1 and when x is equal to 3.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.140
So I could make a table here
actually, let me do that.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.540
So I care about x being equal
to 1, 2, and 3, and what

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.150
the corresponding y is.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.422
We already know that when x is
equal to 2, y is equal to 5.

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:24.720
2 comma 5 is our vertex.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.510
When x is equal to 1, 1
minus 2 is negative 1,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.850
squared is just 1.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.920
So this thing is going
to be negative 2 plus 5,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.410
so it's going to be 3.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.120
And when x is equal to
3, this is 3 minus 2,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.880
which is 1 squared is 1 times
negative 2 is negative 2 plus 5

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.281
is 3 as well.

00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:43.280
So we have three points.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.980
We have the point 1 comma
3, the point 2 comma 5,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.530
and the point 3 comma
3 for this parabola.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.930
So let me go back
to the exercise

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.710
and actually put
those three points in.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.670
And so we have the point 1 comma
3, we have the point 2 comma 5,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.470
and we have the point 3 comma 3.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.430
And we have now fully
determined our parabola.
