00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.260
Everybody loves Disney movies!

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.780
From kids to adults, pretty much everyone
seems love getting lost in the fun stories,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.030
characters and songs from the world of Walt
Disney.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.180
These movies are also famously stuffed with
hidden easter eggs, messages and references

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.430
and over the years they have led to some pretty
awesome and convincing theories.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.140
We’ve gathered some of the best ones for
our list of 10 Disney Movie Theories That

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.620
Actually Make Sense.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.719
Snow White Dies
Snow White is the oldest feature length animated

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.050
Disney movie and it famously ends with a nice
happily ever after scenario, or so we thought.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.060
It turns out that Snow White’s Prince Charming
may not be who we all assumed he was after

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.060
all.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.989
One well respected theory suggests that instead
of the knight in shining armor everyone has

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.019
thought he was, that he’s actually the Grim
Reaper, who has arrived to escort Snow into

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.019
the after life.

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.309
This theory is pretty creepy and definitely
not great for kids, but when you consider

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.370
the dark origins of most fairy tales, it totally
makes sense.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.160
Ariel's Mom
Disney is no stranger to Easter eggs and hidden

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.530
messages, but this one must have taken some
serious planning as the two movies came out

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.820
thirty years apart.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.820
The mermaids in Peter Pan may have been forgettable,
but when you look closely you can see that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.850
one of them has bright red hair and greatly
resembles Ariel.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.490
We never get to meet Ariel's mother in The
Little Mermaid, we do get to learn that her

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.130
name is Athena, and the mermaid in Peter Pan
is never named, meaning her name could conceivably

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.130
be Athena.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.659
It is also revealed that Athena was killed
by pirates, and the mermaid in Peter Pan would

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.310
have been around while Captain Hook was at
large, so it’s definitely possible that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.229
he offed her.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.880
Andy’s Mom in Toy Story
The action of the series mainly follows the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
toys of Toy Story, but as it turns outs one
of the most interesting and convincing theories

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.420
from this franchise is all about the owner
of the toys.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.520
In Toy Story 2, fans found out that Jessie
was originally owned by a girl named Emily,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340
before she was sadly given away.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.159
But many fans have pointed out that the movie
seems to indicate that Emily is actually the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.649
mother of Andy, who of course owns all the
main toys.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.340
In the first story, Andy is playing with Woody
while wearing Jessie’s hat – the same

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.720
one Emily played with when she was younger.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.770
Since 30 years have passed since Emily gave
Jessie away, the age makes sense.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.440
This seems far too convenient to not be true
and we are happy that it gives Jessie a happy

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.360
ending to her story.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.630
Elsa and Anna are Rapunzel's cousins.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.920
This is one of the most famous theories on
the list and by this point it has pretty much

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.190
been accepted as the truth.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.390
Rapunzel and Eugene are very clearly seen
arriving at Elsa's coronation, and considering

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.390
they don't live in Arendelle, they must be
very important guests.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.750
Also, Both Rapunzel and Elsa are blonde, and
both have powers that look pretty but are

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.190
somewhat unorthodox.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.830
This would also explain why the King was so
tough on Elsa about her powers as he would

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:58.680
have seen his niece imprisoned for having
powers and would want to protect her.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.040
Future Aladdin
Aladdin is one of the most beloved Disney

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.140
movies of all time, but it turns out that
fans may be mistaken as to when the action

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.410
of the film takes place.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:16.180
At the beginning of the film, the genie complains
that "10,000 years will give you such a crick

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.380
in the neck!"

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.000
He then spends the rest of the movie making
references to modern culture such as Jack

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.740
Nicholson and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.701
So unless the magic lamp has been sitting
in front of a TV in the Cave of Wonders, we

00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:30.260
have to assume Aladdin takes place 10,000
years from now.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.120
This theory also suggests that the action
takes place in a post-apocalyptic post war

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
middle east.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.130
None of this really changes the plot of the
movie, but it’s definitely fun to think

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.130
about!

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.150
The Little Mermaid's Ariel and Hercules are
cousins

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.140
This theory is very easy to believe as long
as you have a basic understanding and appreciation

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.240
of Greek Mythology.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.330
In The Little Mermaid, Ariel's father is King
Triton, who is famously the son of Poseidon,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.330
the god of the sea.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.270
This would make Poseidon Ariel's grandfather.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.430
Greek mythology also says that Poseidon is
the brother of Zeus, who is, of course, the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.700
father of Hercules both in the movie and in
the mythology.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.460
This means that King Triton and Hercules are
first cousins, making Ariel and Hercules first

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.710
cousins once removed.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.550
With all these crazy characters in the one
family, that’s definitely a reunion we want

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.870
to be invited to!

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.570
The Emperor's Dark Groove
Some Disney moves are intentionally dark but

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.789
it’s always been pretty well understood
that The Emperor's New Groove is just a fun

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.040
movie with a goofy llama and a ridiculous
villain, right?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.900
Well, It turns out The Emperor's New Groove
has a really dark side, that has slipped past

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.139
viewers for years!

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.509
While Kuzco is walking through the jungle,
he sees a fly get eat…only that fly wasn't

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.610
just a fly; it was a human who had been turned
into a fly.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.840
This is known because only animals who have
once been human are able to speak in the movie,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.650
and Kuzco can clearly hear the fly scream.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.319
Essentially, if all of this checks out, this
scene feature the brutal murder of a human

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.479
child.

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.000
Bing Bong lives!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.310
Inside Out was a major hit in 2015 and it
was no surprise when it took home the Academy

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.100
Award for best-animated film.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.789
While many of the main characters in the film
were literally emotions, the most emotional

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.460
character in the movie was Bing Bong.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.400
His ultimate sacrifice and his death brought
a truly heart breaking moment, but don’t’

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.599
be too sad because it turns out that it may
have not actually happened at all.

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:21.599
Why?

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.289
Because a great fan theory suggests that Riley’s
imaginary friend Bing Bong is actually from

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.210
Monsters, Inc., and Monsters, Inc. is set
after Inside Out.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.669
By this logic, Bing Bong must live on in one
war or another.

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.470
Gothel and The Evil Queen
There is a very popular Disney theory that

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.759
does a lot to prove that The Evil Queen from
Snow White and Gothel from Tangled are actually

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.759
the same person.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.419
Right off the bat, the physical similarities
are uncanny!

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.460
If that doesn’t convince you, consider that
Mother Gothel has a dagger in a box, which

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.349
looks a lot like the dagger in the box that
the Evil Queen gives to the Huntsman in Snow

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.349
White.

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.139
Both women are completely obsessed with beauty
and staying young, too.

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.219
Disney doesn’t really do anything by accident
in their movies, so we think it’s very likely

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.030
that all these clues prove this theory!

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.310
Tarzan's Jane is descended from Princess Belle.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.930
When you take a look at Belle from Beauty
and The Beast and Jane from Tarzan, you must

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.080
admit that they look strikingly similar, especially
with those matching yellow outfits.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.110
It seems that the connection may not be without
reason.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.800
In a scene in Tarzan, Terk is drumming on
a tea set.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.199
The pot looks suspiciously like Mrs. Potts
from Beauty and the Beast, and one of the

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.229
teacups even appears to have a small chip,
sound familiar?

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.300
Some have speculated that could mean that
it was an heirloom passed down through the

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.300
family from Belle.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.029
If this theory is true and we think about
the current adaptations of these stories,

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:35.120
that would mean that Emma Watson is playing
the great grandmother of Margot Robbie…talk

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.190
about good genetics!

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.039
So there’s our list of 10 Disney movie theories
that actually make a lot of sense.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.669
How many of these ideas do you believe?

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.069
Have you heard of any other crazy Disney movie
theories?
