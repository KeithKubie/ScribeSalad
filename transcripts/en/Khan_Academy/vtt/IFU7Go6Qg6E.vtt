00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's say that I have
a 100 meter long wire.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.230
So that is my wire
right over there.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.850
And it is 100 meters.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.270
And I'm going to make a
cut someplace on this wire.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.180
And so let's say I make
the cut right over there.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.760
With the left
section of wire-- I'm

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.760
going to obviously cut it in
two-- with the left section,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.185
I'm going to construct
an equilateral triangle.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.575
And with the right section, I'm
going to construct a square.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.250
And my question
for you and for me

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.230
is, where do we make
this cut in order

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.440
to minimize the combined
areas of this triangle

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.620
and this square?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.730
Well, let's figure out.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.240
Let's define a variable that
we're trying to minimize,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.770
or that we're trying to
optimize with respect to.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.350
So let's say that the variable
x is the number of meters

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.180
that we decide to
cut from the left.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.750
So if we did that, then
this length for the triangle

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.880
would be x meters, and
the length for the square

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.500
would be, well, if we use x
up for the left hand side,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.505
we're going to have 100 minus
x for the right hand side.

00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:17.130
And so what would the dimensions
of the triangle and the square

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.790
be?

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.220
Well, the triangle sides are
going to be x over 3, x over 3,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.090
and x over 3 as an
equilateral triangle.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.260
And the square is going
to be 100 minus x over 4

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.690
by 100 minus x over 4.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.810
Now it's easy to figure
out an expression

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.470
for the area of the
square in terms of x.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.290
But let's think about what the
area of an equilateral triangle

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.800
might be as a function of
the length of its sides.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.440
So let me do a little bit
of an aside right over here.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.575
So let's say we have an
equilateral triangle.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.350
Just like that.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.950
And its sides are
length s, s, and s.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.130
Now we know that the
area of a triangle

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.010
is 1/2 times the base
times the height.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.510
So in this case,
the height we could

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.400
consider to be altitude, if we
were to drop an altitude just

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.460
like this.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.510
This length right over
here, this is the height.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.410
And this would be
perpendicular, just like that.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.410
So our area is going to be equal
to one half times our base is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.230
s.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.320
1/2 times s times whatever our
height is, times our height.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.940
Now how can we express
h as a function of s?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.430
Well, to do that we just
have to remind ourselves

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.540
that what we've drawn over
here is a right triangle.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.480
It's the left half of
this equilateral triangle.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.840
And we know what this bottom
side of this right triangle is.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.980
This altitude splits this
side exactly into two.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.190
So this right over here
has length s over 2.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.020
So to figure out what
h is, we could just

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.830
use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.925
We would have h squared
plus s over 2 squared plus s

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:18.980
over 2 squared is going to
be equal to the hypotenuse

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.240
squared, is going to
be equal to s squared.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.090
So you would get h squared
plus s squared over 4

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.760
is equal to s squared.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.450
Subtract s squared
over 4 from both sides,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.082
and you get h squared is equal s
squared minus s squared over 4.

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:38.970
Now, to do this I could
call it s squared.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.170
I could call this
4s squared over 4,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.120
just to be able to have
a common denominator.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.330
And 4s squared minus
s squared over 4

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.435
is going to be equal
to 3s squared over 4.

00:03:51.435 --> 00:03:56.010
So we get h squared is
equal to 3s squared over 4.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.890
Now we can take the
principal root of both sides,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.790
and we get h is equal
to the square root

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.230
of 3 times s over 2.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.140
So now we can just substitute
back right over here

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.960
and we get our area.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.900
Our area is equal
to 1/2 s times h.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.020
Well h is this business.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.779
So it's s times this.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:23.590
So it's 1/2 times s times the
square root of 3s over 2, which

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.260
is going to be equal to
s times s is s squared.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.230
So this is going to
be square root of 3

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.630
s squared over 2 times 2 over 4.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.090
So this is the area of
an equilateral triangle

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.371
as the function of the
length of its sides.

00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:40.370
So what's the area of
this business going to be?

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.470
So the area of our little
equilateral triangle--

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.110
let me write a combined area.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.100
And let me do that
in a neutral color.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.720
So let me do that in white.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.370
So the combined
area, I'll write it

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.700
A sub c is going to be equal
to the area of my triangle

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.910
A sub t plus the
area of my square.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.087
Well, the area of my triangle,
we know what it's going to be.

00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:09.170
It's going to be square
root of 3 times the length

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.370
of a side squared divided by 4.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.150
So it's going to be
square root of 3.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.050
Let me do that in that
same yellow color.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.920
It's going to be-- make
sure I switch colors.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.900
It's going to be square root of
3 over 4 times a side squared,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.350
times x over 3 squared.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.356
All I did is the length
of a side is x over 3.

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:37.730
We already know
what the area is.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.380
It's the square root of
3 over 4 times the length

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.345
of a side squared.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.930
And then the area
of this square right

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.880
over here, the
area of the square

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.320
is just going to be 100
minus x over 4 squared.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.840
So our area, our combined
area-- and maybe I

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.590
can write it like
this-- our combined area

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.800
as a function of where we make
the cut is all of this business

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.090
right over here.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.400
And this is what we
need to minimize.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.670
So we need to minimize
that right over there.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.620
And I will do that
in the next video.
