00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:52.209 align:start position:0%
happen at it's much more available and
 

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:55.050 align:start position:0%
happen at it's much more available and

realities seem like realities so I think
 

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.310 align:start position:0%
realities seem like realities so I think
that's<00:08:58.060><c> why</c><00:08:58.240><c> there's</c><00:08:58.570><c> even</c><00:08:58.810><c> more</c><00:08:58.839><c> attention</c>

00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's why there's even more attention
 

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's why there's even more attention
now<00:08:59.440><c> and</c><00:08:59.649><c> they're</c><00:08:59.770><c> drawing</c><00:09:00.520><c> even</c><00:09:00.850><c> more</c><00:09:01.029><c> focus</c>

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:01.570 align:start position:0%
now and they're drawing even more focus

now and they're drawing even more focus
on<00:09:01.720><c> it</c><00:09:01.990><c> it's</c><00:09:02.290><c> because</c><00:09:02.529><c> even</c><00:09:02.680><c> though</c><00:09:02.860><c> this</c>

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.010 align:start position:0%
