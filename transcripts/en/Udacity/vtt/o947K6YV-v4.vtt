00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let us check our knowledge of parsing states with a quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here I've written 6 inputs and 6 corresponding states,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but I may be leading you astray.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What I'd like you to do is for each input state pair,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
check the box if this state is really a possible state, a valid state,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for our parser on this input, given the grammar above.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You'll need to look at the grammar and the input to check and see if the state is correct.

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Go forth!
