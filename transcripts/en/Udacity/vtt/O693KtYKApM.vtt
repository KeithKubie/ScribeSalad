00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.350
There's so many awesome careers out there

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.960
that primarily focus on genetics every day. But

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.380
there's a growing number of careers that use

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.450
genetic information more and more all the time.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.310
&gt;&gt; Now this class is just a taste of all

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.680
the genetic stories that are out there. So if you ever

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.420
hear another story, or you want a quick review of genetic

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.120
information for another genomics class, then come back and see us.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.310
&gt;&gt; Now, we want to direct your attention to two important

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.120
appendices to the course. The first appendix actually has a full-length

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.250
interview for everyone who was interviewed in the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.190
course. The second appendix actually will show you

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.860
how to extract DNA in the comfort of

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.200
your own kitchen, using nothing more than household items.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.740
&gt;&gt; Now it's time for us to wrap things up,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.350
and we really want to thank you for participating, because without

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010
you, we wouldn't be here. And we also want to thank

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.405
our production team here at Udacity. Particularly, Taylor and Grant.

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:47.900
[LAUGH].

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.240
And we'd also like to thank our collaborators at 23 and ME.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.631
&gt;&gt; Especially Esther Kim Jeff Pollard, Joanna Mountain, and Uta Franka.

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:57.960
&gt;&gt; And thank you to everyone who allowed

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.460
us to interview them about their life stories.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.020
&gt;&gt; Now, we love getting feedback from you.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.190
Good or bad. So stay in touch. Go to

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.470
the forums. E-mail us. And let us know if

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.060
this class has helped you out in some way.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.690
&gt;&gt; Now in the mean time, go

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.930
impress your friends with your newfound genetic knkowledge.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.280
&gt;&gt; And congratulations

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.110
on completing Tales from the Genome. Woo. All done. Ow. It's a wrap.
