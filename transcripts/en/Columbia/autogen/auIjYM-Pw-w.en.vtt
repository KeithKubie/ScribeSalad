00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
pictures so the photo sharing site
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.670
pictures so the photo sharing site
Flickr I don't know if you know this

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680
Flickr I don't know if you know this
 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.050
Flickr I don't know if you know this
photo sharing sites liquor but if you

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060
photo sharing sites liquor but if you
 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.490
photo sharing sites liquor but if you
don't I strongly recommend you check it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500
don't I strongly recommend you check it
 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.820
don't I strongly recommend you check it
out

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830
out
 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.690
out
it is not citizen science per se it's

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700
it is not citizen science per se it's
 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.880
it is not citizen science per se it's
citizen photography where people upload

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890
citizen photography where people upload
 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.800
citizen photography where people upload
photographs and then the social

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810
photographs and then the social
 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.770
photographs and then the social
networking aspect of Flickr brings the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
networking aspect of Flickr brings the
 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.990
networking aspect of Flickr brings the
most interesting and most beautiful

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000
most interesting and most beautiful
 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.880
most interesting and most beautiful
photographs to the top and Flickr is the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890
photographs to the top and Flickr is the
 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.640
photographs to the top and Flickr is the
kind of site that makes you realize that

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650
kind of site that makes you realize that
 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.740
kind of site that makes you realize that
citizen science as possible because so

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750
citizen science as possible because so
 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.460
citizen science as possible because so
much it's possible on this site so

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470
much it's possible on this site so
 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.500
much it's possible on this site so
anyway Flickr has millions of photos of

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510
anyway Flickr has millions of photos of
 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.970
anyway Flickr has millions of photos of
all sorts of things but in particular if

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980
all sorts of things but in particular if
 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.800
all sorts of things but in particular if
you search for astronomical objects

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
you search for astronomical objects
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.430
you search for astronomical objects
that's pretty good there's galaxies here

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
that's pretty good there's galaxies here
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.260
that's pretty good there's galaxies here
here's nebulae actually if you want to

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270
here's nebulae actually if you want to
 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.390
here's nebulae actually if you want to
just explore great photos by amateurs I

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
just explore great photos by amateurs I
 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.880
just explore great photos by amateurs I
suggest you search for nebula on Flickr

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890
suggest you search for nebula on Flickr
 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.980
suggest you search for nebula on Flickr
because there are such beautiful images

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990
because there are such beautiful images
 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.020
because there are such beautiful images
of nebulae but a strange search you can

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030
of nebulae but a strange search you can
 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.310
of nebulae but a strange search you can
do is the search that's hard to

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320
do is the search that's hard to
 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.340
do is the search that's hard to
pronounce which is astrometry and the

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350
pronounce which is astrometry and the
 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.800
pronounce which is astrometry and the
reason you should search astrometry at

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
reason you should search astrometry at
 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.750
reason you should search astrometry at
some point is because if you click on an

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760
some point is because if you click on an
 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.520
some point is because if you click on an
image so I've clicked on a particular

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530
image so I've clicked on a particular
 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.200
image so I've clicked on a particular
it's very hard to see the images here on

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210
it's very hard to see the images here on
 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.220
it's very hard to see the images here on
this screen but here's an image that has

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230
this screen but here's an image that has
 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.460
this screen but here's an image that has
been added to the group astrometry so I

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470
been added to the group astrometry so I
 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.720
been added to the group astrometry so I
don't know if you see this it says the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730
don't know if you see this it says the
 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.090
don't know if you see this it says the
photo also appears in astrometry group

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100
photo also appears in astrometry group
 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.010
photo also appears in astrometry group
it's hard to see that at the edge but if

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
it's hard to see that at the edge but if
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.530
it's hard to see that at the edge but if
you take an image on Flickr upload an

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540
you take an image on Flickr upload an
 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.060
you take an image on Flickr upload an
image on Flickr this is somebody who's

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070

Way from their backyard you can just see

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390
Way from their backyard you can just see
 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.980
Way from their backyard you can just see
it there and then they added the image

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990
it there and then they added the image
 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.080
it there and then they added the image
to the Flickr group called the Strama

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090
to the Flickr group called the Strama
 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.390

a few seconds after they added to the
 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.520
a few seconds after they added to the
group you can see a comment got added to

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530

solver your results are and then it

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100
solver your results are and then it
 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.860
solver your results are and then it
gives a whole bunch of numbers and then

of Toronto is a system that can take
arbitrary images of the sky and tell you

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810
arbitrary images of the sky and tell you
 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.750
arbitrary images of the sky and tell you
where they are on the sky and what's in

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760
where they are on the sky and what's in
 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.600
where they are on the sky and what's in
them and the value of this of course is

it makes images that are taken for fun

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830
it makes images that are taken for fun
 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.250
it makes images that are taken for fun
into images that are potentially useful

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260
into images that are potentially useful
 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.380
into images that are potentially useful
for scientific investigations and then

instance our robot this is
all done by robot of course and our

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:49.499
all done by robot of course and our
 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:51.709
all done by robot of course and our
robot also tags the image you see it's

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:51.719
robot also tags the image you see it's
 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.290

labeled that little thing is m7 which is

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300
labeled that little thing is m7 which is
 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.019
labeled that little thing is m7 which is
a globular cluster so now if you go on

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:57.029
a globular cluster so now if you go on
 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.109
a globular cluster so now if you go on
to Flickr and search for m7 you can find

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:00.119
to Flickr and search for m7 you can find
 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.509
to Flickr and search for m7 you can find
all the images that our robot believes

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:02.519
all the images that our robot believes
 

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.419
all the images that our robot believes
contains m7 and m7 is a very interesting

of themes of the stuff I like to talk
 

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:25.579
of themes of the stuff I like to talk
about is that the world wide web is

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:25.589
about is that the world wide web is

people on the web take images of the sky
 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:33.229
people on the web take images of the sky
all the time and put those images on the

all the time and put those images on the
 

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.959
all the time and put those images on the
web and they do that for a lot of

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.770
talking about citizen science most
people in this room know a lot more

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:36.780
people in this room know a lot more
 

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.900
people in this room know a lot more
about it than I do I would say the most

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:38.910
about it than I do I would say the most
 

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.000
about it than I do I would say the most
and I've decided to define it by example

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.010
and I've decided to define it by example
 

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.300
and I've decided to define it by example
so here's the most minimal I mean not

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.310
so here's the most minimal I mean not
 

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.980
so here's the most minimal I mean not
minimal it's a big project but the thing

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:45.990
minimal it's a big project but the thing
 

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.050
minimal it's a big project but the thing
that is sort of on one end of citizen

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060
that is sort of on one end of citizen

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:13.329
under the direction of a scientist
 

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.239
under the direction of a scientist
they've decided to take this on on their

00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:15.249
they've decided to take this on on their
 

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.579
they've decided to take this on on their
own and that to me is the most exciting

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:17.589
own and that to me is the most exciting
 

00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:20.100
own and that to me is the most exciting
thing because that to me makes the most

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.110
thing because that to me makes the most
 

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.100
thing because that to me makes the most
use of the unique capabilities of the

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.110
use of the unique capabilities of the
 

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.970
use of the unique capabilities of the
people involved um now I just say a bit

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:26.980
people involved um now I just say a bit
 

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.919
people involved um now I just say a bit
of philosophy and then I will hand over

00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:28.929
of philosophy and then I will hand over
 

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:31.559
of philosophy and then I will hand over
the floor to Rick one piece of

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:31.569
the floor to Rick one piece of
 

00:15:31.569 --> 00:15:34.199
the floor to Rick one piece of
philosophy is that all metadata are

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:34.209
philosophy is that all metadata are
 

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:37.260
philosophy is that all metadata are
wrong and this is an old quotation

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:37.270
wrong and this is an old quotation
 

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.120
wrong and this is an old quotation
fact it was about the Semantic Web this

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.130
fact it was about the Semantic Web this
 

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.920
fact it was about the Semantic Web this
quotation was first I never saw it if

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:43.930
quotation was first I never saw it if
 

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.810
quotation was first I never saw it if
you have Dayton librarians of course

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:45.820
you have Dayton librarians of course
 

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.690
you have Dayton librarians of course
think about this a lot you have data in

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:47.700
think about this a lot you have data in
 

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.860
think about this a lot you have data in
general the things that are written

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:49.870
general the things that are written
 

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.720
general the things that are written
about the data tend to be wrong when the

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:51.730
about the data tend to be wrong when the
 

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.550
about the data tend to be wrong when the
data were taken what it was taken with

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560
data were taken what it was taken with
 

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.260
data were taken what it was taken with
what it's a picture of how it's

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.270
what it's a picture of how it's
 

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.810
what it's a picture of how it's
calibrated there tend to be mistakes in

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:57.820
calibrated there tend to be mistakes in
 

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.490
calibrated there tend to be mistakes in
part because people who put data on the

00:15:59.490 --> 00:15:59.500
part because people who put data on the
 

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.050
part because people who put data on the
web don't really care about whether the

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.060
web don't really care about whether the
 

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.120
web don't really care about whether the
data are wet metadata are correct but as

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.130
data are wet metadata are correct but as
 

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.760

a scientist using data coming from other
 

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.860
a scientist using data coming from other
sources especially from sources you know

sources especially from sources you know
 

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.650

nothing about like random IP addresses

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:10.660
nothing about like random IP addresses
 

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.790
nothing about like random IP addresses
you have to understand the metadata when

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800
you have to understand the metadata when
 

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.320
you have to understand the metadata when
the data were taking and what properties

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.330
the data were taking and what properties
 

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.420
the data were taking and what properties
they have and one solution to that

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.430
they have and one solution to that
 

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.700
they have and one solution to that
that's kind of the galaxy zoo and a VSO

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:20.710
that's kind of the galaxy zoo and a VSO
 

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.590
that's kind of the galaxy zoo and a VSO
solutions to that is to have massive

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600
solutions to that is to have massive
 

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.050
solutions to that is to have massive
redundancy make sure every piece of data

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.060
redundancy make sure every piece of data
 

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.210
redundancy make sure every piece of data
gets looked at by many people and you

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.220
gets looked at by many people and you
 

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.860
gets looked at by many people and you
look for consistency or lack of

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:28.870
look for consistency or lack of
 

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.220
look for consistency or lack of
consistency in the results and what we

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.230
consistency in the results and what we
 

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.810
consistency in the results and what we
take the attitude we've been taking a

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:33.820
take the attitude we've been taking a
 

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.790

trauma treatment is to build robots that

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800
trauma treatment is to build robots that
 

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.130
trauma treatment is to build robots that
can vet the data directly and that's

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:38.140
can vet the data directly and that's
 

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.320
can vet the data directly and that's
where we in fact we started with this

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.330
where we in fact we started with this
 

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.200
where we in fact we started with this
theme not the citizen science theme when

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.210
theme not the citizen science theme when
 

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.790
theme not the citizen science theme when
we were doing astrometry yeah that's

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800
we were doing astrometry yeah that's
 

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.230
we were doing astrometry yeah that's
what the sense in which this is a

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240
what the sense in which this is a
 

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.820
what the sense in which this is a
spin-off another philosophical point

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:50.830
spin-off another philosophical point
 

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.140
spin-off another philosophical point
that I'm excited about which I've

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.150
that I'm excited about which I've
 

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.580
that I'm excited about which I've
already mentioned is that good data

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:53.590
already mentioned is that good data
 

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.710
already mentioned is that good data
takers might make good scientist so be

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720
takers might make good scientist so be
 

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.150
takers might make good scientist so be
good to give them a platform where they

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160
good to give them a platform where they
 

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.630
good to give them a platform where they
can initiate scientific projects as I

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:00.640
can initiate scientific projects as I
 

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.190
can initiate scientific projects as I
said many discoveries are made by

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:02.200
said many discoveries are made by
 

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.010
said many discoveries are made by
amateurs and amateurs so amateur is not

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:05.020
amateurs and amateurs so amateur is not
 

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.720
amateurs and amateurs so amateur is not
a bad word in astronomy in fact

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:06.730
a bad word in astronomy in fact
 

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.880
a bad word in astronomy in fact
professionals will sometimes describe

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:08.890
professionals will sometimes describe
 

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.820
professionals will sometimes describe
their research as amateur astronomy when

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:11.830
their research as amateur astronomy when
 

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.370
their research as amateur astronomy when
when they are doing particular kinds of

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:14.380
when they are doing particular kinds of
 

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.740
when they are doing particular kinds of
activities so for instance amateurs are

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:16.750
activities so for instance amateurs are
 

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.020
activities so for instance amateurs are
much better at taking images of the sky

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:19.030
much better at taking images of the sky
 

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.050
much better at taking images of the sky
beautiful images of the sky so a

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:22.060
beautiful images of the sky so a
 

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.940
beautiful images of the sky so a
professional astronomer who's taking

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:23.950
professional astronomer who's taking
 

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.770
professional astronomer who's taking
images that need certain properties will

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:25.780
images that need certain properties will
 

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.620
images that need certain properties will
say I'm doing amateur astronomy here and

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:28.630
say I'm doing amateur astronomy here and
 

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.270
say I'm doing amateur astronomy here and
people will recognize that to mean a

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280
people will recognize that to mean a
 

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.980
people will recognize that to mean a
particular kind of very careful

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:31.990
particular kind of very careful
 

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.440
particular kind of very careful
observing and so amateur is not a bad

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:34.450
observing and so amateur is not a bad
 

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.660
observing and so amateur is not a bad
word in astronomy at all and of course

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:36.670
word in astronomy at all and of course
 

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.620
word in astronomy at all and of course
it means lover or enthusiasts if you

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:40.630
it means lover or enthusiasts if you
 

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.180
it means lover or enthusiasts if you
think about the words root and it's

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.190
think about the words root and it's
 

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.380
think about the words root and it's
that's been kind of preserved in

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:43.390
that's been kind of preserved in
 

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.930
that's been kind of preserved in
astronomy so we would like to build a

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:45.940
astronomy so we would like to build a
 

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.060
astronomy so we would like to build a
platform for to capitalize

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.070
platform for to capitalize
 

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.400
platform for to capitalize
on this these capabilities and make it

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:52.410
on this these capabilities and make it
 

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.010
on this these capabilities and make it
possible for for hobbyists to do their

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020
possible for for hobbyists to do their
 

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.630
possible for for hobbyists to do their
to actually generate their own

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640
to actually generate their own

to actually generate their own
scientific projects and I'm kind of

00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.970
scientific projects and I'm kind of
 

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.750
scientific projects and I'm kind of
vaporware in the sense that we run on we

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760
vaporware in the sense that we run on we
 

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.790
vaporware in the sense that we run on we
run on Flickr and we calibrate actually

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:04.800
run on Flickr and we calibrate actually
 

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.500
run on Flickr and we calibrate actually
we've calibrated millions of images now

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:06.510
we've calibrated millions of images now

build this platform so I'm not going to
 

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.640

no professional image of the Pleiades
 

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.360
no professional image of the Pleiades
that I know that shows this level of

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:02.370
that I know that shows this level of
 

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.640
that I know that shows this level of
detail and if you saw this with proper

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:04.650
detail and if you saw this with proper

contrast there's this great nebulosity

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:06.810
contrast there's this great nebulosity
 

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.390
contrast there's this great nebulosity
around the stars it's being illuminated

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400
around the stars it's being illuminated
 

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.710
around the stars it's being illuminated
by the stars it's just good so I'm gonna

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720
by the stars it's just good so I'm gonna
 

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.060
by the stars it's just good so I'm gonna
end by just saying what I think the

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:14.070
end by just saying what I think the
 

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.570
end by just saying what I think the
challenges are for the my vision of

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:16.580
challenges are for the my vision of
 

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.220
challenges are for the my vision of
citizen science so one really big issue

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:19.230
citizen science so one really big issue
 

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.650
citizen science so one really big issue
is credit we are we've built this

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660
is credit we are we've built this
 

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.690
is credit we are we've built this
catalog around the Ryan Nebula it's

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700
catalog around the Ryan Nebula it's
 

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.610
catalog around the Ryan Nebula it's
involved the contributions of literally

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620
involved the contributions of literally
 

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.670
involved the contributions of literally
thousands of observers and the question

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:28.680
thousands of observers and the question
 

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.130
thousands of observers and the question
is how do we properly give them credit I

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140
is how do we properly give them credit I
 

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.250
is how do we properly give them credit I
am already on papers with more than 500

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260
am already on papers with more than 500
 

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.940
am already on papers with more than 500
authors but those are the other authors

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:37.950
authors but those are the other authors
 

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.030
authors but those are the other authors
are astronomers professional astronomers

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:41.040
are astronomers professional astronomers
 

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.100
are astronomers professional astronomers
so it's an interesting question what are

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.110
so it's an interesting question what are
 

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.050
so it's an interesting question what are
we going to do about scientific credit

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:45.060
we going to do about scientific credit
 

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.820
we going to do about scientific credit
not just because amateurs want it in

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:46.830
not just because amateurs want it in
 

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.170
not just because amateurs want it in
fact many amateurs don't want the credit

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:48.180
fact many amateurs don't want the credit
 

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.850
fact many amateurs don't want the credit
but because it's the right thing to do

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860
but because it's the right thing to do
 

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.150
but because it's the right thing to do
from the point of view of scientific

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160
from the point of view of scientific
 

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.610
from the point of view of scientific
integrity there's a repeatability issue

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620
integrity there's a repeatability issue
 

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.110
integrity there's a repeatability issue
which is very related to the credit

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120
which is very related to the credit
 

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.520
which is very related to the credit
issue which is how do you make sure that

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:58.530
issue which is how do you make sure that
 

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.680
issue which is how do you make sure that
the sources of data are available and

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:00.690
the sources of data are available and
 

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.409
the sources of data are available and
understandable and checkable um

00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419
understandable and checkable um
 

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:05.209
understandable and checkable um
data management issues are very big for

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:05.219
data management issues are very big for
 

00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:08.690
data management issues are very big for
us so in many cases the data in citizen

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700
us so in many cases the data in citizen
 

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.039
us so in many cases the data in citizen
science things are very small but not

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:10.049
science things are very small but not
 

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:12.409
science things are very small but not
for us we want all the raw images that

00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419
for us we want all the raw images that
 

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.569
for us we want all the raw images that
all the amateurs are taking and that can

00:20:14.569 --> 00:20:14.579
all the amateurs are taking and that can
 

00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:16.190
all the amateurs are taking and that can
be more than a thousand gigabytes per

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200
be more than a thousand gigabytes per
 

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.680
be more than a thousand gigabytes per
person so right now we're exploring

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:18.690
person so right now we're exploring
 

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.899
person so right now we're exploring
cloud-based solutions to this but we

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:20.909
cloud-based solutions to this but we
 

00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:22.489
cloud-based solutions to this but we
don't have a solution to this problem

00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:22.499
don't have a solution to this problem
 

00:20:22.499 --> 00:20:24.649
don't have a solution to this problem
that's one of the reasons we are not yet

00:20:24.649 --> 00:20:24.659
that's one of the reasons we are not yet
 

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:26.719
that's one of the reasons we are not yet
a platform for collaboration it's very

00:20:26.719 --> 00:20:26.729
a platform for collaboration it's very
 

00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:27.529
a platform for collaboration it's very
hard problem

00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539
hard problem
 

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:29.479
hard problem
there's participation issues which I

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:29.489
there's participation issues which I
 

00:20:29.489 --> 00:20:31.459
there's participation issues which I
think it will come up again in the

00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:31.469
think it will come up again in the
 

00:20:31.469 --> 00:20:33.079
think it will come up again in the
subsequent talks what are the best ways

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:33.089
subsequent talks what are the best ways
 

00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:35.269
subsequent talks what are the best ways
to get people to participate with the

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:35.279
to get people to participate with the
 

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:38.389
to get people to participate with the
their full capabilities and then finally

00:20:38.389 --> 00:20:38.399
their full capabilities and then finally
 

00:20:38.399 --> 00:20:40.369
their full capabilities and then finally
my interesting question is can we get

00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:40.379
my interesting question is can we get
 

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:42.619
my interesting question is can we get
citizen scientists to work together not

00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:42.629
citizen scientists to work together not
 

00:20:42.629 --> 00:20:45.919
citizen scientists to work together not
just work on a project that is low

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:45.929
just work on a project that is low
 

00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:48.019
just work on a project that is low
located somewhere else but actually work

00:20:48.019 --> 00:20:48.029
located somewhere else but actually work
 

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:51.469
located somewhere else but actually work
in self-organized groups I think if we

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:51.479
in self-organized groups I think if we
 

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:53.749
in self-organized groups I think if we
can achieve that the scientific

00:20:53.749 --> 00:20:53.759
can achieve that the scientific
 

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:55.369
can achieve that the scientific
capabilities of the world will grow

00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:55.379
capabilities of the world will grow
 

00:20:55.379 --> 00:21:01.560
capabilities of the world will grow
substantially okay thank you

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:01.570
 
 

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.720
 
all right well I'm not content with

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:03.730
all right well I'm not content with

how I think that the concept of citizen

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:13.510
how I think that the concept of citizen
 

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.700
how I think that the concept of citizen
science can actually be world-changing I

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:16.710
science can actually be world-changing I
 

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.990

there I don't but I would like to point
 

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.350
there I don't but I would like to point
out to you that we do have citizen

now here's my definition of citizen

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.050
now here's my definition of citizen
 

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.710
now here's my definition of citizen
science I'm going to go ahead and read

questions now I think I have some

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:05.410
questions now I think I have some
 

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.590
questions now I think I have some
standing to define citizen science

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600
standing to define citizen science
 

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.180
standing to define citizen science
because I'm the first person to have

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.190
because I'm the first person to have
 

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.300
because I'm the first person to have
used the term citizen science in this in

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.310
used the term citizen science in this in
 

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.180
used the term citizen science in this in
this regard in the world back in 1995 we

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.190
this regard in the world back in 1995 we
 

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.500
this regard in the world back in 1995 we
started using it at the lab of

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.510
started using it at the lab of
 

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.780
started using it at the lab of
ornithology because we had been doing

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:18.790
ornithology because we had been doing
 

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.970
ornithology because we had been doing
public data collection projects for many

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:20.980
public data collection projects for many
 

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.010
public data collection projects for many
many years and we were concerned about

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:23.020
many years and we were concerned about
 

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.410
many years and we were concerned about

00:25:58.329 --> 00:25:58.339
public and then in a lot of projects we
 

00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:00.339
public and then in a lot of projects we
want to use that information to apply it

00:26:00.339 --> 00:26:00.349
want to use that information to apply it
 

00:26:00.349 --> 00:26:02.469
want to use that information to apply it
to science-based conservation efforts

00:26:02.469 --> 00:26:02.479
to science-based conservation efforts
 

00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:05.320
to science-based conservation efforts
the reason that I got interested in

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:05.330
the reason that I got interested in
 

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.629
the reason that I got interested in
citizen science and the reason that the

00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:07.639
citizen science and the reason that the
 

00:26:07.639 --> 00:26:09.609
citizen science and the reason that the
National Science Foundation has put so

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:09.619
National Science Foundation has put so
 

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:11.889
National Science Foundation has put so
much money into my program is because

00:26:11.889 --> 00:26:11.899
much money into my program is because
 

00:26:11.899 --> 00:26:13.570
much money into my program is because
we've always had the idea that if people

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:13.580
we've always had the idea that if people
 

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.789
we've always had the idea that if people
are participating in the process of

00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799
are participating in the process of
 

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:17.320
are participating in the process of
science that they may become more

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:17.330
science that they may become more
 

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.029
science that they may become more
scientifically literate and by that I

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039
scientifically literate and by that I
 

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:21.489
scientifically literate and by that I
don't mean just all birds have feathers

00:26:21.489 --> 00:26:21.499
don't mean just all birds have feathers
 

00:26:21.499 --> 00:26:24.369
don't mean just all birds have feathers
but there is a process by which data are

00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:24.379
but there is a process by which data are
 

00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:27.549
but there is a process by which data are
collected and analyzed and so when we

00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:27.559
collected and analyzed and so when we
 

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:30.249
collected and analyzed and so when we
say the scientific consensus is thus

00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:30.259
say the scientific consensus is thus
 

00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:32.049
say the scientific consensus is thus
that there's a process by which that

00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:32.059
that there's a process by which that
 

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:36.159
that there's a process by which that
knowledge was produced so my idea was if

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:36.169
knowledge was produced so my idea was if
 

00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:37.570
knowledge was produced so my idea was if
we can get people involved in this

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:37.580
we can get people involved in this
 

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.879
we can get people involved in this
project in these projects then they may

00:26:39.879 --> 00:26:39.889
project in these projects then they may
 

00:26:39.889 --> 00:26:43.409
project in these projects then they may
become much more literate scientifically

00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:43.419
become much more literate scientifically
 

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:46.029
become much more literate scientifically

00:29:36.619 --> 00:29:38.529
out that the kinds of programs that we
do and and others that have been modeled

00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:38.539
do and and others that have been modeled
 

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:40.419
do and and others that have been modeled
on ours around the world are really

00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:40.429
on ours around the world are really
 

00:29:40.429 --> 00:29:42.399
on ours around the world are really
based on a very complicated program

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:42.409
based on a very complicated program
 

00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:44.889
based on a very complicated program
model you don't just say here's an idea

00:29:44.889 --> 00:29:44.899
model you don't just say here's an idea
 

00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:46.330
model you don't just say here's an idea
and you throw it out there and get

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:46.340
and you throw it out there and get
 

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.789
and you throw it out there and get
people to collect data but you have to

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799
people to collect data but you have to
 

00:29:48.799 --> 00:29:50.169
people to collect data but you have to
actually go through a process of

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:50.179
actually go through a process of
 

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:52.049
actually go through a process of
choosing a scientific question

00:29:52.049 --> 00:29:52.059
choosing a scientific question
 

00:29:52.059 --> 00:29:54.190
choosing a scientific question
developing a team and that really should

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200
developing a team and that really should
 

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.140
developing a team and that really should
also have technologists

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.150
also have technologists
 

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.700
also have technologists
and data analysts in it developing and

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:00.710
and data analysts in it developing and
 

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.890
and data analysts in it developing and
testing the protocols with people who

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:02.900
testing the protocols with people who
 

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.090
testing the protocols with people who
are going to participate to make sure

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.100
are going to participate to make sure
 

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.529
are going to participate to make sure
that they understand and that they're

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:05.539
that they understand and that they're
 

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:07.510
that they understand and that they're
gathering accurate data you've got to

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520
gathering accurate data you've got to
 

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.220
gathering accurate data you've got to
recruit the participants which can be

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.230
recruit the participants which can be
 

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.720
recruit the participants which can be
pretty hard how do you get people to

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:10.730
pretty hard how do you get people to
 

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.970
pretty hard how do you get people to
watch earthworms it's easy to get people

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:12.980
watch earthworms it's easy to get people
 

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.549
watch earthworms it's easy to get people
to watch birds but there is a great

00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559
to watch birds but there is a great
 

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:17.169
to watch birds but there is a great
earthworm project a Great Lakes

00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:17.179
earthworm project a Great Lakes
 

00:30:17.179 --> 00:30:18.909
earthworm project a Great Lakes
earthworm project with a lot of people

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919
earthworm project with a lot of people
 

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:20.620
earthworm project with a lot of people
involved you have to train the

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:20.630
involved you have to train the
 

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.360
involved you have to train the
participants to be able to follow the

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:22.370
participants to be able to follow the
 

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.180
participants to be able to follow the
protocols you have to accept the data

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.190
protocols you have to accept the data
 

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.130
protocols you have to accept the data
into a database and ensure data quality

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.140
into a database and ensure data quality
 

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.279
into a database and ensure data quality
with a whole data management policy you

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:30.289
with a whole data management policy you
 

00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:32.230
with a whole data management policy you
have to make those data available to the

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240
have to make those data available to the
 

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.060
have to make those data available to the
public and the professional scientists

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.070
public and the professional scientists
 

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.950
public and the professional scientists
you have to analyze and interpret the

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960
you have to analyze and interpret the
 

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.419
you have to analyze and interpret the
data so that they're not just sitting

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:37.429
data so that they're not just sitting
 

00:30:37.429 --> 00:30:40.120
data so that they're not just sitting
around uselessly you have to publish and

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.130
around uselessly you have to publish and
 

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.100
around uselessly you have to publish and
apply the results or else really you

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:42.110
apply the results or else really you
 

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.210
apply the results or else really you
haven't gone through the whole process

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:43.220
haven't gone through the whole process
 

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.830
haven't gone through the whole process
of science and then you need to measure

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840
of science and then you need to measure
 

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.769
of science and then you need to measure
the effects you decide is this really

00:30:47.769 --> 00:30:47.779
the effects you decide is this really
 

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.450
the effects you decide is this really
effective and should we continue to do

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:49.460
effective and should we continue to do
 

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.090
effective and should we continue to do
it so I again I don't have time to go

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:52.100
it so I again I don't have time to go
 

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.830
it so I again I don't have time to go
through this whole project model or

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840
through this whole project model or
 

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.289
through this whole project model or
program model in great detail it's

00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:56.299
program model in great detail it's
 

00:30:56.299 --> 00:30:58.899
program model in great detail it's
published in bioscience magazine that

published in bioscience magazine that
can give you the the citation for

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:00.860
can give you the the citation for
 

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.190
can give you the the citation for
anybody that's interested but I wanted

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200
anybody that's interested but I wanted
 

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.990
anybody that's interested but I wanted
to talk just for a few minutes here

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000
to talk just for a few minutes here
 

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
to talk just for a few minutes here
about eBird which is our biggest project

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.010
about eBird which is our biggest project
 

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.750
about eBird which is our biggest project
I can't do the math there I'm talking

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760
I can't do the math there I'm talking
 

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.730
I can't do the math there I'm talking
about eBird and show you about some of

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:12.740
about eBird and show you about some of
 

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.029
about eBird and show you about some of
these issues so eBird started in 2003 I

00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039
these issues so eBird started in 2003 I
 

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:17.649
these issues so eBird started in 2003 I
have a feeling that this slides going to

00:31:17.649 --> 00:31:17.659
have a feeling that this slides going to
 

00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:20.320
have a feeling that this slides going to
be hard to see but it shows the rapid

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:20.330
be hard to see but it shows the rapid
 

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.860
be hard to see but it shows the rapid
growth since 2003 in participating and

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:23.870
growth since 2003 in participating and
 

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.990
growth since 2003 in participating and
collecting information about birds not

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000
collecting information about birds not
 

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.700
collecting information about birds not
only from North America but now all over

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:27.710
only from North America but now all over
 

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.220
only from North America but now all over
the world so that we're getting about 2

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:30.230
the world so that we're getting about 2
 

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.909
the world so that we're getting about 2
million about 2 million observations per

00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919
million about 2 million observations per
 

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:36.190
million about 2 million observations per
month into our database and notice that

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200
month into our database and notice that
 

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.220
month into our database and notice that
line where it says eBird 2.0 launch and

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:39.230
line where it says eBird 2.0 launch and
 

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.710
line where it says eBird 2.0 launch and
how the curve begins to go up quickly

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720
how the curve begins to go up quickly
 

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.360
how the curve begins to go up quickly
after that I'm not going to have time to

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:43.370
after that I'm not going to have time to
 

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.919
after that I'm not going to have time to
discuss that now but it might come up

00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:44.929
discuss that now but it might come up
 

00:31:44.929 --> 00:31:47.250
discuss that now but it might come up
during questions and answers and from

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:47.260
during questions and answers and from
 

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.269
during questions and answers and from
from this we're able to to really

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279
from this we're able to to really
 

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:54.460
from this we're able to to really
generate some pretty sophisticated maps

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:54.470
generate some pretty sophisticated maps
 

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.310
generate some pretty sophisticated maps
here now I'm showing for example how the

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320
here now I'm showing for example how the
 

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.080
here now I'm showing for example how the
annual pattern of say the willow

00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.090
annual pattern of say the willow
 

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.539
annual pattern of say the willow
flycatcher is changing over time and

00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:01.549
flycatcher is changing over time and
 

00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:03.190
flycatcher is changing over time and
this is based on millions and millions

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200
this is based on millions and millions
 

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.049
this is based on millions and millions
and millions of records you know you can

00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:05.059
and millions of records you know you can
 

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:06.490
and millions of records you know you can
see I'll let that run again you can see

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:06.500
see I'll let that run again you can see
 

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.899
see I'll let that run again you can see
that they first show up in migration

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:07.909
that they first show up in migration
 

00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:09.430
that they first show up in migration
actually in the southwest

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440
actually in the southwest
 

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.130

over California Arizona area almost

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:12.140
over California Arizona area almost
 

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.050
over California Arizona area almost
before they start to come back in the

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:14.060
before they start to come back in the
 

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.700

East that wasn't actually even known

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:15.710
East that wasn't actually even known
 

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.100
East that wasn't actually even known
before Ebert and then the real white

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:18.110
before Ebert and then the real white
 

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.720
before Ebert and then the real white
hotspots show you where their most

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:19.730
hotspots show you where their most
 

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.580
hotspots show you where their most
common and went throughout the course of

common and went throughout the course of
the year we can do this for most species

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:22.940
the year we can do this for most species
 

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.620
the year we can do this for most species
now and the way that we're able to be

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:26.630
now and the way that we're able to be
 

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.500
now and the way that we're able to be
certain about the quality of these data

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:28.510
certain about the quality of these data
 

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.000
certain about the quality of these data
have to do once again with developing

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.010
have to do once again with developing
 

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.950
have to do once again with developing
and testing the protocols so that as we

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960
and testing the protocols so that as we
 

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.930
and testing the protocols so that as we
develop them we make sure that the

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:34.940
develop them we make sure that the
 

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.280
develop them we make sure that the
people who are going to collect the data

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:36.290
people who are going to collect the data
 

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.200
people who are going to collect the data
understand them and if they don't we

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.210
understand them and if they don't we
 

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.970
understand them and if they don't we
change them and get them to the point

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:39.980
change them and get them to the point
 

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.560
change them and get them to the point
where they do know how to do them in

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:41.570
where they do know how to do them in
 

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.320

when you go to submit data for eBird you

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:51.830
when you go to submit data for eBird you
 

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.470
when you go to submit data for eBird you
submit a location and you get a

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.920
able to show the world that this is
important and deserves further funding I

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:19.930
important and deserves further funding I
 

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.060
important and deserves further funding I
want to point out that the work that

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:22.070
want to point out that the work that
 

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.070
want to point out that the work that
we're doing at the lab of ornithology is

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.080
we're doing at the lab of ornithology is
 

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.010
we're doing at the lab of ornithology is
not being done in isolation and as a

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:27.020
not being done in isolation and as a
 

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.450
not being done in isolation and as a
matter of fact there are a lot of people

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:28.460
matter of fact there are a lot of people
 

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.610
matter of fact there are a lot of people
really trying at this point to codify

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:30.620
really trying at this point to codify
 

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.320
really trying at this point to codify
the field of citizen science and this

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:32.330
the field of citizen science and this
 

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.020
the field of citizen science and this
began with a conference that I and my

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.030
began with a conference that I and my
 

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.190
began with a conference that I and my
colleagues organized that

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200
colleagues organized that
 

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.740
colleagues organized that
the Lab of Ornithology in 2007 funded by

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:38.750
the Lab of Ornithology in 2007 funded by
 

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.650
the Lab of Ornithology in 2007 funded by
NSF was the citizen science toolkit

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:41.660
NSF was the citizen science toolkit
 

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.300
NSF was the citizen science toolkit
conference and it resulted in a

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:43.310
conference and it resulted in a
 

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.099
conference and it resulted in a
proceedings which is actually a whole

00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:45.109
proceedings which is actually a whole
 

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:48.280
proceedings which is actually a whole
lot of fun to read it's very very well

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:48.290
lot of fun to read it's very very well
 

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.710
lot of fun to read it's very very well

the citizen science toolkit which has
 

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.589
the citizen science toolkit which has
all those steps that I showed before

00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599
all those steps that I showed before
 

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.990

you be able to understand how to do all
 

00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:09.490
you be able to understand how to do all
of those things when you're developing a

of those things when you're developing a
 

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.880
of those things when you're developing a
project including evaluation we also

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:12.890
project including evaluation we also
 

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.650
project including evaluation we also
have a lot of other resources on this

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:14.660
have a lot of other resources on this
 

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.900
have a lot of other resources on this
site there's a whole tab on here called

climate change which gets into all the

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:19.910
climate change which gets into all the
 

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.880
climate change which gets into all the
work that again my colleagues and I are

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:21.890
work that again my colleagues and I are
 

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.819
work that again my colleagues and I are
doing in using citizen science projects

00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:24.829
doing in using citizen science projects
 

00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:27.040
doing in using citizen science projects
at science centers as ways of helping

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.050
at science centers as ways of helping
 

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.050
at science centers as ways of helping
people to understand the local impacts

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:29.060
people to understand the local impacts
 

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.960
people to understand the local impacts
of climate change for example we know

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:31.970
of climate change for example we know
 

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.150
of climate change for example we know
through citizen science that birds are

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160
through citizen science that birds are
 

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.579
through citizen science that birds are
nesting as much as 20 days earlier than

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:36.589
nesting as much as 20 days earlier than
 

00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:38.920
nesting as much as 20 days earlier than
they did as few as 40 years ago which

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:38.930
they did as few as 40 years ago which
 

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.710
they did as few as 40 years ago which
has a huge impact on a species which has

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720
has a huge impact on a species which has
 

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.260
has a huge impact on a species which has
evolved over time to lay its eggs and

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:44.270
evolved over time to lay its eggs and
 

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.210
evolved over time to lay its eggs and
raise its young at a time that Mac when

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:46.220
raise its young at a time that Mac when
 

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.460
raise its young at a time that Mac when
the most insects are available and if

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:48.470
the most insects are available and if
 

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.920
the most insects are available and if
over because of climate change those get

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:50.930
over because of climate change those get
 

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:51.880
over because of climate change those get
out of sync it's going to have

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:51.890
out of sync it's going to have
 

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.740
out of sync it's going to have
devastating impacts on those on those

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:53.750
devastating impacts on those on those
 

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.930
devastating impacts on those on those
creatures so we have a whole section on

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:55.940
creatures so we have a whole section on
 

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.240
creatures so we have a whole section on
using citizen science to show to discuss

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:58.250
using citizen science to show to discuss
 

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.430
using citizen science to show to discuss
and teach about climate change which I

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440
and teach about climate change which I
 

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.130
and teach about climate change which I
wish I had time to tell you and as I

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:03.140
wish I had time to tell you and as I
 

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.720
wish I had time to tell you and as I
said it's got the steps of the toolkit

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:04.730
said it's got the steps of the toolkit
 

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.530
said it's got the steps of the toolkit
now coming back to this question about

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:07.540
now coming back to this question about
 

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.300
now coming back to this question about
citizen data collectors versus citizen

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:10.310
citizen data collectors versus citizen
 

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.010
citizen data collectors versus citizen
scientists you can very quickly say how

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:12.020
scientists you can very quickly say how
 

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.870
scientists you can very quickly say how
are people really going to become

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880
are people really going to become
 

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.520
are people really going to become
scientists if all they're doing are

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:15.530
scientists if all they're doing are
 

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.829
scientists if all they're doing are
collecting data just like a bunch of

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839
collecting data just like a bunch of
 

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:20.380
collecting data just like a bunch of
graduate students well a couple years

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:20.390
graduate students well a couple years
 

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.359
graduate students well a couple years
ago the National Science Foundation

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:22.369
ago the National Science Foundation
 

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:24.339
ago the National Science Foundation
asked me to convene a group to actually

00:38:24.339 --> 00:38:24.349
asked me to convene a group to actually
 

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:26.380
asked me to convene a group to actually
do a white paper a position paper on

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.390
do a white paper a position paper on
 

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.480
do a white paper a position paper on
citizen science and we ended up spending

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:28.490
citizen science and we ended up spending
 

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.220
citizen science and we ended up spending
about a year and a half doing this paper

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:30.230
about a year and a half doing this paper
 

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.680
about a year and a half doing this paper
and we actually called it not citizen

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:32.690
and we actually called it not citizen
 

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.420
and we actually called it not citizen
science but public participation and

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:34.430
science but public participation and
 

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.160
science but public participation and
scientific research which is a bigger

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:36.170
scientific research which is a bigger
 

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.710
scientific research which is a bigger
umbrella term that includes citizen

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720
umbrella term that includes citizen
 

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.540
umbrella term that includes citizen
science but some other things what do I

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:40.550
science but some other things what do I
 

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.760
science but some other things what do I
mean by other things when we stop and

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:42.770
mean by other things when we stop and
 

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.530
mean by other things when we stop and
think about the steps in the scientific

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:44.540
think about the steps in the scientific
 

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.370
think about the steps in the scientific
process there as all of you who are

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:48.380
process there as all of you who are
 

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.599
process there as all of you who are
scientists know

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:49.609
scientists know
 

00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:50.890
scientists know
a whole bunch of different things that

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:50.900
a whole bunch of different things that
 

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.720
a whole bunch of different things that
you have to do from beginning to end to

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:52.730
you have to do from beginning to end to
 

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.279
you have to do from beginning to end to
really get something understood and

00:38:54.279 --> 00:38:54.289
really get something understood and
 

00:38:54.289 --> 00:38:57.009
really get something understood and
published and in typical scientific

00:38:57.009 --> 00:38:57.019
published and in typical scientific
 

00:38:57.019 --> 00:38:58.930
published and in typical scientific
investigation if scientists or

00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:58.940
investigation if scientists or
 

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.150
investigation if scientists or
technicians that do all the work the

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160
technicians that do all the work the
 

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.950
technicians that do all the work the
question then is with public

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960
question then is with public
 

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.930
question then is with public
participation what do you want those

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:04.940
participation what do you want those
 

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.210
participation what do you want those
public participants to do and we

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:07.220
public participants to do and we
 

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.210
public participants to do and we
realized when we started doing a

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:09.220
realized when we started doing a
 

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.620
realized when we started doing a
meta-analysis I can use the word meta

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:11.630
meta-analysis I can use the word meta
 

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.769
meta-analysis I can use the word meta
when we started doing a meta analysis of

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:14.779
when we started doing a meta analysis of
 

00:39:14.779 --> 00:39:16.690
when we started doing a meta analysis of
a whole bunch of different projects that

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:16.700
a whole bunch of different projects that
 

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.910
a whole bunch of different projects that
are out there based on a evaluation

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920
are out there based on a evaluation
 

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.489
are out there based on a evaluation
rubric that we created we discovered

00:39:21.489 --> 00:39:21.499
rubric that we created we discovered
 

00:39:21.499 --> 00:39:23.440
rubric that we created we discovered
that they sorted into three basic models

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:23.450
that they sorted into three basic models
 

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.450
that they sorted into three basic models
in citizen science basically as a

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:25.460
in citizen science basically as a
 

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.910
in citizen science basically as a
contributory model where participants

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920
contributory model where participants
 

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.739
contributory model where participants
are collecting and maybe analyzing

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:29.749
are collecting and maybe analyzing
 

00:39:29.749 --> 00:39:31.450
are collecting and maybe analyzing
samples but there are a lot of other

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:31.460
samples but there are a lot of other
 

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.920
samples but there are a lot of other
projects that we labeled as

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:32.930
projects that we labeled as
 

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.900
projects that we labeled as
collaborative projects in which the

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:34.910
collaborative projects in which the
 

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.460
collaborative projects in which the
participants are working with scientists

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:36.470
participants are working with scientists
 

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.229
participants are working with scientists
to do a whole lot more they may be

so coral watch involves the use of these

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760
so coral watch involves the use of these
 

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.060
so coral watch involves the use of these
cold health charts and it usually

who go out they use these charts while

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:28.060
who go out they use these charts while
 

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.850
who go out they use these charts while
they're snorkeling or scuba diving and

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:29.860
they're snorkeling or scuba diving and
 

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.610
they're snorkeling or scuba diving and
they follow reefs transects along the

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:32.620
they follow reefs transects along the
 

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.650
they follow reefs transects along the
reef and they collect information about

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:34.660
reef and they collect information about
 

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.080
reef and they collect information about
the color of the coral by comparing it

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:37.090
the color of the coral by comparing it
 

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.990
the color of the coral by comparing it
to this chart so for example staghorn

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000
to this chart so for example staghorn
 

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.260
to this chart so for example staghorn
corals are compared against II 1 to e 6

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:43.270
corals are compared against II 1 to e 6
 

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:46.020
corals are compared against II 1 to e 6
and if the colors a 1 it's highly

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.030
and if the colors a 1 it's highly
 

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.230

bleached if it's a 6 it's very healthy
they collect this data so there's a

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.010
they collect this data so there's a
 

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:53.130
they collect this data so there's a
actually reef education package and

correct the errors and to identify where
 

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.250
correct the errors and to identify where
data was missing so we developed data

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:26.260
data was missing so we developed data
 

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:28.260

web-based we use open layers so you can

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:50.620
web-based we use open layers so you can
 

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.680
web-based we use open layers so you can
use either Bing Maps Google Earth or

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:52.690
use either Bing Maps Google Earth or
 

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:55.620
use either Bing Maps Google Earth or

both ok so analyzing the Kuril watch

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:10.420
both ok so analyzing the Kuril watch
 

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.270

data and it was very interesting and

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280
data and it was very interesting and
 

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:17.460
data and it was very interesting and
what we found was one of the most common

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:17.470
what we found was one of the most common
 

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.800
what we found was one of the most common
problems was missing doubt data and the

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:19.810
problems was missing doubt data and the
 

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.290
problems was missing doubt data and the
missing data was generally the latitude

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:22.300
missing data was generally the latitude
 

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:26.580
missing data was generally the latitude
and longitude of the location so without

00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:26.590
and longitude of the location so without
 

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.770

that you'd think the data was fairly

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:28.780
that you'd think the data was fairly
 

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.960
that you'd think the data was fairly
useless but often they'll have the reef

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:30.970
useless but often they'll have the reef
 

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.560
useless but often they'll have the reef
name there and so we have a course

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:33.570
name there and so we have a course
 

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.990
name there and so we have a course

location based on the reef name we enter
 

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.330
location based on the reef name we enter
the reef name into a service and a web

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:39.340
the reef name into a service and a web
 

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.190
the reef name into a service and a web
service called bio geomancer and that

age whether they're in grades 3 5 7 or 9

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:45.560
age whether they're in grades 3 5 7 or 9
 

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.880
age whether they're in grades 3 5 7 or 9
the quality improves as they get older

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:47.890
the quality improves as they get older
 

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:50.320
the quality improves as they get older
the amount of training the contributor

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:50.330
the amount of training the contributor
 

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.180
the amount of training the contributor
has undertaken and whether that training

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:52.190
has undertaken and whether that training
 

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.040
has undertaken and whether that training
has been online training or personal

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:54.050
has been online training or personal
 

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.980
has been online training or personal
one-to-one training their experience

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:56.990
one-to-one training their experience
 

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:00.490
one-to-one training their experience
so generally observers improve over time

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:00.500
so generally observers improve over time
 

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.430
so generally observers improve over time
by approximately 5% improvement a year

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440
by approximately 5% improvement a year
 

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.490
by approximately 5% improvement a year
over past the first year so the

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:06.500
over past the first year so the
 

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.170
over past the first year so the
frequency of contributions in the

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:08.180
frequency of contributions in the
 

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.360
frequency of contributions in the
duration of contributions are important

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:10.370
duration of contributions are important
 

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.720
duration of contributions are important
and then also the quality of their past

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:13.730
and then also the quality of their past
 

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:17.020
and then also the quality of their past
data can we compare their previous data

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:17.030
data can we compare their previous data
 

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:20.230
data can we compare their previous data
with some ground truth data to detect

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240
with some ground truth data to detect
 

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.360
with some ground truth data to detect
the number of errors incorporate that in

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:22.370
the number of errors incorporate that in
 

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.610
the number of errors incorporate that in
their trust ranking so what we've been

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:24.620
their trust ranking so what we've been
 

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.800
their trust ranking so what we've been
looking at is how to calculate an

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:26.810
looking at is how to calculate an
 

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:29.140
looking at is how to calculate an
accumulative trust value for particular

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:29.150
accumulative trust value for particular
 

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:32.350
accumulative trust value for particular
user based on their expertise aged range

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:32.360
user based on their expertise aged range
 

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.710
user based on their expertise aged range
training frequency and duration quality

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720
training frequency and duration quality
 

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.110
training frequency and duration quality
of past data and a trust ranking

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:38.120
of past data and a trust ranking
 

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.980
of past data and a trust ranking
assigned from other members if

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:39.990
assigned from other members if
 

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:42.609
assigned from other members if
it's available and how can you then in

01:00:42.609 --> 01:00:42.619
it's available and how can you then in
 

01:00:42.619 --> 01:00:45.890
it's available and how can you then in
calculate an aggregate trust and we

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900
calculate an aggregate trust and we
 

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.900
calculate an aggregate trust and we
assign weightings to all those different

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:47.910
assign weightings to all those different
 

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.790
assign weightings to all those different
attributes and come up with the value

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:49.800
attributes and come up with the value
 

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.250
attributes and come up with the value
between zero and five stars so this

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260
between zero and five stars so this
 

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.440
between zero and five stars so this
person for example has three stars out

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:54.450
person for example has three stars out
 

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:59.450
person for example has three stars out
of five so we have a person ranking tool

01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460
of five so we have a person ranking tool
 

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.910
of five so we have a person ranking tool
here I've logged in I'm looking at a

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920
here I've logged in I'm looking at a
 

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.580
here I've logged in I'm looking at a
particular person Bakar and I can see my

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:04.590
particular person Bakar and I can see my
 

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.680
particular person Bakar and I can see my
trust ranking I've given him four stars

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:06.690
trust ranking I've given him four stars
 

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:08.930
trust ranking I've given him four stars
but the community has given him three

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940
but the community has given him three
 

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:11.150
but the community has given him three
stars so the Community Trust is less

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160
stars so the Community Trust is less
 

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.840
stars so the Community Trust is less
than my value individuals can see the

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:14.850
than my value individuals can see the
 

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.570
than my value individuals can see the
rankings that they give others and they

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:17.580
rankings that they give others and they
 

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.940
rankings that they give others and they
can see aggregate rankings that they've

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:19.950
can see aggregate rankings that they've
 

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:22.160
can see aggregate rankings that they've
been given they can't see the individual

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:22.170
been given they can't see the individual
 

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.720
been given they can't see the individual
rankings and other people have given

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:23.730
rankings and other people have given
 

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:26.950
rankings and other people have given
them because we don't want to deter

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960
them because we don't want to deter
 

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.270
them because we don't want to deter
contributors from coming back we don't

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280
contributors from coming back we don't
 

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.650
contributors from coming back we don't
want them to turn into malicious

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660
want them to turn into malicious
 

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.960
want them to turn into malicious
contributors we want to encourage them

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:32.970
contributors we want to encourage them
 

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.240
contributors we want to encourage them
so they can see their aggregate ranking

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.250
so they can see their aggregate ranking
 

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.300
so they can see their aggregate ranking
but not the individuals and then you can

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:38.310
but not the individuals and then you can
 

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:39.770
but not the individuals and then you can
also have a look at the social trust

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780
also have a look at the social trust
 

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.990
also have a look at the social trust
graph so how it's calculated so here you

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000
graph so how it's calculated so here you
 

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.609
graph so how it's calculated so here you
can see the relationship between Charlie

01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619
can see the relationship between Charlie
 

01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:46.040
can see the relationship between Charlie
and bekar Charlie bakar the

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.050
and bekar Charlie bakar the
 

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.890
and bekar Charlie bakar the
administrator and Charlie Burke are and

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900
administrator and Charlie Burke are and
 

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.180
administrator and Charlie Burke are and
then the other people that the

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:50.190
then the other people that the
 

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.430
then the other people that the
administrator knows so this shows the

01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440
administrator knows so this shows the
 

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.080
administrator knows so this shows the
network that's being used to calculate

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:54.090
network that's being used to calculate
 

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:57.410
network that's being used to calculate
the inferred trust and finally we've

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420
the inferred trust and finally we've
 

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.080
the inferred trust and finally we've
been developing these Google Earth and

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.090
been developing these Google Earth and
 

01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:02.359
been developing these Google Earth and
time line interfaces Bing Maps and time

01:02:02.359 --> 01:02:02.369
time line interfaces Bing Maps and time
 

01:02:02.369 --> 01:02:05.180
time line interfaces Bing Maps and time
line interfaces for searching the data

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:05.190
line interfaces for searching the data
 

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:07.340
line interfaces for searching the data
so for example someone's entered the

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:07.350
so for example someone's entered the
 

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:09.460
so for example someone's entered the
query show me all the corals watch

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:09.470
query show me all the corals watch
 

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:12.609
query show me all the corals watch
observations for masthead reef between

01:02:12.609 --> 01:02:12.619
observations for masthead reef between
 

01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:16.280
observations for masthead reef between
2007 and 2009 but only those with the

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:16.290
2007 and 2009 but only those with the
 

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.410
2007 and 2009 but only those with the
ranking of two or more stars I've

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420
ranking of two or more stars I've
 

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.630
ranking of two or more stars I've
actually shown you here the rankings of

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640
actually shown you here the rankings of
 

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.540
actually shown you here the rankings of
all of them from one star to five stars

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:23.550
all of them from one star to five stars
 

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.650
all of them from one star to five stars
so pink is one star purple is five stars

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:26.660
so pink is one star purple is five stars
 

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:30.320
so pink is one star purple is five stars
but so it's this filtering of data and

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:30.330
but so it's this filtering of data and
 

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.840
but so it's this filtering of data and
presentation of data based on quality

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:32.850
presentation of data based on quality
 

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.460
presentation of data based on quality
which is the outcome that we're looking

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:34.470
which is the outcome that we're looking
 

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:39.050
which is the outcome that we're looking
for so where are we now we're working on

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:39.060
for so where are we now we're working on
 

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:42.500
for so where are we now we're working on
a valuation of the algorithms and the

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:42.510
a valuation of the algorithms and the
 

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:43.970
a valuation of the algorithms and the
waiting's and the methods were

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980
waiting's and the methods were
 

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.180
waiting's and the methods were
accumulating the trust values how are we

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:47.190
accumulating the trust values how are we
 

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:49.040
accumulating the trust values how are we
going to actually evaluate this so we

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.050
going to actually evaluate this so we
 

01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:51.740
going to actually evaluate this so we
want to be able to have a look at the

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:51.750
want to be able to have a look at the
 

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:52.730
want to be able to have a look at the
precision of

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740
precision of
 

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.760
precision of
data sets before and after we apply this

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:55.770
data sets before and after we apply this
 

01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.430
data sets before and after we apply this
filtering of the data based on trust so

01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440
filtering of the data based on trust so
 

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.720
filtering of the data based on trust so
we need to have the ground truth data

01:02:59.720 --> 01:02:59.730
we need to have the ground truth data
 

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.490
we need to have the ground truth data
and this is where we're looking at what

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:01.500
and this is where we're looking at what
 

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.320
and this is where we're looking at what
data we've got at the moment and how we

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:03.330
data we've got at the moment and how we
 

01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:05.359
data we've got at the moment and how we
can overlay the two and compare the two

01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:05.369
can overlay the two and compare the two
 

01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:08.030
can overlay the two and compare the two
we also need to evaluate the performance

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040
we also need to evaluate the performance
 

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.680
we also need to evaluate the performance
and efficiency of the tools there's

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:09.690
and efficiency of the tools there's
 

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:11.600
and efficiency of the tools there's
scalability and adaptability there

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:11.610
scalability and adaptability there
 

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:14.720
scalability and adaptability there
usability and we need to undertake user

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:14.730
usability and we need to undertake user
 

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:17.900
usability and we need to undertake user
feedback surveys with the stakeholders

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:17.910
feedback surveys with the stakeholders
 

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:19.550

involved in the projects as well as the
 

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.850
involved in the projects as well as the
contributors so this evaluation is what

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:22.860
contributors so this evaluation is what
 

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.190
contributors so this evaluation is what
some of what we're doing at the moment

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200
some of what we're doing at the moment
 

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.320
some of what we're doing at the moment
we also want to in particular evaluate

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:27.330
we also want to in particular evaluate
 

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.120
we also want to in particular evaluate
these tools in the context of other

choral watch which is what we've been

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:34.410
choral watch which is what we've been
 

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.990
choral watch which is what we've been
working on at the moment so we've been

01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000
working on at the moment so we've been
 

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
working on at the moment so we've been
talking talking to Birds Australia and

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.010
talking talking to Birds Australia and
 

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:41.120
talking talking to Birds Australia and
climate watch Australia as well and the

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.130
climate watch Australia as well and the
 

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.609
climate watch Australia as well and the
nature mapping foundation in Seattle at

01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619
nature mapping foundation in Seattle at
 

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:44.750

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.450
the University of Washington
so future work issues which I think are

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460
so future work issues which I think are
 

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.210
so future work issues which I think are
very interesting you can't assume that

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220
very interesting you can't assume that
 

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.980
very interesting you can't assume that
those trust metrics are static they're

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:51.990
those trust metrics are static they're
 

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:53.930
those trust metrics are static they're
going to change over time so you don't

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940
going to change over time so you don't
 

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.180
going to change over time so you don't
have to recalculate them either because

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:56.190
have to recalculate them either because
 

01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:59.270
have to recalculate them either because
the individual it's not necessarily

01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280
the individual it's not necessarily
 

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.560
the individual it's not necessarily
going to get better all the time

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:00.570
going to get better all the time
 

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.349
going to get better all the time
after duration so individuals may

01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359
after duration so individuals may
 

01:04:03.359 --> 01:04:05.480
after duration so individuals may
actually get worse over time I know

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:05.490
actually get worse over time I know
 

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.580
actually get worse over time I know
myself as I get older you know the

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:07.590
myself as I get older you know the
 

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:09.410
myself as I get older you know the
quality of my contributions may worsen

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420
quality of my contributions may worsen
 

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.620
quality of my contributions may worsen
so periodic recalculation will be

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:12.630
so periodic recalculation will be
 

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.650
so periodic recalculation will be
important and how frequently would you

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660
important and how frequently would you
 

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.900
important and how frequently would you
have to do that we've been developing

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:17.910
have to do that we've been developing
 

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:21.050
have to do that we've been developing
the annotation tools for the data sets

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:21.060
the annotation tools for the data sets
 

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:23.090
the annotation tools for the data sets
and for the individuals we do need to do

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:23.100
and for the individuals we do need to do
 

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.770
and for the individuals we do need to do
more work on that because we're just

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780
more work on that because we're just
 

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.170
more work on that because we're just
tagging based on quality from the

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180
tagging based on quality from the
 

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.750
tagging based on quality from the
scientists who are involved but we might

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760
scientists who are involved but we might
 

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.180
scientists who are involved but we might
also want to tag potential outlying data

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:32.190
also want to tag potential outlying data
 

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.220
also want to tag potential outlying data
so people can go back and look at that

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:34.230
so people can go back and look at that
 

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:37.280
so people can go back and look at that
more closely the other area that I think

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:37.290
more closely the other area that I think
 

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.480
more closely the other area that I think
is very interesting is how do you

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:38.490
is very interesting is how do you
 

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.730
is very interesting is how do you
identify attacks by malicious

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740
identify attacks by malicious
 

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.099
identify attacks by malicious
contributors and then how do you remove

01:04:43.099 --> 01:04:43.109
contributors and then how do you remove
 

01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:46.040
contributors and then how do you remove
them so at the moment there's a time

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:46.050
them so at the moment there's a time
 

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.650
them so at the moment there's a time
delay before the users contributed a

delay before the users contributed a
 

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.580
delay before the users contributed a
certain amount of data

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:49.590
certain amount of data
 

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:51.260
certain amount of data
and before the community gets to know

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:51.270
and before the community gets to know
 

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.270
and before the community gets to know
them before you can identify malicious

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280
them before you can identify malicious
 

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.370

attacks we'd like to reduce that latency

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:57.380
attacks we'd like to reduce that latency
 

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.500

things like high nutrient levels or poor
 

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:30.640
things like high nutrient levels or poor
water quality are also relevant there so

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:30.650
water quality are also relevant there so
 

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:32.860
water quality are also relevant there so
can we use that as the ground truth for

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:32.870
can we use that as the ground truth for
 

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:36.220
can we use that as the ground truth for
comparison statistical analysis of the

it's interesting that most of the data

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:44.270
it's interesting that most of the data
 

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:48.060
it's interesting that most of the data
that we get corresponds to Heron Island

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.070
that we get corresponds to Heron Island
 

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:51.340
that we get corresponds to Heron Island
Brampton Island where else um where the

major tourist sites are okay so it's

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:54.980
major tourist sites are okay so it's
 

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.300

like I like to ask Rick if they get

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:58.310
like I like to ask Rick if they get
 

01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:01.390

remove that bias from the data we want

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:11.120
remove that bias from the data we want

working with Microsoft Research and
there's my contact details and some

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:30.140
there's my contact details and some
 

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.380
there's my contact details and some
websites on the projects if you need

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:32.390
websites on the projects if you need
 

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:38.230
websites on the projects if you need
more information thank you I would like

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240
more information thank you I would like
 

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.840
more information thank you I would like
to invite our speakers to the table in

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:40.850
to invite our speakers to the table in
 

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:44.770
to invite our speakers to the table in
the front for the next part of this

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:44.780
the front for the next part of this
 

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:49.030
the front for the next part of this
session which is the UA is very very

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:49.040
session which is the UA is very very
 

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.620
session which is the UA is very very
interesting to hear all these talks

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:50.630
interesting to hear all these talks
 

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:52.510
interesting to hear all these talks
so you mentioned chain you mentioned

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520
so you mentioned chain you mentioned
 

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.160
so you mentioned chain you mentioned
something in your talk that actually

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:54.170
something in your talk that actually
 

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.930
something in your talk that actually
kind of puzzled me so you said that

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:55.940
kind of puzzled me so you said that
 

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:58.930
kind of puzzled me so you said that
there was a difference between where the

01:07:58.930 --> 01:07:58.940
there was a difference between where the
 

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.030
there was a difference between where the
training came from if it was online or

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:01.040
training came from if it was online or
 

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.540
training came from if it was online or
in person so what was the difference and

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:04.550
in person so what was the difference and
 

01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:14.110
in person so what was the difference and
why do you think that is well this is

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:14.120
why do you think that is well this is
 

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.640
why do you think that is well this is
not actually research that we've done it

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:15.650
not actually research that we've done it
 

01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:17.350
not actually research that we've done it
was in a paper which I read and I can't

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:17.360
was in a paper which I read and I can't
 

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.660
was in a paper which I read and I can't
remember who it was that identified this

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:19.670
remember who it was that identified this
 

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:22.150
remember who it was that identified this
but what they found was that if it's

01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:22.160
but what they found was that if it's
 

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.490
but what they found was that if it's
person-to-person training so for example

01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:24.500
person-to-person training so for example
 

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.700
person-to-person training so for example
in coral watch when it's tourists who

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:27.710
in coral watch when it's tourists who
 

01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:29.890
in coral watch when it's tourists who
are with a particular dive group then

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:29.900
are with a particular dive group then
 

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.690
are with a particular dive group then
they usually have silent someone with

01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:31.700
they usually have silent someone with
 

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.760
they usually have silent someone with
them and the dive group who shows them

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:33.770
them and the dive group who shows them
 

01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:36.340
them and the dive group who shows them
the protocol teachers and the protocol

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:36.350
the protocol teachers and the protocol
 

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.110
the protocol teachers and the protocol
for collecting the data and explains it

01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120
for collecting the data and explains it
 

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.420
for collecting the data and explains it
to them and then helps them as they go

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:40.430
to them and then helps them as they go
 

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.310
to them and then helps them as they go
along while they're collecting the data

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:42.320
along while they're collecting the data
 

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.230
along while they're collecting the data
so that's person-to-person training

01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:44.240
so that's person-to-person training
 

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.680
so that's person-to-person training
online training is where they just

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:46.690
online training is where they just
 

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:49.240
online training is where they just
perhaps it's an online test they have to

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:49.250
perhaps it's an online test they have to
 

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.950
perhaps it's an online test they have to
read some documents and then they might

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960
read some documents and then they might
 

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.720
read some documents and then they might
have to undergo a test to check that

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:52.730
have to undergo a test to check that
 

01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:54.100
have to undergo a test to check that
they've understood through your

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:54.110
they've understood through your
 

01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:55.810
they've understood through your
scientific protocol for collecting the

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:55.820
scientific protocol for collecting the
 

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:58.450
scientific protocol for collecting the
data and I'll see if I can find the

01:08:58.450 --> 01:08:58.460
data and I'll see if I can find the
 

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.250
data and I'll see if I can find the
paper for you but what they identified

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:00.260
paper for you but what they identified
 

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.830
paper for you but what they identified
was that generally the people who have

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:02.840
was that generally the people who have
 

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.120
was that generally the people who have
undergone personal training with you

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:07.130
undergone personal training with you
 

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:11.260
undergone personal training with you
know a teacher collected better quality

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:11.270
know a teacher collected better quality
 

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.900
know a teacher collected better quality
data than just undergoing online

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:13.910
data than just undergoing online
 

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:19.240
data than just undergoing online
training we have some research about

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:19.250
training we have some research about
 

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:21.690
training we have some research about
that too from our nest watch project

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:21.700
that too from our nest watch project
 

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.760
that too from our nest watch project
because in the nest watch project you

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:24.770
because in the nest watch project you
 

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:26.440
because in the nest watch project you
can either go online and read all the

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:26.450
can either go online and read all the
 

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:27.200
can either go online and read all the
protocol

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:27.210
protocol
 

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:31.040
protocol
and can take a quiz which we encourage

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.050
and can take a quiz which we encourage
 

01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:32.750
and can take a quiz which we encourage
people to do before they submit their

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:32.760
people to do before they submit their
 

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.330
people to do before they submit their
data but we also for a while had a lot

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:35.340
data but we also for a while had a lot
 

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.250
data but we also for a while had a lot
of regional training programs going on

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:37.260
of regional training programs going on
 

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.070
of regional training programs going on
at nature centers and we did not find a

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080
at nature centers and we did not find a
 

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.950
at nature centers and we did not find a
difference in fact we found that the

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960
difference in fact we found that the
 

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.070
difference in fact we found that the
people who were participating in the

01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080
people who were participating in the
 

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.280
people who were participating in the
hands-on face-to-face training were less

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:49.290
hands-on face-to-face training were less
 

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:51.950
hands-on face-to-face training were less
likely to submit data than the people

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960
likely to submit data than the people
 

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.800
likely to submit data than the people
who came online and we think it's

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:54.810
who came online and we think it's
 

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:57.200
who came online and we think it's
because they the fact that they were in

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:57.210
because they the fact that they were in
 

01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:58.430
because they the fact that they were in
these workshops was because they were

01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440
these workshops was because they were
 

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.860
these workshops was because they were
less confident to begin with so you

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:00.870
less confident to begin with so you
 

01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:02.660
less confident to begin with so you
really have to understand a lot about

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:02.670
really have to understand a lot about
 

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:04.850
really have to understand a lot about
the motivations and the aspirations and

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860
the motivations and the aspirations and
 

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:06.440
the motivations and the aspirations and
the knowledge of the participants before

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:06.450
the knowledge of the participants before
 

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:08.120
the knowledge of the participants before
they even enter training to be sure

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:08.130
they even enter training to be sure
 

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:09.860
they even enter training to be sure
about your outcomes there it's very

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:09.870
about your outcomes there it's very
 

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:19.250
about your outcomes there it's very
complicated

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260
 
 

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.790
 
another question for Jane after you

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800
another question for Jane after you
 

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.490
another question for Jane after you
implemented your star rating have you

01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500
implemented your star rating have you
 

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.400
implemented your star rating have you
seen any effects of users reacting to

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:28.410
seen any effects of users reacting to
 

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:31.850
seen any effects of users reacting to
their rating have people that got bad

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860
their rating have people that got bad
 

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:35.810
their rating have people that got bad
ratings started getting better at this

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820
ratings started getting better at this
 

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.790
ratings started getting better at this
stage we've mainly been working just

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800
stage we've mainly been working just
 

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.500
stage we've mainly been working just
with the choral watch people themselves

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:39.510
with the choral watch people themselves
 

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:42.620
with the choral watch people themselves
who are involved because they wanted

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:42.630
who are involved because they wanted
 

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:44.210
who are involved because they wanted
before we put this out in the public

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:44.220
before we put this out in the public
 

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.150
before we put this out in the public
with all of their public communic

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:46.160
with all of their public communic
 

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.800
with all of their public communic
contributors they wanted to understand

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:48.810
contributors they wanted to understand
 

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:50.510
contributors they wanted to understand
precisely how it worked so we're just

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520
precisely how it worked so we're just
 

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.190
precisely how it worked so we're just
working with the choral watch people

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:52.200
working with the choral watch people
 

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.990
working with the choral watch people
themselves because they're scared that

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000
themselves because they're scared that
 

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.080
themselves because they're scared that
we're going this approach will scare off

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:57.090
we're going this approach will scare off
 

01:10:57.090 --> 01:11:01.160
we're going this approach will scare off
their contributors so we're undergoing

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:01.170
their contributors so we're undergoing
 

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.470
their contributors so we're undergoing
testing in the next few months with a

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480
testing in the next few months with a
 

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.850
testing in the next few months with a
small group of volunteers to just

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860
small group of volunteers to just
 

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.550
small group of volunteers to just
understand the response of the

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560
understand the response of the
 

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.030
understand the response of the
volunteers themselves to this system one

01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040
volunteers themselves to this system one
 

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.950
volunteers themselves to this system one
thing that's really really noticeable is

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960
thing that's really really noticeable is
 

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.150
thing that's really really noticeable is
that in sort of web 2.0 web sites that

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:20.160
that in sort of web 2.0 web sites that
 

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.610
that in sort of web 2.0 web sites that
where people share images and video and

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620
where people share images and video and
 

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.130
where people share images and video and
so on there are very big differences in

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140
so on there are very big differences in
 

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:29.630
so on there are very big differences in
the the nature of the of the sort of

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640
the the nature of the of the sort of
 

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.410
the the nature of the of the sort of
inter member communications my joke

01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420
inter member communications my joke
 

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.990
inter member communications my joke
about this is that on Flickr people are

01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000
about this is that on Flickr people are
 

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.150
about this is that on Flickr people are
very very supportive of one another and

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:38.160
very very supportive of one another and
 

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.030
very very supportive of one another and
try to comment in ways that are very

there's just a huge difference which and
 

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.440
there's just a huge difference which and
I don't think the issues about where how

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:54.450
I don't think the issues about where how
 

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:56.720
I don't think the issues about where how
that appears are really understood these

it's interesting because in some
 

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:07.530
it's interesting because in some
situations some applications the ranking

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:07.540
situations some applications the ranking
 

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.040
situations some applications the ranking
works really well too let's see make

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.050
works really well too let's see make
 

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:12.930
works really well too let's see make
people more competitive so they want to

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:12.940
people more competitive so they want to
 

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.550
people more competitive so they want to
contribute so they want to improve their

that kind of ranking is kept hidden and
 

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:23.490
that kind of ranking is kept hidden and
it's only used you know behind the

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:23.500
it's only used you know behind the
 

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.670
it's only used you know behind the
system to filter out data so this is

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:26.680
system to filter out data so this is
 

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.200
system to filter out data so this is
where we need to identify what's the

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.210
where we need to identify what's the
 

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:30.780
where we need to identify what's the
best approach for which particular city

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:30.790
best approach for which particular city
 

01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:32.490

science citizen science project so it

01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:32.500
science citizen science project so it
 

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.040
science citizen science project so it
may vary across them yeah and we have

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:35.050
may vary across them yeah and we have
 

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.960
may vary across them yeah and we have
the same thing going on in Ebert and

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:29.910
so right now I would I can't prove this
 

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:31.730
so right now I would I can't prove this
but I'm pretty sure that most people are

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:31.740
but I'm pretty sure that most people are

using Ebert just to manage their data
and the benefit is that we get that

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480
and the benefit is that we get that
 

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.870

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.760
information now do we want to rate them
do we want to rate you know there's just

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:40.770
do we want to rate you know there's just
 

01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:42.770
do we want to rate you know there's just
so much more more work that has to go on

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780
so much more more work that has to go on
 

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.390
so much more more work that has to go on
here I would add one other thing though

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400
here I would add one other thing though
 

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.120
here I would add one other thing though
which is that in last year's evaluations

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:47.130

of our great backyard bird count we did

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:48.930
of our great backyard bird count we did
 

01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:50.900
of our great backyard bird count we did
a whole lot of quizzing for the first

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:50.910
a whole lot of quizzing for the first
 

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:52.600
a whole lot of quizzing for the first
time we did some pretty sophisticated

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:52.610
time we did some pretty sophisticated
 

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:56.750
time we did some pretty sophisticated
quizzes of bird identification skill and

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760
quizzes of bird identification skill and
 

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.000
quizzes of bird identification skill and
one of the things that and we also ask

01:14:59.000 --> 01:14:59.010
one of the things that and we also ask
 

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:01.910
one of the things that and we also ask
people to self rate themselves in a

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920
people to self rate themselves in a
 

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.620
people to self rate themselves in a
different part of the survey and we

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:03.630
different part of the survey and we
 

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:06.260
different part of the survey and we
discovered an astonishing correlation

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:06.270
discovered an astonishing correlation
 

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:08.330
discovered an astonishing correlation
between people's self rating and their

01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340
between people's self rating and their
 

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.130
between people's self rating and their

some do some studies about people's
 

01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:15.230
some do some studies about people's
willingness to participate in a variety

would be where you'd get the audience to

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080
would be where you'd get the audience to
 

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:25.400
would be where you'd get the audience to

issue in Australia there's reef check

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:27.270
issue in Australia there's reef check
 

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.510
issue in Australia there's reef check
and there's coral watch and you talked

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520
and there's coral watch and you talked
 

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.510
and there's coral watch and you talked
at Menten reef there's also projects for

01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520
at Menten reef there's also projects for
 

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520
at Menten reef there's also projects for
capturing data about manta rays about

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:34.530
capturing data about manta rays about
 

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:37.460

someone choose and usually they choose

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:41.850
someone choose and usually they choose
 

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:43.850
someone choose and usually they choose
because the organizational group they

01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860
because the organizational group they
 

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.860
because the organizational group they
belong to has been approached by someone

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:45.870
belong to has been approached by someone
 

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:48.950

so for example many of the fishing

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960
so for example many of the fishing
 

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.010

the fishing organizations and individual
 

01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:57.050
the fishing organizations and individual
fishermen are approached for capturing

01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060
fishermen are approached for capturing
 

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.860
fishermen are approached for capturing
information about whales or dugongs so

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:00.870
information about whales or dugongs so
 

01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:02.990
information about whales or dugongs so
it is a case of whoever approaches them

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000
it is a case of whoever approaches them
 

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.840
it is a case of whoever approaches them
first so the schools of Townsville are

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:05.850
first so the schools of Townsville are
 

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:08.210
first so the schools of Townsville are
approached to take school kids out to

01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:08.220
approached to take school kids out to
 

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.220
approached to take school kids out to
the reef to collect data and if they're

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:10.230
the reef to collect data and if they're
 

01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:11.750
the reef to collect data and if they're
approached by reef check first they'll

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760
approached by reef check first they'll
 

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.190
approached by reef check first they'll
go with reef check if they're approached

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:13.200
go with reef check if they're approached
 

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.500
go with reef check if they're approached
by coral watch first but you're also

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:15.510
by coral watch first but you're also
 

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:18.440
by coral watch first but you're also
assuming that the tools and technologies

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:18.450
assuming that the tools and technologies
 

01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.280
assuming that the tools and technologies
are simple enough that it's not onerous

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:22.290
are simple enough that it's not onerous
 

01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.520
are simple enough that it's not onerous
for them to do this as part of either

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:25.530
for them to do this as part of either
 

01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:26.319

the school

01:20:26.319 --> 01:20:26.329
the school
 

01:20:26.329 --> 01:20:28.649
the school
or as part of you know we need

01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:28.659
or as part of you know we need
 

01:20:28.659 --> 01:20:32.500
or as part of you know we need
undertaking fishing yeah actually that's

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:32.510
undertaking fishing yeah actually that's
 

01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:34.569
undertaking fishing yeah actually that's
an interesting point that relates to the

01:20:34.569 --> 01:20:34.579
an interesting point that relates to the
 

01:20:34.579 --> 01:20:36.129
an interesting point that relates to the
things that all three of us spoke about

01:20:36.129 --> 01:20:36.139
things that all three of us spoke about
 

01:20:36.139 --> 01:20:38.500
things that all three of us spoke about
is that all three of us aspire to have

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:38.510
is that all three of us aspire to have
 

01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:40.540
is that all three of us aspire to have
systems that are a general purpose and

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:40.550
systems that are a general purpose and
 

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:44.049
systems that are a general purpose and
that might make the environment less

01:20:44.049 --> 01:20:44.059
that might make the environment less
 

01:20:44.059 --> 01:20:47.319
that might make the environment less
competitive in the sense of permitting

01:20:47.319 --> 01:20:47.329
competitive in the sense of permitting
 

01:20:47.329 --> 01:20:49.060
competitive in the sense of permitting
people to participate in multiple

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:49.070
people to participate in multiple
 

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:52.770
people to participate in multiple
systems sort of easily or transparently

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:52.780
systems sort of easily or transparently

we have that problem even at the lab of

01:20:55.209 --> 01:20:55.219
we have that problem even at the lab of
 

01:20:55.219 --> 01:20:57.220
we have that problem even at the lab of
ornithology so you're a birdwatcher and

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:57.230
ornithology so you're a birdwatcher and
 

01:20:57.230 --> 01:20:59.109
ornithology so you're a birdwatcher and
you go to our website do I want to do a

01:20:59.109 --> 01:20:59.119
you go to our website do I want to do a
 

01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:01.270
you go to our website do I want to do a

urban birds what's the difference among

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:03.110
urban birds what's the difference among
 

01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:05.260
urban birds what's the difference among
all these projects anyway and one of the

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:05.270
all these projects anyway and one of the
 

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:06.819
all these projects anyway and one of the
things that we're building now it's not

01:21:06.819 --> 01:21:06.829
things that we're building now it's not
 

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:09.430

a project I know a lot about it is a

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440
a project I know a lot about it is a
 

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.020
a project I know a lot about it is a
Cornell Lab of Ornithology project is

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:11.030
Cornell Lab of Ornithology project is
 

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:13.089
Cornell Lab of Ornithology project is
called yard map and it starts out by

01:21:13.089 --> 01:21:13.099
called yard map and it starts out by
 

01:21:13.099 --> 01:21:15.970
called yard map and it starts out by
actually using online software to map

01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:15.980
actually using online software to map
 

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.339
actually using online software to map
your yard you know where the the shrubs

01:21:18.339 --> 01:21:18.349
your yard you know where the the shrubs
 

01:21:18.349 --> 01:21:20.049
your yard you know where the the shrubs
and the ponds and the trees and so

01:21:20.049 --> 01:21:20.059
and the ponds and the trees and so
 

01:21:20.059 --> 01:21:21.700
and the ponds and the trees and so
obviously it's probably not gonna be

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:21.710
obviously it's probably not gonna be
 

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.060
obviously it's probably not gonna be
terrific in the Upper West Side but at

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:25.070
terrific in the Upper West Side but at
 

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:26.620
terrific in the Upper West Side but at
least for the people who have a yard to

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:26.630
least for the people who have a yard to
 

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:30.069
least for the people who have a yard to
map what it is then going to do is get

01:21:30.069 --> 01:21:30.079
map what it is then going to do is get
 

01:21:30.079 --> 01:21:31.780
map what it is then going to do is get
them to start reporting the birds that

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:31.790
them to start reporting the birds that
 

01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:33.040
them to start reporting the birds that
are in their yard and they're not gonna

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:33.050
are in their yard and they're not gonna
 

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:34.689
are in their yard and they're not gonna
have to worry about which project

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:34.699
have to worry about which project
 

01:21:34.699 --> 01:21:36.850
have to worry about which project
they're in and in fact something that

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:36.860
they're in and in fact something that
 

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.140
they're in and in fact something that
most people don't really know or

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:38.150
most people don't really know or
 

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:39.819
most people don't really know or
understand about our projects is that

01:21:39.819 --> 01:21:39.829
understand about our projects is that
 

01:21:39.829 --> 01:21:41.500
understand about our projects is that
they actually all talk to each other if

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:41.510
they actually all talk to each other if
 

01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:43.959
they actually all talk to each other if
you put your data into eBird well it's

01:21:43.959 --> 01:21:43.969
you put your data into eBird well it's
 

01:21:43.969 --> 01:21:45.790
you put your data into eBird well it's
it's just one big database and these

01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800
it's just one big database and these

different projects are almost marketing

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:47.690
different projects are almost marketing

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:58.580
 
I'm a different type of question when

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:58.590
I'm a different type of question when
 

01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:00.229
I'm a different type of question when
you start out just getting people

01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239
you start out just getting people
 

01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:03.440
you start out just getting people
involved they're not really the subjects

of your research but obviously as soon

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:05.010
of your research but obviously as soon
 

01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:08.540
of your research but obviously as soon
as you start evaluating them groups like

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:08.550
as you start evaluating them groups like
 

01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:11.270

require you to abide by human subjects

01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060
require you to abide by human subjects

what your experience has been has that
 

01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:26.510
what your experience has been has that
been a barrier is a issue moving into

been a barrier is a issue moving into
 

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.250
been a barrier is a issue moving into
the fact that you are dealing with

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260
the fact that you are dealing with
 

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:31.130
the fact that you are dealing with
people and affecting their lives and

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140
people and affecting their lives and
 

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:38.240

think when the people sign up to

01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:45.300
think when the people sign up to
 

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.960
think when the people sign up to
contribute they also sign some kind of

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:47.970
contribute they also sign some kind of
 

01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:53.290
contribute they also sign some kind of
you know agreement to release the data I

01:22:53.290 --> 01:22:53.300
 
 

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.370

don't know that there's any ethics
involved in the choral watch but they

01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060
involved in the choral watch but they
 

01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.880
involved in the choral watch but they
definitely sign an agreement to make the

01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:58.890
definitely sign an agreement to make the
 

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:01.940
definitely sign an agreement to make the
data available but from my perspective

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:01.950
data available but from my perspective
 

01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:04.310
data available but from my perspective
it's not an issue but we could help with

01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320
it's not an issue but we could help with
 

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.400
it's not an issue but we could help with
having online data agreements and you

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:07.410
having online data agreements and you
 

01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:10.250
having online data agreements and you
know that kind of thing yeah we do have

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260
know that kind of thing yeah we do have
 

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.590
know that kind of thing yeah we do have
to get IRB approval for all of our

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600
to get IRB approval for all of our
 

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.640
to get IRB approval for all of our
evaluation work but thus far it's all

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:16.650
evaluation work but thus far it's all
 

01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:19.910
evaluation work but thus far it's all
been exempt I've had to get letters that

01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920
been exempt I've had to get letters that
 

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.700
been exempt I've had to get letters that
show that it's exempt but for those of

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:22.710
show that it's exempt but for those of
 

01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:24.800
show that it's exempt but for those of
you who deal with IRB I don't remember

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:24.810
you who deal with IRB I don't remember
 

01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:26.300
you who deal with IRB I don't remember
the wording but there's a clause in

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:26.310
the wording but there's a clause in
 

01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:29.180
the wording but there's a clause in
there that says something about if this

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:29.190
there that says something about if this
 

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:31.850
there that says something about if this
project can be thought of as simply an

01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860
project can be thought of as simply an
 

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.380
project can be thought of as simply an
educational project where you're

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:33.390
educational project where you're
 

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:36.140
educational project where you're
involving people in learning then it's

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:36.150
involving people in learning then it's
 

01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:37.520
involving people in learning then it's
exempt because we're not actually

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:37.530
exempt because we're not actually
 

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.770
exempt because we're not actually
manipulating the people we're not

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780
manipulating the people we're not
 

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.290
manipulating the people we're not
actually experimenting with the people

01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300
actually experimenting with the people
 

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.229
actually experimenting with the people
yeah but clearly at some point some of

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239
yeah but clearly at some point some of
 

01:23:45.239 --> 01:23:47.290
yeah but clearly at some point some of
the questions we'd like to answer will

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:47.300
the questions we'd like to answer will
 

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:49.660
the questions we'd like to answer will
and then we'll and then we'll get and

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:49.670
and then we'll and then we'll get and
 

01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:59.460
and then we'll and then we'll get and
then we'll get IR beam also I think

01:23:59.460 --> 01:23:59.470
then we'll get IR beam also I think
 

01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:01.840
then we'll get IR beam also I think
establishing personal profiles for

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:01.850
establishing personal profiles for
 

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:05.110
establishing personal profiles for
individuals who are involved then you're

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120
individuals who are involved then you're
 

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.720
individuals who are involved then you're
starting to get into the issues of

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:07.730
starting to get into the issues of
 

01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:10.240
starting to get into the issues of
personal privacy and personal data and

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:10.250
personal privacy and personal data and
 

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:11.700
personal privacy and personal data and
yet that information is very valuable

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:11.710
yet that information is very valuable
 

01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:15.430
yet that information is very valuable
both for providing relevant training and

01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440
both for providing relevant training and
 

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.770
both for providing relevant training and
other information but also when they're

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:17.780
other information but also when they're
 

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:20.560
other information but also when they're
doing searches inquiry so personalizing

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:20.570
doing searches inquiry so personalizing
 

01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.580
doing searches inquiry so personalizing
and customizing these search and query

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:23.590
and customizing these search and query
 

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:26.590
and customizing these search and query
results so I think there's a lot that

01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600
results so I think there's a lot that
 

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.630
results so I think there's a lot that
can be done there but there are also the

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:28.640
can be done there but there are also the
 

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.700
can be done there but there are also the
personal privacy issues that need to be

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:30.710
personal privacy issues that need to be
 

01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:42.130
personal privacy issues that need to be
considered

01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:42.140
 
 

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.810
 
I have two questions one as appears very

01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:46.820
I have two questions one as appears very

interesting Wells forty some years ago

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:16.790
interesting Wells forty some years ago
 

01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:19.570
interesting Wells forty some years ago
when I was a kid and I often heard the

01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:19.580
when I was a kid and I often heard the
 

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.070
when I was a kid and I often heard the
term popular science for the difference

01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080
term popular science for the difference
 

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.210
term popular science for the difference
of the classical science so reason that

tracked the term historically thank you
so I'll respond to the first part of the

01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:43.640
so I'll respond to the first part of the
 

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.310
so I'll respond to the first part of the
question and I'll let you to respond to

01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320
question and I'll let you to respond to
 

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:51.280
question and I'll let you to respond to
the second so the coral reef scientists

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:51.290
the second so the coral reef scientists
 

01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:52.750
the second so the coral reef scientists
that we're working with they're

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760
that we're working with they're
 

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.790
that we're working with they're
interested in the impact of climate

01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800
interested in the impact of climate
 

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.600
interested in the impact of climate
change on coral reef ecosystems and in

01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:58.610
change on coral reef ecosystems and in
 

01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:00.820
change on coral reef ecosystems and in
particular the correlation between

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:00.830
particular the correlation between
 

01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:03.460
particular the correlation between
climate change and frequency of

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:03.470
climate change and frequency of
 

01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.560
climate change and frequency of
bleaching events and what's the cause of

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:05.570
bleaching events and what's the cause of
 

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:07.150
bleaching events and what's the cause of
bleaching events and is there anything

01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:07.160
bleaching events and is there anything
 

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.170
bleaching events and is there anything
that can be done to mitigate the effects

01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:11.180
that can be done to mitigate the effects
 

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:15.550
that can be done to mitigate the effects
of bleaching now in order to do that

01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560
of bleaching now in order to do that
 

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.980
of bleaching now in order to do that
that they have determined that a number

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:17.990
that they have determined that a number
 

01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:20.290
that they have determined that a number
of factors caused coral bleaching one of

01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:20.300
of factors caused coral bleaching one of
 

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.120
of factors caused coral bleaching one of
them is rising sea surface temperatures

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:22.130
them is rising sea surface temperatures
 

01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:24.430
them is rising sea surface temperatures
so when the sea surface temperature goes

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440
so when the sea surface temperature goes
 

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.380
so when the sea surface temperature goes
above I don't know it's might be 22

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:26.390
above I don't know it's might be 22
 

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:28.450
above I don't know it's might be 22
degrees centigrade then there's much

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:28.460
degrees centigrade then there's much
 

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.670
degrees centigrade then there's much
more likelihood of bleaching but it's

01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:30.680
more likelihood of bleaching but it's
 

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.350
more likelihood of bleaching but it's
not just sea surface temperature it's

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360
not just sea surface temperature it's
 

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.150
not just sea surface temperature it's
also the water quality so if there's

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:34.160
also the water quality so if there's
 

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.000
also the water quality so if there's
high turbidity or high nutrients so when

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:37.010
high turbidity or high nutrients so when
 

01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:38.710
high turbidity or high nutrients so when
we have high rainfall events in

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:38.720
we have high rainfall events in
 

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.450
we have high rainfall events in
Queensland such as we've had recently

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:40.460
Queensland such as we've had recently
 

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.240
Queensland such as we've had recently
then you're getting a lot of the soil

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:43.250
then you're getting a lot of the soil
 

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:45.820
then you're getting a lot of the soil
and a lot of the pesticides from cane

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:45.830
and a lot of the pesticides from cane
 

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:48.400
and a lot of the pesticides from cane
farming and other types of farming and a

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:48.410
farming and other types of farming and a
 

01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:51.790
farming and other types of farming and a
lot of nutrients from you know human

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800
lot of nutrients from you know human
 

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.580
lot of nutrients from you know human
sewage washed into the rivers think

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:54.590
sewage washed into the rivers think
 

01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:56.439
sewage washed into the rivers think
washed out into the bays and onto the

01:26:56.439 --> 01:26:56.449
washed out into the bays and onto the
 

01:26:56.449 --> 01:26:59.620
washed out into the bays and onto the
reef that also has a big impact but with

01:26:59.620 --> 01:26:59.630
reef that also has a big impact but with
 

01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:02.169
reef that also has a big impact but with
the motors satellite imagery they could

01:27:02.169 --> 01:27:02.179
the motors satellite imagery they could
 

01:27:02.179 --> 01:27:05.140
the motors satellite imagery they could
analyze that imagery to derive sea

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:05.150
analyze that imagery to derive sea
 

01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:07.959
analyze that imagery to derive sea
surface temperature results okay and so

01:27:07.959 --> 01:27:07.969
surface temperature results okay and so
 

01:27:07.969 --> 01:27:09.910
surface temperature results okay and so
if there's a correlation between sea

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920
if there's a correlation between sea
 

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.649
if there's a correlation between sea
surface temperature when it goes above

01:27:11.649 --> 01:27:11.659
surface temperature when it goes above
 

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:14.500
surface temperature when it goes above
you know 22 degrees centigrade and

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:14.510
you know 22 degrees centigrade and
 

01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:17.290
you know 22 degrees centigrade and
you've also got high turbidity in the

01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:17.300
you've also got high turbidity in the
 

01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.060
you've also got high turbidity in the
water then you're more likely to get

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:19.070
water then you're more likely to get
 

01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:21.810
water then you're more likely to get
bleaching so then we want to overlay the

01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:21.820
bleaching so then we want to overlay the
 

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:26.939
bleaching so then we want to overlay the
actual coral watch data with the

01:27:26.939 --> 01:27:26.949
actual coral watch data with the
 

01:27:26.949 --> 01:27:30.879
actual coral watch data with the
satellite imagery and with but only the

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:30.889
satellite imagery and with but only the
 

01:27:30.889 --> 01:27:32.680
satellite imagery and with but only the
satellite imagery for the particular

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:32.690
satellite imagery for the particular
 

01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:34.660
satellite imagery for the particular
period when the sea surface temperature

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:34.670
period when the sea surface temperature
 

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:36.520
period when the sea surface temperature
goes above 22 degrees and you've got

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:36.530
goes above 22 degrees and you've got
 

01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:39.669
goes above 22 degrees and you've got
high nutrients and sediment in the water

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679
high nutrients and sediment in the water
 

01:27:39.679 --> 01:27:43.750

so using that kind of overlay of data to

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760
so using that kind of overlay of data to
 

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.180
so using that kind of overlay of data to
look for correlations and detect

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:46.190
look for correlations and detect
 

01:27:46.190 --> 01:27:50.260
look for correlations and detect
outliers as well so on that point one

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:50.270
outliers as well so on that point one
 

01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:52.510
outliers as well so on that point one
the one of the most interesting things

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520
the one of the most interesting things
 

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.879
the one of the most interesting things
about amateur astronomy is the ability

01:27:54.879 --> 01:27:54.889
about amateur astronomy is the ability
 

01:27:54.889 --> 01:27:57.970
about amateur astronomy is the ability
to detect anomalies and both of you two

01:27:57.970 --> 01:27:57.980
to detect anomalies and both of you two
 

01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.010
to detect anomalies and both of you two
mentioned the fact that you look for

01:28:00.010 --> 01:28:00.020
mentioned the fact that you look for
 

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.189
mentioned the fact that you look for
outliers and outliers of suspects and of

01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199
outliers and outliers of suspects and of
 

01:28:03.199 --> 01:28:05.589
outliers and outliers of suspects and of
course even in astronomical data almost

01:28:05.589 --> 01:28:05.599
course even in astronomical data almost
 

01:28:05.599 --> 01:28:07.720
course even in astronomical data almost
all outliers are suspect but

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:07.730
all outliers are suspect but
 

01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:09.820
all outliers are suspect but
occasionally in outliers of enormous

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:09.830
occasionally in outliers of enormous
 

01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:10.930
occasionally in outliers of enormous
interest and sometimes is more

01:28:10.930 --> 01:28:10.940
interest and sometimes is more
 

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.910
interest and sometimes is more
interesting than all of the aim liners

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920
interesting than all of the aim liners
 

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.620
interesting than all of the aim liners
and there's several couple of issues

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:17.630
and there's several couple of issues
 

01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:20.050
and there's several couple of issues
here one is that you happen have layers

01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:20.060
here one is that you happen have layers
 

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.149
here one is that you happen have layers
of other data like we're just like

01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159
of other data like we're just like
 

01:28:22.159 --> 01:28:25.629
of other data like we're just like
satellite data sometimes and of course

01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639
satellite data sometimes and of course
 

01:28:25.639 --> 01:28:27.339
satellite data sometimes and of course
you specifically mentioned that there

01:28:27.339 --> 01:28:27.349
you specifically mentioned that there
 

01:28:27.349 --> 01:28:28.899
you specifically mentioned that there
can be inconsistencies in the way people

01:28:28.899 --> 01:28:28.909
can be inconsistencies in the way people
 

01:28:28.909 --> 01:28:31.810
can be inconsistencies in the way people
fill out forms which allow you to

01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:31.820
fill out forms which allow you to
 

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.270
fill out forms which allow you to
identify things but but you definitely

01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280
identify things but but you definitely
 

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.050
identify things but but you definitely
want to be open to finding outliers and

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:37.060
want to be open to finding outliers and
 

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.399
want to be open to finding outliers and
investigating them and I know one place

01:28:39.399 --> 01:28:39.409
investigating them and I know one place
 

01:28:39.409 --> 01:28:42.070
investigating them and I know one place
where that came up is Galaxy Zoo and one

01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080
where that came up is Galaxy Zoo and one
 

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.660
where that came up is Galaxy Zoo and one
of the things they did is they kept a

01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:43.670
of the things they did is they kept a
 

01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:46.570
of the things they did is they kept a
sort of open-ended forum for people to

01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:46.580
sort of open-ended forum for people to
 

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.990
sort of open-ended forum for people to
just discuss outliers and then that

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000
just discuss outliers and then that
 

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.970
just discuss outliers and then that
open-ended forum actually led to some of

01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:51.980
open-ended forum actually led to some of
 

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.410
open-ended forum actually led to some of
the most important discoveries in the

01:28:53.410 --> 01:28:53.420
the most important discoveries in the
 

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.109
the most important discoveries in the
project were these outliers but I do

01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119
project were these outliers but I do
 

01:28:56.119 --> 01:28:57.879
project were these outliers but I do
think when when the number of records

01:28:57.879 --> 01:28:57.889
think when when the number of records
 

01:28:57.889 --> 01:28:59.800
think when when the number of records
gets enormous like you're facing it's

01:28:59.800 --> 01:28:59.810
gets enormous like you're facing it's
 

01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:04.359
gets enormous like you're facing it's
very hard to see like automated and

01:29:04.359 --> 01:29:04.369
very hard to see like automated and
 

01:29:04.369 --> 01:29:05.290
very hard to see like automated and
robust way

01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:05.300
robust way
 

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.439
robust way
as you can find the LP interesting

01:29:08.439 --> 01:29:08.449
as you can find the LP interesting
 

01:29:08.449 --> 01:29:12.879
as you can find the LP interesting
outliers so there was also the question

01:29:12.879 --> 01:29:12.889
outliers so there was also the question
 

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:24.190
outliers so there was also the question
about popular science mm-hmm

01:29:24.190 --> 01:29:24.200
 
 

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.720
 
but I'm not sure if I really understood

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:26.730
but I'm not sure if I really understood
 

01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:30.920
but I'm not sure if I really understood
the second part of the question well you

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:30.930
the second part of the question well you
 

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:32.240
the second part of the question well you
were asking about the term popular

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:32.250
were asking about the term popular
 

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:34.220
were asking about the term popular
science right what happened to that term

01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:34.230
science right what happened to that term
 

01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:37.790
science right what happened to that term
I think not I mean I think of popular

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800
I think not I mean I think of popular
 

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.820
I think not I mean I think of popular
science as being the science that's

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:40.830
science as being the science that's
 

01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:43.610
science as being the science that's
accessible to the public in a certain

01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:43.620
accessible to the public in a certain
 

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.290
accessible to the public in a certain
way and of course a lot of what people

01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300
way and of course a lot of what people
 

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.030
way and of course a lot of what people
in this room do is may try to make

01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040
in this room do is may try to make
 

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.180
in this room do is may try to make
science more accessible for the public

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:49.190
science more accessible for the public
 

01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:53.240
science more accessible for the public
and I think citizen science much more

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:53.250
and I think citizen science much more
 

01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:54.830
and I think citizen science much more
implies a participation direct

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840
implies a participation direct
 

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.260
implies a participation direct
participation and not just that the

01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:57.270
participation and not just that the
 

01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:00.230

understanding that whoa but I'd

01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:00.240
understanding that whoa but I'd
 

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.680

Anthropology of the terms doesn't work

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:05.660
Anthropology of the terms doesn't work

Anthropology of the terms doesn't work
right when we were working on the report

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:09.210
right when we were working on the report
 

01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:11.810

the field of citizen science we ran into
 

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.450
the field of citizen science we ran into
so many different terms there's

01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460
so many different terms there's
 

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.940
so many different terms there's
community science and civic science and

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:19.950
community science and civic science and
 

01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:21.350
community science and civic science and
we hadn't even thought about popular

01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360
we hadn't even thought about popular
 

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.600
we hadn't even thought about popular
science but participatory research

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:23.610
science but participatory research

that I'm forgetting and that's why we

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:28.410
that I'm forgetting and that's why we
 

01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:30.650
that I'm forgetting and that's why we
went out on a limb and came up with our

01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:30.660
went out on a limb and came up with our
 

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.630
went out on a limb and came up with our
new term public participation in

01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:32.640
new term public participation in
 

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.730
new term public participation in
scientific research to encompass all of

scientific research to encompass all of
 

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:36.860
scientific research to encompass all of
those and that's why we came up with

01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:36.870
those and that's why we came up with
 

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:40.700
those and that's why we came up with
those three to three new categories with

those three to three new categories with

and to me those are the people that are

citizen journalists and says the
journalism and there was clearly a

01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:47.540
journalism and there was clearly a
 

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:51.040
journalism and there was clearly a
deliberate choice of the term there to

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.050
deliberate choice of the term there to
 

01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:52.990
deliberate choice of the term there to
articulate a view of the role of the

01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:53.000
articulate a view of the role of the
 

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.479
articulate a view of the role of the
individual relationship society that the

01:31:55.479 --> 01:31:55.489
individual relationship society that the
 

01:31:55.489 --> 01:31:57.459
individual relationship society that the
citizen is a an active member of society

01:31:57.459 --> 01:31:57.469
citizen is a an active member of society
 

01:31:57.469 --> 01:31:59.290
citizen is a an active member of society
contributes in constructive ways and so

01:31:59.290 --> 01:31:59.300
contributes in constructive ways and so
 

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.340
contributes in constructive ways and so
forth I actually thought that might be

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:00.350
forth I actually thought that might be
 

01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:02.860
forth I actually thought that might be
part of what the terms as a scientist

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:02.870
part of what the terms as a scientist
 

01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:04.690
part of what the terms as a scientist
was trying to get an encouragement of

01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:04.700
was trying to get an encouragement of
 

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.310
was trying to get an encouragement of
that I might change the whole nature of

01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320
that I might change the whole nature of
 

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.950
that I might change the whole nature of
what it means to be a citizen well you

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960
what it means to be a citizen well you
 

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:15.700
what it means to be a citizen well you
know so I almost I'm 99.9% certain that

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:15.710
know so I almost I'm 99.9% certain that
 

01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:17.800
know so I almost I'm 99.9% certain that
I can lay claim that having started the

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:17.810
I can lay claim that having started the
 

01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:20.350
I can lay claim that having started the
use of this term and I was writing a

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360
use of this term and I was writing a
 

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.580
use of this term and I was writing a
grant proposal to NSF was 1995 and I

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:24.590
grant proposal to NSF was 1995 and I
 

01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:25.930
grant proposal to NSF was 1995 and I
said I don't want to call them

01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:25.940
said I don't want to call them
 

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.550
said I don't want to call them
volunteers because some of them are

01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560
volunteers because some of them are
 

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.990
volunteers because some of them are
paying us and I don't want to call him

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000
paying us and I don't want to call him
 

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.940
paying us and I don't want to call him
amateurs because it can be denigrating

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:30.950
amateurs because it can be denigrating
 

01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:32.320
amateurs because it can be denigrating
what the heck are we gonna call folks

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:32.330
what the heck are we gonna call folks
 

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:34.930
what the heck are we gonna call folks
anymore and I said how about citizen

01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:34.940
anymore and I said how about citizen
 

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.570
anymore and I said how about citizen
scientist and then I thought does that

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:37.580
scientist and then I thought does that
 

01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.940
scientist and then I thought does that
sound too much like Citizen Kane and I

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:39.950
sound too much like Citizen Kane and I
 

01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:42.340
sound too much like Citizen Kane and I
thought whatever and I wrote it down and

01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:42.350
thought whatever and I wrote it down and
 

01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:44.320
thought whatever and I wrote it down and
kind of the kind of the rest is history

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:44.330
kind of the kind of the rest is history
 

01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:47.590
kind of the kind of the rest is history
now Alan Irwin published a book in 1995

01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600
now Alan Irwin published a book in 1995
 

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.630
now Alan Irwin published a book in 1995
in the UK called citizen science that

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:49.640
in the UK called citizen science that

in the UK called citizen science that
same year and he was referring using the

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:51.950
same year and he was referring using the
 

01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:54.450
same year and he was referring using the
term to talk more about civic or

01:32:54.450 --> 01:32:54.460
term to talk more about civic or
 

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.979
term to talk more about civic or
contributing to social policy which is a

01:32:56.979 --> 01:32:56.989
contributing to social policy which is a
 

01:32:56.989 --> 01:32:59.290
contributing to social policy which is a
very important field and he still works

01:32:59.290 --> 01:32:59.300
very important field and he still works
 

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:02.680
very important field and he still works
in that area so there really was not a

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:02.690
in that area so there really was not a
 

01:33:02.690 --> 01:33:06.160
in that area so there really was not a
lot of deliberation on my part to using

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:06.170
lot of deliberation on my part to using
 

01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:09.700
lot of deliberation on my part to using
the word and I don't know how much

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:09.710
the word and I don't know how much
 

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.709
the word and I don't know how much
deliberation there was on anybody else's

01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719
deliberation there was on anybody else's
 

01:33:11.719 --> 01:33:13.030
deliberation there was on anybody else's
part like the National Audubon Society

01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040
part like the National Audubon Society
 

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.160
part like the National Audubon Society
or the National Wildlife Federation that

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:15.170
or the National Wildlife Federation that
 

01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:17.800
or the National Wildlife Federation that

Bruce Lowenstein at Cornell who is
 

01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:25.130
Bruce Lowenstein at Cornell who is
probably

Miller named to some of you and we spent

01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500
Miller named to some of you and we spent
 

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.940
Miller named to some of you and we spent
two weeks studying citizenship which I'd

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:31.950
two weeks studying citizenship which I'd
 

01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:34.130
two weeks studying citizenship which I'd
never done before we read all kinds of

01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:34.140
never done before we read all kinds of
 

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:36.290
never done before we read all kinds of
papers on citizenship and the question

01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300
papers on citizenship and the question
 

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.140
papers on citizenship and the question
was what did was it a good idea

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:39.150
was what did was it a good idea
 

01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:41.930
was what did was it a good idea
that that I or if it wasn't me whoever

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940
that that I or if it wasn't me whoever
 

01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:45.500
that that I or if it wasn't me whoever
came up with this and and also I should

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:45.510
came up with this and and also I should
 

01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:47.990
came up with this and and also I should
point out that at the 2007 conference

01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000
point out that at the 2007 conference
 

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.640
point out that at the 2007 conference
there were a lot of people in the room

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:49.650
there were a lot of people in the room
 

01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:51.680
there were a lot of people in the room
who are upset with the term citizen

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:51.690
who are upset with the term citizen
 

01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:53.600
who are upset with the term citizen
science because a lot of people are

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:53.610
science because a lot of people are
 

01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:56.150
science because a lot of people are
afraid of the word citizen and right now

01:33:56.150 --> 01:33:56.160
afraid of the word citizen and right now
 

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.790
afraid of the word citizen and right now
there's a lot of talk about immigration

01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800
there's a lot of talk about immigration
 

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.680
there's a lot of talk about immigration
so there's a lot of interesting

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:00.690
so there's a lot of interesting
 

01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:02.840
so there's a lot of interesting
connotations with the word right now and

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:02.850
connotations with the word right now and
 

01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:05.150
connotations with the word right now and
again that's why we got away from using

01:34:05.150 --> 01:34:05.160
again that's why we got away from using
 

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.920
again that's why we got away from using
it in our report and switched over to

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:06.930
it in our report and switched over to
 

01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:11.000
it in our report and switched over to
the PP SR but what I decided at first

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:11.010
the PP SR but what I decided at first
 

01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:12.980
the PP SR but what I decided at first
during this graduate seminar listening

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:12.990
during this graduate seminar listening
 

01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:14.690
during this graduate seminar listening
to graduate students who knew way more

01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:14.700
to graduate students who knew way more
 

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.630
to graduate students who knew way more
than I did about citizenship theory

01:34:17.630 --> 01:34:17.640
than I did about citizenship theory
 

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.000
than I did about citizenship theory
listening to them I first thought no I

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:20.010
listening to them I first thought no I
 

01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:22.310
listening to them I first thought no I
wish I hadn't and you know it was really

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320
wish I hadn't and you know it was really
 

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.350
wish I hadn't and you know it was really
civilian sciences really what we were

01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360
civilian sciences really what we were
 

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.440
civilian sciences really what we were
talking about non professional but then

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:27.450
talking about non professional but then
 

01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:29.240
talking about non professional but then
the more I thought about it I decided

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:29.250
the more I thought about it I decided
 

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:30.440
the more I thought about it I decided
that what's really important to think

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:30.450
that what's really important to think
 

01:34:30.450 --> 01:34:32.840
that what's really important to think
about is the citizenship of science and

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:32.850
about is the citizenship of science and
 

01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:35.930
about is the citizenship of science and
the obligation that science as an

01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940
the obligation that science as an
 

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.820
the obligation that science as an
institute or institution globally

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:37.830
institute or institution globally
 

01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:39.350
institute or institution globally
speaking has to the world to be

01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360
speaking has to the world to be
 

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.570
speaking has to the world to be
transparent and inclusive and tried to

01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:41.580
transparent and inclusive and tried to
 

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:44.660
transparent and inclusive and tried to
make what we do something that not only

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:44.670
make what we do something that not only
 

01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:46.700
make what we do something that not only
can anybody understand but can also

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:46.710
can anybody understand but can also
 

01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:49.580
can anybody understand but can also
participate in so now I'm glad I did it

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:49.590
participate in so now I'm glad I did it
 

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:51.650
participate in so now I'm glad I did it
although I still think that people will

01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:51.660
although I still think that people will
 

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.540
although I still think that people will
debate it forever and I'll just add one

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:53.550
debate it forever and I'll just add one
 

01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:55.550
debate it forever and I'll just add one
little funny story is that I sat in

01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560
little funny story is that I sat in
 

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.310
little funny story is that I sat in
another seminar once listening to people

01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320
another seminar once listening to people
 

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.560
another seminar once listening to people
debate what the person who came up with

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:00.570
debate what the person who came up with
 

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:05.180
debate what the person who came up with
the term meant but I but I wasn't my

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:05.190
the term meant but I but I wasn't my
 

01:35:05.190 --> 01:35:06.920
the term meant but I but I wasn't my
presence wasn't known in the room and

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:06.930
presence wasn't known in the room and
 

01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:08.300
presence wasn't known in the room and
that was really really fun it was like

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:08.310
that was really really fun it was like
 

01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:10.640
that was really really fun it was like
Mark Twain you know was it Tom Sawyer at

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:10.650
Mark Twain you know was it Tom Sawyer at
 

01:35:10.650 --> 01:35:13.970
Mark Twain you know was it Tom Sawyer at
his own funeral or else all these people

01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980
his own funeral or else all these people
 

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.560
his own funeral or else all these people
that tried to figure out what Bob Dylan

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:15.570
that tried to figure out what Bob Dylan
 

01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:17.240
that tried to figure out what Bob Dylan
was talking about in any of his songs

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:17.250
was talking about in any of his songs
 

01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:21.820
was talking about in any of his songs
and he'll answer you hell if I know the

01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:21.830
and he'll answer you hell if I know the
 

01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:25.490
and he'll answer you hell if I know the
I'm I like the implication of the

01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500
I'm I like the implication of the
 

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.590
I'm I like the implication of the
journalism citizen journalist

01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600
journalism citizen journalist
 

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.310
journalism citizen journalist
where I do think both the idea that said

01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320
where I do think both the idea that said
 

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.170
where I do think both the idea that said
science has a responsibility to citizens

01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:33.180
science has a responsibility to citizens
 

01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:35.300
science has a responsibility to citizens
but also that part of citizenship

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:35.310
but also that part of citizenship
 

01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:37.400
but also that part of citizenship
especially as we're entering a phase in

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:37.410
especially as we're entering a phase in
 

01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:40.880
especially as we're entering a phase in
which the the public has a lot of

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:40.890
which the the public has a lot of
 

01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:46.870
which the the public has a lot of
influence over the world citizen

01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880
influence over the world citizen
 

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.340
influence over the world citizen
citizenship does involve some kind of

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:49.350
citizenship does involve some kind of
 

01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:53.360
citizenship does involve some kind of
scientific responsibility and I think a

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:53.370
scientific responsibility and I think a
 

01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.520
scientific responsibility and I think a
good term to describe it is the

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:55.530
good term to describe it is the
 

01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:58.340
good term to describe it is the
democratization of science which is

01:35:58.340 --> 01:35:58.350
democratization of science which is
 

01:35:58.350 --> 01:36:01.010
democratization of science which is
being enabled through these citizen

01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020
being enabled through these citizen
 

01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.690
being enabled through these citizen
science projects and I'd also like to

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:02.700
science projects and I'd also like to
 

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.750
science projects and I'd also like to
say that the term citizen science it

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760
say that the term citizen science it
 

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.380
say that the term citizen science it
isn't so well accepted in Australia the

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:09.390
isn't so well accepted in Australia the
 

01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:12.320
isn't so well accepted in Australia the
term citizen has American connotations

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:12.330
term citizen has American connotations
 

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:15.170
term citizen has American connotations
to it so I prefer public participation

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:15.180
to it so I prefer public participation
 

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.490
to it so I prefer public participation
in research programs is that what your

01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500
in research programs is that what your
 

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.030
in research programs is that what your
new title is the area that has it better

01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040
new title is the area that has it better
 

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.100
new title is the area that has it better
it would be better accepted in Australia

01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:25.110
it would be better accepted in Australia
 

01:36:25.110 --> 01:36:27.650
it would be better accepted in Australia
I think yeah that's good to hear now

01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:27.660
I think yeah that's good to hear now
 

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:29.960
I think yeah that's good to hear now
democratization of science I grabbed on

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:29.970
democratization of science I grabbed on
 

01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.940
democratization of science I grabbed on
to that early on when I first heard it I

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:31.950
to that early on when I first heard it I
 

01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:33.350
to that early on when I first heard it I
think that comes up a lot of that comes

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360
think that comes up a lot of that comes
 

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.740
think that comes up a lot of that comes
out of the UK but I quickly discovered I

01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:36.750
out of the UK but I quickly discovered I
 

01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:38.360
out of the UK but I quickly discovered I
mean at the lab of ornithology

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:38.370
mean at the lab of ornithology
 

01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:41.300
mean at the lab of ornithology
where I am a social scientist I'm most

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:41.310
where I am a social scientist I'm most
 

01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:43.900
where I am a social scientist I'm most
of my my colleagues there are real

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:43.910
of my my colleagues there are real
 

01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.310
of my my colleagues there are real
ornithologists and I discovered that the

01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320
ornithologists and I discovered that the
 

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.310
ornithologists and I discovered that the
democratization of science was what's

01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320
democratization of science was what's
 

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.600
democratization of science was what's
the word I'm looking for here that they

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:50.610
the word I'm looking for here that they
 

01:36:50.610 --> 01:36:52.220
the word I'm looking for here that they
were worried about that was threatening

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:52.230
were worried about that was threatening
 

01:36:52.230 --> 01:36:54.200
were worried about that was threatening
who was threatening to them to hear that

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:54.210
who was threatening to them to hear that
 

01:36:54.210 --> 01:36:59.060
who was threatening to them to hear that
term so because they had spent their

01:36:59.060 --> 01:36:59.070
term so because they had spent their
 

01:36:59.070 --> 01:37:01.220
term so because they had spent their
whole life getting a PhD in studying and

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:01.230
whole life getting a PhD in studying and
 

01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:03.590
whole life getting a PhD in studying and
they didn't want that democratized we

01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600
they didn't want that democratized we
 

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.560
they didn't want that democratized we
will offer a co-authorship to everybody

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:06.570
will offer a co-authorship to everybody
 

01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:11.450
will offer a co-authorship to everybody
who contributed data now that that mean

01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460
who contributed data now that that mean
 

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.670
who contributed data now that that mean
that's probably not sustainable for a

01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:13.680
that's probably not sustainable for a
 

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.930
that's probably not sustainable for a
lot of projects and a lot of projects

01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940
lot of projects and a lot of projects
 

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:18.100
lot of projects and a lot of projects
don't have that tradition in the field

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:18.110
don't have that tradition in the field
 

01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:21.140
don't have that tradition in the field
but I think but you know in Australia

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:21.150
but I think but you know in Australia
 

01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:22.880
but I think but you know in Australia
the other thing I should say is that in

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:22.890
the other thing I should say is that in
 

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:25.760
the other thing I should say is that in
astronomy and in physics authorship

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:25.770
astronomy and in physics authorship
 

01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:27.560
astronomy and in physics authorship
author lists of more than 2,000 people

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:27.570
author lists of more than 2,000 people
 

01:37:27.570 --> 01:37:30.350
author lists of more than 2,000 people
are now common in fact there are many

01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360
are now common in fact there are many
 

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.000
are now common in fact there are many
papers now in the physics literature in

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:32.010
papers now in the physics literature in
 

01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:33.770
papers now in the physics literature in
which the author list is longer than the

01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780
which the author list is longer than the
 

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:36.550
which the author list is longer than the
body of the paper

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560
 
 

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.550
 
and I and so for us it's much less of a

01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:39.560
and I and so for us it's much less of a
 

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.200
and I and so for us it's much less of a
problem because we've kind of based that

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:41.210
problem because we've kind of based that
 

01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:43.660
problem because we've kind of based that
issue but if we got to a hundred

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:43.670
issue but if we got to a hundred
 

01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:47.200
issue but if we got to a hundred
thousand participants you know we I

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:47.210
thousand participants you know we I
 

01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:49.150
thousand participants you know we I
don't think anybody has a real model for

don't think anybody has a real model for
 

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:52.060
don't think anybody has a real model for
that except you know me credit my

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:52.070
that except you know me credit my
 

01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:58.660
that except you know me credit my
reference I know that the researchers I

01:37:58.660 --> 01:37:58.670
reference I know that the researchers I
 

01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:00.580
reference I know that the researchers I
work with in environmental sciences and

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:00.590
work with in environmental sciences and
 

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:03.520
work with in environmental sciences and
marine scientists if they're reusing

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:03.530
marine scientists if they're reusing
 

01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:05.260
marine scientists if they're reusing
this data they will credit the coral

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:05.270
this data they will credit the coral
 

01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.240
this data they will credit the coral
watch organization but not individuals

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:07.250
watch organization but not individuals
 

01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:09.850
watch organization but not individuals
but there are initiatives around quite a

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:09.860
but there are initiatives around quite a
 

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.680
but there are initiatives around quite a
few and they're taking seem they're

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:13.690
few and they're taking seem they're
 

01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:17.530
few and they're taking seem they're
making significant progress in standards

01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:17.540
making significant progress in standards
 

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.210
making significant progress in standards
for data citation so then you can have

01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:21.220
for data citation so then you can have
 

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.220
for data citation so then you can have
citations to particular data by

01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:24.230
citations to particular data by
 

01:38:24.230 --> 01:38:26.890
citations to particular data by
individuals contributed through citizen

01:38:26.890 --> 01:38:26.900
individuals contributed through citizen
 

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.230
individuals contributed through citizen
science projects and those citations

01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:29.240
science projects and those citations
 

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:32.640
science projects and those citations
would be within publications so I think

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:32.650
would be within publications so I think
 

01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:37.990
would be within publications so I think
that these methods will enable specific

01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000
that these methods will enable specific
 

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.960
that these methods will enable specific
citation of individual contributions of

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:40.970
citation of individual contributions of
 

01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:43.870
citation of individual contributions of
data through these projects yeah

01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880
data through these projects yeah
 

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.460
data through these projects yeah
actually that's a very generic problem

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:45.470
actually that's a very generic problem
 

01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:47.560
actually that's a very generic problem
in all of the sciences now that use

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:47.570
in all of the sciences now that use
 

01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:50.170
in all of the sciences now that use
heterogeneous data is that how you know

01:38:50.170 --> 01:38:50.180
heterogeneous data is that how you know
 

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:53.200
heterogeneous data is that how you know
you there's another issue which is

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:53.210
you there's another issue which is
 

01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:54.670
you there's another issue which is
related which is this repeatability

01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:54.680
related which is this repeatability
 

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.820
related which is this repeatability
issue that in astronomy we're trying to

01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:57.830
issue that in astronomy we're trying to
 

01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:59.470
issue that in astronomy we're trying to
build systems so that if somebody wants

01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480
build systems so that if somebody wants
 

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480
build systems so that if somebody wants
to repeat the analysis in a paper they

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:01.490
to repeat the analysis in a paper they
 

01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:04.540
to repeat the analysis in a paper they
can and that requires not just citation

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:04.550
can and that requires not just citation
 

01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:08.350
can and that requires not just citation
of the data but kind of deep links the

01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360
of the data but kind of deep links the
 

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.720
of the data but kind of deep links the
detailed provenance so for example if

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:10.730
detailed provenance so for example if
 

01:39:10.730 --> 01:39:12.370
detailed provenance so for example if
someone analyzes all of the coral watch

01:39:12.370 --> 01:39:12.380
someone analyzes all of the coral watch
 

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:13.960
someone analyzes all of the coral watch
state and then they generate a graph

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:13.970
state and then they generate a graph
 

01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:16.420
state and then they generate a graph
which shows the trends in bleaching

01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:16.430
which shows the trends in bleaching
 

01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:19.240
which shows the trends in bleaching
events you need to know what data

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:19.250
events you need to know what data
 

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:22.540
events you need to know what data
they've use to generate those trends you

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:22.550
they've use to generate those trends you
 

01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:24.520
they've use to generate those trends you
know what kind of statistical analysis

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:24.530
know what kind of statistical analysis
 

01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:27.100
know what kind of statistical analysis
they've used to generate the graph and

01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:27.110
they've used to generate the graph and
 

01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:30.130
they've used to generate the graph and
so there's also significant work going

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:30.140
so there's also significant work going
 

01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:33.130
so there's also significant work going
on on the capturing the detailed

01:39:33.130 --> 01:39:33.140
on on the capturing the detailed
 

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.800
on on the capturing the detailed
provenance of the derived data from the

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:35.810
provenance of the derived data from the
 

01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:36.569
provenance of the derived data from the
citizens

01:39:36.569 --> 01:39:36.579
citizens
 

01:39:36.579 --> 01:39:38.879

and there's issues there of the data
 

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:41.250
and there's issues there of the data
evolving under you so there's you want

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:41.260
evolving under you so there's you want
 

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.109
evolving under you so there's you want
to be able to roll back the data a

01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119
to be able to roll back the data a
 

01:39:43.119 --> 01:39:45.209

referee might want to roll back the data

01:39:45.209 --> 01:39:45.219
referee might want to roll back the data
 

01:39:45.219 --> 01:39:47.459
referee might want to roll back the data
and see what the data looked like at the

01:39:47.459 --> 01:39:47.469
and see what the data looked like at the
 

01:39:47.469 --> 01:39:48.959
and see what the data looked like at the
time that this analysis was performed

01:39:48.959 --> 01:39:48.969
time that this analysis was performed
 

01:39:48.969 --> 01:39:56.540
time that this analysis was performed
and its technical issues there that are

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:56.550
 
 

01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:58.589
 
no more questions from the audience I

01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599
no more questions from the audience I
 

01:39:58.599 --> 01:40:00.870
no more questions from the audience I
will use my moderator privilege and to

will use my moderator privilege and to
 

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.149
will use my moderator privilege and to
ask one question and that um there

01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159
ask one question and that um there
 

01:40:03.159 --> 01:40:05.609
ask one question and that um there
appears to be two dimensions to citizen

01:40:05.609 --> 01:40:05.619
appears to be two dimensions to citizen
 

01:40:05.619 --> 01:40:08.220
appears to be two dimensions to citizen
science and one seems to be more

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:08.230
science and one seems to be more
 

01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:09.839
science and one seems to be more
prominent in our discussion here and

01:40:09.839 --> 01:40:09.849
prominent in our discussion here and
 

01:40:09.849 --> 01:40:11.760
prominent in our discussion here and
that's the one day how do we get data

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:11.770
that's the one day how do we get data
 

01:40:11.770 --> 01:40:13.500
that's the one day how do we get data
that already exists the citizens

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:13.510
that already exists the citizens
 

01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:15.120

collects how we can how can we integrate

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:15.130
collects how we can how can we integrate
 

01:40:15.130 --> 01:40:17.280
collects how we can how can we integrate
them into our projects and engage with

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:17.290
them into our projects and engage with
 

01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:19.850
them into our projects and engage with
them then there's the educational part

01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860
them then there's the educational part
 

01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:24.359
them then there's the educational part
educating the citizen participants on

01:40:24.359 --> 01:40:24.369
educating the citizen participants on
 

01:40:24.369 --> 01:40:26.250
educating the citizen participants on
the work that they're already doing and

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:26.260
the work that they're already doing and
 

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.799
the work that they're already doing and
to learn more from the scientists and

01:40:28.799 --> 01:40:28.809
to learn more from the scientists and
 

01:40:28.809 --> 01:40:32.609
to learn more from the scientists and
then I see like a as far as this stuff

01:40:32.609 --> 01:40:32.619
then I see like a as far as this stuff
 

01:40:32.619 --> 01:40:35.640
then I see like a as far as this stuff
dimension of that second dimension how

this information in the science how do

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:44.650
this information in the science how do
 

01:40:44.650 --> 01:40:46.470
this information in the science how do
you engage them and I think with a

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480
you engage them and I think with a
 

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.140
you engage them and I think with a

already excited at some level about the
 

01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:00.330
already excited at some level about the
subjects but I agree actually that one

01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:00.340
subjects but I agree actually that one
 

01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.890

deeper understanding of what they're
 

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.900
deeper understanding of what they're
doing and I think first of all I think

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:12.910
doing and I think first of all I think
 

01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:14.280
doing and I think first of all I think
it's a hard problem but second of all I

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:14.290
it's a hard problem but second of all I
 

01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:15.720
it's a hard problem but second of all I
think one thing that's definitely

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:15.730
think one thing that's definitely
 

01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:17.970

happening in education this is now

01:42:17.970 --> 01:42:17.980
happening in education this is now

in America at least is there's a lot of

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:22.930
in America at least is there's a lot of
 

01:42:22.930 --> 01:42:26.520
in America at least is there's a lot of
emphasis on and I think quite rightly on

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:26.530

like activities and then evolving to
 

01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:35.130
like activities and then evolving to
doing true research activities and I

01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:35.140
doing true research activities and I
 

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:38.730
doing true research activities and I
think that and that that whole mode of

education well I have so many responses
to that question okay so the first one

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:03.010
to that question okay so the first one
 

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.790
to that question okay so the first one
is I have no idea and if you can figure

01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.800
is I have no idea and if you can figure
 

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.600
is I have no idea and if you can figure
it out

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:06.610
it out
 

01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:08.130
it out
you know if I knew we'd have a lot more

01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:08.140
you know if I knew we'd have a lot more
 

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:11.250
