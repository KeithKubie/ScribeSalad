In previous videos,
you guys have seen

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.200
Nate make dry ice bubbles
that you can actually bounce

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.000
and play with.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.800
Now, Nate has a tendency
to try and eat pretty

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.700
much anything he can.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.800
So, today we're actually
going to put a twist

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.100
on those dry ice bubbles.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.100
We're going to make
them edible,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.600
so you can use them
for fun Halloween toppings

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.592
in your drinks.

00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:26.440
[Music]

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.800
&gt;&gt; Guys, Cali's back
here in the studio

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
and she's going to be showing us
how to adapt a project

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.300
we've done previously,
and make it a little bit

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.500
more food grade.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.900
&gt;&gt; Because you eat everything.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.520
&gt;&gt; That's sometimes true.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.300
In the past, we've made
some bubbles that we fill

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.800
with dry ice vapor and looks
really cool because it's full

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.900
of just a white fog.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.600
And, then they pop

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.692
and it releases the fog.

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:46.700
Cali has found a way
to make those bubbles edible.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.500
So, we can fill them
with dry ice and put them

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.300
on the top of the drink.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.660
So, you have a sort of spooky,
bubbly-filled,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.200
ghost drink topper.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.300
We captured some ghost souls
and we put them in bubbles,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.800
and we're putting those
in our drinks.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.020
&gt;&gt; That wasn't in the fine print.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.800
&gt;&gt; That's what we're doing.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.100
Some people call it dry ice,
but I call it ghost souls.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.920
&gt;&gt; I have to go.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.600
So, here's the basic idea.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700
We're going to be
taking some pretty

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.900
common kitchen ingredients.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.800
We're going to be putting them
together, that will actually hold

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.020
in bubble shape,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.500
fill them with dry ice and see
if we can put them on the top

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.200
of some drinks.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.700
So, the ingredients that we
are using are pretty simple,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.260
pretty easy to find.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.720
Corn syrup and dish soap,
you're usually going to find

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.440
in your kitchen.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.400
Glycerin can usually be found
in any baking section

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.260
or pharmacy section
of any department store.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.300
&gt;&gt; We also have
a good variety of sodas,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.212
which we primarily picked
because they were fun colors,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.140
I'm pretty sure.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.200
First, let's do a recap.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.192
Let's make some of the regular
dry ice-filled bubbles,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600
the non-edible kind,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.100
and then we can see what's
different between the two,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.300
once we've got them all made.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.000
&gt;&gt; I will be surprised
if you don't try

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.340
and eat one of those too.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.100
&gt;&gt; So, for the non-edible bubbles,
we're actually going to take

00:01:56.152 --> 00:01:58.542
some Dollar Store
bubble solution.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.800
Going to use that for just
a little bit of the base,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
but it's not really strong
enough to make these as large

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.500
as we want.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.400
So we're going to add
a few other things too.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.192
Just a little bit of this

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:11.100
and then if you can add,
probably I would say,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.920
half a teaspoon of Glycerin.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.180
There you go.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.800
We're going to add
a little bit of water.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.000
And then two full teaspoons
of Dawn dish soap.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.400
I really made
this stuff powerful.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.100
Oh, the power.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.960
Okay, let's see if it works.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.800
Hey, it works!

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.560
Don't eat these ones.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.400
No...

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.640
Now let's add some dry ice.

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:43.392
And go.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.000
Add more.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.782
Add more.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.600
More.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.440
Yeah, that should do it.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.080
&gt;&gt; It's too much, it's actually
building up pressure.

00:02:58.082 --> 00:02:59.672
&gt;&gt; No, no, that's actually
exactly what we want.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.760
So take the lid off.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.160
So the lid is how
we're going to control...

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:05.892
how fast we're building
these bubbles.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.840
Build me a bubble.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.700
&gt;&gt; Oh, just one at a time.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.620
Look at that.

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:32.742
Honestly, you can test a lot
of different dish soaps, Dawn,

00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:34.800
for some reason,
everybody agrees...

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800
it works the best.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.480
Look at this.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.800
That's--
that's insane.

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:42.800
If you do this with bare hands
or rubber gloves

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.000
or anything like that,
the bubbles aren't really

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.640
going to stay.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.500
They want this soft fabric, 
and then you can pretty

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:51.552
much-- not drop them.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:56.800
So if you want a lot
of dry ice vapor very quickly,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.860
drop your dry ice
into hot water.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.100
It's not going to last as long,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.760
but you're going to get
this crazy opaque material here.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.120
This is not recommended.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.000
Nate's going to eat one
of the ones that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.200
should not be eaten.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.300
How'd that taste?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.560
&gt;&gt; Like soap.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.100
&gt;&gt; Do you want it to taste better?

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.600
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.400
&gt;&gt; Let's fix that.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.360
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.200
Now we're going
to start making

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.500
our edible bubbles
and to do that,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.700
we're going to start with soda.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.300
Then we're going to take
a little bit of our soda

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.360
and we're going to throw it
in a pot on the stove.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.800
And, the main reason for that,
is to just try and get all

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.000
of the carbonation out of it.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.200
So for best results,
really just dump out some soda,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.200
leave it on the counter
until there is,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.500
no carbonation left.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.900
This tends to be a slightly
faster way to do it,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.500
but we do want to avoid it
boiling and we also

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.000
want to avoid it
hitting any sort

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.400
of caramelization stage.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.500
&gt;&gt; We would also be able to just
put in a vacuum chamber

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.400
and suck all
of the carbonation out

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.332
like that.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:06.400
&gt;&gt; Kind of like,
when you shake up a soda,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.900
and then you pour it out

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.700
and you lose a lot
of that carbonation.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.000
The idea is to just
really agitate the soda,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.600
so we get rid
of that carbonation.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.100
So you can see now
when I'm stirring it,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.200
we're really not getting
any bubbles coming

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.500
to the surface.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.400
It's basically just what
you would see on any liquid

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.000
on the stove.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.500
That's what we're looking for.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.400
No more carbonation,
so we're good to go.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.600
So, we are going
to be adding one

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.800
similar ingredient that we added
to the regular bubble solution

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.300
and that is Dawn dish soap.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.420
So while these bubbles
are edible,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.700
you don't want to drink them.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.600
They're wonderful
for the topping of a drink.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.700
They're wonderful
if you just want

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.600
to blow them and kind of
catch them in the air

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.020
with your tongue,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.260
but maybe don't drink
the whole solution.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.000
&gt;&gt; So let's talk, about how much
of this dish soap are we adding

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.532
into our mixture here?

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:55.200
&gt;&gt; Much less than we added here.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.000
This was almost 3 tablespoons
by the time we were done.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.300
This we're going to do
maybe half a tablespoon

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.200
and we're adding
other ingredients as well.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.800
So that by the time you're done

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.100
it's less than a drop or so
of Dawn dish soap per drink.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.800
&gt;&gt; Probably even less
than that even,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.500
because once we've made
the bubbles, the actual

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.700
amount of liquid
used in bubbles,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.500
it's going to end up only
being a few drops and each

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.200
of those few drops will only

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.900
contain about one
or two percent Dawn dish soap.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.500
So... it's really
such a small amount

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.800
that it's really not a problem.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.300
&gt;&gt; So here's what
we're going to do

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.200
to make it a little bit thicker.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.900
We're going to be adding
some corn syrup,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.200
which is just augmenting
the sugar that we have

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.900
in the soda already and then

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.580
glycerin which is going
to help the surface tension

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.480
of the bubbles.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.800
Corn syrup about 2 tablespoons.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.700
Glycerin, I'm going to say...
less than half a tablespoon or so.

00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:45.600
&gt;&gt; Now, Glycerin like this soap,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.200
is not something you want to eat

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.700
or drink a lot of but
in very small quantities such

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.900
as we're going to be having
in the bubbles on top

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.800
of our drinks,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.120
it's not going
to cause any problems.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.800
&gt;&gt; You get a bubble,
but it won't release.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.020
Better than I thought.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.560
Okay.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.600
So you will see
that these bubbles

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.900
aren't forming nearly as large
as they are with a straight Dawn

00:07:16.912 --> 00:07:19.000
dish soap-sort of solution.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.300
So what we're going to do
instead is we're going to make

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.700
these bubbles even smaller

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.700
so that when you put them
on the top of the drink

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.000
filled with dried ice,
it's going to look really foamy,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.700
really frothy,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.100
and then when they pop,
you're going to get

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.600
that really cool smoke effect.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.400
So the way we're
going to do that,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.400
is just a small piece
of craft store mesh.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.200
In case you're wondering
about the bubbly taste,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.800
if you like,
stick your finger

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.592
in this and lick it,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.500
yeah, you can taste bubbles,
but I did feed a drink to

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.000
my roommate without telling him
what was in it,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.200
and he was fine.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.700
Nate, which drink
are you choosing?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.300
&gt;&gt; This is a strawberry pop,
is what it's called

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.000
and it's just got
a nice red color.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.140
So we're going to try that.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.460
All right.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.700
Well, let's add some dry ice.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.000
Same process.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.600
So we're controlling the flow
of the dry ice fog with the lid.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.900
So we're going to go
pretty slow here.

00:08:26.912 --> 00:08:28.500
So, let me dip it first.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.740
All right and go for it.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.680
How about that?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.140
Try and blow bubbles.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.440
Now we're just making a mess.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.500
&gt;&gt; It's what I'm good at--

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.980
&gt;&gt; But a cool mess.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.200
&gt;&gt; That's one heck of a fancy,
bubbly drink.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.300
&gt;&gt; So every single one of these
is actually an edible drink.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.900
We just wanted to find
the weirdest sodas possible.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.592
We've got blue-- Peach.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.100
Pete--

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.640
Oh, that's Peach flavor.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.540
This is--

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.220
That's a lemon lime.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.000
That's a lemon lime.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.600
This one is grape,
of all things.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.600
This was strawberry and this
is a homemade butter beer.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.300
This one is mine.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.500
&gt;&gt; Let's add bubbles.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.240
Yeah.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.620
Keep going, keep going.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.220
Next one!

00:10:07.242 --> 00:10:07.872
Oh, too far!

00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:09.060
Move it, move it, move it, move it--

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.600
They're going--

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.322
they're just-- at this point

00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:11.832
it's just becoming--

00:10:11.832 --> 00:10:12.852
&gt;&gt; It's bringing the cups closer.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.800
&gt;&gt;  I know, it's becoming one piece.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.500
Now, let's refill the ones
that have gone out.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.700
&gt;&gt; Go, go, go.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.920
&gt;&gt; All right, so we
have made some food-safe,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.200
carbon dioxide-filled bubbles,
and one more thing that

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.220
we want to try,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.880
is this chocolate-covered,
maple-smoked,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.000
bacon-flavored soda,
which sounds

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.240
like the worst thing ever,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.700
but maybe that's just
because I'm not Canadian.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.352
I don't know...

00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:08.632
So I'm going to try this,
so is Cali.

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:18.700
I would say that taste
like Tootsie Rolls mixed

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.700
with burnt peanut butter.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.062
Your turn.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.412
&gt;&gt;  What is in this?

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.820
Grant, you're Canadian,
maybe you'll like this stuff.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.420
&gt;&gt; Chocolate-covered,
maple-smoked, bacon soda.

00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:41.300
&gt;&gt; And, look at-- breakfast
in a bottle, it says.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:41.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.800
&gt;&gt; No, it's a health food.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.140
&gt;&gt; There's really nothing
more Canadian than that.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.900
How do you describe what
that taste like, honestly?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.100
I'm sticking with--

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.280
You know, it tastes
like chocolate-covered,

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.000
maple-smoked bacon.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.400
&gt;&gt; I didn't actually get
any bacon flavor in there.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.600
&gt;&gt; I wonder if anybody else
has ever tried this before

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.300
and can tell me what they taste.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.802
Like, is there a better
description for this?

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:10.600
&gt;&gt; Guys, that's all for now,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.900
but we've got more
for you to see.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.500
That box up at the top
will take you directly

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.500
to our most recent video,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.600
and you should go
check that out.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.600
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.400
you should be watching next
and if you aren't subscribed

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.540
to our channel yet,

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.800
just hit this bomb
to get in the club

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.400
and that way you'll never
miss out on a video.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.700
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.300
Talk to you then.
