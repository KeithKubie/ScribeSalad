00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:01.629
- [Voiceover] Where we
left off in the last video

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:05.600
we were in 1902, 1903,
and Mendelian genetics

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.316
had been rediscovered at
the turn of the century

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:12.055
and Boveri and Sutton,
independently, had proposed

00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:14.516
the chromosome theory,
that the chromosomes

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:18.138
were the location for where
these inheritable factors

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:20.344
that Mendel first talked
about, where they actually

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:21.807
were located.

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:23.032
But we talked about in that video

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:24.286
that that was just a theory.

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:27.351
This was based on some
observations of meiosis

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:28.999
and seeing how chromosomes behaved,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.413
and they seemed to
behave in analogous ways

00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:34.363
to some of these inheritable factors

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:38.241
but they really didn't
have good cellular proof

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:41.398
that chromosomes indeed were the location

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:43.000
for these inheritable factors.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.858
And we don't really start to get that

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:49.734
until we start looking at the
work of Thomas Hunt Morgan.

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:53.543
Now 1908, he decides to study fruit flies.

00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:55.354
So why does he wanna study fruit flies?

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:56.469
If you've ever seen a fruit fly,

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.607
they're very very very small.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:01.647
So you could actually put a
ton of fruit flies in one jar.

00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:03.366
So, that's convenient.

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.451
You oftentimes don't think
about the practical logistics

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.143
of science, but you could
put a lot in one jar.

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:11.790
They were actually cheap,
and that's another practical

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.228
concern of science, is you
don't always have a lot

00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:16.016
of resources to do your work.

00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:18.175
And they had short lives,
and they reproduced a lot

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:20.265
so you could very quickly
get many many offspring

00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:22.703
and many many generations
if you wanted to study

00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:25.419
how the different traits were passed on

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.323
or not passed on.

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.156
And so he spent some time,
he started this in 1908

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.408
working with the fruit flies.

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:35.264
And he kept breeding them,
in search for some type

00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:37.393
of a mutant trait.

00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:40.737
In general when you look
at traits in a species,

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:43.187
the wild type, let me write this down,

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:46.113
the wild type is the one
that's typically seen,

00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:50.501
while the mutant trait is
something that seems unusual.

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:54.681
And after two years he finally
discovers a mutant trait

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.538
in his fruit flies.

00:01:56.538 --> 00:01:58.976
He finds a white-eyed male.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:02.154
So this is the white-eyed
male right over here.

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.396
He says oh, okay, now this is interesting.

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:07.903
Let me take this white-eyed
male and begin to cross it

00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:12.361
with other, well, with the females.

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.334
And you say well how
does this actually occur?

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.190
Well, what you do is you
take a jar full of females

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.815
and you put the white-eyed male in there

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:21.695
and then the crossing happens.

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:24.690
And what was interesting
was the inheritance pattern

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.639
that he saw for this white-eyed trait.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.798
Because you have the
parent generation here,

00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:32.491
but then in the F1 generation

00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:35.463
all of the females were red-eyed

00:02:35.463 --> 00:02:37.832
and all of the males were red-eyed.

00:02:37.832 --> 00:02:40.409
And so just off of that first
generation it wasn't clear

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.963
that anything interesting was going on.

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:47.227
But then, when he crossed
these to each other,

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.629
and I know what some of
you all are thinking,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.694
wait, aren't they all brothers
and sisters being crossed

00:02:50.694 --> 00:02:51.785
to each other?

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.191
Ah, well, yeah, they were
probably half brothers and sisters

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.327
if they came from different mothers,

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:57.813
but some of them could have
been brothers and sisters,

00:02:57.813 --> 00:03:00.181
but yes, that's what
people are talking about

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:03.061
when they're crossing the F1 generation.

00:03:03.061 --> 00:03:05.661
But when they crossed
these with each other,

00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:07.588
he saw a pretty interesting pattern.

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:11.882
He saw a three to one ratio
of red eyes to white eyes,

00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:16.020
so for every four fruit
flies he would see,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.003
let me underline these, he
would see three red-eyed

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:24.534
and he would see one white-eyed.

00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:27.242
So the white-eyed, the white-eyed trait

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:29.958
makes a reappearance, which in
and of itself is interesting.

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.418
It shows that this can
be passed on genetically.

00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:35.949
And that's interesting
because this was a mutant

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.666
that just showed up after he
did many many many many many

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:42.102
generations of observations.

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:43.820
But what was even more
interesting about this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.137
three to one ratio, and that
three to one was something

00:03:46.137 --> 00:03:48.954
that popped up a lot
in Mendelian genetics,

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.624
but what was even more
interesting was that

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:55.363
he only observed, he only
observed the white eyes

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.962
in the males in this F2 generation,

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:03.907
in this second generation of
the crosses right over there.

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:06.644
And so you're thinking,
well, why is that a big deal?

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:08.989
Well, he was a pretty astute guy,

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.938
and he says well look, if I'm
only seeing it in the males,

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:13.821
and it's not like he only
got four offspring here

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:16.546
in the ratio, he may have
had hundreds of them,

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:20.840
but it was in the ratio
of two red-eyed females

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.043
for every one red-eyed male,
for every one white-eyed male.

00:04:25.043 --> 00:04:29.245
And so across these hundreds
of, in this generation,

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:32.589
he only observed the
white eyes on the males.

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.561
And he said, hm, maybe
this is in some way related

00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.647
to the chromosome that determines sex.

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:41.534
And so what he was able to do is say,

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:43.485
well, let's just assume that it is.

00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:47.571
Let's assume that that
trait, that mutant allele,

00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:50.868
that mutant variation of
the gene for eye color,

00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:55.367
let's assume it's carried
on the x chromosome.

00:04:55.367 --> 00:05:00.248
And so the genotype for
that first mutant fly,

00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:02.494
that white-eyed male that he found,

00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:04.267
we could call it, and this is the notation

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:09.027
that people typically use,
because this is a gene

00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:12.835
that we're assuming sits
on a, it's sex-linked,

00:05:12.835 --> 00:05:16.016
it sits on a sex chromosome,
in this case the x chromosome,

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:17.967
the way that you would
specify the genotype

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.415
of that white-eyed male is,
well on his x chromosome,

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:24.793
he had the white variation,
he had the white allele,

00:05:24.793 --> 00:05:26.697
the white variation of that gene,

00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:30.714
and then on his y chromosome
he had no variation

00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:31.480
for that gene.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.545
So we assume that it's
only contained on the,

00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:36.518
only on the x chromosome.

00:05:36.518 --> 00:05:38.910
You've probably heard of
heterozygous or homozygous,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.197
well this is a case
where you're hemizygous,

00:05:41.197 --> 00:05:43.240
you only have a version of the allele

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.493
on one of your two
chromosomes, one of the two

00:05:45.493 --> 00:05:48.186
that you've gotten from
each of your parents.

00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:50.206
So this would be the genotype right here

00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:52.690
of the white-eyed male.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.430
The genotype for the red-eyed female

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.703
is specified by, so it's
on the x chromosome,

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:01.537
and the females have two x chromosomes,

00:06:01.537 --> 00:06:04.253
just like in the situation for humans,

00:06:04.253 --> 00:06:06.993
so on each of the x chromosomes,

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:11.428
we assume that the females
start off with the red allele,

00:06:11.428 --> 00:06:15.840
and the red allele, the
notation is the w +, w +.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.999
And you might say, well why
don't we just use the letter r?

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:21.923
Well, we could have, but the
general convention in genetics

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.336
is to use to letter of the
first mutant type discovered

00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:28.842
for that gene, and then to
use this little plus type

00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:30.096
for the wild type.

00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:33.254
So the wild type is the
red eyes, and then w,

00:06:33.254 --> 00:06:35.715
which is the mutant
discovered for this gene,

00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:37.294
is the first mutant allele,

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:39.593
that we do so we name it after that white,

00:06:39.593 --> 00:06:43.401
so this is the white, the white allele,

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:46.489
and these right here, these
represent the red alleles.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.579
So these are the genotype
of the red-eyed female.

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:51.435
And so, when you cross
that first generation

00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:55.330
well, the white-eyed male, he can either,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.565
he'll either produce sperm
that have the x chromosome

00:06:58.565 --> 00:07:01.288
in it, which is going
to contain the allele,

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:03.331
or sperm which have
the y chromosome in it,

00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:05.630
which is not going to contain the allele,

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.102
and the red-eyed female, well
they produce eggs either way,

00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:10.259
either which of these x
chromosomes they contribute,

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.092
they're both going to
have the wild type allele.

00:07:13.092 --> 00:07:15.274
And we can see how this crosses.

00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:18.270
You could get an x from both parents.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.500
If you get an x from both parents

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.449
you're going to be female,
because you're going to be xx,

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.955
and each of these females,
since you've got one wild type

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:29.090
and one mutant type, and
the wild type turns out

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.201
to be dominant, they still
show, their phenotype

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:35.382
is still red eyes, they
still have red eyes.

00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:39.538
But now they are heterozygotes,
they are carrying

00:07:39.538 --> 00:07:41.257
the white allele.

00:07:41.257 --> 00:07:43.555
Now the male offspring right over here,

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:46.341
well, in order to be male,
they got the y chromosome

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.617
from their dad, so they're not able to get

00:07:48.617 --> 00:07:53.299
that white allele, and they
get the red, the wild type,

00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:54.002
from their mom.

00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:56.741
And you could see it here, and
this is why all of the males

00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.203
in that first generation were red.

00:07:59.203 --> 00:08:00.851
They only got one copy of the allele

00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:04.032
from their wild type mother.

00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:06.795
But then what was interesting
is the crosses that you see

00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:08.397
in that next generation.

00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:10.524
If you took these red-eyed females

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.336
that we already established,
that these are all

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:15.295
going to be heterozygotes,
and so you can see

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:20.251
they have the red allele and
they have the white allele.

00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:24.287
And you cross that with red-eyed males.

00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:25.773
You cross it with red-eyed males,

00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:27.468
what is going to happen?

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:30.232
Well, the females in this generation,

00:08:30.232 --> 00:08:32.391
in order to be female you
have to get an x from your mom

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.053
and your dad, and so they
get an x from their dad

00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:40.964
which has the wild type there,

00:08:40.964 --> 00:08:43.047
the dominant red allele,

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:45.207
and so regardless of which
one they got from their mom,

00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:48.132
they're still going to
be red-eyed females.

00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:49.920
Some of them might be homozygotes,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.079
some of them might be heterozygotes.

00:08:52.079 --> 00:08:54.564
But now we see something
interesting happening

00:08:54.564 --> 00:08:56.700
in the males.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.460
You could have heterozygote
male, male flies here,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.011
where they got the x from,
where they got the red x

00:09:06.011 --> 00:09:07.311
from their mom.

00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:10.701
Or you could get the
hemizygous white-eyed males,

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:14.300
where they got the white
allele, the white x,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.158
from their mom.

00:09:16.158 --> 00:09:19.832
And this is the exact observation

00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:22.033
that Morgan made.

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:24.230
So it was a very interesting
thing that he was able to see.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.457
He started breeding these
in 1908, he started breeding

00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:29.152
these flies in 1908.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.635
It wasn't until a couple of
years that he finally found

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:35.398
that first mutant white-eyed male

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:39.601
and it was in 1910 and
1911 that he publishes

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.481
these discoveries in Nature.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.873
And the reason why this is a big deal

00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:45.911
is he says, look, this is, my observations

00:09:45.911 --> 00:09:50.782
are completely consistent with
this eye trait, this gene,

00:09:50.782 --> 00:09:53.468
being on the x chromosome.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:56.022
So he was able to show a
direct linkage between,

00:09:56.022 --> 00:10:00.851
in this case, sex chromosomes
and these heritable factors

00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:02.825
that Mendel first talked about.

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:05.123
And he would go on and his
students that he worked with

00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:07.492
would go on to study this
for many many many many years

00:10:07.492 --> 00:10:10.766
and he actually ends up getting
a nobel prize for this work.

00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:13.297
And this is a big deal, because
he's finally able to draw

00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:16.222
pretty substantive connections
between these heritable

00:10:16.222 --> 00:10:20.796
factors Mendel, this
theory of Boveri and Sutton

00:10:20.796 --> 00:10:22.365
that maybe chromosomes
have something to do

00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:23.735
with these inheritable factors,

00:10:23.735 --> 00:10:25.337
and he's showing that
this is actually the case,

00:10:25.337 --> 00:10:28.727
these sex chromosomes
seem to carry the trait,

00:10:28.727 --> 00:10:32.048
or in this particular
case, the x sex chromosome

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:36.331
seems to carry the gene for eye color

00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:38.322
in these fruit flies.
