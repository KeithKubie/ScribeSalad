00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.876
Let's learn a little
bit about springs.

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:05.100
So let's say I have a spring.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.870
Let me draw the ground so that
we know what's going on with

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.490
the spring.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.280
So let me see, this
is the floor.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.830
That's the floor, and
I have a spring.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.680
It's along the floor.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.000
I'll use a thicker one, just
to show it's a spring.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.060
Let's say the spring looks
something like this.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.170
Whoops, I'm still using
the line tool.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.430
So the spring looks like this.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.299
This is my spring, my amazingly
drawn spring.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.170
Let's say at this end it's
attached to a wall.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.980
That's a wall.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.470
And so this is a spring when I
don't have any force acting on

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.880
it, this is just the natural
state of the spring.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.050
And we could call this, where it
just naturally rests, this

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.340
tip of the spring.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.640
And let's say that when I were
to apply a force of 5 Newtons

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.410
into the spring, it looks
something like this.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.210
Redraw everything.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.355
So when I apply a force of 5
Newtons-- I'll draw the wall

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:12.700
in magenta now.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.300
When I apply a force
of 5 Newtons, the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.550
spring looks like this.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.880
It compresses, right?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.060
We're all familiar with this.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.320
We sit on a bed every
day or a sofa.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.620
So let's say it compresses
to here.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.960
If this was the normal resting--
so this is where the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.000
spring was when I applied no
force, but when I applied 5

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.420
Newtons in that direction, let's
say that this distance

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.290
right here is 10 meters.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.940
And so a typical question that
you'll see, and we'll explain

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.759
how to do it, is a spring
compresses or elongates when

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.950
you apply a certain force
by some distance.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.010
How much will it compress when
you apply a different force?

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.615
So my question is how much will
it compress when I apply

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.260
a 10-Newton force?

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.480
So your intuition that it'll
compress more is correct, but

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.220
is it linear to how much
I compress it?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.150
Is it a square of how
much I compress it?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.175
How does it relate?

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:34.480
I think you probably
could guess.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.880
It's actually worth
an experiment.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.280
Or you could just keep
watching the video.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.020
So let's say I apply
a 10-Newton force.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.180
What will the spring
look like?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.740
Well, it'll be more
compressed.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.780
Drop my force to 10 Newtons.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.060
And if this was the natural
place where the spring would

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.580
rest, what is this distance?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.280
Well, it turns out that
it is linear.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.590
What do I mean by linear?

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.860
Well, it means that the more
the force-- it's equally

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.750
proportional to how much the
spring will compress.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.060
And it actually works
the other way.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.040
If you applied 5 Newtons in this
direction, to the right,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.670
you would have gone 10 meters
in this direction.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.940
So it goes whether you're
elongating the spring or

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.450
compressing the spring within
some reasonable tolerance.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.620
We've all had this experience.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.300
If you compress something too
much or you stretch it too

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.070
much, it doesn't really go back
to where it was before.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.430
But within some reasonable
tolerance, it's proportional.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.830
So what does that mean?

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.990
That means that the restoring
force of the spring is minus

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.840
some number, times the
displacement of the spring.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.040
So what does this mean?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.110
So in this example right here,
what was the displacement of

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.140
the spring?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.528
Well, if we take positive x to
the right and negative x to

00:03:56.528 --> 00:04:00.980
the left, the displacement
of the spring was what?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.010
The displacement, in this
example right here, x is equal

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.090
to minus 10, right?

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.180
Because I went 10 to the left.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.520
And so it says that the
restorative force is going to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.310
be equal to minus K times
how much it's

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.260
distorted times minus 10.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.470
So the minuses cancel out,
so it equals 10K.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.420
What's the restorative force
in this example?

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.210
Well, you might say, it's 5
Newtons, just because that's

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.550
the only force I've drawn here,
and you would be to some

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.160
degree correct.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.260
And actually, since we're doing
positive and negative,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.570
and this 5 Newton is to the
left, so to the negative

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.770
x-direction, actually, I should
call this minus 5

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.090
Newtons and I should call this
minus 10 Newtons, because

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.340
obviously, these are vectors and
we're going to the left.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.630
I picked the convention that
to the left means negative.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.980
So what's the restorative
force?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.820
Well, in this example-- and we
assume that K is a positive

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.500
number for our purposes.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.370
In this example, the restorative
force is a

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.660
positive number.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.310
So what is the restorative
force?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.970
So that's actually the force,
the counteracting force, of

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.030
the spring.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.680
That's what this formula
gives us.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.220
So if this spring is stationary
when I apply this

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.030
5-Newton force, that means that
there must be another

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.830
equal and opposite force that's

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.160
positive 5 Newtons, right?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.460
If there weren't, the spring
would keep compressing.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.240
And if the force was more than 5
Newtons, the spring would go

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.620
back this way.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.010
So the fact that I know that
when I apply a 5-Newton force

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.920
to the left, or a negative
5-Newton force, the spring is

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.130
no longer moving, it means that
there must be-- or no

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.830
longer accelerating, actually,
it means that there must be an

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.330
equal and opposite force to
the right, and that's the

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.650
restorative force.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.370
Another way to think about it is
if I were to let-- well, I

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.510
won't go in there now.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.990
So in this case, the restorative
force is 5

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.950
Newtons, so we can
solve for K.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.940
We could say 5 is
equal to 10K.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.110
Divide both sides by 10.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.380
You get K is equal to 1/2.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.610
So now we can use that
information to figure out what

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.750
is the displacement
when I apply a

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.050
negative 10-Newton force?

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.410
When I push the spring
in with 10 Newtons in

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.790
the leftward direction?

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.050
So first of all, what's the
restorative force here?

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.790
Well, if the spring is no longer
accelerating in either

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.710
direction, or the tip of
the spring is no longer

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.120
accelerating in either
direction, we know that the

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.540
restorative force must be
counterbalancing this force

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.290
that I'm compressing
with, right?

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.810
The force that the spring wants
to expand back with is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.030
10 Newtons, positive
10 Newtons, right?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.550
And we know the spring constant,
this K for this

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.780
spring, for this material,
whatever it might be, is 1/2.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:53.320
So we know the restorative force
is equal to 1/2 times

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.280
the distance, right?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.940
And the formula is
minus K, right?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.670
And then, what is
the restorative

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.340
force in this example?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.190
Well I said it's 10 Newtons, so
we know that 10 Newtons is

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.440
equal to minus 1/2x.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.750
And so what is x?

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.030
Well, multiply both sides
by minus 1/2, and

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.920
you get minus 20.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.455
I'm sorry, multiply both sides
by minus 2, you get minus 20

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:19.705
is equal to x.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.700
So x goes to the
left 20 units.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.390
So that's all that
it's telling us.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.710
And this law is called Hooke's
Law, and it's named after--

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.810
I'll read it-- a physicist in
the 17th century, a British

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.170
physicist. And he figured out
that the amount of force

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.460
necessary to keep a spring
compressed is proportional to

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.420
how much you've compressed it.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.570
And that's all that
this formula says.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.150
And that negative number,
remember, this formula gives

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.710
us the restorative force.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.910
So it says that the force is
always in the opposite

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.860
direction of how much
you displace it.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.470
So, for example, if you were
to displace this spring in

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.590
this direction, if you were to
apply a force and x were a

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.620
positive and you were to go in
that direction, the force-- no

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.150
wait, sorry.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.320
This is where the
spring rests.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.260
If you were to apply some force
and take the spring out

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.610
to here, this negative number
tells us that the spring will

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.610
essentially try to pull back
with the restorative force in

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.190
the other direction.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.750
Let's do one more problem
and I think this

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.570
will be clear to you.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.460
So let's say I have a spring,
and all of these problems kind

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.090
of go along.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.280
So let's say when I apply a
force of 2 Newtons, so this is

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.880
what I apply when I apply
a force of 2 Newtons.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.180
Well, let's say it this way.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.740
Let's say when I stretch
the spring.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:55.650
Let's say this is the spring,
and when I apply a force of 2

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:05.940
Newtons to the right, the spring
gets stretched 1 meter.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.280
So first of all, let's
figure out what K is.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.030
So if the spring is stretched
by 1 meter, out here, its

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.650
restorative force will be 2
Newtons back this way, right?

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.620
So its restorative force, this
2 Newtons, will equal minus K

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.530
times how much I displaced it.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.050
Well I, displaced it by 1 meter,
so then we multiply

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.380
both sides by negative 1, and we
get K is equal to minus 2.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.350
So then we can use Hooke's Law
to note the equation for

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.450
this-- to figure out the
restorative force for this

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.110
particular spring, and
it would be minus 2x.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.530
And then I said, well, how much
force would I have to

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.730
apply to distort the
spring by 2 meters?

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.420
Well, it's 2 times
2, it would be 4.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.330
4 Newtons to displace it by 2
meters, and, of course, the

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.580
restorative force will then be
in the opposite direction, and

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.620
that's where we get the
negative number.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.800
Anyway, I've run out of time.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.860
I'll see you in the
next video.
