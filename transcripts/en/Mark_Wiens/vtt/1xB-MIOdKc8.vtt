00:00:00.382 --> 00:00:04.299
- [Mark] Oh yeah, I'm
gonna need a lot of this.

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:11.065
Oh yeah, I could eat a lot of that sauce.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.199
(funky music)

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:19.415
Good morning everyone it's Mark Wiens

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:22.724
with Migrationology.com
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:24.808
Woke up this morning
and packed all the bags.

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:28.398
We are getting ready to
leave, but before we head out

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:32.676
we're gonna head downstairs
to have a quick breakfast.

00:00:32.676 --> 00:00:35.710
This is exactly what I am looking for.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.891
I could not leave Barcelona
without some more jamon,

00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:41.058
one last breakfast dosage.

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:45.860
Oh, this is a pile of the jamon,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.970
look at how beautiful it is.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.124
It's so good.

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:53.335
And then, these are some
other types of Iberico pork.

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.899
This one is particularly
good, it's very lean.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.851
This one, this type of
chorizo is also really good.

00:00:58.851 --> 00:00:59.684
- [Woman] Good morning.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.517
- [Mark] Good morning.

00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.784
(mellow Hispanic music)

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:14.732
It's just wonderful, and
I also like this chorizo.

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:22.534
Just a hint of a spice to it.

00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:28.646
(funky upbeat music)

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.516
That was a good breakfast and we just

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:36.046
checked out of Cotton House Hotel.

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:39.566
It's a really nice
boutique hotel in Barcelona

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.526
and it's in a really good location.

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:42.987
That was a very nice stay.

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:45.424
We're walking over to the metro
and heading to the airport.

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:48.507
(funky upbeat music)

00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:52.539
45 minutes later we have
arrived at the airport.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.471
It's about 8:30 am.

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.291
Barcelona has been fantastic.

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.865
This is really an amazing city to visit,

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.786
lots of delicious food and some amazing

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:02.995
architecture as well.

00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:05.333
And, I love the cafe culture here.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.040
But, we are catching a
flight with TAP Portugal

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.479
on our way to Lisbon.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.562
(funky upbeat music)

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.249
We are somewhere in the
sky and we are flying

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.508
across, just across the Iberian Peninsula

00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:29.449
from Barcelona to Lisbon, Portugal.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.032
And, they just served us a little snack.

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:33.408
I almost thought it was
a egg on the bottom,

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:37.575
but I think that's bread, a
little open faced sandwich.

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:51.436
I think there are two
layers of meat on here.

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.523
And then, with rocket on the top,

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:56.856
there's something sweet on the top, too.

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:02.923
I ate that whole sandwich
and I was thinking

00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:04.758
the whole time that it was turkey.

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:06.084
But now, that I think about it,

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:07.925
I think it was actually fish.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:11.008
(funky upbeat music)

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:25.539
I just woke up, got a good nap in.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.319
We should be landing in
Portugal in about 10 minutes.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.402
(funky upbeat music)

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.159
- [Man On PA] Landing is on
track here in just one minute

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.385
Alberto Delgado Airport.

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:46.245
Please remain seated with
your seat belt fastened

00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:49.511
until the seat fastened
sign is switched off.

00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:52.032
- That was about an hour and half flight.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.824
Welcome to Lisbon.

00:03:53.824 --> 00:03:56.907
(funky upbeat music)

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:03.924
Bus number one will go
to Avenida de Libertad.

00:04:03.924 --> 00:04:05.796
- [Woman] Yes, there's cab fare.

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:07.542
- We have decided to take
the bus into the city

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.558
because that's the most
direct, I think it will be

00:04:09.558 --> 00:04:10.960
the easiest way.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.082
And so, they have a stand outside.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:15.915
This is for Aerobus, we're
taking bus number one.

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:19.356
I got this long receipt
that is our ticket.

00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:22.439
(funky upbeat music)

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.862
That took a little while
because the traffic was heavy,

00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:41.009
but we just got off our bus
stop at Avenida de Libertad.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.328
And, our hotel should be
just across the street.

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:47.187
We are staying at the Fontecruz Lisboa,

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.896
which is another Hotel by Marriott.

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:53.479
And, this is in a very
lovely area of town.

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:55.938
Looks like a shopping street with a lot of

00:04:55.938 --> 00:04:57.803
high end designer brands.

00:04:57.803 --> 00:04:59.797
We checked in, but our room is not ready.

00:04:59.797 --> 00:05:02.120
They said it's gonna be
ready in about an hour

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.121
so we're gonna hang out for a little bit

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.484
and do some research.

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:08.231
As we are waiting for our
room to finish being cleaned

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:12.295
we decided to take, they
offered us this welcome

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:14.617
plate of fruit and so we
decided to eat it now.

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:16.799
I think it's supposed to
be served in the room,

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.582
but I think this is a good
time to eat it right now.

00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:22.915
Our mango, orange, kiwi, and well, kiwi.

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:32.928
I don't think I've had a
mango yet on this trip.

00:05:32.928 --> 00:05:35.011
Mmm, that's a good mango.

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:37.940
Which one is it?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.511
(mumbles)

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:40.428
Zero, five.

00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:43.616
(mumbles)

00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:44.449
Yeah.

00:05:47.253 --> 00:05:50.086
It's a little bit of a dark theme.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.716
- [Woman] And with that
it's back to training.

00:05:53.716 --> 00:05:56.539
- Okay, welcome to our hotel in Lisbon.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.271
Before we do anything else let me give you

00:05:58.271 --> 00:06:00.561
a quick tour of the hotel room.

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.651
This is the bathroom,
everything is kind of

00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:06.401
a dark theme, toilet,

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.785
oh and a chest.

00:06:10.882 --> 00:06:13.334
And then, out to the main bedroom.

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:15.637
It's a pretty spacious room.

00:06:15.637 --> 00:06:18.561
Kind of has an antique feel to it,

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:19.978
but a dark theme.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.808
A relax chair, whoa,

00:06:24.372 --> 00:06:25.955
a full body mirror.

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.865
We are off now to walk around and explore

00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.856
and hopefully find something to eat.

00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:35.229
But, I wanted to just quickly share that

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.414
this is my first time to be in Portugal

00:06:37.414 --> 00:06:38.716
and I'm really excited to be here

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:40.851
because I've been to a lot of countries

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.101
from Kenya and the east coast of Africa

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:48.816
to Sri Lanka to even
Thailand that have been,

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:52.907
oh that's a really loud motorcycle,

00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:55.226
but I've been to so many
countries that have been

00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:57.696
influenced by Portugal.

00:06:57.696 --> 00:07:01.538
And also, the Portuguese are responsible

00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:03.538
for distributing and for

00:07:05.463 --> 00:07:08.339
bringing chilies from
South America to Asia.

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:10.997
Chilies being one of my
favorite foods in the world

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.894
so I'm excited to be here.

00:07:12.894 --> 00:07:15.464
This tree lined avenue
is absolutely beautiful.

00:07:15.464 --> 00:07:18.547
(funky upbeat music)

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.352
Ying and I were both
very hungry so we came

00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:32.006
to this restaurant that's
very close to our hotel

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:34.492
and it's also very close
to a couple of attractions

00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:36.327
that I wanna visit this afternoon.

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:38.945
So, we are stopping here for a quick lunch

00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:42.278
and this restaurant is called Bonjardim.

00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:48.161
Okay.

00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:49.115
- [Waiter] And, pedi a pedi Okay.

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:52.056
- [Mark] Pedi a pedi okay.

00:07:52.056 --> 00:07:53.389
Okay, thank you.

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:57.030
Ying and I decided to
each get a half a chicken

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.352
and so we got the
chicken, we got some rice,

00:07:59.352 --> 00:08:03.992
and I also ordered a vegetable
spinach dish, as well.

00:08:03.992 --> 00:08:06.409
I'll put this half a chicken,

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:11.514
put this onto my plate.

00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:12.347
Oh yeah.

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:17.282
And, okay I just gotta taste this.

00:08:17.282 --> 00:08:20.199
Let me just taste this immediately.

00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:37.173
That is salty, a little bit
oily and then the chicken

00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:38.938
is really, really soft.

00:08:38.938 --> 00:08:41.720
But, what I really wanna
try here is the pedi a pedi

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.946
chili and this is quite
a like a oily chili sauce

00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:48.041
with a little paint brush in it.

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:50.624
And, add on some of that sauce,

00:08:51.644 --> 00:08:55.477
I'm not sure if, are you
supposed to touch it?

00:08:56.815 --> 00:08:59.565
(cutlery clinks)

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:11.993
Just a little bit spicy but it has a sour

00:09:11.993 --> 00:09:13.584
chili oil flavor to it.

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:16.985
I'm going to need a lot of this.

00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:19.208
And, I wanna scoop out those seeds,

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.375
the seeds from the bottom.

00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:30.326
Oh yeah, I could eat a lot of that sauce.

00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:39.140
And then, this is come
kind of a rice fried with

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.304
I think it's chicken,
something from the chicken.

00:09:42.304 --> 00:09:44.985
Maybe could it be the gizzard and liver

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.818
maybe fried with rice?

00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:53.667
Oh, that's a good, that's
a nice ratio though.

00:09:55.085 --> 00:09:56.888
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what it is.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:10:01.055
I saw it in, it said "Arroz
Brasilerio" I think on the menu.

00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:10.491
Yeah, I think that's rice fried with liver

00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:13.178
and maybe some other
organs, mostly liver I think

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:15.595
that gives the rice a creamy,

00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:19.115
iron-y component to it.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.474
And, also got some creamed spinach.

00:10:23.474 --> 00:10:25.055
And, this is the dish that
I just saw on the menu

00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:26.525
and I wanted to try.

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:30.633
Whoa, that is very pasty, whoa very pasty.

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:32.550
It's almost like dough.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.763
Wow, that's very sticky and like,

00:10:43.582 --> 00:10:46.544
its like a sticky whipped
cream almost of spinach.

00:10:46.544 --> 00:10:49.133
And, it's very thick and dense.

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.906
You can taste the green spinach flavor.

00:10:50.906 --> 00:10:52.725
It's a little bit salty, but it's mostly

00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:55.578
just all about that
spinach and then a really

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:59.401
yeah like doughy, sticky texture to it.

00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:01.773
Wow, this could be filling because

00:11:01.773 --> 00:11:03.690
it's so densely sticky.

00:11:10.998 --> 00:11:13.478
I think it's all right
to just brush you chicken

00:11:13.478 --> 00:11:15.061
with the pedi pedi.

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:26.982
(funky upbeat music)

00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:31.846
We finished with that
lunch, the chicken was good.

00:11:31.846 --> 00:11:34.921
Felt great to eat an entire
half of chicken as well,

00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:37.911
get that protein in the system.

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:39.346
We were both really hungry.

00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:42.254
And, nice to sit out
here it's a great day.

00:11:42.254 --> 00:11:45.453
The breeze in Lisbon is fantastic.

00:11:45.453 --> 00:11:49.047
And also, I'm liking these
cobblestone streets in Lisbon.

00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:50.568
Actually, I'm not sure
what type of stone they are

00:11:50.568 --> 00:11:53.485
but they are so silky and so smooth

00:11:54.427 --> 00:11:56.760
you can actually just scoot,

00:11:57.847 --> 00:11:59.341
and you slide as well.

00:11:59.341 --> 00:12:00.800
Right across from where we ate lunch

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.488
we are walking now over
to Ascensor da Gloria.

00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:07.571
(funky upbeat music)

00:12:12.242 --> 00:12:14.623
This is a Lisbon historical landmark

00:12:14.623 --> 00:12:19.596
and originally the Gloria
Funicular opened in 1885,

00:12:19.596 --> 00:12:23.541
but back then it worked
on, it was powered by

00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:25.479
a water counter weight system.

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:28.238
And so, what's really awesome
is that the Gloria Funicular

00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:30.686
is still open to the public for rides.

00:12:30.686 --> 00:12:34.853
And, we are boarding now and
about to head up the hill.

00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:41.344
We waited until the tram was pretty full.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.590
It's pretty stuffed
right now and we are on

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.590
our way now up the hill.

00:12:50.088 --> 00:12:53.171
(funky upbeat music)

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.736
That was a short, just
about three minute ride

00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:20.766
but I think it's more about the history

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:23.633
of this funicular than
the actual transportation.

00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:26.804
And, there were some nice
views of some beautiful

00:13:26.804 --> 00:13:29.721
painted murals on the wall as well.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.636
Okay, that was fun.

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:36.664
From the top of the
funicular there is a park

00:13:36.664 --> 00:13:40.144
with a viewpoint, so gonna get a good,

00:13:40.144 --> 00:13:43.407
hopefully a good panoramic
view of Lisbon from here.

00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:46.490
(funky upbeat music)

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.962
A cool breeze, great views of Lisbon

00:13:58.962 --> 00:14:01.181
and I'm glad we came here on our first day

00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:04.503
actually just a couple hours
after we landed in Lisbon.

00:14:04.503 --> 00:14:06.856
This gives me a good idea of the city

00:14:06.856 --> 00:14:07.836
and some of the landmarks.

00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:10.667
I can see the castle in the distance,

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.417
the ocean, yeah a nice viewpoint,

00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:16.011
nice place to just hang out.

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:19.094
(funky upbeat music)

00:14:30.926 --> 00:14:31.759
Ah.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.093
No.
(Portuguese folk music)

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.798
Yes, hi I'm going on.

00:14:46.798 --> 00:14:50.131
(Portuguese folk music)

00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:04.272
I am just stepping into
the church and it is

00:15:04.272 --> 00:15:06.356
elaborate on the inside.

00:15:06.356 --> 00:15:10.277
There is the main sanctuary,
which is a huge open space

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.155
but then on the sides there are all sorts

00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:14.989
of different chapels and altars.

00:15:14.989 --> 00:15:17.045
And then, you look up at that ceiling,

00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:20.694
it is decorated and painted with a mural.

00:15:20.694 --> 00:15:22.764
And then, while I'm walking on the floor

00:15:22.764 --> 00:15:25.201
it is ancient looking marble.

00:15:25.201 --> 00:15:28.245
The fourth chapel on the left hand side

00:15:28.245 --> 00:15:30.607
is considered to be one
of the most expensive

00:15:30.607 --> 00:15:32.245
chapels in the world.

00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:36.304
It includes gold and
silver and lapis lazuli

00:15:36.304 --> 00:15:39.097
and it was actually designed in Rome.

00:15:39.097 --> 00:15:42.306
And then, in the back is
a Baroque style painting.

00:15:42.306 --> 00:15:43.920
Just spent a few minutes walking around

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.498
Igreja de Sao Roque and this is a church,

00:15:47.498 --> 00:15:49.851
a Jesuit church in Lisbon that dates back

00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:51.417
to the 16th century.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:54.860
It's known to have a very
simple facade on the outside

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.308
and look very simple on the outside,

00:15:56.308 --> 00:15:59.466
but when you step inside
it's just full of gold.

00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:02.609
It's elaborate, and it's
known for it's riches.

00:16:02.609 --> 00:16:05.192
(tribal music)

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.914
Oh, look at that fish.

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:24.513
Oh, and there's lobster
in the window there, too.

00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:28.277
Oh, I need to eat some
seafood very soon in Lisbon.

00:16:28.277 --> 00:16:31.110
But, this is just an amazing city.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.018
It has a wonderful artistic feel to it.

00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:37.380
And, I'm loving the wind
and the views of the city.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.163
We are in an area of town
now called Bairro Alto.

00:16:40.163 --> 00:16:42.201
So, I think we're just
gonna walk around this area.

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:45.110
This is a fantastic area of Lisbon.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.439
And, although it hasn't
been very long since lunch

00:16:48.439 --> 00:16:50.366
I think we might try to have dinner

00:16:50.366 --> 00:16:52.072
and then head back to the hotel.

00:16:52.072 --> 00:16:55.155
(funky upbeat music)

00:16:59.614 --> 00:17:01.212
We're just walking around leisurely,

00:17:01.212 --> 00:17:02.643
not really looking for anything,

00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:05.752
but I just found a cafe
that I wanted to check out

00:17:05.752 --> 00:17:08.178
so I think now would be a perfect time

00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:10.678
to have a quick cup of coffee.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.592
(indistinct chatter)

00:17:15.592 --> 00:17:17.897
I don't know if I should
feel the need to sit down.

00:17:17.897 --> 00:17:19.868
I was originally just
gonna stand at the bar

00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:21.438
and just have a quick cup of coffee,

00:17:21.438 --> 00:17:24.714
but we decided to sit at this empty table.

00:17:24.714 --> 00:17:28.979
This is a real legendary, a
historic coffee shop in Lisbon.

00:17:28.979 --> 00:17:30.645
As soon as I could get the
attention of the waiter

00:17:30.645 --> 00:17:32.645
I just ordered a coffee.

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:39.623
Hey, that is good coffee.

00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:41.456
Mm, strong but smooth,

00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:45.952
not too thick.

00:17:50.915 --> 00:17:53.415
I might have to have one more.

00:17:55.298 --> 00:17:56.958
These wooden chairs and tables are

00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.876
absolute classics as well, and the mirrors

00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:03.793
on the walls, the
decorations, the chandeliers.

00:18:06.036 --> 00:18:08.786
Okay, I had to order another one.

00:18:15.306 --> 00:18:19.644
Oh that's hot, really hot,
right out of the machine.

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:20.811
Oh, wonderful.

00:18:21.837 --> 00:18:24.920
(indistinct chatter)

00:18:28.152 --> 00:18:32.220
Those were two, well spent
Euros, two good cups of coffee.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.677
This is a legendary, classic place.

00:18:34.677 --> 00:18:37.760
(funky upbeat music)

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:53.798
It's a shower head.

00:18:54.638 --> 00:18:56.678
- [Woman] The dishes come
one by one to the table,

00:18:56.678 --> 00:19:01.543
and for two people I recommend
three dishes to share.

00:19:01.543 --> 00:19:05.603
So, today we have house
dish is good mackerel tartar

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.185
with ginger, citrus,
(mumbles) tartar sauce

00:19:09.185 --> 00:19:11.071
very fresh (mumbles).

00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:13.462
If you like raw fish or sushi
we'll definitely try this one.

00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:15.520
- We came to a restaurant
which is right in this area.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.057
It's called Taberna da Rua das Flores

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.217
and this restaurant I didn't realize

00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:24.368
at lunch time they serve
more of a Portuguese menu

00:19:24.368 --> 00:19:27.304
and then at dinner it's kind of a modern

00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:30.418
kind of modern style Portuguese food,

00:19:30.418 --> 00:19:33.669
but it's really cozy little restaurant.

00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:37.357
It's very friendly service
and you sense the passion

00:19:37.357 --> 00:19:39.044
of the food in this place.

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:40.987
And so, they just have a daily set menu

00:19:40.987 --> 00:19:43.656
which is according to season and according

00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:46.367
to what ingredients are available.

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:48.781
Starting off with some
olives and I've already

00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:50.531
had a couple of them.

00:19:51.777 --> 00:19:55.910
Those are fantastic olives, salty and sour

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.823
and have a fantastic
texture to them as well.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.298
They're like a little bit silkier

00:20:01.298 --> 00:20:03.105
than other olives I've had.

00:20:03.105 --> 00:20:05.580
The lighting in here is pretty dim

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.334
so I'm going to have to use my cellphone

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:12.178
to light up the food when I take a bite.

00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:14.770
The first dish that we
got this one is a ceviche

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.833
of I think the fish is cr-oo-k,

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:20.910
with I'm not sure what's on
top, some kind of pickles

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.515
and then surrounded by sweet potato chips.

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.444
This looks fantastic.

00:20:24.444 --> 00:20:27.382
Oh, oh no some of the chips just slid off.

00:20:27.382 --> 00:20:29.243
Let me take a piece of the fish

00:20:29.243 --> 00:20:33.410
and try to get some of that
pickle at the same time.

00:20:36.081 --> 00:20:41.004
It's sour, those cubes of
raw fish are just slightly

00:20:41.004 --> 00:20:44.555
cooked on the edges from that acidity.

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:47.537
And then, it has just a very light garnish

00:20:47.537 --> 00:20:49.037
of cilantro maybe.

00:20:50.409 --> 00:20:52.742
Oh man, yeah I love ceviche,

00:20:54.398 --> 00:20:58.565
is just, or any type of fish
or raw fish is fantastic.

00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:02.492
You can taste the freshness of the fish

00:21:02.492 --> 00:21:06.975
and the quality and just how
beautiful the dish is as well.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:11.142
I'm gonna grab some of these
little chips on the side.

00:21:15.426 --> 00:21:16.665
They're crispy but they've soaked up

00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:18.748
some of that lemon juice.

00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:25.384
The next dish we have is
marlin and this has been,

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.355
I think, pan seared.

00:21:27.355 --> 00:21:32.098
And then, it looks like
Thai sweet and sour sauce.

00:21:32.098 --> 00:21:36.633
I think it's just seared on
the inside and a little bit

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:38.767
it might be a little
bit pink on the inside

00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:42.517
which is why you need
to cut it with a knife.

00:21:48.138 --> 00:21:51.207
And, that fish is extraordinary.

00:21:51.207 --> 00:21:53.040
It's soft and buttery.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.979
You can taste the different textures.

00:21:55.979 --> 00:21:59.333
In the middle it's raw, but
then on the outside edges

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:04.286
it is cooked and it almost
has a chicken breast texture

00:22:04.286 --> 00:22:08.205
to it on the inside, but
buttery all the way through.

00:22:08.205 --> 00:22:10.224
They suggested that we have three dishes

00:22:10.224 --> 00:22:12.306
between the two of us and
then they should be served

00:22:12.306 --> 00:22:13.514
one dish by one dish.

00:22:13.514 --> 00:22:15.362
So, we've had two dishes so far

00:22:15.362 --> 00:22:18.097
and now we are on our third dish.

00:22:18.097 --> 00:22:21.613
This is black pork and
they're little cubes

00:22:21.613 --> 00:22:24.942
of pork which look
marvelous, little nuggets,

00:22:24.942 --> 00:22:27.355
glistening nuggets and
then there are onions

00:22:27.355 --> 00:22:30.634
on top and some cilantro
and a lemon wedge on top.

00:22:30.634 --> 00:22:34.051
Let me just taste that piece right there.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:39.438
It looks kind of crispy
and soft at the same time.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.303
Wow.

00:22:47.285 --> 00:22:50.109
Oh yeah, that is exactly correct.

00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:53.582
It is crispy and soft at the same time.

00:22:53.582 --> 00:22:55.902
Crispy on the edges, it's salty

00:22:55.902 --> 00:22:59.172
and then because it is quite well marbled

00:22:59.172 --> 00:23:02.566
with some fat mixed in it is so juicy.

00:23:02.566 --> 00:23:04.393
And just when you bite down you get

00:23:04.393 --> 00:23:07.848
that crispy caramelized pork edge

00:23:07.848 --> 00:23:10.448
and then just that fatty juice.

00:23:10.448 --> 00:23:12.403
Wow, that's insane.

00:23:12.403 --> 00:23:15.267
Then, I love it with those
red onions, the cilantro.

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:18.850
I'm gonna squeeze on
a little bit of lemon.

00:23:25.247 --> 00:23:28.330
Wow, that is a treat, a treat indeed.

00:23:32.753 --> 00:23:34.234
That is insane.

00:23:34.234 --> 00:23:36.072
Ying and I just finished with dinner

00:23:36.072 --> 00:23:38.707
and I have to tell you
that when I was going to

00:23:38.707 --> 00:23:41.097
this restaurant I was hoping to have

00:23:41.097 --> 00:23:42.888
an authentic Portuguese dinner.

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:45.173
But, when got here then they said

00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:47.293
that at lunch time they
serve Portuguese dishes

00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:49.864
but at dinner time they
serve Portuguese ingredients

00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:53.377
but with a modern twist and it turned out

00:23:53.377 --> 00:23:56.197
to be an exceptionally good meal.

00:23:56.197 --> 00:23:58.295
The ingredients were incredible.

00:23:58.295 --> 00:23:59.919
The different dishes
that they put together

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:04.132
were simple but the ingredients
were outrageously good,

00:24:04.132 --> 00:24:08.123
delicious food that was
kind of a trendy meal.

00:24:08.123 --> 00:24:09.791
But, it was really, really good.

00:24:09.791 --> 00:24:11.548
So, if you come for
lunch you can get more of

00:24:11.548 --> 00:24:15.635
the Portuguese dishes but
at dinner it's a special

00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:19.207
seasonal menu of the
ingredients they have.

00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:22.212
I think this is the perfect
place to end today's volg.

00:24:22.212 --> 00:24:23.504
Thank you all for watching.

00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:24.991
