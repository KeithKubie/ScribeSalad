00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.879
You know what keeps us at night?

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.269
In 20 years the earth will have nearly
9 billion people and not enough food.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.189
So at Carnegie Mellon University

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.039
we're growing food
in a whole new way.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.479
Using artificial intelligence
we analyze plants,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.329
improve sustainable growth
and get solutions to farmers.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.109
And thanks to a team
of really smart robots,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.220
we keep the momentum growing.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.679
There's work to be done worldwide.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.490
We do the work that matters.
