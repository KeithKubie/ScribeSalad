00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.450
also from the lower Criminal Court and
the Supreme Criminal Court because

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:30.460
the Supreme Criminal Court because
 

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.290
the Supreme Criminal Court because
criminal cases could be heard in either

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:32.300
criminal cases could be heard in either
 

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.810
criminal cases could be heard in either
one and and only two of those cases

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:34.820
one and and only two of those cases
 

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.090
one and and only two of those cases
courts rather have all of the records

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.100
courts rather have all of the records
 

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.240
courts rather have all of the records
online so that was certainly very

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.250
online so that was certainly very
 

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.280
online so that was certainly very
labor-intensive and you know when I

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:42.290
labor-intensive and you know when I
 

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.520
labor-intensive and you know when I
started out I had you know but my you

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:45.530
started out I had you know but my you
 

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.530
started out I had you know but my you
know initial question was just whether

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:47.540
know initial question was just whether
 

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.420
know initial question was just whether
it was systemic or an anomaly for these

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.430
it was systemic or an anomaly for these
 

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.850
it was systemic or an anomaly for these
civil cases to be based on criminal

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:51.860
civil cases to be based on criminal
 

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.530
civil cases to be based on criminal
charges that have been thrown out but

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:53.540
charges that have been thrown out but
 

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.960
charges that have been thrown out but
then you know as I started you know

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:55.970
then you know as I started you know
 

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.610
then you know as I started you know
going through the cases and doing some

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:57.620
going through the cases and doing some
 

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.940
going through the cases and doing some
of you know reporting I just noticed all

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:00.950
of you know reporting I just noticed all
 

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.940
of you know reporting I just noticed all
of these other things I initially wasn't

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:03.950
of these other things I initially wasn't
 

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:08.170
of these other things I initially wasn't
even aware that the law gave the NYPD

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:08.180
even aware that the law gave the NYPD
 

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.630
even aware that the law gave the NYPD
the authority to you know sweep down

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:10.640
the authority to you know sweep down
 

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.690
the authority to you know sweep down
without notice and and serve people with

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:13.700
without notice and and serve people with
 

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.060
without notice and and serve people with
an order that immediately closed down

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.070
an order that immediately closed down
 

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.500
an order that immediately closed down
their business or home before they'd

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:17.510
their business or home before they'd
 

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.450
their business or home before they'd
even gotten a chance to appear in court

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:19.460
even gotten a chance to appear in court
 

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.310
even gotten a chance to appear in court
to defend themselves that wasn't

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320
to defend themselves that wasn't
 

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.230
to defend themselves that wasn't
something I really learned about until

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240
something I really learned about until
 

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.550
something I really learned about until
you know sort of deeper into my

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560
you know sort of deeper into my
 

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.500
you know sort of deeper into my
reporting so so the I think that the the

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:29.510
reporting so so the I think that the the
 

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.540
reporting so so the I think that the the
data the data entry and the data

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:31.550
data the data entry and the data
 

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.550
data the data entry and the data
analysis was a very important component

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560
analysis was a very important component
 

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.670
analysis was a very important component
of it but I also think that the

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680
of it but I also think that the
 

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.380
of it but I also think that the
extensive Street reporting field

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:38.390
extensive Street reporting field
 

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.610
extensive Street reporting field
reporting that I did was very important

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:42.620
reporting that I did was very important
 

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.610
reporting that I did was very important
we none of the people that were in the

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:44.620
we none of the people that were in the
 

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.520
we none of the people that were in the
series were people who were you know

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.530
series were people who were you know
 

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.950
series were people who were you know
passed on to me from a lawyer or an

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:50.960
passed on to me from a lawyer or an
 

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.800
passed on to me from a lawyer or an
advocate they were all people that you

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:53.810
advocate they were all people that you
 

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.720
advocate they were all people that you
know we found by going out into the

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:55.730
know we found by going out into the
 

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.210
know we found by going out into the
field and just knocking on doors

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:57.220
field and just knocking on doors
 

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.970
field and just knocking on doors
actually I mapped the cases because we

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:00.980
actually I mapped the cases because we
 

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.120
actually I mapped the cases because we
tracked the address and I geo coded the

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.130
tracked the address and I geo coded the
 

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.580
tracked the address and I geo coded the
addresses and then I just you know from

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:06.590
addresses and then I just you know from
 

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.260
addresses and then I just you know from
the map of my phone went to different

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:08.270
the map of my phone went to different
 

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.300
the map of my phone went to different
neighborhoods rather and and knocked on

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.310
neighborhoods rather and and knocked on
 

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.050
neighborhoods rather and and knocked on
doors and then I also did a lot of you

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.060
doors and then I also did a lot of you
 

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.360
doors and then I also did a lot of you
know course interviews with you know

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:16.370
know course interviews with you know
 

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.680
know course interviews with you know
officials and and went through

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.690
officials and and went through
 

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.000
officials and and went through
historical archives I think that the

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.010
historical archives I think that the
 

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.840
historical archives I think that the
history of the law is really

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:23.850
history of the law is really
 

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.069
history of the law is really
and so so yeah I mean it was I think

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079
and so so yeah I mean it was I think
 

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:29.569
and so so yeah I mean it was I think
that sort of all the elements of

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579
that sort of all the elements of
 

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:32.360
that sort of all the elements of
reporting kind of tied together the data

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.370
reporting kind of tied together the data
 

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.550
reporting kind of tied together the data
the shoe-leather reporting and then sort

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560
the shoe-leather reporting and then sort
 

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.139
the shoe-leather reporting and then sort
of the more traditional investigative

00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:36.149
of the more traditional investigative
 

00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:38.240
of the more traditional investigative
reporting with the you know documents

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.250

I actually i quantify did at one point
 

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.269
I actually i quantify did at one point
I'd have to look back at the emails but

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279
I'd have to look back at the emails but
 

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.129
I'd have to look back at the emails but
I think for about eight months I

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139
I think for about eight months I
 

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:27.439
I think for about eight months I
followed up with him on that one sending

00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:27.449
followed up with him on that one sending
 

00:15:27.449 --> 00:15:29.449
followed up with him on that one sending
them emails calling sometimes I would

00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459
them emails calling sometimes I would
 

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:31.879
them emails calling sometimes I would
corner people from the press office of

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:31.889
corner people from the press office of
 

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.790
corner people from the press office of
the law department at events and then

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800
the law department at events and then
 

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.710
the law department at events and then

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720
finally they relented and and they did
 

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.420
finally they relented and and they did
sit down with me for an hour and I

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:38.430
sit down with me for an hour and I
 

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.400
sit down with me for an hour and I
talked with them about my findings at

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.410
talked with them about my findings at
 

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.769
talked with them about my findings at
that point and it was all on the record

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779
that point and it was all on the record
 

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.689
that point and it was all on the record
which I think really added to this story

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699
which I think really added to this story
 

00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:47.960
which I think really added to this story
and then I did sort of a second analysis

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:47.970
and then I did sort of a second analysis
 

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.910
and then I did sort of a second analysis
you know after a party with ProPublica

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920
you know after a party with ProPublica
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.280
you know after a party with ProPublica
where I had added of a bunch of

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:52.290
where I had added of a bunch of
 

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.790
where I had added of a bunch of
different factors into the into the

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800
different factors into the into the
 

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.490
different factors into the into the
database you know that we were building

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:57.500
database you know that we were building
 

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.050
database you know that we were building
and and so for about five months there I

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.060
and and so for about five months there I
 

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.309
and and so for about five months there I
had to pass them for another interview

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319
had to pass them for another interview
 

00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:06.620
had to pass them for another interview
and and they gave another hour-long

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:06.630
and and they gave another hour-long
 

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.079
and and they gave another hour-long
interview but aside from that they

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:09.089
interview but aside from that they
 

00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:11.150
interview but aside from that they
pretty much didn't answer any of my

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160
pretty much didn't answer any of my
 

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.360
pretty much didn't answer any of my
follow-up questions even you know my

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.370
follow-up questions even you know my
 

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.420
follow-up questions even you know my
editor my editor chief at one point even

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.430
editor my editor chief at one point even
 

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.230
editor my editor chief at one point even
got involved so let's let's talk about

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240
got involved so let's let's talk about
 

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.759
got involved so let's let's talk about
interviewing because this is something I

00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:22.769
interviewing because this is something I
 

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:25.100
interviewing because this is something I
know our students are grappling with at

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.110

initially when I started doing projects
 

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.900
initially when I started doing projects
and data projects I did it mostly on my

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:27.910
and data projects I did it mostly on my
 

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.140
and data projects I did it mostly on my
own time you know 11:00 12:00 at night I

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.150
own time you know 11:00 12:00 at night I
 

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.540
own time you know 11:00 12:00 at night I
would be at the office and just kind of

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:33.550
would be at the office and just kind of
 

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.510
would be at the office and just kind of
showing them that this is what they want

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520
showing them that this is what they want
 

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.010

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:40.870
investigations and I think that's really
 

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.750
investigations and I think that's really
important to remember because a lot of

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.130

right off the bat but it was something
 

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.990
right off the bat but it was something
that I found through records you know

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000
that I found through records you know
 

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.540

her son's interactions with the police
but I think that that for me gave a

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:15.420
but I think that that for me gave a
 

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.800
but I think that that for me gave a
story more credibility because I think

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:18.810
story more credibility because I think
 

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.150
story more credibility because I think
that you know people know that

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:20.160
that you know people know that
 

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.010

importantly it forced people to ask the
sort of a essential question of you know

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:27.150
sort of a essential question of you know
 

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:32.000
sort of a essential question of you know
is this right is do we want to say that

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.010
is this right is do we want to say that
 

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.700

taking an entire family out of their
 

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.500
taking an entire family out of their
home is a reasonable penalty for someone

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:39.510
home is a reasonable penalty for someone
 

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.900
home is a reasonable penalty for someone
who was you know found to have a small

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:41.910

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.240
who was you know found to have a small
amount of drugs in their home you know

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:44.250
amount of drugs in their home you know
 

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.700
amount of drugs in their home you know
of course it's not a reasonable penalty

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:45.710
of course it's not a reasonable penalty
 

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.640
of course it's not a reasonable penalty
the the penalty that the face and in the

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:49.650
the the penalty that the face and in the
 

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.200
the the penalty that the face and in the
civil course is far more severe than

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:51.210
civil course is far more severe than
 

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.250
civil course is far more severe than
anything that they would face in the

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260
anything that they would face in the
 

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.510
anything that they would face in the
criminal courts for that same offense

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520
criminal courts for that same offense
 

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.540
criminal courts for that same offense
and obviously it's not a penalty that

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:56.550
and obviously it's not a penalty that
 

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.640
