[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.710
SPEAKER: I am very,
very happy to be hosting

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.470
one of the best chefs,
not only in Latin America,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.030
but in the world.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.760
She's a creative force.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.900
She's a successful
entrepreneur, author,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.500
and she's definitely
a passionate feminist.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.032
So if you will welcome me in--

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:30.240
join me in welcoming Martha
Ortiz, Chef Martha Ortiz.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.950
MARTHA ORTIZ:
[INAUDIBLE] thank you.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.290
Thank you.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.140
Thank you.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.900
SPEAKER: Well, Martha, thank
you very much for being here.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.640
I'll start with just doing
a little bit of context.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.320
I know that Martha is
incredibly successful.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.040
She has a restaurant in
Mexico City that has twice

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.270
been named in the San Pellegrino
list of the World's 50 Best

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.940
Latin American Restaurants,
which is a great success.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.790
It's the number one
Mexican restaurant

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.060
on the list, which is
a French counterpart.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.650
And she's an author of eight
books, two in the works.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.000
She's a known media personality.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.790
She is currently the
judge in "Top Chef"--

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.040
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.020
SPEAKER: --in Mexico.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.228
MARTHA ORTIZ: The only woman.

00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:16.440
SPEAKER: The only woman
in "Top Chef Mexico."

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.190
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.500
SPEAKER: And she recently
opened her latest

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.620
international venture here
in London, no other than 1

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.750
Park Lane, which is in
the Intercontinental

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.270
Hotel in Mayfair, which is
also a remarkable achievement.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.940
"Master Chef," I
think, is shooting, no,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.380
part of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.350
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, we're
finished with that.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.600
SPEAKER: You're
finished, "Master Chef."

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.530
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes,
we're finished.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.571
SPEAKER: For this season.

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:43.270
So who is interested in the
series, you can check it out.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.420
So this is going to be
a conversation, Martha.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.610
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of
course, thank you.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.342
SPEAKER: We'd like to make it
as interactive as possible.

00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:52.800
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of
course, of course.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.630
SPEAKER: And, well, first
of all, congratulations.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.129
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:57.690
MARTHA ORTIZ: Oh, thank
you for inviting me.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.740
I am very happy.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.970
I'm very pleased.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.345
I think sometimes life
can be like a recipe.

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:03.974
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.640
MARTHA ORTIZ: So it's
important to share

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.180
the secrets so
everybody can know

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.090
how to handle the ingredients.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.990
I think that some
people can make a master

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.810
recipe of their lives
and make something

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.310
unique and remarkable.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.140
And I think like good cuisine,
good persons can be shared.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.570
So I'm very happy to be here.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.730
And let's talk about
the ingredients in life.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.980
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.438
MARTHA ORTIZ: Let's
talk about what

00:02:31.438 --> 00:02:32.860
is beautiful, what it's not.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.197
And what do you do with this--

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:36.030
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.870
MARTHA ORTIZ: --in
the every day.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.750
SPEAKER: So I think
what we thought

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.710
about is we wanted to
touch on, obviously,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.380
Martha's journey, her
approach to her craft,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.930
talk about resilience
and setbacks

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.190
and talk about venturing
into different projects.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.360
And I want to start a little
bit from the beginning.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.650
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.960
SPEAKER: What you
might not know is

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.620
that Martha has a degree
in political science.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.330
So she focused her
studies in university

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.070
in political science.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.630
So I wonder, Martha, what was
the origin and the impetus

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.950
to focus in that area?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.589
And how did you move--

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:16.380
MARTHA ORTIZ: Move.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.139
Or not move.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.180
SPEAKER: --to gastronomy.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.320
MARTHA ORTIZ: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.944
SPEAKER: How did you
find your calling?

00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:23.760
MARTHA ORTIZ: You know, I
born in a very blessed home.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.610
My mother is an artist.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.200
My father is a medical doctor.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.740
And when I was a little girl,
I remember that everything

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.900
happens in the table.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.270
They invite the most interesting
people to have dinner with us,

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.760
to share the stories, to
share what they were doing.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.270
So I remember that I saw sitting
kind of this Octavio Paz,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.530
and he was a Nobel Prize.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.570
So I went down to the
library and started

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.500
reading these beautiful
poems and see him eating.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.230
So I start believing that
in tables, everything

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.610
could happen, agreement,
disagreement, and the food

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.290
has its ceremony.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.020
So I think that--
that idea, when

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.730
you are a little girl, it plants
like a seed in your brain.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.250
Then I grew up, and I remember
that I said to my father

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.920
that he was very strict, as
all the surgeons, you know?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.430
My father preformed the
first kidney transplant

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.590
in Mexico and Latin America.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.670
And I'm named Martha because
of his first patient.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.840
Then he married
Martha, my mother.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.660
So it was a beautiful story,
but he was very strict.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.000
You can imagine a surgeon.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.560
So I remember that I said to my
father, I want to be a curator.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.430
My father's, a curator?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.970
You want to work in a museum?

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.640
And I said, yes, I will
adore to work in a museum.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.440
I think it's wonderful.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.040
And I remember that he
told me, OK, you are 14.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.100
You can go out, work,
put the money together,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.000
and go to study to be a curator.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.830
And then I decide that I have
to go to a very good school

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.760
to have a formal education
because my father always--

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.790
and I have to say
it and honor him.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.910
He always believed in
intelligence more than having

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.930
boys or girls.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.500
We were two girls.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.400
And I have another
sister and a brother,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.730
and he never make a
difference in that way.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.430
So he said me, go
to a good school.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.760
So I decided-- and
I read the careers,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.090
and they were accounting,
my god, math, no, you know?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.920
Economy, and I say,
mmm, political science.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.290
And I thought it was
very interesting.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.610
I really like it.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.980
I went to ITAM.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.220
It's a very school--

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.750
a very good one.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.730
We were like, at the
beginning, maybe three girls

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.040
and like 20 boys.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.020
The three girls finished
and just three boys.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.110
So we-- we-- and you
know at the same time.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.960
And at the end of this
career, they ask us to make--

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.610
in Mexico, you have
to make a thesis.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.860
SPEAKER: Yeah, a presentation.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.790
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, yes,
to have your career done.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.880
And they asked us to make a
study about social mobility

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.280
and party votes.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.940
It was very interesting.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.610
So I went to a community that is
called Milpa Alta near Mexico.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.060
And you have to go to the home
and say, hello, good afternoon.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.360
I come from the ITAM.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.750
I want to ask you, how
many children do you have?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.820
And they say to you, 10.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.550
OK.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.600
How many bedrooms?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.690
Just this one, you know?

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.120
I start feeling very bad,
because in Mexico, sometimes,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.020
I was talking
about the contrast,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.070
that it's a country
with a lot of contrast.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.430
But every time that
I went to a home,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.680
I remember that they
offered me mole.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.260
You know, in Milpa Alta,
it's the place where we have

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.170
a lot of cactus fruit and mole.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.925
And I remember that these people
that has no protein, and this

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:31.660
is a true story, they
serve us in peltre.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.420
Peltre is like an enamel,
or how do you say it?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.100
It's [SPEAKING SPANISH]
enamel, no?

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.634
Like--

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:39.550
SPEAKER: Yeah, metal--

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.070
MARTHA ORTIZ: Metal,
but it's painted.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.920
And it's painted
with blue and white.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.420
So in that moment,
I realized that they

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.140
were richer than me
eating in the cosmos

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.570
because everything was
blue and with the stars.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.090
So I came with this idea,
you know, with my mentor.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.890
And I say, I want to change.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.380
And I want to build a story
about food and identity

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.710
in this community because I
think it's very important.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:14.160
It's through women who are
sharing these kind of recipes

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.500
through the other young women.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.600
So I think it's
quite interesting

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.360
to talk with these people about
this richness of ingredients

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.910
and the point of view.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:30.070
And I started looking that
they didn't have any--

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.050
how can they say it?

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:37.590
This kind of food that comes
to big chains in Milpa Alta you

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.820
never see, or a McDonald's,
or a Burger King.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.110
There is no chains.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.540
It's just a community.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.420
And why?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.670
Because they have a
religious party every day.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.540
And they make it with food.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.020
So for me, it was fantastic
seeing that it's a--

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.670
you know, it was
the Day of the Dead,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.270
and they shared this food.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.800
Then was the Posadas, they
shared all the Posadas.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.290
So food became part of that
religious and nice identity.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.290
So I finish, and they
say, this is fantastic.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.420
I really like.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.600
But I like this part of
food, the academic part,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.190
when I started building this
kind of Mexican sense, no,

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.640
the strong, the passion,
the woman, the fire,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.350
the witchcraft.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.580
And I remember that I
finished that story,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.490
and they really love it in ITAM.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.440
Because I finish
saying that for me,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.150
this kind of traditional
cooks in Mexico,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.060
they're like,
[SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.990
SPEAKER: Witchcraft.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.890
MARTHA ORTIZ: Witchcraft woman,
that with four ingredients,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.260
they can build everything.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.810
So we are friends.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.980
I still adore them.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.350
I adore all the
traditional cooks

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.440
because they're kind
of anonymous heroines.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.630
Every day, they--
most of them, they

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.184
don't have husbands because
they left to the States to work.

00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:09.350
SPEAKER: Yes, as immigrants.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.870
MARTHA ORTIZ: They emigrate
in very difficult conditions.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.620
And sometimes, they
never came back,

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.490
and they take care
about the family selling

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.360
food in the markets.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.420
And I think that makes another
kind of economy, but beautiful.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:32.360
So I remember the tables,
these ladies, and I said,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.040
I need to build my own place,
but I didn't have the money.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.490
I didn't have the
money in that moment.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:47.600
So I have been very
blessed because then there

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.230
was a group of women who
were very kind with me

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.280
and invited me to make dinners
with them because Mexico was

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.200
on trend because, you
know, it was starting

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.440
after Carlos Salinas de
Gortari-- this big moment

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.550
with everything, you know?

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.341
Mexico [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:07.820
SPEAKER: That moment in which
the country was privatizing.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.050
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes,
privatizing, it was very--

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.650
SPEAKER: A lot of
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.400
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.680
So we were on the news.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.790
We were everywhere.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.840
So they invited me to help
them with the dinners.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.910
And I really adore--

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.640
and every time that we
went to make a dinner,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.680
I'd ask the main
chef, can I stay here

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.000
for maybe three months?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.150
And they say, yes, if you
want to make tortillas or make

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.410
the coffee, it will be great.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.140
So I was a helper.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.440
I served coffees.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.560
And I was very happy, you
know, I learned a lot.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.960
Then I returned to Mexico.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:48.650
I built this consulting
office with the husband of one

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.540
of my friends.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.060
I always had been
very close to the art

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.660
scene with the husband of
Mariana Cuevas, the daughter

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.080
of Jose Luis Cuevas, this very
famous artist in Mexico that

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.620
just passed away, and
my business partner

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.500
passed away too very young.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.710
But I adored to start creating
restaurant concepts with him

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:18.140
and making these
great events, and food

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.710
started being my identity too.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.400
SPEAKER: So let's
talk about that.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.330
MARTHA ORTIZ: And then
I saw like "Like Water

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.092
for Chocolate," this
is a true story.

00:12:26.092 --> 00:12:27.050
SPEAKER: Ahh, the more.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.630
MARTHA ORTIZ: I read the
book, and I saw the movie,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.610
and I said, I want
to be like Tita.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.740
I want to be a rebel.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.570
I don't want to
marry the man that I

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.884
have to marry in these
kind of bourgeoisie thing.

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:39.800
I want to be like her.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.490
I want to be a rebel.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.790
And we adored that movie.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.290
SPEAKER: It's fantastic.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.521
If you haven't seen it like--

00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:46.770
MARTHA ORTIZ: I read the book.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.961
I think it's the most celebrated
Spanish book, you know--

00:12:50.961 --> 00:12:52.460
SPEAKER: "Like Water
for Chocolate."

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.320
MARTHA ORTIZ: "Like
Water for Chocolate."

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.410
Now, I'm very good friends of
Laura Esquivel because once,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.255
I--

00:12:58.255 --> 00:12:59.750
the [INAUDIBLE]
made this book that

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.790
is called "Gritos y Sussuros."

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.670
And I was beside her, and
I said, you don't know,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.260
but I am what I am because
of you, and she was, why?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.310
Because you built the
character in a woman

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.950
that was a rebel through food.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.670
So in the movie,
what is beautiful is

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.150
if she was in love, everybody
was in love with the food.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.930
So I started believing that
food can have emotions.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.700
And if you're sad, everybody
is sad when it takes the food.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.910
So feelings can
trespass the food.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.720
So everything has started
melting, you know?

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.000
Everything at the same time.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.090
And then Emanuele, my partner,
decide to go back to Paris

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.601
because he was French.

00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.720
And I said, what I'm going
to do with this office?

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.590
I don't like to
charge the clients.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.140
I don't like that
kind of things.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.610
I love the creative part.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:06.770
So I remember that I married
an artist, my first marriage.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.840
I married a very
rebel artist that

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.732
was handsome, and nice, and--

00:14:10.732 --> 00:14:11.440
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.260
MARTHA ORTIZ: The
perfect fit, you know?

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.830
But in the moment that I told
him, I want to do something.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.430
he was very, very clear with me.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.049
Yes, you're going
to work for me.

00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:25.340
That's what you're going to do.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.830
And he gave me a book
that it was called,

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.140
"The Wife of the
Artist," and it was

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.300
horrible because all the wives,
they have miserable lives,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.020
you know, miserable lives,
just some examples like

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.530
[INAUDIBLE] maybe that you have,
you know, the little thing.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.560
But they were horrible
lives, and I said,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.040
I don't want this life.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.250
So I remember that I
went out of that house

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.506
with just like 10 pesos,
no car, no nothing.

00:14:54.506 --> 00:14:55.380
SPEAKER: $0.30 today.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.838
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes,
I remember that.

00:14:56.838 --> 00:14:58.620
I remember perfectly.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.570
And I went with
my mother's house,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.780
and I said, I have to
be here, I'm sorry,

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.570
maybe three, four months, but
I will go away another time.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.180
And she told me,
yes, of course, you

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.100
can be here three
or four months.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.040
SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.780
MARTHA ORTIZ: Fantastic.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.650
That's a true story.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.830
SPEAKER: It seems
that you talk of,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.821
you know, gastronomy like
almost as a language.

00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:19.820
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.890
SPEAKER: And I have seen
some of your interviews

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.925
that you like to tell that
you're a writer in flavors.

00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:30.300
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course, I
think that's the storytelling.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.700
SPEAKER: In your style,
I'd like delve a little bit

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.620
in your style.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.910
Artists usually say that part of
being a great artist is to find

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.590
and inhabit your own style.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.120
Marcus Samuelsson recently said
that part of being a great chef

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.640
is to knowing who you are.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.770
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.570
SPEAKER: So your style
is very unique, you know,

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.610
from what you read in the
press, it's very bold.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.110
It's very feminine.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.100
It's very creative, but I think
it would be great for everybody

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.960
to hear it from you, like--

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.260
MARTHA ORTIZ: What is my style?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.718
SPEAKER: How would
you describe it?

00:16:03.718 --> 00:16:07.800
How would you-- and how
have you developed it?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.680
How have you come to
find this is Martha?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.940
MARTHA ORTIZ: The first
thing is that I never

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.130
ever want to copy no one.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.870
The other thing that I adore
is showing that I'm a woman.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.240
I don't want-- I think there
is in the world, right now,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.190
you know, the big chefs, they
have this minimalistic style,

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.930
very masculine.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:34.770
And I say, I don't--

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.817
I'm not-- I don't feel OK to
copy these and transport it

00:16:39.817 --> 00:16:41.040
to a dish.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.710
I adore these kind of
baroque, Mexican beauty.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.530
So and even I--

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.500
I was talking this morning with
a very nice girl that I said,

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.550
I remember when I see all
the pseudorealistic painters

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.360
and artists that live in Mexico,
like woman in Wonderland,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:10.170
you know Frida, Remedios
Varo, and Leonora Carrington,

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.140
this great photographer,
[INAUDIBLE],, the one

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.290
with the big curls you know?

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.859
And I said, this is fantastic.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.300
I want to be like them.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.710
They were my role models.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.710
I never said I want to be
like the Joel Robuchon.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:30.140
I want to be like this artist
because they find the way.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.910
Imagine Frida because
everybody now sees Frida.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:38.010
She suffers a lot, everybody--
but finding her style being

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:42.540
married with one of the most
important artists in the world

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.600
at the--

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.670
he painted this big
murals, and she decided

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.690
to make these small paintings.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.020
And she was-- and that paintings
were her mural, you know?

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.960
She invented herself
like that's--

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.610
that's what the exhibition said.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.550
And when you go to
Casa Azul of Frida,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:06.810
you really start feeling that
she invented the way that she

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.520
wanted to be, but not
because of Diego, because

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.140
of her own [INAUDIBLE] with her.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.250
She used to adore animals.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.920
So she put the animals here.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.380
She adored to have, you
know, her big eyebrows,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.360
and she never pulled it out.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.760
She put her-- her, you
know, the beautiful,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.280
red nails and with the rings.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.250
And his grand niece is a friend
of mine, Guillermo Kahlo,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.290
the photographer, he
always told me then

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.200
when Frida went out on
the street, people laughed

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.030
about her, imagining that--

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.530
SPEAKER: Yeah, like
the appearance--

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.988
MARTHA ORTIZ:
--bourgeoisie society

00:18:44.988 --> 00:18:46.860
in Mexico in that
moment, looking

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:52.190
this woman going with
ribbons on the hair, strong.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.480
And she couldn't walk
very well because she

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.620
had polio when she was--

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.655
SPEAKER: Yeah, she
had-- and an accident.

00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:58.446
MARTHA ORTIZ: And an
accident called polio.

00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:00.960
She wanted, you
know-- and I said,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.090
these women are fantastic.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.310
I want to be a
woman in Wonderland,

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.520
in my own Wonderland.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.020
So it was more personal.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.390
And I developed-- and
I never want to see it,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.070
I say, this is in fashion.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.270
This is in trend.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.060
This is made by this male chef.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.440
And I said, no, I--

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.700
I'm a woman.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.780
I love lyrics.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.740
I love colors.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.550
I'm a proud Mexican,
and I'm trying

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:33.720
to build a business with
a lot of women involved.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.520
I give the same opportunities
and sometimes a little bit more

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.280
to the woman to
tell you the truth.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.160
If I have a man producer,
a woman producer,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.320
I say, let's see, bring
her first, you know?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.870
Because for them,
it's very difficult.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.200
Imagine a lady who sells
tomatoes in Mexico.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.120
It's very difficult to get to
a restaurant, to be a producer.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.710
So I have to be caring
about these type of things.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.150
I think so.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.160
SPEAKER: And for everybody
to know, I think,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.850
there's a fantastic interview
from Martha with the "Evening

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.560
Standard" in which she's--

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.086
you're credited with
saying you want to break--

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.960
MARTHA ORTIZ: The caramel
ceiling, of course.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.500
SPEAKER: --the caramel ceiling.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.830
You want to help other women
to break the caramel ceiling.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.130
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course,
I say the caramel

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.930
because it's not the
glass ceiling for me.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:20.740
It's the caramel ceiling.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.630
SPEAKER: I think it's
a great topic on that.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.610
And I would like to hear
your thoughts on how--

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.624
what does that mean for
you in your industry?

00:20:29.624 --> 00:20:31.540
MARTHA ORTIZ: These kind
of things-- you know,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.760
first I hate when they said--

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.907
and I'm very, you know, in the
opinion of Dominique Crenn,

00:20:37.907 --> 00:20:40.420
this great chef--

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.670
it's horrible that
they say, this prize

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.990
goes for the woman chef.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.590
I think that's horrible.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.900
It's not the best woman chef.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.740
It's the best chef.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.580
You don't have to
say it that way.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.180
You don't have to say it--

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.820
let's make them happy.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.800
Let's say the best woman chef.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.420
I don't think that's fair.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.270
It's the best chef of the world.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.049
SPEAKER: True.

00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:04.090
MARTHA ORTIZ: And I think
if they start dividing,

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.770
that's not nice.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.000
What I'm trying to do is
really to build opportunities

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.030
because maybe in Mexico--

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.400
here it's different, maybe.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.360
But in Mexico, when
you have trainees,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.670
I try to educate and
be mentor of women

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.910
and say, I have these 10 men.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.680
I have these six women.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.500
Let's bring the women
first because they

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.410
want to have an opportunity.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.780
They won't have it
maybe in other places.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.630
Or they will be very small
windows or doors to open.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.860
So I'm trying.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.800
My pastry chef is a woman.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.550
SPEAKER: Which is
fantastic, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.030
MARTHA ORTIZ: I have one
sous chef man, one woman,

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.210
and my head chef is a woman.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.260
And I'm trying, you know,
even with the flowers,

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.250
I buy it from a woman.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.730
So I'm trying to make this
network that everything

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.880
is, you know, very feminine.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.120
And because we don't have
opportunities in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.180
SPEAKER: Do you
find that more chefs

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.240
are following your example?

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.600
Do you see somebody--

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.020
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, I
think they're-- they're--

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.240
SPEAKER: --or do you
find yourself alone.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.387
MARTHA ORTIZ: There's
a wonderful woman chef

00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:18.340
that I adore.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.180
She's young.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.470
She's from Tabasco.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.990
Now she has a
restaurant in Mexico.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.780
And she always
called me, I'm making

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.190
this name because of you.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.260
Can you help me?

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.610
And I say, yes, of course,
because I put names

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.910
to the dish that's different.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:37.520
I won't say, creme caramel with
the perfume of da, da, da, no.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.020
No.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.720
I call it Mary goes
to the flower shop

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.940
because Mary is a character.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.380
And she changes every month.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.470
Even Mary has been
candidate and has lost.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.270
Sometimes she is fat, and she
doesn't want to be in the menu.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.770
You know?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.990
SPEAKER: She has her temper.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.531
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yeah,
she has a temper.

00:22:54.531 --> 00:22:55.580
She's a modern woman.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.330
She goes to the library.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.220
She wants to make a PhD.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.647
She's a modern woman, you know?

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:02.230
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.750
MARTHA ORTIZ: She's getting
divorced, so, please, you know,

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.730
Mary has to take care of her.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.610
She's with the attorney.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.610
And everybody laughed.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.960
Now I'm making that book.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.230
I have, I think, like,
14 emails from my editor

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.380
because he's mad because I
have to do it more quickly.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.850
But this is a fantastic book
because the name is Maria,

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.540
because I love the name
in Spanish, "Marie Va, "

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:35.450
"Maria is Moving," "Recipes
for a Woman with Greatness."

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.940
SPEAKER: Oh, I love that.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.440
I love that.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.680
MARTHA ORTIZ: So what I'm doing
is putting this-- it's not just

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.400
like a gastronomy book.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.640
The first part is
talking about what

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.190
ingredients you need in life.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.300
And the second part of the book
are my favorite women in Mexico

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.450
that they tell the
recipe of their own life.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.360
So it's fantastic to see a
woman like Carmen Aristegui

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.250
with a big knife and say, I
have to cut everybody, you know?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.700
And she gives a recipe
of little cookies.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.560
So it's this kind
of high contrast.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.327
So--

00:24:07.327 --> 00:24:09.493
SPEAKER: It sounds like a
fantastic project, Martha.

00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:12.280
MARTHA ORTIZ: It's going to be--
it's going to be the project.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.890
SPEAKER: You're more than
welcome to come back again.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.160
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, of course.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.960
SPEAKER: It will be a
privlege to have that.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.390
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, and
we need to bring these 12

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.837
women that they are fantastic.

00:24:18.837 --> 00:24:19.420
You know them.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.290
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.081
MARTHA ORTIZ: And some,
they are, you know,

00:24:22.081 --> 00:24:25.090
very famous and the other
are not famous, but for me,

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.650
are heroines.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.450
They are in the resistance.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.850
They make things
for the Mexicans.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.330
Maybe they're not well known,
but they are fantastic.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.330
SPEAKER: Yeah, and you touched
on something very interesting

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.440
now, which is the struggle, no?

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.540
There's a lot of determination.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.130
There's a lot of
resilience that needs

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.050
to come when you
are basically trying

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.120
to change the status quo.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.171
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:24:50.171 --> 00:24:51.670
SPEAKER: There's
one anecdote that I

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.090
would like to share with the
audience that illustrates

00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:01.480
very well your nature and
your spirit of resilience

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.360
and struggle.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.740
So in 2003, Martha opened
her first restaurant.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.609
Immediately, it was a success,
very well known, very popular.

00:25:12.609 --> 00:25:13.900
MARTHA ORTIZ: I worked so much.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.810
You cannot imagine.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.220
I was the valet parking,
the security, the cook.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.480
I went to a bank.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.220
I remember my husband told me,
you will never get the money.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.990
So I went to a bank.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.910
I remember that I
bought something

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.580
that I couldn't bought, and
I returned it the other day

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.370
after the bank appointment.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.980
I remember that I
went very elegant.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.140
And I asked the man,
I need $1 million.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.352
And he told me, for what?

00:25:40.352 --> 00:25:44.097
And I said, for a restaurant.

00:25:44.097 --> 00:25:45.055
And they gave it to me.

00:25:45.055 --> 00:25:45.680
SPEAKER: Wow!

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.230
Fantastic.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.470
MARTHA ORTIZ: I said, here's my
business plan, and I show it,

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.040
you know?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.950
And they give me
a million dollars.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.890
This is a true story.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.390
SPEAKER: That is a
fantastic story--

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:55.690
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.481
SPEAKER: --I think.

00:25:56.481 --> 00:25:59.282
MARTHA ORTIZ: And I returned
it with a lot of people

00:25:59.282 --> 00:26:00.490
because I couldn't afford it.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.605
I need the $1 million
to build the restaurant,

00:26:02.605 --> 00:26:03.730
and it was a great success.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.790
SPEAKER: It was a fantastic
success, like, it took off.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.610
However, five years
later, the government--

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.795
MARTHA ORTIZ: I
changed the location.

00:26:12.795 --> 00:26:13.670
SPEAKER: --asked you.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.330
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, remember
that I have these beautiful--

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.250
but I need to make it--

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.830
a lot of people was
in saying to me,

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.450
Martha we need to build
this restaurant in Spain,

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.610
and New York, and everything.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.350
And the space was very
beautiful, but I said,

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.270
I need a private room.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.249
I need an office in the house.

00:26:38.249 --> 00:26:39.040
I need to build it.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:47.380
So I saw the most beautiful,
beautiful corner in Mexico

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.390
where Louis Vuitton
was, and I say,

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.120
OK, Louis Vuitton, let's go.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.350
You will be Louis Vuitton.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.331
I will be Aguila y Sol, a
Mexican brand and a woman

00:26:56.331 --> 00:26:56.830
brand.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.046
So I changed location.

00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:00.755
SPEAKER: You changed
location, and then--

00:27:00.755 --> 00:27:02.962
MARTHA ORTIZ: A beautiful
place, Legoretta made that.

00:27:02.962 --> 00:27:04.130
SPEAKER: Legorreta.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.520
MARTHA ORTIZ: Made
this space that was--

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.532
SPEAKER: Fantastic art.

00:27:07.532 --> 00:27:08.990
MARTHA ORTIZ:
Beautiful, fantastic.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.640
And we have a serpent
on the ceilings

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.010
because I don't build
restaurants with architects.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.550
I always ask artists,
you know, people

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:25.000
who like opera, or woman
designers, for everything.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.150
I love that people
from different--

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.910
not just the common
people, no, people

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.099
that is a little bit crazy.

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:32.890
SPEAKER: And they--

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.936
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes,
a little talent.

00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:35.230
SPEAKER: The spiky ones.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.120
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes,
the spiky ones.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.700
I adore that.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.300
SPEAKER: So the
government asked Martha

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.467
to shut down the restaurant.

00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:43.299
MARTHA ORTIZ: They
closed me, my restaurant.

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:45.070
SPEAKER: So they asked
her with the excuse

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.311
that you were short
one parking space.

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:49.060
MARTHA ORTIZ: Less
than one parking space.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.710
SPEAKER: Less than
one parking space.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.376
MARTHA ORTIZ: I
remember that afternoon,

00:27:52.376 --> 00:27:55.570
and every time I remember, I
cry because it was so horrible.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.910
Because people was having lunch.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.520
They came in, and
they say, we're

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.200
going to close this restaurant.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.270
And I say, why?

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:08.880
Because you need to less
than one parking space.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.730
So I remember that afternoon--

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.530
SPEAKER: I'm sure that it
must have been devastating.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.420
MARTHA ORTIZ: Devastating.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.130
They took the people away.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.930
They took my people away.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.020
And at the end, I didn't
want to go, they--

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.030
they said to me, we would
leave you here, and I said,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:29.730
it's perfect.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.160
I will die in here.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.530
I have food.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.380
I have water.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.465
I can be here six months.

00:28:34.465 --> 00:28:35.180
SPEAKER: And I know how to.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.013
MARTHA ORTIZ: And I
will make my resistance.

00:28:37.013 --> 00:28:38.540
I will call the newspapers.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.770
And they took me
outside by the force.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.110
SPEAKER: And what do you
think the motivation was?

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.417
MARTHA ORTIZ: I
think I was punished.

00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:49.250
SPEAKER: Because of how
successful you were?

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.460
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of my success,
of course, and I was a woman,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.180
and I was very young.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:00.060
And I cannot tell you it was
this person or this person.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.870
It was a system because
at the same time,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.760
a lot of women struggled.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.050
Carmen Arestegui lost her job.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.090
A lot of women [INAUDIBLE]
it was, for me, devastating.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:12.260
SPEAKER: It was a--

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.250
there was a period
of a clampdown

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.750
on certain local personalities.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.260
MARTHA ORTIZ: I lost everything
in three days, my work,

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:23.200
my house, everything.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.449
SPEAKER: But fast forward
one year, and in one year--

00:29:26.449 --> 00:29:28.240
MARTHA ORTIZ: I remember
that I was crying,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.350
and a friend of mine--
this is another true story

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.660
how women can help other women.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.180
She's a very influential
and intelligent lady,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.040
Denise Dresser.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.840
SPEAKER: Yeah, of
course, a journalist--

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.270
MARTHA ORTIZ: A journalist in
Mexico and in "The New York

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.930
Times" and a very good friend.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.260
I remember that I was crying,
crying, crying, crying, crying,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.210
and she came to my house.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.700
She's very small, not very
thin, what are you crying about?

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.180
And I said, I lost
everything, everything.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.710
I lose my restaurant.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.300
I lose my money.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.840
I lose everything that
I have worked for.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.990
And she looked me in the
eyes, and she told me,

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.100
you haven't lost anything.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.210
You have it here.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.120
So let's go.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.190
She offered me the door,
and she took me away.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.410
So I remember I was
crying in the street.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.010
I have to find a horrible work
to survive, that's the truth.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:23.960
I review menus, now casting,
the things that I don't like,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.930
but I have to do it.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.250
And I learned how
can you be punished.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.200
SPEAKER: And that's
what I would like

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.160
for you to share in
retrospective because one

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.460
year after Martha opened her
current restaurant, which

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:45.680
is the one that catapulted
you to international acclaim,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:51.330
but I think that a lot of us
will or have faced setbacks.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.370
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.380
SPEAKER: Now in
retrospective, what do you

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.710
think made you
find your strength

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:05.290
and just bounce back
with all that force?

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:09.970
MARTHA ORTIZ: I saw that I
have a social responsibility

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.630
and to be an example
for other women.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.970
I don't do it just for myself.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.950
I remember to see my cooks,
chef, what are we going to do?

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:20.880
We don't have work.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.370
And I say, we will find a work.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.450
Don't worry.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.950
And I remember that that's
why the name is Dulce Patria.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.410
People doesn't know,
that's my private joke

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:36.300
because I think that my homeland
is sweeter than my government.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.360
SPEAKER: Yes, dulce patria
means sweet homeland.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.652
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, it's my--

00:31:39.652 --> 00:31:41.130
it's my private joke.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:46.020
And-- and the logo, it's
a woman with a flame

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.190
like an Amazon and a horse.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.880
So if they do it again,
I will do it again.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.970
I told them, if you're going to
close me the restaurant again,

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:59.500
I will open again, and we will
die maybe first you or me,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.770
but we will keep like this, no?

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.370
You close.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:03.300
I will open.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.010
You close me, I will open.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.240
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.230
So I felt in that
moment, that I have

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.740
to get a story not just
for me because I have to be

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.480
an example for a lot of women.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.495
I was in the supermarket,
and they come crying with me.

00:32:19.495 --> 00:32:21.720
I cannot believe this, chef.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.520
We are very sorry.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.850
What are you going to do?

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.150
And I said, we have
to do it together.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.010
We're going to build it again.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.900
So I make Dulce Patria.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.010
I don't know which--

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.260
now I see it back.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.514
If it happened to me, I
don't know, but I say,

00:32:35.514 --> 00:32:36.180
I have to do it.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.990
I have to do it.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.100
I have to do it.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.810
I divorced the twice.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:45.380
Imagine my husband was working
with the current president,

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.760
and I say I cannot
sit with these people.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.260
I must go.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.190
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.320
MARTHA ORTIZ: I cannot
be in the same table.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.020
I have another idea of life.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.900
I have values.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.470
So go for your work.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.370
I will stay here.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.120
SPEAKER: And congratulations,
you have actually stayed.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.370
MARTHA ORTIZ: But it was hard.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.617
SPEAKER: And stayed
for the long time.

00:33:11.617 --> 00:33:12.700
MARTHA ORTIZ: It was hard.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.514
I remember the bills.

00:33:14.514 --> 00:33:15.014
Oh!

00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.638
Is this what I'm
going to do, you know?

00:33:16.638 --> 00:33:17.500
Oh, my god.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.260
But you find the strength.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.440
You find the strength.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.880
SPEAKER: And now, Martha, with
your most recent venture--

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.690
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.130
SPEAKER: --here.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.700
The name is Ella Canta,
which means, She Sings.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.700
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.270
SPEAKER: And I'll led
you to the story of of--

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.728
MARTHA ORTIZ: We
all sing together.

00:33:33.728 --> 00:33:35.440
SPEAKER: --of the name.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.450
But I think it's
very, very interesting

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:42.490
that you're coming to one of
the most competitive markets

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.140
the UK, gastronomy.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.280
We find that in
our jobs at Google,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.020
we need to venture
elsewhere, and we often

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.250
struggle, no, on how to
adapt to that new market.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.260
And you have that
added complexity

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.880
that you have said that
you want to bring and stay

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.260
as authentic as possible.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.310
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:12.230
SPEAKER: How do you
balance that objective

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.940
of being-- like
remaining as authentic

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.850
as possible with probably
the needs or the pressure

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.989
to adapt to the local
taste or the local market?

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:26.120
MARTHA ORTIZ: I think London
is very international,

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.750
and people is used to
have this big palate.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.090
And talking about
big palate, you

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.190
have great Indian restaurants,
great Asian restaurants.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:39.690
So I think people
is open to flavors.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.159
That's the first thing.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:46.050
Second, I think that Mexican
cuisine is very powerful.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.530
And I think it's very sensual.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.889
So I'm sure that it
will seduce everybody

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:57.560
because when you try a mole,
you're trying 50 ingredients.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:03.980
And I'm sure, and that's
part of Maria of the book,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.580
the nuns made that
recipe, and I think

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.520
they made that
recipe because they

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.950
weren't allowed to get married.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.812
So all the sensualness,
all the young--

00:35:16.812 --> 00:35:17.770
they come through food.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.660
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.380
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes,
yes, so you try that,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.490
and you feeling in ecstasy
when it's well done, really.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.620
Oh, how you try, and
these 50 ingredients

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.080
melt in your mouth, the
chocolate, the spices,

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.720
the cinnamon.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.800
Everything is so
powerful, and I'm

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.020
sure that that's why Mexican
food is on trend because it's

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.875
the Old and the
New World together.

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.500
SPEAKER: Such a great
fusion, you know?

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.800
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, we're not
inventing fusion between China

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.360
and France, you know?

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:57.560
Mexican food in the
conception is fusion food.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.420
We have these very
interesting pre-Hispanic era

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.630
touch that it's true.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:10.152
[? The sun ?] emperor has
these 300 dishes every day.

00:36:10.152 --> 00:36:13.340
And they were-- he
can choose from,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.390
because he was thin, remember?

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.360
SPEAKER: He was.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.443
MARTHA ORTIZ: People said,
maybe it was like this.

00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:20.360
No, he needed to choose.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.230
They were warriors.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.820
They need to make a strong.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.070
And then the Spanish came
with all the Arabic influence.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.000
So I think it melted perfectly.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.990
And then in all the convents
in the Baroque time,

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.680
they rebuild, and they
make this Mexican identity,

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.230
like the mole, like
the pipian like--

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.860
SPEAKER: It's like twice it
has been like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.359
MARTHA ORTIZ: Like
all these sauces.

00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:52.250
And I have an idea
of, at the beginning--

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:56.750
and I always said that when
Hernan Cortes came to Mexico

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.020
or La Nueva Espana in that
moment that they called it,

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.980
and he saw La Malinche--

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.670
Malinche was this beautiful
and wonderful lady

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.016
that everybody
looks as a traitor

00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:08.390
because she was
very intelligent.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.400
But she wasn't a traitor.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.330
She was the mother
of Mexico in a way.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:18.750
When he tries her, he adored her
because it tastes like the sun,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.290
salty.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.420
Have you tried?

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.640
Have you put your hand in
the sun and then tried?

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.200
It's a little bit salty.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.690
So I think he get in love
because she was salty

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.670
because she tasted like the sun.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:38.240
And I have that idea that
this melting, wonderful parts

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.220
all over the world that
they were in Mexico.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.920
That's why Mexican
gastronomy is so rich.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.050
That's why our
culture is so rich.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.600
That's why we have the artists
that we have, the movie

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.850
directors right now.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.530
They are amazing, why?

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.620
Because we have this imagination
and this idea of beauty.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:00.740
Before I come to London, I saw
"Roma," the new film of Cuaron.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.460
SPEAKER: Cuaron.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.210
MARTHA ORTIZ: Wow!

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:07.130
An amazing story-- what a
profound story about these--

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.020
this Mexico--

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.830
SPEAKER: And so proud--

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.600
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of
what they are doing.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.700
SPEAKER: The work
they are doing.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.470
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.820
But they have this imagination,
and that imagination

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.510
is through food too.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.640
SPEAKER: I wouldn't like
to hijack your time.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.860
So I want to have the--

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.510
I'll give the
opportunity, anybody to--

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.510
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.830
SPEAKER: --ask any question or--

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.080
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course, and
thank you for being here.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.220
SPEAKER: --share anything that
you would like to ask Martha?

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.420
If not, I'll carry on.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.459
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:38:39.459 --> 00:38:40.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.360
MARTHA ORTIZ: Hi.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.443
AUDIENCE: I went to your
country a few months ago,

00:38:42.443 --> 00:38:44.590
and I had the Maria
from Mexico dessert.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.340
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:38:45.492 --> 00:38:47.200
AUDIENCE: It was
actually one of the best

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.370
desserts I've ever had.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.369
MARTHA ORTIZ: Thank you.

00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:51.970
AUDIENCE: But you were
saying how it changes,

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.770
and sometimes it's
not on the menu.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.050
Is it always the same,
the actual dessert,

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.360
or does the dessert
itself change?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.270
MARTHA ORTIZ: In Mexico,
we change it every month.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.560
And here, we change
it every time

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.110
that we have on a special menu.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:12.330
Now Maria is this new one.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.510
Maria went to Mictlan.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:21.820
Mictlan is the land of the
dead for the Aztecs here.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.950
But in Mexico, she
goes all the way.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.150
She went there.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.780
She returned with victory.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.150
She is alive.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.800
And, now, she makes a
government of all the stars.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.650
So she creates an
eclipse in Mexico.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.140
So everybody says,
she's powerful.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.880
And I say, of course, yes.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.345
She can government
even the stars.

00:39:42.345 --> 00:39:43.470
SPEAKER: That's incredible.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.030
So when-- when do
have the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.030
MARTHA ORTIZ: This one--

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.990
Maria, Maria by Mictlan--

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.670
SPEAKER: It's currently.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.878
MARTHA ORTIZ: It's currently.

00:39:49.878 --> 00:39:51.380
In Mexico, she [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:51.880
SPEAKER: OK.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.033
MARTHA ORTIZ: I have
more hands [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:54.033 --> 00:39:57.910
AUDIENCE: OK, so if I go back,
I can't have the same dessert.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.410
MARTHA ORTIZ: You
want the same one?

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.040
AUDIENCE: The same dessert.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.590
MARTHA ORTIZ: You want
Mary Comes to London?

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.205
AUDIENCE: It was the--

00:40:02.205 --> 00:40:03.820
MARTHA ORTIZ: Just ask
us in the reservation.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.020
You have the right people.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.560
Stephen will make it happen.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.950
He will tell the kitchen.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.270
Or Gabriella will
say to Elliott,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.430
no problem, no problem.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.010
Thank you very much.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.915
And I'm very pleased
that you liked Maria.

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:18.790
Maria is a character.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:19.765
It's not a dessert.

00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:23.020
It's like she's a writer.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.656
She's everything.

00:40:24.656 --> 00:40:28.025
AUDIENCE: Why did you decide
to open a restaurant in London?

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:28.900
MARTHA ORTIZ: London?

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
maybe you said it, sorry.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.350
MARTHA ORTIZ: I think it's--

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.970
no, I didn't say it.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.890
I adore London since
I was a little girl.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.150
I remember that I came here
with my parents, and I really

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.480
I adored it because
it was the first time

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.220
that I tried Indian food and
these kind of new flavors.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.940
So as I said, all
the seeds stay here.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.030
Then the group that
I'm working with,

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.910
they went to Mexico,
see different chefs,

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:02.380
and they decided that I could
be successful in London maybe

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.260
because I have, I think,
this imagination ingredient

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.820
that I adore.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.170
So it was built
in the both ways.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.244
SPEAKER: And I think I will
exhort everybody to go--

00:41:14.244 --> 00:41:15.910
MARTHA ORTIZ: Because
it can taste nice.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.920
SPEAKER: Because
it is quite unique.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.545
I think it is beyond what
you would usually think of--

00:41:22.545 --> 00:41:23.545
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of course.

00:41:23.545 --> 00:41:25.330
SPEAKER: --in Mexican cuisine.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.650
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, of course.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.770
SPEAKER: It is
remarkably different

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.201
and incredibly authentic.

00:41:31.201 --> 00:41:32.200
MARTHA ORTIZ: Thank you.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:32.700
Thank you.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.370
SPEAKER: So I definitely
encourage you to try.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.410
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that you're working now

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:41.740
on a new book with
a different concept

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.780
really empowering a
certain number of women

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.010
and their story.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.640
What about your previous books?

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.220
Were they also--

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.620
MARTHA ORTIZ: No, they
are are not cookbooks.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.810
I'm making these
because I think I

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.770
have to share my experience of
Aguila y Sol that was terrible

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.470
in a way, but in
a positive part.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:08.810
And I think because I make
so much of this effort,

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:10.310
and I was telling
you that I believe

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.810
that life can be
like your recipe,

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.620
building these ingredients,
that I have to share it.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.570
And I would love not to be just
the only one that shared it.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:26.330
So I'm asking people that I
highly respect in Mexico that

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.890
have been through difficult
times, maybe worse than mine,

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:31.850
but they make--

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:33.890
they're my kind of
heroines, you know?

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.750
I believe in the power of woman.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.110
I said, I like Wonder Woman,
you know, this kind of Wonder

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.640
Womans that we have in Mexico.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.720
Sometimes I say, this
woman has lost a child.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:50.630
They are here to
ask for justice,

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.210
and that's the
work of every day.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:57.050
That's very-- that's hard.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.312
That's hard.

00:42:59.312 --> 00:43:00.770
AUDIENCE: How long
does it actually

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.350
take to train all the
chefs in the restaurant

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.260
before they actually bring
on the plate what you expect?

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.380
And are you actually
cooking yourself sometimes?

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.600
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, of
course, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.700
AUDIENCE: But here
in London, like--

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.990
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yeah,
sometimes, yes, of course.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.590
AUDIENCE: So when
are you there again?

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.360
When can we go?

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.255
MARTHA ORTIZ: I'm--

00:43:14.255 --> 00:43:15.650
OK.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.660
I'm coming back in February.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.500
I'm opening a new restaurant
in Mexico, very interesting,

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.220
because it's a cafe.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.380
And I think we are
losing all the bread

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.800
Mexican tradition
that I adore, even

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.790
the names we call it,
cocoles, purequitas, conchas,

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.010
and novias.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:38.510
You know, all these
beautiful names.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.930
So I'm opening a cafe with
all the traditional bread--

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:42.890
SPEAKER: Oh, wow!

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.950
MARTHA ORTIZ: --with
pulque, with chochitos,

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.650
with all these kind of beauties.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.280
I'm going to open it in January.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.090
I think after Aguila y Sol, I
was a little bit frightened,

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:58.610
you know, to--

00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:59.870
I think it was unconscious.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.510
So I stay in my small
castle, you know,

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:10.790
you put like a barrier,
but I decide last year

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.210
that I want to achieve
better things than I have.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.260
And I start--

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.790
I'm going to open three
restaurants next year.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.740
And, one, it's
going to be amazing,

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.870
because it's a theater.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.640
It's not a restaurant.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.500
We will have a place.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.820
And the place will go
through [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.900
And the menu is
going to be built

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.960
with one like Laura Esquivel,
"Like Water to Chocolate."

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.230
So we're going to
build this menu.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.320
We're going to-- it's going
to be like a testing menu,

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:49.460
but even the things that
you're going to eat with

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.160
is not going to be conventional.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.034
It's going to be
very interesting.

00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:55.700
AUDIENCE: You're a
foreigner, and you're

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.210
a woman in a city that
is a very tough city.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.650
What has been your biggest
challenge because I--

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:07.340
even, like, here the
chefs that we hear from,

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.020
there's hardly a lot of--

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.980
hardly any women
in your world, so

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.412
has that been challenging here?

00:45:14.412 --> 00:45:15.620
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes, of course.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:21.260
I think the most difficult
thing here for me is that I'm--

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.440
not all the time.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.420
That's the first thing that if
I want to achieve something,

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.880
I maybe would need
to have more time,

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:34.430
you know, educating
people about Mexico

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.665
because I think one
of the challenges

00:45:36.665 --> 00:45:41.690
is that people get confused
with Tex-Mex food and Mexican

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.000
and more right now, you know?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.620
And what I believe for
me that it's a challenge,

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.140
sometimes, it's even--

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:55.040
hello, Martha.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.930
No, it's hello, chef.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.030
It's different, no?

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:03.380
So I think it's a way of--

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.910
of I was saying in
Mexico, they call

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.630
me chef because they
see me every day,

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.630
and they know that I have
control of everything,

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.900
of the fire, of the
fireman, of everything,

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.480
but here, I do the menu.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.530
I work with great people.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.740
But I don't have
the time, you know?

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.020
And that's difficult
for me sometimes.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.300
So I have to create--

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.330
what I want to do
the next time is

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.930
make the chefs come
to Mexico and maybe

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.140
have more environment
of what we are doing.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.170
I'm making this
dish of this blue

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:45.402
because I adore this painting
of Remedios Varo in this museum.

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:47.360
So we're going to take
this woman in Wonderland

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.820
in this plate and do it right.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.790
That's what I'm going to
do, coming and going, not

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.930
just coming.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:57.050
I think they have
to have, you know,

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.670
the blood, the spirit of Mexico.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:06.680
SPEAKER: Do you
think that that is--

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:11.960
particularly like
the educating part,

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.442
how do you approach it
beyond your restaurant.

00:47:14.442 --> 00:47:15.900
Obviously, the
restaurant is there.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.300
And there's the food.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.320
How-- how is--

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.570
MARTHA ORTIZ: In Mexico, I
do it completely different.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:24.460
Sometimes, Mexico,
the chefs, they maybe

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.790
didn't have a formal education.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:32.999
So on Sundays, we give them
Mexican history lessons.

00:47:32.999 --> 00:47:33.790
SPEAKER: Oh, great.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.800
MARTHA ORTIZ: So they feel
proud about what we are.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.770
I invite very interesting
people, sometimes artists,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:47.330
so they will know that we have
these figurative tradition

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.410
in Mexico.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.500
And now we're going to have--

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.670
I think that is
going to be amazing,

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.980
because I love flowers.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.100
But I don't like flowers
just because they are nice.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.340
I adore them because they
have, I think, a spirit.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.300
And in Mexico in the shamans
and in traditional medicine,

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.230
they use it to cure you.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:12.860
So we're going to invite
an expert in flowers

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.930
and the shaman culture to
show us to make powders

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.460
and colors with the flowers.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.329
So it's going to be amazing.

00:48:22.329 --> 00:48:24.370
SPEAKER: That's something
you really use use, no?

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.540
Currently like flowers
is left and right which--

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.530
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yeah,
and I adore it.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.863
SPEAKER: --is a core part of it.

00:48:28.863 --> 00:48:31.970
MARTHA ORTIZ: But I want to
use it more, but more as not

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.590
just as [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:39.170
I want the power of
these ingredients because

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:42.470
of the color, because
of the well being,

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.500
and because the
tradition, even, in

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.792
Mexican traditional medicine.

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:50.750
AUDIENCE: So we've touched
on this a little bit

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.333
before where we were
talking about how

00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:54.320
your style is very
different from what

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.030
most chefs are doing nowadays.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.870
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.161
AUDIENCE: Most chefs, as you
said, are very minimalist,

00:48:59.161 --> 00:49:02.000
and you really celebrate
femininity in your food.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.076
It's like very bold.

00:49:03.076 --> 00:49:04.075
MARTHA ORTIZ: Exuberant.

00:49:04.075 --> 00:49:04.666
Exuberant.

00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:07.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I remember
when I went to your restaurant

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.270
in Mexico City, you served these
incredible pineapple chips that

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.020
were in the shapes
of butterflies

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.700
and had edible glitter
on top of them.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.200
MARTHA ORTIZ: Of
course, I adore it.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.340
AUDIENCE: Which I thought--

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.756
I just-- as soon
as you served it,

00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:23.000
I thought this is so badass and
so bold of this woman in such

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.070
a male-dominated field to be
saying, eat butterflies, like,

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.190
this is who I am.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.220
MARTHA ORTIZ: Yes.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.530
AUDIENCE: And I
wonder in your career

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.710
how much pushback did you get
because very often if you're

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.840
doing something different,
people tell you, don't do that.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.660
That's wrong.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.590
MARTHA ORTIZ: A lot.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:41.020
AUDIENCE: And how did you come--

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.220
MARTHA ORTIZ: And I pay the
price, but I don't care.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.740
AUDIENCE: How did you
come to decide that,

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.660
and how did you come to
never doubt yourself?

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:51.500
Because there's this
tricky trade off,

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.350
I think, sometimes between
being self-confident and not

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:55.900
listening to feedback.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.320
So how did you
make sure that you

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.620
were finding the right path?

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.050
MARTHA ORTIZ: I always listen
to feedback about the flavors

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.000
because you need to
know, and people maybe

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.690
say, I don't like this, because
it has this taste, this, this.

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.780
But about the style, I
never asked to other cooks.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.140
I go with the artist.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.770
I remember that I built
this beautiful relation

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.900
with Ricardo Legorreta.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:21.040
And I remember that I go
running to his house, I show,

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:21.990
do you like it?

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:24.230
And he told me-- he was the
best architect in Mexico

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:25.580
and say, no.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.280
So I'd get back to
the kitchen and build

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.480
the salad in another way.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.530
Do you like it?

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.580
No.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:36.920
So I rem-- because I love
to hear from other artists.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.380
Sometimes I invite
Guillermo Kahlo, that

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.680
is this great Mexican
photographer, and I say,

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.320
do you think these
has this power

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.420
and this beauty of Mexico?

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:50.400
Yes, Martha, but
think in this way.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.830
So I always love to hear
that from another artist

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:59.810
more than another cook because
I think it's, as you said,

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.750
it's a temptation to be
like another person and more

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:04.880
in this global world.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.080
And I think you need
to listen, and I go--

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.570
and I never go to another
restaurant to have inspiration.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.300
I love to go to museums.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.580
I can be-- today I saw
that it was [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.446
in the National--

00:51:18.446 --> 00:51:20.800
in the Royal Academy.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.140
And I love the gold and the
purple of [INAUDIBLE] together.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.110
I want to see that because I--

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:30.170
and then I can go to Alexander
McQueen and say this is black,

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.400
and she's a woman--

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.880
she's a woman designer and say,
oh, Simone Rocha is putting,

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.850
you know, flowers,
all over the--

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:38.420
in her Instagram.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.820
I love that kind of inspiration,
and when I make the black menu

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.470
that I'm taking
to San Francisco,

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.680
I read Cesar Vallejo,
this poet that I adore,

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.550
that said so much love.
but nothing against death.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:57.170
And I start on that point.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.590
So I get inspired by
that kind of things.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.090
I can go to a
museum, and I start

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.803
crying because I think it's
too beautiful, you know?

00:52:04.803 --> 00:52:06.960
People look at me like this.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.430
But I cry because I think
it's overwhelming, you know?

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.050
I think where is
the beauty, I think

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:18.570
that when a person can create
beauty or more than that,

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:22.380
I think that our
lives have value

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.230
when you can share beauty.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:28.620
And beauty can be
defined a lot of things,

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:35.320
but beauty can be in love,
in power, in paintings.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.960
But I think that's our mission
in life to share beauty.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.190
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:45.160
I'm inspired now, Martha.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:49.140
MARTHA ORTIZ: That's what
I think in my small world.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:52.690
And at the same time, we
didn't talk about that.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:55.920
But I love to make
very healthy business

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.590
because then I can decide.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:03.130
So now that I'm
making this cafe,

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:07.240
I want that this cafe be very
strong, financially talking,

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.190
so I can make decisions.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:13.550
And I want to bring every
month [SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:14.842
We call it like that in Mexico.

00:53:14.842 --> 00:53:17.300
I don't know how to call it
here because they're not chefs.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.980
SPEAKER: The master
bread maker, like--

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.950
MARTHA ORTIZ:
Master bread maker.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:25.600
And I want that they can stay
in Mexico City for a month

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.410
and rent a very
nice home for them,

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:33.070
and share what they
have to share with us,

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.440
and give them all the respect.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.010
So I need to find a
lot of money and make

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.690
it very healthy to do that.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:46.680
So that's my point of view,
to make very strong business,

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:51.520
and if people doesn't like the
menu because of the glitter,

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.920
I don't care if
I think it's good

00:53:53.920 --> 00:54:00.230
if I think that the people who
I really respect it's good.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:01.730
I love to hear--

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.500
as you said, you
have to hear what

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.380
people say about the flavors.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:12.900
But I don't want to
be like any male chef.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.830
I adore being a woman.

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:16.510
I adore being a Mexican.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.270
I'm a very proud Mexican.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:25.020
And I remember that when
my grandfather gave me

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:30.450
these beautiful Filigrana
earrings with two drops.

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:35.070
And he told me,
and I believe him,

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:43.040
you are a princess
from Monte Alban.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:43.927
And I believe it.

00:54:43.927 --> 00:54:46.260
And I remember that all my
friends want to be, you know,

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.310
Marie Antoinette in the parties.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:49.730
No, I get dressed
like a Mexican.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:52.500
I say, I'm a Mexican princess.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.650
I adore it, you
know, because I think

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.930
Mexico's a very strong country.

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:59.910
We have a lot of
controversial right now.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.890
We need to work a lot.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.230
I think we have a big potential.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:09.150
I was very proud to see
that we are the 9 or the 11

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:10.660
economy of the world.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.290
So let's make it Mexicans.

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:13.495
Let's do it.

00:55:13.495 --> 00:55:17.375
Let's work every day and feel
proud of what we are doing.

00:55:17.375 --> 00:55:18.750
SPEAKER: I think
you were talking

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.730
about being a princess who
wants to be a princess.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.990
I think that you are
the queen now of--

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.990
MARTHA ORTIZ: Thank you.

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.680
Thank you.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:26.610
SPEAKER: --everything.

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.950
Please join me in
thanking Martha.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.700
[APPLAUSE]
