00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.080
A,

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 1>what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for</v>

3
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.680
Monday, February 27th, 2017 what's going

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.180
<v 2>one on how are you ?</v>

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.260
<v 1>how's it going? Sorry, the podcast is a little bit late this week. Um, you know,</v>

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.750
the fucking checkout was, you know,

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.430
10:00 AM at this place I was staying at and I thought I could sleep till 10 and

8
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.030
then do the fucking podcasts and leave at noon. That's what I thought. You know,

9
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.010
I'm sorry. Am I still in America? Checkout time is maybe 11.

10
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:34.450
Where the fuck is it? 10:00 AM

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.130
the fuck is Trump not president anymore? I mean,

12
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:41.350
I thought this was something that he thought he thought he was gonna make it

13
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.290
great again. Make it great again.

14
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.120
That'd be check out at one in the fucking afternoon.

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.670
Once you sign an executive order. If order for that orange headed content.

16
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.270
How about that? This podcast is not funny. It's sad.

17
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.800
It's a lonely man by himself. I'm sorry for the bad Trump impression.

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.400
Um, anyways, I am in Gainesville, Florida right now. You're probably wondering,

19
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.470
Bill, what the fuck are you doing in Gainesville, Florida,

20
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.250
home with the Florida gators? You know,

21
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.510
you're on there either on a fucking Monday. It's not football season.

22
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.400
Why are you here?

23
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:19.510
It's cause I have to do the makeup date for the show that I was going to do back

24
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:22.750
in November when I was going to go to the Florida gators game down there at the

25
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:23.770
fucking swamp.

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.630
I was going to do that and go to the Florida gator LSU game.

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.400
And um, that game got rained out. Whatever.

28
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:36.220
They had a fucking hurricane and everybody freaked out cause Jacksonville was

29
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.030
going to get the shit kicked out of him. Gay Gainesville was, you know,

30
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.510
as far as I'm concerned it was safe, you know,

31
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.230
with my complete lack of a meteorology logical background.

32
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:50.950
Is that the right word? I Dunno. So I'm back here. I'm back here, you know,

33
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.050
in February. Well, nothing's going on. Oh Shit.

34
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:56.920
What about that team?

35
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.530
What if they fuck a team has a good basketball team as a game tonight?

36
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.090
Maybe that's, maybe that's what's going on. I don't fucking know. Anyways.

37
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.670
Um, I'm here in fucking day. Uh, Gainesville, uh,

38
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.760
had a great time this whole weekend being out there and now Daytona,

39
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:16.210
Daytona Beach, Florida, and uh, Jesus Christ, dude,

40
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.320
some of the fucking locals in Daytona. Yeah. Heart just goes out to,

41
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.380
you know what I mean? It's just these, these fight all these dudes.

42
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.400
It's all those people that, that people in Hollywood trash,

43
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.660
you know what I mean? It's just a bunch of, you know,

44
00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:34.510
a lot of fucking white people that just,

45
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.770
Jesus' life is just fucking kicked the shit out of them.

46
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.040
Not saying everybody, but I'm just saying,

47
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.160
I fucking came into town

48
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.260
fucking walking down the street the first night I got video of this. I'm,

49
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:51.960
I'm walking.

50
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.720
There's like a fight about rate of breakout outside of a pizza joint and

51
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.700
everybody there was like my age, except they look my age, you know what I mean?

52
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.740
They might have a better hairline, which isn't hard with me,

53
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.810
but they're just fucking fat.

54
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.380
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.360
<v 1>Fucking big fat fucking, uh, what's that pride, those sex shit that people eat?</v>

56
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.580
That is it called that Shit Larry,

57
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:18.240
the cable guy talks about right where he goes fucking proud six 18 seat.

58
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.710
When you fucking go out and you eat a whole fucking pig and you stomach's like,

59
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:27.711
what the fuck you just do to me rather than natty the whole fucking pig again.

60
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:32.400
You can take this shit and make it feel like eating a whole pig itself is okay.

61
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.940
That shit, they had those bodies,

62
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.410
lot of cargo shorts that were just frayed at the bottom. A lot of bad tattoos.

63
00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:46.640
A lot of fucking people that look like, even if they weren't on drugs,

64
00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:48.680
you know when people do drugs for so fucking long,

65
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.850
there's only so coherent that you can get back to.

66
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.090
We went to this fucking restaurant right on the Strip and uh,

67
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.470
this fucking lady, Jesus Christ, if she wasn't high, she just don't,

68
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.280
she had just done so many fucking drugs. She bought the fucking wings over.

69
00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:11.570
Right. And they were like, they weren't ice cold. They will room temperature,

70
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:16.070
which is fucking ice cold. And I'm like, yeah. Uh, and I hate sending food back.

71
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.300
We're sitting in this fucking restaurant, right. And we sitting in a,

72
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.810
it's like basically a NASCAR, cause we're,

73
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.130
they had to go to the Daytona 500 the next day. Right.

74
00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:29.000
It's like a NASCAR that they cut in half and put a booth in the middle of it.

75
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:29.834
Right.

76
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.310
<v 4>Um,</v>

77
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.990
<v 1>assumption. I don't know what the fuck it is.</v>

78
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.590
And we looked up later and evidently this was the worst restaurant

79
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.190
me and Nate ended up going to this fucking thing.

80
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.270
Ended up being the worst restaurant. It wasn't bad. I ordered the fucking,

81
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.950
it looks shady and the music they were playing,

82
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.560
they were playing like Zz top. She's got legs.

83
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.480
They played George through a good twice. Uh,

84
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.640
they played yes. Owner of a lonely heart. I was just sitting there. It fell.

85
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.960
He goes,

86
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.710
in 1985 I was joking on stage that night I was waiting for fucking Marty McFly

87
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:07.710
to come walking in key word there,

88
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.950
fly and um,

89
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.040
to see some guy walking around sort of mouthing the words to this joint.

90
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.850
It wasn't even a good George Story. Good Song.

91
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.200
It wasn't bad to the bone or a whatever that fucking was one whiskey,

92
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:26.490
one scotch or one beer wasn't that one. It was at, uh,

93
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.690
the cover day that my bag dog,

94
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.970
my bitch don't come no more booming on over rock and on over.

95
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.650
It just said, I gone, oh my God.

96
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.163
<v 4>Um,</v>

97
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.350
<v 1>the waitress fucked up every possible way she could have fucked up other than</v>

98
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:48.320
just blowing your nose into the bread. I mean, other than that, she,

99
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:51.720
every fucking thing you could do, she fucked up. It was hilarious. I've,

100
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.180
I felt bad for, I could see, you know, she just, you know, we all do it.

101
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.900
We all do it in business. We stay out there too long. Madonna did it, you know,

102
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.640
she's still twerk and she's like 60.

103
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:05.300
It's like Madonna for the love of fucking God. Can you dress your age?

104
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.670
Okay Kid,

105
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:12.671
you have a shred of fucking decency for yourself so that people can just in a

106
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.480
general sense, look in your, your, your direction. You know what I mean?

107
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.230
There was a bunch of guys down on Daytona beach dressing the way Madonna was

108
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:24.591
dressing.

109
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:29.591
There was a bunch of fucking guys my age still wearing tank tops where your arms

110
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.490
have no muscle definition anymore. It's just us.

111
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.200
It looks like in order it looks like, it looks like,

112
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.890
you know when somebody has like cankles you know that part of the leg where it

113
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:41.900
just, you know, there's no shape to the calf.

114
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.640
That's what the arm looks like and it's all fucking flabby and just these awful

115
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.650
horrific fucking tattoos. I'm just shit.

116
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.150
And you pick off a wall,

117
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.630
somebody with the shakes just puts it on your fucking rms. So she comes over,

118
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.640
by the way, when you go into a place like that, cause once I sit down,

119
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.130
I'm not leaving. Just go with the grilled cheese.

120
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.250
You get a grilled cheese sandwich and what can they do? You know what I mean?

121
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.290
Fucking Nate ordered a Hamburg and I was just like, all right dude. You know,

122
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.790
but if you get fucking a bola,

123
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.190
I mean I don't want to hear your bitching about it or whatever. We equal lie,

124
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.680
whatever you get. And it was something with knee.

125
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.830
So she comes over and she's just like, Hey, well,

126
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.000
it was like one in the afternoon, the sun just fucking blaze into the windows.

127
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.710
He's just like, Hey, welcome. We're going to be a waitress to this is evening,

128
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.090
evening.

129
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.650
And she caught herself saying evening and she just fucking plowed forward. Uh,

130
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.310
you know, your guys' patch to third. Uh, then it was like, listen,

131
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.030
it was like literally like listening to a cell phone going in and out. Right.

132
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.733
And um,

133
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.370
she brings the fucking orders over and she kept going, how, how's your meat?

134
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.580
Which I've never heard anybody say that. I order a burger and the wings,

135
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.620
I've got a little dangerous with the fucking wings.

136
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.120
And I had the grilled cheese sandwich.

137
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:06.620
I think it was just too much for a fucking blown out brain to try to remember

138
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:08.030
what kind of protein we ordered.

139
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.730
So she just kept coming over and going as the inmate, she came over,

140
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.750
she gave me the Burger,

141
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.690
she gave Nate the fucking grilled cheese sandwich way to swing that fucking

142
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:19.190
thing around. The chicken was fucking stone cold.

143
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.480
And she says she started to like turn sideways when she fucked up the order and

144
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:27.170
she was like almost trying to hide behind her own shoulder. She was like, ah,

145
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:28.004
I'm sorry,

146
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.240
I have the manager take it off and really apologize and she fucking disappears

147
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:38.660
and comes back two seconds later, which was a big thing in Daytona

148
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.550
ordering food that should have taken at least 15 minutes.

149
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:45.290
And it returned in like two seconds.

150
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.800
It was very disturbing because the first night when we saw those fucking old

151
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:52.820
guys with the flabby arms pushing each other outside that fucking pizza parlor.

152
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 4>Um, well</v>

153
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.600
<v 1>let me, I'll take you through the whole fucking shit show.</v>

154
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.600
We went into this place that we thought was a Hooters,

155
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.070
a fucking Hooters. And I'm like, I'm not eating it here.

156
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.490
Any place that that is sort of in the sex industry.

157
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.490
It's got one foot in the sex industry. I'm not ordering food.

158
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.840
And so I went in there and got a beer and we walked in and the chicks didn't

159
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:16.674
have holders,

160
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.060
but they all had asses and they had shorts like up their ass.

161
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.260
Like half their fucking ass was hanging out. And it was just, you know,

162
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.180
it was a shit show. And we're trying to figure it out. We're like going,

163
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:30.811
what the fuck?

164
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:35.811
What the kind of fucking Hooters is holders finally admitting that hip hop went

165
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:40.320
mainstream about 25 years ago and now they're focusing on ashes.

166
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.700
And um, wasn't until the next day we walked out,

167
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:48.750
we realized it wasn't a Hooters. It was some wings joint and a,

168
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.330
I think they're going to put Hooters out of business cause I don't think people

169
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:53.670
care about tidies anymore. You know what I mean?

170
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.780
Plus you can have a nice rack and like your fucking ass could be as flat as a

171
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.790
Goddamn fucking desk desktop. Right. You know what I mean?

172
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.970
So then, then what do you guys, then you just gotta, you gotta get pair of tits,

173
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.920
you know, what do you, what are you gonna do with that?

174
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.700
I love an ass.

175
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.050
And you can't have a nice ass and be out of shape but just doesn't fucking work.

176
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:18.930
That is the nucleus of the body. If that's fucking in shape,

177
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.140
then everything else is fine. You could have a fucking pair of tits on.

178
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:25.920
You get what I mean? And it could just be a shit show when you go south.

179
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.520
You know what I mean? That's like a, you know guys, when they fucking, they,

180
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.740
they keep lifting weights, you know,

181
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.830
and they just keep trying to keep their chest out in front of their beer belly

182
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:37.200
and they keep pushing the jeans down further and further.

183
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:41.520
So they still have that 32 inch Jains you know, by the way,

184
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.600
I think white people were the first one to wear saggy jeans. You know,

185
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.800
I think we were the first ones to do it.

186
00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:53.801
And that was with the guys who just refuse to buy a 34 inch to 36 38 inch waist.

187
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.160
They just kept pushing it down and letting their fucking stomach come out over

188
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:02.960
the top. So anyways,

189
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.730
she's like hiding behind her shoulder, going on inside the manager,

190
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.100
take it out of there. So she fucking, uh, oh no, I know.

191
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:13.950
I remember I was trying to see how quickly the food came.

192
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:16.490
So the night before we went out, after we left the fucking, uh,

193
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.820
the bar where these girls had to walk around with half of their fucking hazards

194
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.440
hanging out. Um, and now that I'm a dad,

195
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:26.840
it was even worse. I just kept thinking,

196
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:28.730
what if my daughter ends up working this for what?

197
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.970
I wanted to meet the father of all these guys and be like,

198
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.660
what did you do that had them end up here? So I don't do it.

199
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:40.310
So my daughter doesn't end up here. So we go down the fucking street and uh,

200
00:11:40.311 --> 00:11:44.030
we go to this other fucking bar, do like they got a biker bar down there,

201
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:44.451
cause you know,

202
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:47.330
Daytona has that fucking crazy bike or we can some shit out here.

203
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.081
And I'm just like, all right,

204
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:51.710
I am not a biker and I'm not going to go in there and get fucking, you know,

205
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.180
I don't know. A pool, cute fucking shoved in my year. I don't need this shit.

206
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.650
Right. So we go to this other bar, it's sort of a sports bar. We walk in,

207
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:04.320
everything's cool. So I ordered some food, I go, let me get the,

208
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.660
uh, what's, what's the raw tuna? It's not Shashimi as a tuna tar, tar,

209
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.660
tar, tar. Is that what I ordered? You know, and,

210
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.930
and you know this fucking sports bar. Why would you,

211
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:18.480
why would you order raw fish in a place like that? It's fucking nuts.

212
00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:21.740
But I did and I ordered chips and salsa and I swear to gut,

213
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.970
this woman walked into the kitchen. They had the in, in the outdoor, you know,

214
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.581
the swinging doors.

215
00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:31.581
She walked in there and the Dolan permit [inaudible] and then she came walking

216
00:12:32.281 --> 00:12:36.000
right back out and with the fucking food, like to like disturbingly,

217
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.990
like it came back so fucking fast. The look on my face, Nate was fucking crying,

218
00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:45.390
laughing. And, uh,

219
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:49.560
all I can say about the food is you shouldn't have to chew raw tuna.

220
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.860
It should be like butter, like melts in your mouth kind of thing. And I,

221
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:56.530
and I was chewing this shit out of it.

222
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.530
So anyways, back to the fucking other places. You know,

223
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.320
this is so stupid that I'm fucking shitting on the food there.

224
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.530
When you're sitting in a fucking NASCAR that's been cut in half and they put a

225
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.530
fucking booth in the middle of it, can you really complain about the food? Well,

226
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:14.770
you know what, I have an hour to fill here. So I've gotten, um,

227
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.590
so this poor woman who, you know, probably had some Shitty Dad,

228
00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:21.070
she ended up doing drugs, is trying to get our fucking order right.

229
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.571
And you know,

230
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:26.950
the guys walking around and the words moving on over and uh,

231
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.710
this guy in the corner starts eating this burger dude.

232
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:32.770
And I can't even tell the way he was fucking attacking this burger.

233
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.740
I was crying, laughing and I had to let you know I had to do like that,

234
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.101
you know,

235
00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:42.030
you know when you're with somebody and you're the person you're laughing at kind

236
00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:44.610
of catches you looking at them and then you want your friend to look at them

237
00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:47.820
too. So you gotta do like that kind of that stretch thing where you look back.

238
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.590
Fortunately it was a flat flat screen TV above his head and I just sort of like

239
00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:54.210
without even like I'm from toilet Christian,

240
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.380
so I'm like just turn around and look at the today. You know,

241
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.480
did like one of those things and dude,

242
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.560
the way this guy would say he attacked this burger, like he,

243
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.600
he lunged at it rather than like, it was almost like his,

244
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.700
it was someone else was holding,

245
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:12.420
it was the woman who was trying to steal a bite of somebody else's burger.

246
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.010
That's the way this guy was eating.

247
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.550
Like his first bite into the Burger. He fucking lunged at, it's so hard.

248
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.020
He hit himself in the face with like the lettuce that this big piece of like

249
00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:27.750
fucking Romaine lettuce hanging off to sell whatever the fuck it was.

250
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:30.660
Iceberg lettuce. And when he lunged in at it,

251
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.720
like it fucking hit him in one of his eyes and he had a stop and blink and then

252
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:39.270
he just fucking, he came up higher and just lunged at it again.

253
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.590
He was eating it like a, like a fucking Komodo Dragon, you know,

254
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.510
they just sorta fucking lunge at something and just,

255
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.530
just saw and rip away as he was a fucking animal and every,

256
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.640
he would lunge at this thing. It was, I could not look at him and I was crying,

257
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:58.850
laughing of course by three bites.

258
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:03.620
He looked over and he caught me looking at him laughing and then I looked at

259
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:06.560
Nate and I pointed at the menu like I was laughing like, oh my God,

260
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:08.470
they have chicken fingers. Isn't that hilarious?

261
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.930
Like I was trying to somehow get away from it, but long story short,

262
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.770
the grilled cheese was all right. The fucking wings were horrific.

263
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:20.600
Even when they were actually heated up. They clearly made them hours ago,

264
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.640
the way they came over fucking ice cold.

265
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:26.570
And then they brought me some hot ones like three seconds later.

266
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.490
And so the lady comes over and she picks up our check.

267
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.390
She walks over the register in the,

268
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.540
and in that short amount of time she already forgot where we were sitting.

269
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.920
And then when she came back, you know, Nate picked up the check,

270
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:46.580
she gave it back to me. It was just was fucking horrific man.

271
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.613
<v 4>Um,</v>

272
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.710
<v 1>but other than that, they told the beach was beautiful. We did a show that,</v>

273
00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:55.700
and I always would be like, what are you shitting on? Fuck it. They taught her,

274
00:15:55.701 --> 00:16:00.040
fuck, we can't because that's what I saw. I didn't know where to go. So anyways,

275
00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:02.920
I um, I played the, uh,

276
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.350
I want to say PBT theater cause where I'm from, that's how you say Peabody,

277
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.280
the Peabody theater. It's like when you need, when you're in New York,

278
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:16.630
it's Carnegie Hall and when you're in Pittsburgh, it's Carnegie. All right.

279
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:18.020
When you're in Massachusetts, it's,

280
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.220
it's Peabody and everywhere else it's Peabody.

281
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.370
So we played the Peabody theater. I had a great time,

282
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:28.180
did an hour and 20 minutes, you know, all new shit,

283
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.730
shit that got left off of other hours. Just had a great fucking time.

284
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.590
The crowd was awesome, got a bunch of heckles, but they were all great. I liked,

285
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.330
I liked that shit. I don't mind when people yell out.

286
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.403
<v 4>Um,</v>

287
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.260
<v 1>you know, to a point I don't mind it.</v>

288
00:16:43.261 --> 00:16:45.480
And I had a good time and I made a point of saying that,

289
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.360
cause sometimes people in the crowd was sorry for all the fucking heckles.

290
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.250
I enjoy it. I don't mind a lively drunk ass crowd. I'm a fucking drunk.

291
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.070
Okay. And now that I've shit on everybody,

292
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.620
you know that I met basically in a 12 hour period in Daytona.

293
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.783
<v 4>Um,</v>

294
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.210
<v 1>let's talk about the, uh, we went to the race the next day and by the way,</v>

295
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.620
thank you to everybody who came out to the show.

296
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:12.320
I mean it was such a big fucking event the next day.

297
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.150
I mean they should have been three people in the crowd.

298
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.060
So the fact that it was sold out was fucking amazing. So thank you to everybody.

299
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.570
I will definitely be back. Um,

300
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.570
but I will not be eating at that fucking place with the cars that are side in

301
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:24.404
half.

302
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.000
<v 4>Um,</v>

303
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.340
<v 1>so anyways, plowing ahead here. So the next day we go to the race and uh,</v>

304
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.310
we weren't really thinking that there's going to be 250,000 fucking people.

305
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.920
That's like two and a half rose bowls all descending on the same fucking the

306
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:45.170
same place. So all the locals are going like, Oh man,

307
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:48.030
I'm just staying in tomorrow. That's gonna be a shit show, blah blah blah,

308
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.390
blah blah. And when I had driven from the airport, you know, when you get off,

309
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.300
what's so fucking cool when you get off at the airport,

310
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.710
you can actually hear them racing. You know, I think there was a truck racist,

311
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.660
some shit like that. I keep the land, you know,

312
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.260
I didn't get into like fucking one in the morning at midnight actually.

313
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.380
So the race was already overboard. Nick got there and you could hear him racing.

314
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.010
You pull out, you can see the fucking day,

315
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.780
Tony International fucking speedway, which is amazing, right? Legendary place.

316
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.400
And as you drive and buy this,

317
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.970
all these fucking people in RVs and all that hanging out,

318
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:25.971
wait to go on the race and do these people do not fuck around

319
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.220
the way they were doing it up.

320
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:31.350
Like it's the way I wish we did it at the Rose Bowl.

321
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.380
Like I've never seen so many like,

322
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:35.960
<v 3>okay,</v>

323
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.340
<v 1>I mean legit like you could,</v>

324
00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:40.940
you could like a rock star could tour in some of these fucking mobile homes,

325
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.790
um, in the setups that they had and the fucking flat screen TVs,

326
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.630
you know,

327
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.630
on the outside with the generator and they had smokers going and everybody just

328
00:18:52.821 --> 00:18:55.910
having a great fucking time waiting for this race to happen.

329
00:18:55.911 --> 00:19:00.290
And evidently people who park on the infield can get there like something like a

330
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:03.200
week or 10 days. They've just been in there

331
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.960
as these guys are fucking driving around. Um, the track, you know,

332
00:19:08.961 --> 00:19:10.910
getting ready to go to the race and all that, you know,

333
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.910
testing out their cars and shit. Um,

334
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.970
qualifying for pole position or whatever the fuck it is that they're doing.

335
00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:18.590
These people are sitting there like to me though,

336
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.750
that's that those a die hard fans, right?

337
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.380
So we ended up calling a fucking Uber, um,

338
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.720
the venue the night before hooked us up with this guy, this driver. And um,

339
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.750
he knew all these back ways to get there, which was a godsend.

340
00:19:34.751 --> 00:19:37.780
And he got us like right to where it says, um,

341
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.200
Daytona International speedway and uh,

342
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.470
Nate Barr got C's like hooked up with some of those NASCAR guys and they came by

343
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:45.640
about 20 minutes later,

344
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.330
picked us up in this little golf cart and just gave us the,

345
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.310
the total VIP treatment.

346
00:19:51.311 --> 00:19:56.110
And this is the one thing I will say about NASCAR versus the NFL is the level of

347
00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.570
fan access to all these different do you can,

348
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:03.430
you could walk right down onto pit row.

349
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.920
We were sitting on the track before the race,

350
00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:08.650
like a couple hours before the race. They let you go up there.

351
00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:12.370
Everybody was like taking pictures at the finish line. And um,

352
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:18.160
one thing I couldn't believe was how fucking small it is as far as the width of

353
00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:22.030
it. It's like these people will go three side-by-side, 200 miles an hour.

354
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.990
They were out of their minds. Um, you got to be right down there on pit row.

355
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.140
Um, I met Mario Andretti, got to shake his hand and uh,

356
00:20:32.141 --> 00:20:33.370
that was another thing too, like the,

357
00:20:33.371 --> 00:20:37.690
just the array of like famous people that were there.

358
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.330
I guess the appeal of NASCAR was fucking nuts. Like you'd see Mario Andretti,

359
00:20:43.331 --> 00:20:48.250
which makes sense. Race car driver. I saw Gronkowski

360
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.650
um, guy fee airy. Uh,

361
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.670
who else? There was some fucking model, this gorgeous model there.

362
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.180
Kiano Reeves, LaDainian Tom Wilson. It was just fucked.

363
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.890
It was like all over the fucking map and you'd see like, oh that guy,

364
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.080
he's the senator of fucking, you know, whatever, South Carolina.

365
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.203
<v 4>Um,</v>

366
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.630
<v 1>we got to go in and you know,</v>

367
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.060
we got to sit in on like the drivers meeting and all of that,

368
00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:19.560
which is really fucking interesting.

369
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.290
I thought it was just going to be the drivers and like four of us,

370
00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:27.291
but it was this giant fucking room where they let this whole crowd go into is

371
00:21:27.481 --> 00:21:31.140
just sitting there talking to the drivers going, all right. Uh, you know,

372
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.810
it's been a lot of, uh,

373
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.840
trying to bump guys off the track into the fucking stands.

374
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.390
You gotta stop doing that. I mean, I don't know what,

375
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.360
I didn't even know what they was saying.

376
00:21:39.361 --> 00:21:42.540
I was kind of sitting behind the guy so I couldn't quite hear him. But, um,

377
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.820
I mean, I can't imagine going into like a fucking any NFL game,

378
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.610
but he got to hear the referees talking to the head coaches before the game.

379
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:52.680
You know, the NFL is like the God Damn CIA.

380
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.960
You can't get anywhere near anything. So, um, we ended up, uh,

381
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.810
watching the race from the infield and uh,

382
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.270
you know, I knew some people there. So you, at one point we were with, um,

383
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.190
the people from Cisco brewery down on Nantucket. If you ever go to Nantucket,

384
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.750
um, crazy good beer. And then they got the, this vodka,

385
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:18.840
they had like this blueberry vodka and cranberry vodka that you're fucking

386
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.273
ladies gonna love.

387
00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.973
<v 4>And, um,</v>

388
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.040
<v 1>we hung with them for awhile and then we also were at this other fucking place</v>

389
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:30.700
in, Ah, our view was absolutely insane. It was a bunch of fucking,

390
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.730
I dunno, crashes and cautions. It's the fucking race took forever. But, um,

391
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.350
I dunno. I can't, I still can't believe that I got to go, go to it.

392
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:43.900
But thank you to everybody at NASCAR for hooking us up.

393
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:45.480
<v 4>And, um,</v>

394
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.480
<v 1>I'm trying to remember who the fuck one was at. Kyle Bush cow Bush one. Right.</v>

395
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.440
I went there and I just routed for fucking Dale Earnhardt jr Jr. You know,

396
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:55.390
it's been so long since I've watched NASCAR. I'm like,

397
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.940
is Jeff Gordon still racing? It's like, Nah, he's retired.

398
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.940
Like everybody I knew was gone. Like I,

399
00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:04.030
I watched it big time in the early fucking eighties, late seventies,

400
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:08.740
early eighties when it was like Bobby Alanson, Cale Yarborough,

401
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.420
Harry Gant, Richard Petty. I saw him when like his last Daytona 500.

402
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.040
I'm like 81 or something, um, than Cale Yarborough won two years in a row.

403
00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:22.450
Then it was a bill Elliot era. And, um, I don't know. Somewhere around there,

404
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:25.300
I was trying to get through college and I started doing standup and I kind of

405
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:30.230
lost touch with it, but I, I still paid attention, um, right through, uh,

406
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.050
the Dale Earnhardt years and, uh, I dunno, I haven't watched it in a minute,

407
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:38.080
but it's fucking amazing dude. The whole thing.

408
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.330
It was just such an amazing experience and I'm a, I don't know,

409
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.050
maybe I'll go to Talladega. Who knows? I think that one's in May. We'll see.

410
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.460
But the big thing I was excited about was the fact that, uh,

411
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.060
I was able to do like an hour and 20 minutes and not bore people shit that

412
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.180
they'd already heard before. So, um, you know,

413
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:57.280
that's like the big fear when you go back out on the road after you had a

414
00:23:57.281 --> 00:23:58.660
special commodities, you're like, all right,

415
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.470
how do I fucking do a bunch of new shit without fucking these people over?

416
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.420
Sorry, I'm adjusting the microphone here without fucking these people over. Um,

417
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.940
and I'm still thinking that I was funny,

418
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.150
especially after going on after Nate Barr. Gutsy.

419
00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:18.151
Who by the way is I'm one of like six people that got half hours on a,

420
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.540
on Netflix. I think Netflix is trying to do like the HBO one night stands.

421
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.640
So he was running his ready to tape special in front of me and that guy's one of

422
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:30.800
the best joke writers I know and he fucking murdered.

423
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:34.000
So I was relieved that I was able to, uh,

424
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:38.270
go on after him and have a good time. So anyways, is it time? Yeah.

425
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.350
How about a little bit of advertising here? Everybody? All right. Where are we?

426
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.213
<v 4>Okay.</v>

427
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.300
<v 1>Wandering the fuck is this stuff. Never heard of this one.</v>

428
00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.340
Wondery um, here's a podcast you should listen to. Wait a minute,

429
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.120
I'm somebody else's podcast is advertising on my podcast. Yeah.

430
00:24:57.121 --> 00:25:00.790
Don't listen to my podcast. Listen to this one. All right. What?

431
00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.650
I remember this shit. This one's actually sounded cool. All right. Uh, secrets,

432
00:25:04.651 --> 00:25:09.330
crimes and audio tape. It's a podcast that has a different story every week.

433
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.710
Uh, this week story is called, this is not a Banksy.

434
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.410
It's about a guy who wakes up in the morning and realizes Banksy drew on his

435
00:25:19.411 --> 00:25:23.380
ass. Who the fuck is Banksy?

436
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.760
He gets it tattooed and now people want to collect his ass.

437
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:32.590
It doesn't go well. It was, it has high production values.

438
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:37.600
It's funny. And Mario Lopez is the guest star. Go listen to it. All right.

439
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.170
This is why I liked that podcast is because it sounds different and it also,

440
00:25:41.171 --> 00:25:45.880
the copy was nice and short. Is Banksy? Uh, he's an, he's an artist, right?

441
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.580
I only know this because Nia is into all that shit. Let me,

442
00:25:48.581 --> 00:25:49.570
let me look this fucking up.

443
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.630
So he drew on somebody's ass and then he had a tattooed

444
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.723
<v 4>and now what?</v>

445
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.920
<v 1>Who the fuck is Banksy? Banksy is an anonymous English-based graffiti artists,</v>

446
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.460
political activists and film director. Weave is anonymous.

447
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:11.270
How come they know who he is? Um, have on verified identity. Oh,

448
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:14.810
there you go. There's satirically street art and subversive.

449
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.020
Well then how the fuck did this guy know Banksy drew on his ass?

450
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:20.563
<v 4>Okay,</v>

451
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.760
<v 1>man, he's got great work.</v>

452
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.770
I want to judge them on the two that are on his Wikipedia page. Oh,

453
00:26:26.771 --> 00:26:31.180
these are amazing. What a talented son of a bitch. He must be really shy.

454
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:34.530
<v 4>Um,</v>

455
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.300
<v 1>so he does this in England. What if it's one of his,</v>

456
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.720
somebody from the royal family. And the reason why they don't say it is because,

457
00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:44.580
you know, graffiti is looked down upon by the, uh, the aristocrats, you know,

458
00:26:44.581 --> 00:26:49.560
stop drawing on our buildings. Um, maybe that's who it is.

459
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:51.270
So I guess he drew on somebody's ass.

460
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

461
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.140
<v 1>Somebody who knows him well. Well, I'm surprised the, uh,</v>

462
00:26:57.141 --> 00:27:00.830
the Illuminati doesn't kidnap that dude and his ass and it goes,

463
00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:02.360
tell me who the fuck Banksy is.

464
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:08.300
Tell me who Banksy is or I'll fucking scalp your ass and that painting and then

465
00:27:08.301 --> 00:27:11.750
your ass won't work and it won't be worth shit. How about that? No Pun intended.

466
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.520

questions for this week. Dollar Shave Club, which was the first one.

536
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:33.280
The first one was the, uh, the Banksy.

537
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.220
Banksy fucking tattooed my ass. Um, all right.

538
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:42.410
Oh by the way, everybody, uh, I mentioned lately that uh, I'm,

539
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.360
I'm going to be certain posts, some videos up to my youtube, my youtube page.

540
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.350
Uh, I'm going to a bunch of videos from the Daytona 500. I'm going to have, um,

541
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.100
at www.youtube.com/users/monday morning podcast.

542
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.950
I'm going to give the fucking video to my guy this week.

543
00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:02.090
He's going to edit it and get the shit up there. Okay. I'll,

544
00:32:02.091 --> 00:32:06.790
I'll tweet about it when it gets up there. All right, so speaking of stamps,

545
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.590
I bought some stamps today.

546
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.620
I did not use stamps.com I was driving from a Daytona beach up here to

547
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:18.290
Gainesville. And rather than going like the highway way, I,

548
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.670
I took the longer route cause I want to see some shit. Right?

549
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.070
Like going by this fucking, my brother told me it's called folk art.

550
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.310
I guess I drove by this woman's house. So this guy's house.

551
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.510
Otherwise I thought it was a woman,

552
00:32:32.511 --> 00:32:37.160
but you don't have like a giant tyrannosaurus rex, a fucking bull,

553
00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.870
like kicking his legs up. Like all these

554
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.040
things that you can put on your fucking lawn, I guess.

555
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.200
I don't know what all this crazy stuff that, you know,

556
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.390
you don't see that when you take 75 north,

557
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.840
it's just going to be a bunch of Arby's. We got the meats.

558
00:32:51.841 --> 00:32:55.320
It's going to be the same fucking 10 chains and a god Damn Walmart.

559
00:32:55.321 --> 00:32:58.930
I've seen that a zillion times, but if he, if he take the old school, the,

560
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.640
the fucking route 66 Jack Kerouac ways, it takes longer,

561
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.930
but you see a bunch of cool shit. So I was fucking driving along there and uh,

562
00:33:06.931 --> 00:33:10.350
I came upon a post office and Lo and behold, I had a,

563
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.530
I had a built that I need to pay and I didn't have a fucking stamp.

564
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.450
So I fucking Poland and the locals that are in there and I'm listening to this

565
00:33:18.451 --> 00:33:22.660
guy tell this fucking hilarious story. Um, first of all,

566
00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:23.680
I love the pace of it too.

567
00:33:23.681 --> 00:33:26.740
I love the pace of a small town where I don't give a shit that this guy's

568
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.230
telling his story. He's such a fucking character. I'm enjoying it.

569
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.670
I'm already second in line cause there's nobody fucking there. Right.

570
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.780
And he's telling his story about how somebody cut him off.

571
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

572
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.421
<v 1>You know,</v>

573
00:33:39.421 --> 00:33:43.080
and he's not driving too fast so than the woman behind the counter then tells

574
00:33:43.081 --> 00:33:45.540
her story about how she was doing 15,

575
00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:49.350
someone pulled out in front of her and her son and his son blew the horn and

576
00:33:49.351 --> 00:33:51.360
when they pulled up next to him at a red light,

577
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:56.750
the guy fucking had had a pistol and he fucking just brought it up looking at

578
00:33:56.881 --> 00:33:58.770
him like, you know, pointing at the ceiling of his car.

579
00:33:58.771 --> 00:34:02.100
He just sort of brought it up like that. And then the guy's like,

580
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.650
egos can't do that. Can't do that.

581
00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:07.890
I write that such a terrorist act that's branded should brandishing a weapon.

582
00:34:07.891 --> 00:34:11.030
And you start talking about brandishing a weapon. You can't do that.

583
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.870
That'll make somebody want to, uh, you know,

584
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.160
do some sort of self defense is what's up. It was saying, and I was just like,

585
00:34:17.161 --> 00:34:21.810
this is fucking crazy out here. But actually I think that they said that, that,

586
00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:25.290
that happened up in a Charlotte or something like that.

587
00:34:25.291 --> 00:34:27.990
I guess the road rage is off the fucking chains. It's in Charlotte,

588
00:34:27.991 --> 00:34:30.090
North Carolina. That's what I love about a small town.

589
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.400
I never would have heard that, you know,

590
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.740
just fucking guy with his white uncle Jesse Beard, tell a story,

591
00:34:37.741 --> 00:34:38.880
brandishing a weapon.

592
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.190
And I was just sitting there totally not even given a fuck that I was standing

593
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:44.190
in line at the post office,

594
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:48.990
completely enjoying this story and praying to God that this guy then took out

595
00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:52.860
his weapon cause I wanted, I wanted to see where this was going to go next.

596
00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:54.150
But you know, they didn't say anything like,

597
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.610
oh I should've got his license plate and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Um,

598
00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.960
I dunno think that's why I stay off the 75 north.

599
00:35:00.961 --> 00:35:03.960
Cause I never would have heard that. You know, if I'd stayed on the 75 north,

600
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.070
I would have heard, you know, uh, can I get the fucking a,

601
00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.690
can I get a double cheeseburger with the bucket liberal blue?

602
00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.210
I don't wanna hear that shit. Oh,

603
00:35:12.211 --> 00:35:14.430
I know a lot of you guys are expecting me to talk about the Oscars,

604
00:35:14.431 --> 00:35:19.210
but I didn't watch them. Okay. I don't watch award shows unless I'm home.

605
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.750
If I'm home, then, uh,

606
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.700
my wife's watching them and then I watch it with her because I like making fun

607
00:35:27.701 --> 00:35:31.330
of them while she watches them cause it makes her mad. She doesn't get mad mad,

608
00:35:31.331 --> 00:35:34.450
but she gets like upset. But uh, I heard about the, the big,

609
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:39.030
the big fucking thing there in the end where a Warren Beatty came out and he's

610
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:41.700
like a little wet are for the best picture.

611
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.880
2017 goes though La la land.

612
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:47.610
And evidently the poor people from la La land went up.

613
00:35:47.611 --> 00:35:51.780
There were two speeches in before they realized that it was actually going to

614
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:56.550
moonlight, starring Civil Sam Shepard and Bruce Willis, I believe.

615
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.510
Um, I dunno what the fuck happened.

616
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.540
All I know is once I heard that that happened, I didn't want to watch it.

617
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:04.880
You know, I don't,

618
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.670
I don't like watching people like that level of fucking awkwardness, you know?

619
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

620
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.040
<v 1>I just seen Warren Beatty be that fucking old.</v>

621
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.900
I just realized his last fucking name was what that fucking robot was saying on

622
00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.790
close, not close encounters. What was that? What does that stupid fucking shit?

623
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:25.590
Buck Rogers where they had that little stupid fucking robot go. Yeah.

624
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.990
<v 5>BDB BDB does he say baby baby, baby baby.</v>

625
00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.070
<v 1>There was a stupid, like somebody came up,</v>

626
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.210
but somebody sitting in a fucking writers room and they're like, all right,

627
00:36:37.211 --> 00:36:40.570
star wars is all the rage. We gotta somehow make money off this.

628
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.600
How are we going to do buck Rogers? That doesn't seem that bad.

629
00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:47.500
I mean it was around before star wars and one of the things we got to have like

630
00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:51.370
an r two d two and a c three Po and the network's like, well,

631
00:36:51.371 --> 00:36:54.970
we're not fucking ironman to actors. It's gonna be too expensive.

632
00:36:54.971 --> 00:36:58.450
Combined both characters and stick a fucking midget and that goddamn suit.

633
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.400
All right. Sorry. All right, we'll see three pos.

634
00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.780
Kind of a fucking smart cut with an English accent.

635
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:09.550
I would just have this thing be a moron. It just, yeah, it has a catch phrase.

636
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.330
I don't know. What's the catch? What you fucking come up with it.

637
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.340
And the writers are probably so pissed. All right,

638
00:37:15.341 --> 00:37:18.070
let's just come up with the dumbest shit we can possibly say and see what this

639
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:22.210
fucking industry person says. I, he is a little fucking,

640
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.240
he looks like a little kid, George Washington,

641
00:37:25.241 --> 00:37:30.070
but he's painted all silver and he's made out of metal. And before he talks,

642
00:37:30.071 --> 00:37:30.820
he walks around, he goes, yeah,

643
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.230
<v 5>baby, baby, baby, baby.</v>

644
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.090
<v 1>You know, and then they just sat there and they kept the fucking straight face.</v>

645
00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:38.520
And that's one of those moments in life, you know,

646
00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:42.300
when you throw it on the table, you know, you're looking at that person,

647
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.390
they looking at you and it becomes one of those moments where whoever talks

648
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:49.710
first loses and you just fucking wait it out. And then the fucking person goes,

649
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.170
ah, yeah, go with that. And they're like, great, awesome.

650
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.710
Well let's go do some cocaine. It's not fucking addicting, right?

651
00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.150
It's fucking the late seventies. Um, yeah. So I didn't, I didn't see, uh,

652
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.123
I didn't see any of it.

653
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.950
Sorry. I know I got a bunch of tweets.

654
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:11.490
Can't wait to hear your take on the Oscars. I did not see what I did see.

655
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.030
Was that the fucking Boston Bruins one again? One again,

656
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.990
it all my fucking wine in about wine and about, uh, you know,

657
00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.640
them getting rid of clothed Julian. Uh, according to Bob Beers,

658
00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.510
the Bruins are playing much looser and more confident under Bush. Bruce Cassidy,

659
00:38:28.511 --> 00:38:32.950
sorry, should I say Bush? Bruce Cassidy. Um, so with the new man on the bench,

660
00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:34.480
the Boston Bruins look like a new team.

661
00:38:34.481 --> 00:38:38.740
The bees are and one since Bruce Cassidy took over as interim coach averaging

662
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:42.850
four goals per game while scoring the first and six of those contests,

663
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.510
they exploded for six goals and Sundays matinee went over the stars.

664
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:51.430
But the stars suck this year and a 98.5, this sports hub,

665
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.930
Bruins analyst Bob Beers says he's seen a much looser and more confident team.

666
00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.980
Uh, take the ice since Cassidy took over for Clo Julian,

667
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.280
they have a little more leash and a little more freedom to make some plays down

668
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:05.320
to the point where they're being reckless or carried away,

669
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:07.150
leaving themselves exposed. At the other end,

670
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.900
but they're encouraged to play more offensively. Um,

671
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.250
I gotta tell you, man, they've been playing great, so I don't know what it is.

672
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:19.840
So, you know, I guess I was wrong. I still think Khloe,

673
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:22.000
Julian's a fucking great coach. What are you gonna do? Maybe.

674
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:25.390
Maybe everybody needed to change, you know, maybe that's what it is.

675
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:28.540
Like you stay with the same person for awhile. He just gets sick of them.

676
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.300
You know? And this is like the new girlfriend. You're all excited.

677
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.630
You can go all the old places, but it's new for the both of you to go there.

678
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.960
I don't know. All I know is it's fucking working.

679
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.360
And I absolutely loved,

680
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.500
loved the Boston Celtics not making a move before the trade deadline.

681
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.840
I think that was fucking genius. It was.

682
00:39:49.841 --> 00:39:54.430
It would have been so fucking stupid to give up draft picks and in some players

683
00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:55.540
that we had, you know,

684
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:59.890
that they were gonna want like Marcus smart and fucking Jae Crowder and a bunch

685
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:00.760
of draft picks.

686
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:04.390
At the very least we were going to have to fucking give up that to bring in who?

687
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:05.470
Carmelo Anthony.

688
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.253
<v 6>You know</v>

689
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.041
<v 1>who's, who's going to,</v>

690
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:11.980
he's going to tell fucking everybody to clear out and then not get back on d.

691
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:12.814
You don't need that shit.

692
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.660
And even if he got us past the Cavaliers when nobody's beaten the fucking

693
00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:18.460
warriors this year, or we're certainly not.

694
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.740
You give up all of that shit to do what?

695
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.090
Come in second place instead of fourth. Who gives a fuck?

696
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.680
Who gives a fuck? This is the Boston Celtics.

697
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.510
We got to win another championship.

698
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.220
The Lakers are lying about the amount of fucking champions championships they

699
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:39.580
have. They padded their resume with one. We need to win another one.

700
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:42.610
Put a little distance between them and I think this fucking move right here.

701
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.020
Being patient enough to just say, no, we're staying in the goddamn course.

702
00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.320
We've got all these draft picks. You know? Who knows?

703
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:53.440
Maybe that kid from Duke comes out a Tatum,

704
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.070
maybe he's one and done. Who knows? You know they got that.

705
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:58.960
Who's that other kid that some kid on Kansas,

706
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.300
I guess he's like a point guard or something like that.

707
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:03.760
I don't know what the fuck we need. I don't know shit about basketball,

708
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.690
but I love not giving into the stupid pressure that you know you're supposed to

709
00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:12.160
make a move, you know that'll make you better in the short run,

710
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:15.100
but fuck you. Fuck over all the work you've been doing over the last three,

711
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:19.900
four years. So Danny, age, Danny Age. Love it.

712
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.680
Absolutely love it. All right, let's do some reads for this week because

713
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:29.110
I'm actually going to drive down to Tampa tonight and I'm going to go, uh,

714
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:34.980
I'm going to go to the fucking Tampa Bay lightning versus the fucking auto with

715
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.780
senators game tonight. Palm never been to a game. Then we'll see how it is.

716
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:41.540
All right, four reads. All right. This is what I got here. Oh,

717
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.200
four reads was the advertising. It's not for questions. Let me get rid of that.

718
00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:49.420
Okay. Boyfriend birthday gift. Hey there,

719
00:41:49.421 --> 00:41:52.360
Billy birthday boy, my boyfriend,

720
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:58.170
my man recently celebrated a birthday and I contemplated for weeks what I would

721
00:41:58.361 --> 00:42:01.990
get them after listening to many podcasts episode,

722
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.150
I picked up on your advice to freshly single men. Uh,

723
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.470
get yourself all the sports packages.

724
00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.450
I took all Billy boys advice and bought my guy a subscription for NHL TV.

725
00:42:13.451 --> 00:42:18.280
All these shit. You're a fucking angel for the remainder of the hockey season.

726
00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:22.760
Parenthesis go pens. That's great too. So he and his and his team is a,

727
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.621
a contender,

728
00:42:23.621 --> 00:42:28.420
so it'll be fun to watch and NFL Sunday ticket for the upcoming football season.

729
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.930
He's beyond thrilled. Of course he is.

730
00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:35.710
Thanks for the laughs and most importantly, thanks for the birthday suggestion.

731
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.200
Alright ladies, did you hear that?

732
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.920
You know what's great about all of that shit is it's so fucking easy to do.

733
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.610
That's one phone call. You don't have to go out and go shop.

734
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.480
You don't have to go get something fucking engraved. It's perfect.

735
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.360
And if anybody wants to outdo this woman,

736
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.870
you know what you do is you get them the perfect chair to sit there and watch,

737
00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.130
you know.

738
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:03.690
And then what you do is you get life insurance and as he slowly eats and drinks

739
00:43:03.691 --> 00:43:06.690
himself to death watch and all these sports, you know,

740
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:07.980
you're going to win either way.

741
00:43:07.981 --> 00:43:11.190
Either he's going to be around and he's going to be this big lovable fucking,

742
00:43:11.191 --> 00:43:11.700
you know,

743
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.570
grizzly bear over there watching his games or he's going to fucking die and

744
00:43:15.571 --> 00:43:20.430
you're going to get paid. You know, there you go. Good for you.

745
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.560
That's a, that's a great gift. I would love that. I would that,

746
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.160
I would be thrilled with that gift. Alright. Who versus whom?

747
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.010
Ah, a little aristocrat fucking compensation here. Uh, the actual rule,

748
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.980
I always get these confused and I love that you guys are going to fucking help

749
00:43:34.981 --> 00:43:36.930
me out here. Cause I actually used spoon the other day.

750
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.960
Somebody told me that when you use who is,

751
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.310
is if you could substitute it with he or she. But if you're talking about uh,

752
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.260
they are us or a Soliloquy, then you use home. I don't know.

753
00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:54.150
Anyways, he said the actual rule to you is who? With the subject in whom?

754
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:59.700
Oh, the actual rule is to use who with the subject. In whom?

755
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.390
With the object. So it's the subject like a person.

756
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.880
No, I don't. I, I'll never get this done.

757
00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

758
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.450
<v 1>It's like live versus lay.</v>

759
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.900
The baby on the bed lies down,

760
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.250
but when you put the baby on the bed, the baby is laid down.

761
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.513
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

762
00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.650
<v 1>all right. Like how was that supposed to help me? All right,</v>

763
00:44:26.651 --> 00:44:29.020
let's try and figure out the subject of the object. Oh my God.

764
00:44:29.021 --> 00:44:31.650
I'm going to start fucking hyperventilating. This takes me to high school.

765
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:33.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

766
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:37.130
<v 1>They call on you like, I don't know. I don't know.</v>

767
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.380
Just give me a fucking zero.

768
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.630
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

769
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.690
<v 1>Jesus Christ. Are We fucking tied? You got to call on me.</v>

770
00:44:43.691 --> 00:44:46.330
I don't know the answer before you figure out you need to call on somebody else.

771
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.290
Quarterback keeps throwing to somebody to keep dropping the ball. They they,

772
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:55.090
they go to somebody else. Fucking idiot. Punt. All right.

773
00:44:55.091 --> 00:44:59.490
The baby on the bed lies down. All right,

774
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:03.420
so the baby is, the subject is the bed, the object,

775
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:08.040
but when you put the baby on the bed, that's an object. The baby's laid down.

776
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.330
All right, well what the fuck?

777
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:14.960
Who laid the baby down versus Billy boo?

778
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:19.560
Blue balls laid home down. All right, I got to slow down.

779
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:20.940
Who laid the baby down?

780
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:22.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

781
00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.630
<v 1>Who laid the baby down? You did.</v>

782
00:45:25.631 --> 00:45:30.130
You did shoot that boys and Arrow through my, huh? Shoot.

783
00:45:30.131 --> 00:45:33.970
That boy is narrow. Thank you. Good night. Took me back.

784
00:45:33.971 --> 00:45:35.980
I always sing that song to Nia and I always say,

785
00:45:35.981 --> 00:45:37.360
whoever sinks that fucking song,

786
00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:40.060
you know that they close with it and then that's how they end that song.

787
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:45.360
That's how they ended. They go shoot that poison Arrow to buy. Ah,

788
00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:50.520
shoot that poison arrow. Thank you. Good night. Yeah, the surprise ending.

789
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.000
Oh, I thought you gotta go through my heart again, but you didn't. All right,

790
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:58.030
so who laid the baby down? All right.

791
00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.123
<v 3>Okay.</v>

792
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.010
<v 1>Versus Billy balls laid whom down.</v>

793
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.983
Okay.

794
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:09.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

795
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.920
<v 1>Who laid the baby? Okay, so if I went like,</v>

796
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:13.170
<v 3>yeah,</v>

797
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.820
<v 1>who drank all his fucking beer?</v>

798
00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.520
Billy blue balls.

799
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:20.540
<v 3>Okay,</v>

800
00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.490
<v 1>well it's who drank all the beer. I can't fucking do it.</v>

801
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:29.290
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

802
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.930
<v 1>who drank all this beer? How can I keep plug that in.</v>

803
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.110
All right, well somebody says something about a baby. I have a baby my life,

804
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:41.610
so I have a chance I can at least get that one right. Oh,

805
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:45.120
Jesus sent right back down to the minors. Yeah. Once again,

806
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:49.170
he grounds into an inning ending. Double play. Fucking kill that goddamn dream.

807
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.360
I, well I don't understand. I just don't fucking get,

808
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.820
this has been explained to me. 50 million.

809
00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:59.010
I never understood how fucking planes flew.

810
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:03.120
And then I got my pilots license and they were able to fucking explain it to me.

811
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.230
Who laid the baby down

812
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.490
versus Billy blue balls laid whom down.

813
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.393
<v 3>All right,</v>

814
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.560
<v 1>so I'm the subject in the first one and then then what?</v>

815
00:47:23.561 --> 00:47:26.800
The baby becomes an object. Like are you talking shit about my kid here?

816
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.900
Billy blue bluebells laid home.

817
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.640
The actual rule is to use who with the subject and who with the object.

818
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.830
So I'm more important than my kids. So I'm the object here is that I'm done.

819
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.370
I'm the subject, but then a,

820
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.210
that doesn't mean it can he sense because a king has subjects and they have to

821
00:47:48.211 --> 00:47:52.310
do whatever the fuck they, he tells them. I'll tell you right now, I don't know.

822
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.720
I don't feel any closer to the finish line than I was Jesus.

823
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.910
The amount of empathy that I have for all the fucking teachers in my life,

824
00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.620
that this is the fucking putty. They're trying to mold into something.

825
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.700
<v 3>All right.</v>

826
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.620
<v 1>You know it's great for Great Barrier Reef. For Fuck's sakes. Bill.</v>

827
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:16.720
Stop saying the Great Barrier Reef is dying.

828
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.150
Get your pasty white ranger rs down here.

829
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:22.750
Get in the water and have a look for it. It's not dying. Yeah, it is. You can't,

830
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.230
what are you assigned to? I'm going by what the fucking scientists are saying.

831
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.550
And I wanted to go fucking a snorkeling over there. He said,

832
00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:32.010
you better do it now cause they're not gonna let people go there much longer.

833
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.390
And if you don't know what a ranger is that we all C's call red headed.

834
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:41.340
Fuck's like you a ranger being short for a rang of tank.

835
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.190
Oh, I guess, isn't that cute? Well, you know what?

836
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.130
Maybe you can say that to me next time he come down there and do a fucking show.

837
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:51.070
All right. Why don't you do that? I don't give a fuck. You think I give a fuck?

838
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:55.120
But what some con who at the bottom of the fucking world,

839
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.660
we're like three quarters of your goddamn country. You can't even go to

840
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.850
the entire middle of that fucking content is you continent.

841
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:04.870
You can't even live there.

842
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

843
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.430
<v 1>What else do you do on Australia Day?</v>

844
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:12.610
Do you drive around and your poor excuse for a fucking El Camino?

845
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:19.520
Um, anyways. Oh, that's, yeah, he's one of those fucking guys. Ah,

846
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.130
that's fine. It's still fucking there. You know,

847
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.500
I'm going to look this shit up right now. All right, great. Barrier Reef.

848
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.140
Let me see what I get and let me guess because it doesn't agree with you then

849
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:33.690
it's going to be fake news. Great Barrier Reef dead. Uh,

850
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.900
the Great Barrier Reef is not actually dead. CNN dramatic. Oh, go.

851
00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:41.730
What about dying? Let me see. Dying. Die Ying. Let me see. Dying.

852
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.570
Uh, corals are dying on the great barrier.

853
00:49:45.571 --> 00:49:48.870
Reef scientists have discovered an unprecedented die off of the,

854
00:49:48.871 --> 00:49:52.080
in the world's largest reef. The Great Barrier Reef. Prom. Yeah, there you go.

855
00:49:52.081 --> 00:49:56.520
Right there. Okay, great. Barrier Reef not dying. Australia insists.

856
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.710
Oh, I get it. This is your big tourist attraction. This is your Ferris wheel.

857
00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.760
So you want people to keep flying down there so they can jump on the water with

858
00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:09.030
a bunch of great white sharks because there's nothing to see on land down there.

859
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.230
Cause three quarters of your fucking country is unlivable and God knows if you

860
00:50:13.231 --> 00:50:15.390
go out there, it's so fucking unlived.

861
00:50:15.391 --> 00:50:17.220
That's why are snakes and everything down there.

862
00:50:17.221 --> 00:50:20.220
It's so fucking poisonous because it's such a lack of food

863
00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.280
that a snake, if it just grazes somebody, they gotta make it count.

864
00:50:25.281 --> 00:50:29.000
Cause God knows they're not gonna see anything edible for fucking weeks.

865
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.950
Australia insists that it's not fucking dying. I love it. Okay,

866
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.560
well that's fucking credible. That's how you make all your money.

867
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.280
All those fucking cons going down there and this scuba gear because they learned

868
00:50:40.281 --> 00:50:42.230
how to hold their breath and breathe under water.

869
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:46.310
And a fucking swimming pool and they got themselves a little scuba card and now

870
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:50.720
they're going to go into God's swimming pool. A fucking ocean. All right.

871
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:55.340
That's got all this shit that can kill on that gun. That's what it is. Okay.

872
00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:56.001
Again, I'm sorry.

873
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:59.750
I was fucking with the tourist attraction that that'd be like you guys down

874
00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.470
there saying that he can't go up into the armor, the Statue of Liberty anymore.

875
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:04.550
It's going to snap off.

876
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:07.143
<v 4>Um,</v>

877
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.990
<v 1>it is dying. You're stupid. Fuck. All right. All right.</v>

878
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.870
Anyways, I absolutely believe that it is.

879
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:16.640
Why wouldn't it be all this shit that we're doing?

880
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.040
Why would everything else is fucking dying?

881
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.570
Everything else is completely fucked, but that isn't a, maybe I'm wrong.

882
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.880
Maybe I'm wrong. Let me, you know what? I actually, I looked it up.

883
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.720
Let me look up, not dying. Let's see what this said. Great Barrier Reef.

884
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:32.060
But if this is all from fucking Australia, I'm not buying it.

885
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:37.390
Great Barrier Reef not in danger can be a big picture of fucking Trump.

886
00:51:38.571 --> 00:51:42.020
Scuba diving. The Great Barrier Reef, not quote,

887
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:47.060
endanger tourism and mining groups have welcomed a whatever recommendation that

888
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:53.090
the great barrier reef be left off the world. Heritage in danger. Yeah. Touring,

889
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:55.580
tourism, mining. These people all make money off it.

890
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:58.010
<v 4>Um,</v>

891
00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.460
<v 1>should the great B barrier reef be listed as in danger.</v>

892
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.810
UNESCO. Great Barrier Reef is not endangered but needs care.

893
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:08.930
You and Asperger experts say great barrier reef now. Yeah,

894
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.120
this is all because you're not making money off of it.

895
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.590
Great Barrier Reef Outlook. Poor but not in danger.

896
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:20.720
This is like what you guys are doing with the Great Barrier Reef now is what we

897
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:21.980
do with our food supply.

898
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.840
You know, it's not the best for you, but it doesn't necessarily cause cancer.

899
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.030
Um, and you know what buddy? I hope you right. I hope you're right.

900
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:35.661
I hope it isn't,

901
00:52:35.661 --> 00:52:39.020
but I know God good and God damn well that you're not a fucking scientist.

902
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.740
I know I'm not a scientist and I know that scientists say that is fucking dying,

903
00:52:42.741 --> 00:52:44.360
but anybody for what I just did,

904
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:47.870
my research for 30 seconds was anybody that makes money off of it.

905
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:51.740
Say it says that it isn't. So I don't know. Can I, can you,

906
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.800
if you can write me back with a fucking scientists or some sort of fucking group

907
00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:00.260
of them that don't make money off it or not getting paid to say that it's

908
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:04.850
fucking dying. Uh, it's not dying then, then I'll believe it. Okay.

909
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:09.020
So what a mom. I'm still fucking open-minded. Um, all right.

910
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:13.760
Obama News, censorship. Uh, hey Mr Bill,

911
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:14.931
um, Bill Burr.

912
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:19.931
I have listened to the past couple of podcasts where some of your listeners have

913
00:53:20.271 --> 00:53:22.460
messaged in about Obama's.

914
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:26.520
Suppose it's censoring of news media and after a bit of further research,

915
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:29.580
it seems like they're most likely inaccurate or just wrong.

916
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:33.420
Now let me ask you this sir, cause I looked it up. Okay.

917
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.640
If what I could tell it was accurate,

918
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.010
but what I'm guessing is you're an Obama fan,

919
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:39.780
so now you're going to tell me this is fake news.

920
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:44.130
Now you just saw where I was able to look up shit where it said it was dying and

921
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:48.780
then the isn't dying and it's just all what you choose to believe, right? Uh,

922
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:50.010
while the bill is real,

923
00:53:50.011 --> 00:53:54.330
the conclusion that it would cause the shutdown and silencing of dissenting

924
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.310
opinions seems an incorrect,

925
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.200
it's supposed to find the identity when foreign countries are involved in

926
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:06.201
spreading propaganda to allow us news sites to know where information is coming

927
00:54:06.211 --> 00:54:10.800
from. I have a liberal bias and am probably overlooking some things. Oh,

928
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:12.780
there you go. This guy's an adult. Okay. You know what,

929
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:14.010
I take back everything I said,

930
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:18.120
but it seems like that the bill is not nearly as bad as certain sites are making

931
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:18.541
out to be,

932
00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:21.180
which I would agree with cause that that's going to be the Fox News people.

933
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.150
Thanks for the podcast and the latest special. Um,

934
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.780
this is what I would guess which is a obviously a total guest cause I'm a

935
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:29.370
fucking moron. Um,

936
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.310
I'm guessing it's not as bad as people on the right are saying it is,

937
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:36.720
but I'm definitely of the belief that there's always that wiggle room in there

938
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.780
that, you know, is, is there preventing something, you know,

939
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:42.900
that everybody wants to be prevented, which would be, uh,

940
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.790
propaganda from our fucking enemies,

941
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:46.410
which actually don't even think is that bad.

942
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:51.160
I'm not against hearing their take on things. Um,

943
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.070
but it would also allow them, it's Kinda like, you know,

944
00:54:54.071 --> 00:54:57.970
after nine 11 where it was just like, we need to listen.

945
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.880
We need to be able to listen in on people's phone conversations.

946
00:55:00.881 --> 00:55:04.510
But if you're not doing anything wrong, you know, a, it's then a fucking love.

947
00:55:04.511 --> 00:55:04.940
You know, it's,

948
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.200
this is just for terrorist and then it just becomes a way for them to spy on you

949
00:55:08.201 --> 00:55:09.034
even more.

950
00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.580
And then years later you see that whole fucking Snowden thing and he's taken off

951
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.880
basically saying, I'm not going to help you guys build this thing.

952
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:20.320
The greatest nerd of all time is that snowed guy. You know,

953
00:55:20.321 --> 00:55:22.600
I suppose those other fucking pussies who just keep fucking, you know,

954
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.050
I've always said it, you know, total psychos,

955
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:32.020
like a complete psycho has no fucking power. You know, without nerds,

956
00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:35.500
nerds give them the ability to be as cycle on a psycho,

957
00:55:35.501 --> 00:55:38.730
on a fucking global level. Okay.

958
00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:42.900
Is his nuts as Trump is his nuts as fucking Hillary is nuts as fucking Bush.

959
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:47.310
It's not just all these fucking loaded techs are then that shit without nerds

960
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.130
creating the technology for them to, uh, you know,

961
00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.630
go psycho on a global fucking level.

962
00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.110
You mean if it wasn't for fucking nerds and we'd still be attacking each other

963
00:56:00.111 --> 00:56:04.500
with sticks, you know, I, I couldn't figure out how to make a gun.

964
00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:11.300
All right, last my 401k. Hey Bill. Uh,

965
00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.530
well to cut to the chase, I'm 51 years old.

966
00:56:13.531 --> 00:56:18.360
Divorced son is in jail for hitting his mother who was a lunatic. Jesus Christ.

967
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:23.870
And I received a $49,000 settlement and blew it all on the California lottery.

968
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:29.670
This can't be real. I really feel like throwing in the towel.

969
00:56:29.671 --> 00:56:33.360
Can you tell me what you would do if you were in my awful shoes?

970
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:36.840
All right. If this is even remotely real,

971
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.660
<v 4>um,</v>

972
00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.960
<v 1>let's see. This probably fake, but whatever I can,</v>

973
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.280
but other people have completely fucked up their lives. So I'll,

974
00:56:44.281 --> 00:56:48.360
I'll talk to them. And you, sir, if you're actually telling the truth, um,

975
00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:52.590
the biggest thing you got going for yourself is you know that you're a moron in

976
00:56:52.591 --> 00:56:53.790
you fucked up your life.

977
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.310
So I would sit down and I would look at the decisions that I've made,

978
00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:02.820
figured out why I made those fucking decisions.

979
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:09.440
I refuse to believe that you're dumb enough to get $49,000 and spend all of it

980
00:57:09.931 --> 00:57:13.830
on the California lottery. I would think that some of it went to bear.

981
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:18.990
Some of them. It went to Wade. Come on, somebody had 49,000 bucks.

982
00:57:18.991 --> 00:57:20.880
You can get yourself a new truck. Come on. Come on.

983
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:23.973
<v 4>I don't know.</v>

984
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:27.050
<v 1>Can you tell me what you would do if you were in my office shoes? Uh,</v>

985
00:57:27.051 --> 00:57:31.790
I would get a fucking job. First of all, I would stay away from, um,

986
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:38.210
that stay away from your ex wife. You son's in jail for hitting your mother.

987
00:57:38.211 --> 00:57:42.110
So that would mean he's of age. Um,

988
00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.670
so you're not paying any child support. So maybe there's some alimony.

989
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:49.780
<v 4>Um,</v>

990
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.350
<v 1>I dunno, I try to teach my son not to hit my mother. I mean,</v>

991
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:55.960
I'm [inaudible] not to hit his mother.

992
00:57:58.090 --> 00:57:59.350
I don't know dude. You, you got you,

993
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.050
you got water coming in from all sides here. I don't know what to tell you.

994
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.373
<v 4>Um,</v>

995
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.140
<v 1>if you get money, I would save it rather than gamble it away.</v>

996
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:13.600
And uh, but you're only 51 years old, dude. This is what I would do.

997
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:16.230
I would say I would start P90x get a little bit,

998
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.480
it's fucking self esteem and have a little more belief in yourself that you can

999
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:22.810
make it other than trying to do a fucking nine zillion to one shot,

1000
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:29.040
which you tried to cut down to a 49,000 to 49,000 shots at a billion to one.

1001
00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.600
Um, yeah, dude, I don't know what to tell you, man.

1002
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:39.550
I think you're going to be fine. You 51 years old, you know, you still got,

1003
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.860
you still got some years ahead of you, but I would just, uh,

1004
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.730
I wouldn't throw my fucking money away like that. I mean,

1005
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:48.670
I don't know how to give you advice if you blew all your money on lottery

1006
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:51.250
tickets. Uh, but I don't want you to throw in the towel.

1007
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.890
You know what I would do? I would write a fucking book, stare into it.

1008
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.500
You know, like if it's the comic's comic, you might be the losers loser.

1009
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:04.090
Write a fucking book about it,

1010
00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.613
<v 4>you know?</v>

1011
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.200
<v 1>Well, make some youtube videos and just tell your fucking story.</v>

1012
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:14.760
Get some advertising right? Maybe you can make a little bit of money that way.

1013
00:59:14.761 --> 00:59:17.700
Shit, it's easy to make 49,000 bucks off the fucking Internet.

1014
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.820
There's enough people that people love, people failing you,

1015
00:59:20.821 --> 00:59:23.660
who the fuck's failed more than you turn it around.

1016
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:27.620
Turn that failing into a fucking positive. Tell you fucking story.

1017
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.430
Start going around to schools telling people what not to do.

1018
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:35.450
I don't know what you should do, but don't do what I did. Right.

1019
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.940
That's a country lyrics. They always, they're always doing that shit.

1020
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:43.980
Like I was thinking on the drive over here talking about this person in front of

1021
00:59:43.981 --> 00:59:45.600
me was driving so slow is like Jesus Christ,

1022
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.310
you've got all the time in the world. I'm like,

1023
00:59:47.311 --> 00:59:50.070
that's such like a country lyric that they would flip around.

1024
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:52.603
<v 3>You know,</v>

1025
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.280
<v 1>I've got all the time in the world than I don't want to go on live in. You know,</v>

1026
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.690
you see it's a juxtaposition there. You know what I mean?

1027
01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:02.060
It's like I got all this time my hands,

1028
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:04.460
but I don't want any time cause I'm a mom.

1029
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.280
My woman left me or something like that. Right. It's like,

1030
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:11.840
wait up fucking a bull wants to fuck a cow but ain't going on around but a pig.

1031
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.150
You know what I mean? It's one of those types of things.

1032
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.590
I would just steer into it sir.

1033
01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.690
I would turn it into entertaining stories that somehow tell them,

1034
01:00:19.691 --> 01:00:21.850
but I'm also a comedian. That's what the fuck I would do.

1035
01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:25.480
Other than that I would stay away from your ex wife and um,

1036
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:32.720
I dunno, I dunno what to do with you son. Try to set a better example

1037
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.560
by not blowing all your money on lottery tickets. Maybe that's,

1038
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:39.350
that's the thing. I don't know. Sorry. You were in that situation.

1039
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:43.520
If you actually are all right. Text sent to the wrong person at work. Oh Jesus.

1040
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:49.160
This is never good. Uh, dear Billy Graham cracker tits.

1041
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.800
Um, I never thought I'd be in a situation where I needed to write into you like

1042
01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:59.420
this, but here I am in a pinch. For the last couple of years,

1043
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.790
certain people at my work have been getting very relaxed with their work ethic

1044
01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:05.840
and punctuality.

1045
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:11.110
So much so that another coworker and I have written an album of songs about its

1046
01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:12.554
absurdity.

1047
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:13.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1048
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.700
<v 1>Since our office is,</v>

1049
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.240
well maybe you can write a song about the guy who just wrote in above me,

1050
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.573
<v 3>you know,</v>

1051
01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.790
<v 1>you guys, you know, then you go on American idol. I don't know. Anyways,</v>

1052
01:01:24.791 --> 01:01:27.460
since ours is an office of about 10 people,

1053
01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:32.230
everybody's job directly relates to everyone else's and it puts extra strain on

1054
01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:36.250
the rest of us. Recently, two of the worst defenders, both ladies,

1055
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.300
not that it matters, I'm have actually, but I mentioned it, uh,

1056
01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:45.070
have actually gotten promotions for some reason. With that said this morning,

1057
01:01:45.071 --> 01:01:50.071
I noticed one of the ladies accomplished a quote task in our project manager.

1058
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:52.620
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1059
01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.550
<v 1>Uh, to bring food to an office, potluck, lunch</v>

1060
01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.280
being the snarky asshole I am.

1061
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.110
I took a screenshot to send to my likeminded coworker with the techs,

1062
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:09.870
quote, think, and then the person's name is going a little overboard here.

1063
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:12.930
Somehow she only creates to do, she can get done,

1064
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:17.370
can't get shit done for work, but for food, the bitches all over it.

1065
01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:22.230
When I didn't hear back from after 10 minutes, I felt this first wave of panic.

1066
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.250
I knew it immediately. The techs had been sent to the lady. Yeah.

1067
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.640
Cause what happens is you're thinking about that person and you're thinking

1068
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:34.320
about their name and you, Oh my God, we've all done this completely flustered.

1069
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:38.130
I sent a flurry of apology texts, but she didn't respond.

1070
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:39.190
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1071
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:43.810
<v 1>All this was happening around eight 30 which is when people are supposed to</v>

1072
01:02:43.811 --> 01:02:44.644
arrive.

1073
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.780
This work or usually shows up around nine 45 or 10 but that's beside the point.

1074
01:02:49.781 --> 01:02:54.220
What can you unsend the text? I Dunno.

1075
01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.250
Just some nerd know how to do that. Anyways, after I didn't hear from her,

1076
01:02:57.251 --> 01:03:01.780
I checked the calendar and saw that she was on vacation for the next 10 days.

1077
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.280
Oh No. But I know she got the text and now I'm worried about what she thinks and

1078
01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:09.370
whether it's going to be weird in the office. What do I do?

1079
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.280
She's not a bad person. And when you called her a bitch too,

1080
01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:16.540
and I have to work with her regularly before realizing she was out,

1081
01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:21.130
I already bought flowers and put them on a desk in order to cover the stench of

1082
01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.200
my own failure. Now Dude, you can't. He goes,

1083
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.170
cause she knows what you really think.

1084
01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:27.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1085
01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.850
<v 1>I'm guessing I shouldn't leave them there.</v>

1086
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:32.990
Let her come back to dead flowers either. Congratulations on your baby girl.

1087
01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:36.380
And of course you laid a special sincerely, I'd done fucked up.

1088
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.383
<v 3>Um,</v>

1089
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.620
<v 1>where is she on vacation and is there a way to unsend all of those text</v>

1090
01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:48.830
messages? That's what I would try to do over the next 10 days.

1091
01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.070
I would not apologize anymore. I would not give flowers.

1092
01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.350
And this is what you got to do, Dude.

1093
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:59.060
You got a fucking man up and when she calls you out on it, be like, Yep,

1094
01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:01.910
I was, I'm not going to tell you who I was sending it to.

1095
01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:05.540
Don't rat out the other person on any fucking level.

1096
01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:08.750
Do not rat out the other person you piece of shit if you do it.

1097
01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:12.230
Do not rat them out. Um,

1098
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:16.100
I would actually say I was actually sending it to this girl.

1099
01:04:16.101 --> 01:04:19.040
I know who doesn't work here. Okay. Just say that.

1100
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.113
<v 3>Um,</v>

1101
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.640
<v 1>and I was pitched to her about people at work and when she calls you out,</v>

1102
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:29.330
I would just say, listen, you know what? No. Send sugarcoat in it.

1103
01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:32.570
You're supposed to be here at eight 30 show up at nine 45, 10 o'clock.

1104
01:04:32.571 --> 01:04:33.141
Get dog in.

1105
01:04:33.141 --> 01:04:38.141
It is setting a bad example and I like working hard and that text came from the

1106
01:04:38.271 --> 01:04:41.120
frustration of watching you working,

1107
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:43.520
setting the example of not working up to your potential.

1108
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:48.590
It makes it a bad experience out here. So that's why I did it. If you mad at me.

1109
01:04:48.591 --> 01:04:53.240
I understand, but you know I stand by that text message.

1110
01:04:53.241 --> 01:04:54.350
I shouldn't have called you a bitch.

1111
01:04:54.351 --> 01:04:57.620
I was just saying that the way you know Richard Pryor says it.

1112
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:59.300
I was just trying to be funny. But you know

1113
01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.040
you showing up an hour and 15 to an hour and a half late everyday is not good

1114
01:05:06.041 --> 01:05:09.670
for the, the morale around the office. That's what, that's where that came from.

1115
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.310
So there you go. And I'm sorry I sent it to you, but you know

1116
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:17.950
that's it. Fuck it.

1117
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:23.020
<v 4>Fuck it. That's all. That's the only card you got to play. Be like, yeah,</v>

1118
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:23.854
I sent it.

1119
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:29.450
Although you did fucking put your hat in your hand and apologize. Yeah.

1120
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.100
Boy, can you please write back and let me know how it pans out.

1121
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.330
I'd love to know. All right. With that. That is the podcast for this week.

1122
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:39.583
Um,

1123
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:42.360
<v 1>I'll check in on your, on Thursday. And uh,</v>

1124
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.170
this time next week I will be in Phoenix,

1125
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:48.400
Arizona doing two shows a night at a commodity club,

1126
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.890
also known as a comedy club and

1127
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:52.603
<v 4>uh,</v>

1128
01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:55.680
<v 1>be fucking polishing up this fucking hour so I can go on the road.</v>

1129
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.530
Not Embarrass myself like this guy did with his text message.

1130
01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.830
You pour bears too. We've all been there. You know what?

1131
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.760
Even the lady that you're writing to, I bet she's done it too. Um,

1132
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.870
but she's letting you squirm or,

1133
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:12.640
or she's in Aruba or she someplace where she didn't get the text message and

1134
01:06:12.641 --> 01:06:13.690
maybe you can undo it.

1135
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:18.160
Maybe you can fucking undo what was already done. This is,

1136
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:22.550
this is another fucking movie. This is a fucking movie.

1137
01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.740
This is like weekend at Bernie's meets, uh, Steve Jobs.

1138
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.890
Fucking one of those things when we used to walk out and be like, look,

1139
01:06:30.891 --> 01:06:35.060
now you can swipe texts. And everyone's like, oh right. That's what you do.

1140
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.040
If you get fired, sir, you should write a fucking script.

1141
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:47.360
Write a fucking script about somebody who sent the wrong text message to their

1142
01:06:47.361 --> 01:06:51.590
boss, sent a text message to the wrong person. That person's on vacation.

1143
01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.340
Okay? And then eventually you're going to have to fly down there.

1144
01:06:55.790 --> 01:07:00.100
You know that you can coast. Start with the guy with the eyes. You know,

1145
01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.690
he said the ice thing that he got from fucking out pachino where was,

1146
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.890
what was the name of that actor he was in about last? Andrew McCarthy, right?

1147
01:07:06.891 --> 01:07:10.670
You guys, maybe you can fucking executive producer. See that.

1148
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:14.800
That's the great thing about entertainment. No matter how bad you fuck up in it,

1149
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.480
it makes the more you fuck up on your personal life,

1150
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.900
the more material you get as a comedian, you get a script out of it.

1151
01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.673
<v 4>I Dunno,</v>

1152
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.130
<v 1>you don't sound fulfilled. Maybe. Maybe you could be a script writer. All right,</v>

1153
01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:29.200
that's it. Go fuck yourselves. Your [inaudible] and I'll,

1154
01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.730
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
