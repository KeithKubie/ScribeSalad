00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.610
 People often ask me in an accusatory way: "Are you an atheist?" 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:13.449
 I want them to be a world and I am not associated with any groups 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:20.449
 I do not follow any movements and follow what is dictated to my mind, when someone follows a doctrine 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.730
 Or movement, it becomes a pot of this doctrine 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.890
 When you want to discuss something, they'll tell you 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.210
 They already know everything important that you should know because of this connection to the doctrine. 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.469
 But sorry for this is not a way to discuss, it is better to explore 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.429
 Each other actually rather than sticking labels together and emphasizing that we know 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.719
 What will happen in advance. 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.639
 What people try to know is my position on religion, spirituality or God 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:08.280
 The closest word I describe myself to is (a skeptical atheist) 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 This term refers to the 19th century and was written by Huxley to refer to someone who does not know but is 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.040
 Has yet to see evidence of his belief but is willing to accept the evidence if any 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.930
 But if there is no evidence, he does not have to think about something without evidence. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.930
 There are many atheists. "All skeptics are atheists." "Well always 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 Atheists say I am an atheist. "And I find this a deceptive thing. 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.800
 Others did so. I feel flattered when people are interested in knowing about my life 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.220
 To collect information on this page. The page says "Neil Degrass is an atheist" but I say 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 This is not really "real", "Neil Degrass is an atheist skeptical" and a week later I visited the page again if it was not done 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.210
 Even though I did it twice in the same week - I said, "What's this?" 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.460
 "It seems I have to put it another way," so I said well, "Neil Digras, who says atheists widely 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.290
 He is an atheist, he really is (a skeptical atheist). " 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.120
 Some will say, well, that is - "You are unfair to the fact that they are in fact 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.740
 "No, they are not the same and I will tell you why, the atheists I know 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.660
 They are proud to be so active atheists. They are atheists 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.660
 They seek to change policies and engage in debates. But I do not have time 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.120
 No effort and I have no desire. I am a scholar and a teacher. My goal is to push people 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.550
 To think directly first of all out of curiosity towards the natural world 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.220
 That's what I am. I do not care about the rest 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.290
 It is strange that the word atheist is present. I do not play golf. Is there a word "non-golf player"? 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.290
 Do not the golfers crowd and plan. Do non-skiers are called a description and congregate 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.450
 For a real forum they do not skate? I can not do that 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.430
 I can not gather with others and discuss how many people among us do not believe in God. Quite simply 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.430
 I do not have the effort to do so, so being skeptical distinguishes me from the behavior of atheists 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.000
 Whether there is a large space shared between the two categories or not, and at the end 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.890
 Today I do not prefer my rankings at all
