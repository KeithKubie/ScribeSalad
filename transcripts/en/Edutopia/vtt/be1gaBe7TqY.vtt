00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:10.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's no
surprise that the children

00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:13.566
who attend Capitol Elementary
enjoy going to school.

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.096
This brightly colored,
sparkling new building minutes

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:20.016
from downtown Phoenix is a
flexible learning environment

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:21.236
with spacious classrooms.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:26.096
Instruction here features hands-on
cooperative learning with an emphasis

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.066
on literacy and social
emotional growth.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How do you think
Lisa and Corduroy feel now?

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:34.796
&gt;&gt;They happy.

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:36.966
&gt;&gt;Good answer.

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.126
&gt;&gt;I'm very proud of you.

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:42.566
This is only your fourth day
learning English at Capitol School.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.966
And you did a great job saying--
trying to say it in English.

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The dedicated staff
is supported by a large group

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:57.976
of involved parents and a
core of community volunteers.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: What is surprising is
that this school exists at all.

00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:04.896
It's a testament to the will of a
community that refused to give up

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:06.816
and to the vision of a
principal named Cora Garrido.

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:07.676
&gt;&gt;Cora: Good for you.

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:09.276
&gt;&gt;When I first came to Capitol,

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:13.166
there had been a building
that was condemned.

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:19.886
And at that time, a decision was
made to set up the modular units

00:01:20.056 --> 00:01:21.896
because this was dying community.

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:26.136
And people didn't believe that there
were enough children in this area

00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:28.796
to warrant giving it much attention,

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:32.386
and certainly not building
another facility

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.156
to accommodate the
needs of these children.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The need
here is apparent.

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:39.066
According to the latest census,

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.306
this is the poorest
district in the country.

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:44.656
Every student here
qualifies for free meals.

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:48.646
More than half are recent immigrants
from Mexico who speak little

00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:49.506
or no English [Women
speaking Spanish]

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:55.406
and while some saw the
community as a liability,

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.426
Garrido saw it as a resource.

00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.366
&gt;&gt;Cora: We know a lot
about instruction,

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.696
but there's a whole community
out there that can help.

00:02:04.516 --> 00:02:08.366
&gt;&gt;Cora: So, what we do
is we have Walk the Talk.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:15.226
And the entire staff, custodians,
office staff, the nurse,

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:20.146
social worker we go out and
knock on our family's homes

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.196
and welcome them to the new year.

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:23.066
&gt;&gt;See you on Monday.

00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:26.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to
walking the neighborhood

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:28.976
on 110 degree August afternoons,

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:32.276
Garrido has scoured the school
district looking for help

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:36.206
from businesses and other potential
partners, people like Bob Kay.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:37.576
&gt;&gt;Bob: Do you know anybody in town

00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:39.896
that handles Gabriel
shocks for the big trucks?

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:43.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kay runs a truck parts
firm a few blocks from the school

00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:45.886
and heads up the local Kiwanis club.

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:50.826
He'd been volunteering at Capitol for
about a year when Garrido invited him

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:54.766
to join a diverse group of teachers,
students, parents, architects,

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:57.886
and community members who
began a year long discussion

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.226
about what they wanted
in a new school.

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:03.136
&gt;&gt;Bob: I was amazed that
they asked me to begin with.

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:07.976
You know, here I am a little
businessman out wandering

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.476
around doing little
businessman things.

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:15.836
And here I was asked to
be with bankers, lawyers,

00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:18.306
people that I thought
were far above me.

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:21.136
&gt;&gt;He was worried about
making it a box.

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:22.766
And he said, "I can
remember that earlier.

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.076
Let's do it this way."

00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:28.146
I'm glad that you didn't
get your way.

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:31.096
&gt;&gt;I am, too.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:41.686
&gt;&gt;It was hard for me initially to buy
into that whole process because it's

00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:46.386
like what does a parent know
about putting together a building?

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:52.646
As an engineer you have step
one, step two, step three.

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:58.386
And in this process, I was
forced to break out of that,

00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:00.706
so I was out of my comfort zone.

00:04:00.856 --> 00:04:03.496
&gt;&gt;I came at it from a
business lawyer standpoint.

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.386
For me, this was a deal.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:10.656
&gt;&gt;Bob: My gosh, you know, when you
stop to think about 60 people all

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.716
with different attitudes and
different ideas and things.

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:17.116
And the most important things
is they worked as a group.

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:19.756
&gt;&gt;We stayed focused on children.

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:24.906
&gt;&gt;It wasn't about what Cora, what
Fred, or Greg, what any adult wanted.

00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:26.756
It was for children.

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:29.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Ultimately,
the new school design grew

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:32.386
out of Capitol's commitment to
cooperative project-based learning.

00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:37.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: In a quiet buddy buzz
voice describe your carrot seeds.

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:42.116
&gt;&gt;When we began planning, we
never spoke of the facility.

00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:44.056
We spoke of how we wanted to teach.

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:47.676
We wanted to teach
cooperatively within our classroom,

00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:50.436
but also within the school,
within the grade level,

00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:52.916
within other grade levels.

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:56.246
So when we decided how
we wanted to teach,

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:58.186
then the building just
sort of evolved.

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.576
&gt;&gt;You put them in the order of signs.

00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:03.586
&gt;&gt;Paul: One of things that came out
of the discussions with the parents

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:07.336
and the rest of the design
group was the idea that many

00:05:07.336 --> 00:05:09.506
of the children learn
in different ways.

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:12.836
And so the flexibility
was of key importance.

00:05:13.186 --> 00:05:17.246
The idea of having a place to build
large scale projects and not have

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:20.266
to tear them down every time,
the idea of having a space

00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:24.506
where you could have multiple
computers that if you needed them,

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:26.386
you had more than just a couple.

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:29.296
Or, if you weren't using them,
they weren't in your way,

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.456
and someone else could use them.

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:36.926
And a whole series of kinds
of learning that needed more

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:38.086
than just the basic classroom.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:41.096
And so, what came out
of that was this sort

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:44.176
of center exploratory commons area.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school's
flexible design allows as many

00:05:47.986 --> 00:05:51.246
as four separate classrooms
to open their sliding walls

00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:55.786
to share a large common space often
used for collaborative projects.

00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:04.206
At this school the curriculum
is focused on literacy,

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:07.976
which is delivered through a
program called Success For All.

00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:11.826
&gt;&gt;Mari: It's a 90 minute
uninterrupted reading block for all

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:13.536
of our school, we have K through 6.

00:06:14.046 --> 00:06:17.736
And what they do during this
time is the students are tested,

00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:24.496
and then they're placed
according to their reading level.

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:26.996
&gt;&gt;Cooperative learning is
the foundation of the program

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:29.796
because we work as teams, and
we're learning to work as teams

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:32.066
because in real life we have to
work with different types of people.

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:34.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, now
pair with your partner.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.036
&gt;&gt;Mari: This way every
single child is engaged,

00:06:38.116 --> 00:06:41.166
and every single child has an
opportunity to give their answers.

00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:46.066
&gt;&gt;Welcome, parents, to
Family Literacy Night.

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:47.106
I know you're going to have fun...

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:49.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Capitol's parents
have a strong commitment

00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:50.856
to their neighborhood school.

00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:53.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What I want you to do is
go ahead and find a book you would

00:06:53.916 --> 00:06:54.976
like to read to your parents.

00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:56.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They come to
Parent's Literacy Night

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:58.976
to learn English language skills
along with their children.

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:02.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [speaking Spanish]

00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:07.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They can also attend
special parent classes and offer help

00:07:07.836 --> 00:07:09.906
on fundraisers and in the classroom.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:11.946
&gt;&gt;Volunteer: You want
to be a nurse, doctor?

00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:14.356
Really, that's awesome.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:18.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But not all of
Capitol's homeroom parents are

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.086
actually parents.

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:22.966
Many of the school's volunteers are
employees of a Phoenix law firm.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.286
&gt;&gt;Kent: We certainly could
have written a check to Capitol

00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:27.036
and helped them buy
computers or books.

00:07:27.566 --> 00:07:28.916
This was really investment of time.

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:32.876
We wanted our people get out from
behind their desks, down to Capitol

00:07:32.876 --> 00:07:34.856
where they interacted with the
kids and had an opportunity

00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:38.896
to invest themselves in the process,
as opposed to just writing a check.

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:40.676
For every one of us
that have participated,

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.976
education now has a very
different feel to us.

00:07:45.046 --> 00:07:48.806
&gt;&gt;Nancy: The art teacher works
with us and gets pictures

00:07:48.806 --> 00:07:52.806
to us once a month, which we
display on our second floor,

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.166
which is our client
floor, our fancy floor.

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.216
And we display the pictures.

00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:01.866
We put the child's name up just
like we do artwork that we paid lots

00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:03.876
of money for, with the
artist's name beside it.

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:07.246
&gt;&gt;Every first grader was in school.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:08.976
Good for you.

00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:11.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Success is
difficult to measure here.

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:15.556
Since a third of Capitol's student
population are the sons and daughters

00:08:15.556 --> 00:08:18.786
of migrant workers who leave
the district every year.

00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:21.976
&gt;&gt;They receive a certificate...

00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:23.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But, Garrido
points to improved test scores

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:27.576
and the school's nearly perfect
attendance record as measures

00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:29.946
of the dedication of
parents, teachers,

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:31.736
community members, and students.

00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:36.916
Efforts that are recognized in
the awarding of certificates

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.936
and t-shirts to these terrific kids.

00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:43.326
&gt;&gt;Bob: You can see this morning
that those little kids just beamed.

00:08:43.326 --> 00:08:47.876
I hope that we're making a
positive difference in their lives.

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:48.976
And I think we are.

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:56.006
You know, if we save one, that's one
that we don't have to worry about.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:03.916
If we save two, what a
miraculous thing that we've done.

00:09:05.276 --> 00:09:07.246
