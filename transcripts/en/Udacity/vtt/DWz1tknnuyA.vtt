00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's apply derivatives to physics --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Newton's Second Law of Motion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're looking at one-dimensional motion.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Think of the train we saw before.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Some force is exerted on object of mass m.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What does happen? The velocity of this object changes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And Newton's Second Law describes that relationship.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The mass times the acceleration is that force.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you keep the same object, the same mass

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and double the force, we double the acceleration --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the change of velocity.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If we want to accelerate an object of twice the mass,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we need twice the force.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Mass is measured in kilograms internationally.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity -- v dot --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the derivative of the velocity with respect to time,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or as velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the derivative of the derivative of the position with respect to time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Velocity is meters per second internationally,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the change would be meters per second --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
per second by how many meters per second,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
thus the velocity change per second --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that is m/s².

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Force is given in kg times m/s²,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and there's a short name for that -- Newtons --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because obviously, Newton was the one to find this.
