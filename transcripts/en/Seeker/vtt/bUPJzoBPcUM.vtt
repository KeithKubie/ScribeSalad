00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.819
When it comes to consumer electronics or electric
cars, lithium-ion batteries are still the

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.250
technology of choice thanks to their high
energy density and decent charge times.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.360
But billion dollar tech and auto giants are
betting that there’s still room for improvement.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.570
One of the most promising upgrades has been
mired by a mysterious setback, but now researchers

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.660
think they’ve ironed out the problem, literally.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.070
Scientists have been researching an improvement
to the battery’s cathode -- the positive

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.660
end -- for years.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.400
The cathode is the most expensive part of
the battery, so research has been focused

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.579
on finding cheaper materials while improving
performance.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.040
Your phone’s cathode probably uses cobalt
oxide, which are* great for small electronics

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.399
but too volatile and expensive for use in
electric cars.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.579
Tesla’s secret sauce is a cathode made of
nickel, cobalt, and aluminum, which is designed

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.780
to reduce costs.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.690
But for electric cars there’s a cathode
that could promise more range for cheaper.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
It’s called the Lithium Rich NMC cathode,
and as its name suggests it’s made of layers

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.640
of lithium rich nickel, manganese, and cobalt
oxides.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.470
The first generation of this cathode has already
been used, like in the original Chevy Volt,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.300
but the second generation was projected to
nearly double the battery’s capacity up

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.040
to about 280 milliampere-hours per gram.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.251
This was achieved by upping the voltage from
about 3.7 volts to 4.7 volts, but after a

00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:23.080
few charge and discharge cycles researchers
noticed a steep drop in energy the new battery

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.850
could store and discharge.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.900
They dubbed the problem “voltage fade.”

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.970
The problem appeared to be the materials in
the cathode scrambled when the higher voltage

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.060
was applied.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.060
The manganese, nickel, cobalt, oxygen, and
lithium rearranged themselves and the material’s

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.810
new properties couldn’t deliver the performance
of the original structure.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.490
While some scientists have deemed voltage
fade an intrinsic property of the material,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.390
others aren’t quite ready to give up on
it just yet.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.200
In July of 2018 researchers published a paper
in the journal Nature Energy that not only

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.700
pinpoints what causes the voltage fade, but
actually found a way of reversing it.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.960
The researchers x-rayed the cathodes under
operating conditions and saw the nanoscale

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.140
defects forming in the otherwise perfect crystal
structure.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.979
Once they knew exactly how these defects were
taking shape, they devised a heat treatment

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.820
to get rid of most of them.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.920
When the treated cathodes were applied to
new batteries and tested up to 4.7 volts,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.620
they performed like new and with no voltage
fade.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.620
This doesn’t mean these new cathodes are
going to flood the market anytime soon.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.740
The researchers stressed that this heat treatment
is labor intensive and can’t be applied

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.590
on a large scale easily.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.720
But their work does keep the promise of these
better cathodes alive, and encourages more

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.530
research into solving the problem of voltage
fade.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.070
I-T people know how it is.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.630
When all those alerts and tickets light up
your monitor like a Christmas tree, you aren’t

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.130
being productive, you’re just stressed out.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.680
No mere mortal can analyze all of those alerts
and respond to all those tickets.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.050

While you’re here, subscribe because unlike
some batteries, we keep the energy flowing.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.620
Like in this video where I talk about how
contact lenses could lead to better electric

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.620
cars!

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.010
The cathode in your phone battery is what
wears down too, causing a dip in performance,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.780
though it’s not as sudden as these experimental
NMC cathodes.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.510
