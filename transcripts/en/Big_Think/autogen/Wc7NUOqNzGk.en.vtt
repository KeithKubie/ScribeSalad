I think that's a great question you know

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
I think that's a great question you know
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.419
I think that's a great question you know
I do think you know as I said I think

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
I do think you know as I said I think
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.280
I do think you know as I said I think
property rights and connection to a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
property rights and connection to a
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.289
property rights and connection to a
large market creates good incentive to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299
large market creates good incentive to
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.390
large market creates good incentive to
produce but that's primarily to produce

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
produce but that's primarily to produce
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.029
produce but that's primarily to produce
you know what we call private goods so

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
you know what we call private goods so
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.759
you know what we call private goods so
to make food or cell phones or

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
to make food or cell phones or
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.070
to make food or cell phones or
televisions or you know film all of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
televisions or you know film all of
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.710
televisions or you know film all of
which can be consumed by individuals but

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
which can be consumed by individuals but
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570
which can be consumed by individuals but
capitalism is not a good system for

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
capitalism is not a good system for
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.810
capitalism is not a good system for
taking care of public goods and I think

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
taking care of public goods and I think
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.049
taking care of public goods and I think
the in this current era we've got more

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
the in this current era we've got more
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970
the in this current era we've got more
and more countries that are buying into

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
and more countries that are buying into
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520
and more countries that are buying into
the notion of property rights and free

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
the notion of property rights and free
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860
the notion of property rights and free
trade so the global economy is growing

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
trade so the global economy is growing
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.680
trade so the global economy is growing
faster than it has for a long time and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
faster than it has for a long time and
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.229
faster than it has for a long time and
that's good for raising living standards

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
that's good for raising living standards
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.080
that's good for raising living standards
and reducing poverty but it also creates

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
and reducing poverty but it also creates
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.330
and reducing poverty but it also creates
some new problems because there are

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
some new problems because there are
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.299
some new problems because there are
global issues that cannot easily be

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
global issues that cannot easily be
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459
global issues that cannot easily be
dealt with just by the capitalist system

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
dealt with just by the capitalist system
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.010
dealt with just by the capitalist system
itself and I think the most important is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
itself and I think the most important is
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439
itself and I think the most important is
the global environment and I'm

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
the global environment and I'm
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.850
the global environment and I'm
particularly concerned about the issue

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
particularly concerned about the issue
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580
particularly concerned about the issue
of global warming so we're in a pretty

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
of global warming so we're in a pretty
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289
of global warming so we're in a pretty
nice situation now where a lot of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
nice situation now where a lot of
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.260
nice situation now where a lot of
developing countries are growing well

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
developing countries are growing well
 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.609
developing countries are growing well
creating jobs and lifting people out of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
creating jobs and lifting people out of
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859
creating jobs and lifting people out of
poverty which is great but now we have

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
poverty which is great but now we have
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.140
poverty which is great but now we have
this challenge of collective action you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
this challenge of collective action you
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.580
this challenge of collective action you
know how do we preserve the global

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
know how do we preserve the global
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219
know how do we preserve the global
Commons and how do we take care of the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
Commons and how do we take care of the
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620
Commons and how do we take care of the
you know the earth basically so that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
you know the earth basically so that
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.570
you know the earth basically so that
this development can be sustainable and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
this development can be sustainable and
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609
this development can be sustainable and
there i think you know they're the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
there i think you know they're the
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.460
there i think you know they're the
solution and you know in simple terms

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
solution and you know in simple terms
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080
solution and you know in simple terms
the solution there is not property

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
the solution there is not property
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819
the solution there is not property
rights the solution there is collective

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
rights the solution there is collective
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.030
rights the solution there is collective
action and we are in a situation where

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
action and we are in a situation where
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440
action and we are in a situation where
you've got all these different countries

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
you've got all these different countries
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.899
you've got all these different countries
in the world we don't really have a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
in the world we don't really have a
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.270
in the world we don't really have a
system of global government we've got a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
system of global government we've got a
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120
system of global government we've got a
United Nations you know which is you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
United Nations you know which is you
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.499
United Nations you know which is you
know doing its best to deal with

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
know doing its best to deal with
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389
know doing its best to deal with
security issues but it's not really

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
security issues but it's not really
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.789
security issues but it's not really
global government we don't really have

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
global government we don't really have
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710
global government we don't really have
any kind of global framework for

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
any kind of global framework for
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.380
any kind of global framework for
managing the global environment you know

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
managing the global environment you know
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.959
managing the global environment you know
we've got the Kyoto Protocol to begin to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
we've got the Kyoto Protocol to begin to
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.450
we've got the Kyoto Protocol to begin to
deal with greenhouse gas emissions but

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
deal with greenhouse gas emissions but
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.639
deal with greenhouse gas emissions but
that's very partial it only involves

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
that's very partial it only involves
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.200
that's very partial it only involves
commitments from a small number of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
commitments from a small number of
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.600
commitments from a small number of
countries you've got big players like

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
countries you've got big players like
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.999
countries you've got big players like
the u.s. that have not signed up in all

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
the u.s. that have not signed up in all
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190
the u.s. that have not signed up in all
the developing countries were exempt so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
the developing countries were exempt so
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.030
the developing countries were exempt so
I think

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
I think
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.539
I think
getting the collective action to the

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549
getting the collective action to the
 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.490
getting the collective action to the
general issue is the collective action

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500
general issue is the collective action
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.280
general issue is the collective action
to produce public goods and I think the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
to produce public goods and I think the
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170
to produce public goods and I think the
best example to make this concrete is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
best example to make this concrete is
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.849
best example to make this concrete is
the whole issue of preserving the global

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859
the whole issue of preserving the global
 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.550
the whole issue of preserving the global
environment including greenhouse gases

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
environment including greenhouse gases
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.080
environment including greenhouse gases
and global warming I think the other

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
and global warming I think the other
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.270
and global warming I think the other
obvious one is in the health field you

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
obvious one is in the health field you
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.710
obvious one is in the health field you
know that the general issue here there

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
know that the general issue here there
 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.479
know that the general issue here there
are things that are really public goods

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489
are things that are really public goods
 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.759
are things that are really public goods
in the sense that if you're new

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769
in the sense that if you're new
 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.129
in the sense that if you're new
communicable disease develops of avian

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139
communicable disease develops of avian
 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.349
communicable disease develops of avian
influenza develops as a human disease

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359
influenza develops as a human disease
 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.259
influenza develops as a human disease
that can spread right then that's a

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269
that can spread right then that's a
 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.349
that can spread right then that's a
that's a global public concern you know

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359
that's a global public concern you know
 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.119
that's a global public concern you know
you can have a global health epidemic of

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129
you can have a global health epidemic of
 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.440
you can have a global health epidemic of
different types so that's another good

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
different types so that's another good
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.210
different types so that's another good
example where you really need countries

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
example where you really need countries
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.449
example where you really need countries
to cooperate to set up you know rules

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
to cooperate to set up you know rules
 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.330
to cooperate to set up you know rules
about what happens when diseases develop

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
about what happens when diseases develop
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.309
about what happens when diseases develop
how do you investigate these you know

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319
how do you investigate these you know
 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.429
how do you investigate these you know
how do you quarantine people and I you

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439
how do you quarantine people and I you
 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.559
how do you quarantine people and I you
know I think all due respect to the

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
know I think all due respect to the
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.599
know I think all due respect to the
World Health Organization I don't think

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609
World Health Organization I don't think
 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.970
World Health Organization I don't think
we have a strong global regime for

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980
we have a strong global regime for
 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.099
we have a strong global regime for
managing these these global public

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109
managing these these global public
 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.599
managing these these global public
health issues so i think the the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609
health issues so i think the the
 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.819
health issues so i think the the
environment environmental issues are the

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829
environment environmental issues are the
 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.550
environment environmental issues are the
most obvious lack in the current world

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560
most obvious lack in the current world
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.289
most obvious lack in the current world
and then I think dealing with global

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299
and then I think dealing with global
 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.390
and then I think dealing with global
health issues is the second area of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
health issues is the second area of
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:35.410
health issues is the second area of
obvious concern

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420
 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.480
you
