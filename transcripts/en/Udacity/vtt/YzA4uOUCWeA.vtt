00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.080
So let's see if we can
work this through.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.000
In the case of gamma equals 1 and

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.330
probability of left is a half and
probability of right is a half.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.430
Turns out it will be nice to solve for
the value function, so let's have

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.180
three variables that represent the value
function, one from each of those states.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.138
&gt;From the z state, what happens?

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:21.530
Well, with probability a half, we go
to the right, which ends up giving us

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.540
an immediate reward of 0 and then we get
a discounted value of being back in z.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.390
&gt;&gt; Or with a half probability,
we go to the left and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.200
we get a reward of 1 and we're done.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.020
So z is two-thirds.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.108
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just boring old algebra.

00:00:36.108 --> 00:00:39.528
I see, you magically put one-half in
where gamma used to be because gamma is

00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:40.160
one-half.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.980
That makes sense.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.270
Okay, fair, fair enough.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.936
&gt;&gt; I thought that would
make things easier.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:48.090
All right, so z is two-thirds,
and let's work out x and y.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.430
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
I guess you will do a similar thing.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the value at x from x with
probability a half, we go to the left

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.530
which gets us a 0 reward, and then
a discounted value of being back in x.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.704
Or with probability a half,
we get no reward, and

00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:05.436
then we have a discounted
value being in y.

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:09.770
Meanwhile y, the value from y is,
well, with probability a half,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.620
we get the discounted
value of being in x.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.820
And with probability a half, we get
a value of 1, and then we're done.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.998
&gt;&gt; That's two equations and
two unknowns.

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:19.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, linear equations.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.350
&gt;&gt; That's even better.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.240
&gt;&gt; So convenient.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.780
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.690
some normal algebra-ish
kind of things later,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.670
I have x is two-elevenths and
y is six-elevenths, better to be in y.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.663
So when we average our discounted
expected reward from each of

00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:38.574
these possible starting states, we get
a third of this and a third of that and

00:01:38.574 --> 00:01:43.505
a third or 0.4646 as our value for
taking this stochastic policy.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.840
&gt;&gt; That's not even 50/50, ha.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.769
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, and
we said that we could do better.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:51.751
So, we said we could do better by
choosing probability of left to

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.940
be a third and probability of
right being two-thirds, right?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.140
let's see if that actually
gives us a better number.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.060
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So we need to work out

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.910
what the value of z is in this case
where we're going two-thirds, one-third.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.460
So once we solve through for
z we find out that z is a half.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.550
Before, z was two-thirds and so we
actually are doing worse in this state

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.300
because we're spending more of our time
bashing against the wall to the right.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.860
&gt;&gt; And we're going to write down what
happens from these other two states.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.442
So the value at x which simplifies to 5x
= 2y, and the value of y, because again

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:27.460
we're going to go to the left one-third
of the time, getting us the value at x.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.924
And we're going to go to the right
two-thirds of the time getting us our

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:31.590
value of 1.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.430
All right, so

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.337
once we solve all that through, we get y
is five-sevenths and x is two-sevenths.

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:40.822
And so when we averaged these
three values out, we actually get

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:44.897
a half which is a little surprising to
me that those 7s kind of cancel out,

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:49.463
but a half is bigger than 0.464646,
so we actually have a better policy.

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:52.144
&gt;&gt; Right, and
coincidentally it does give us 50/50.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.468
&gt;&gt; What do you mean it gives us 50\50?

00:02:53.468 --> 00:02:56.428
&gt;&gt; Well, you said you wanted to do
better than 50/50, 0.5 that's 50/50.

00:02:56.428 --> 00:02:56.963
&gt;&gt; No, no, no.

00:02:56.963 --> 00:03:01.887
The 50/50 policy which gets us 0.464646,
we did better than that policy by trying

00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:04.360
a different policy
that actually gets 0.5.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.828
&gt;&gt; I know Michael,
I was using word play.

00:03:07.828 --> 00:03:08.768
&gt;&gt; Brilliant.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, so

00:03:08.768 --> 00:03:11.752
I suppose using all of that algebra,
we could actually figure out what

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:14.710
the optimal numbers are if they
aren't one-third, two-thirds.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.595
Maybe they are,
just by replacing all the one-thirds and

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:20.901
the two-thirds with P and 1- P.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:21.945
Then we'd figure out what P is.

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:22.675
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:25.585
&gt;&gt; And I'm sure that would
be a wonderful exercise for

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.447
the students to do.

00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:27.805
&gt;&gt; All right so,
we'll leave it for that then.

00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:28.305
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
