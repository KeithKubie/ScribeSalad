00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.689
&gt;&gt; Hi YouTubers, I am Henrietta Fore, and
I am the director of United States foreign

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.530
assistance and the administrator for the U.S.
Agency for International Development. And

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.020
we are the largest bi-lateral donor in the
world. And we try to reduce poverty and to

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.740
help people who are struggling for freedom
and people who want to build their own lives

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.610
and their own nations so that we can have
a better future for all. We've been here in

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.910
Davos talking about a number off issues all
of which are very important. Education and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.270
agriculture and finance, but let me tell you
about the global development commons. That

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.820
is an idea that is just beginning to take
root upon the donor and developing country

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.050
community that you could be a part of. It
is a way for nonprofit organizations and individuals,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.700
and developing county ministers and parents
and school teachers, and people in every walk

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.630
of life to come to a commons and talk about
the issues that are important to them. In

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.350
the commons you would be able to exchange
information on any issue of importance to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.680
you, but grouped around ideas that come out
of our development community. So ways to increase

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.689
prosperity and reduce poverty for the people
in developing countries. We want to have nonprofit

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.830
organizations and businesses and governments
all come together on the commons. Let me give

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.680
you an example. In the high mountains of Peru
there are a number of coffee growers, these

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.280
coffee growers should know a great deal about
how to grow the finest coffee in their world

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.579
because coffee prices are rising coffee demand
is rising. All of you probably drink a cup

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.700
of coffee at some point of the day and you
want a fine cup of coffee. The buyers are

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.310
world wide who want to buy coffee. So if our
farmers who are poor, and who are in remote

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.209
regions want to know about what they have
to do to grow the best coffee bean and how

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.180
to get it to market, we can get information
to them through the global development commons.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.640
So if you want to keep your eye on this issue
come to www.usaid.gov. Thanks very much, and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.260
be a part of it.
