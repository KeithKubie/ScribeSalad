00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.540
Mysteries of vernacular

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.029
Inaugurate:

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.004
to begin or introduce a system, policy, or period

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.002
or to admit someone formally into public office.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.511
The word inaugurate probably begins

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:30.772
with the Latin word avis,

00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:32.431
meaning bird.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.850
In ancient Rome, avis was combined

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.362
with the Latin verb garrire, to talk.

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:43.516
The two words together made augur,

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:46.680
literally one who talks to birds.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.908
Figuratively, however, augur was the name given

00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:52.384
to a specific religious official,

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.839
a type of soothsayer or prophet,

00:00:57.294 --> 00:00:59.751
who foretold events by studying the behavior of birds.

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:01.585
No major decision was made

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:04.676
without the augur's consultation.

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:07.783
He would analyze flight patterns and direction,

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:09.038
bird calls,

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:10.956
and general bird activities,

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:15.684
and then use these signs to interpret the will of the gods.

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:19.649
From augur comes the verb inaugurare,

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.272
to see omens from the flight of birds,

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:26.438
and, then later, to consecrate or act

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:29.604
when such omens are favorable.

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:32.968
Roman officials could only be installed in office

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.823
when the avian omens were auspicious.

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:38.328
Centuries later,

00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:41.884
the word was eventually transmuted into English

00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:43.914
as inaugurate.

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:47.130
Along the way, it lost its veneer of superstition

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.105
and was admitted formally

00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.634
into the jargon of politics.
