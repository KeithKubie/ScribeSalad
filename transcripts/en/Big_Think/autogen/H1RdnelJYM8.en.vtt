that process is going to have to start
now and we need to understand the safety

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
now and we need to understand the safety
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.960
now and we need to understand the safety
record which is very good we need to

one of the important things about the
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010
one of the important things about the
nuclear industry is the opportunity it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
nuclear industry is the opportunity it
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990
nuclear industry is the opportunity it
does give for jobs and well-paying jobs
