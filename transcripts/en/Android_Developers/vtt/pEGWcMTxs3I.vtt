[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.220
ROMAN NURIK: Hello there.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.950
And welcome once again to
"Android Design in Action."

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.205
I'm Roman Nurik.

00:00:59.205 --> 00:00:59.680
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.215
My name is Adam Koch.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:01.880
NICK BUTCHER: And hi.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.060
I'm Nick Butcher.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.250
ROMAN NURIK: And today's episode
is all about common UX

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.140
issues, or anti patterns,
as we'll call them.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.980
So let's just jump into the
slides here, since we have a

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.300
lot to cover.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.940
Just a bit of background.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.910
Our team, the developer
relations team for Android, we

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.880
do lots and lots of different
reviews for apps.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.210
We will look at apps in both a
formal and informal setting.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.280
Formally, internally we have
a review process that we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.970
look at apps for.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.226
This is completely separate from
editorial featuring, or

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:35.640
anything like that.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.650
We just look at apps and we
provide feedback to some of

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.260
our app developers that
we work with.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.240
And then in an informal setting,
obviously, we're

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.730
always looking at apps, getting
APK links sent over to

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.250
us in Google+.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.510
And we're looking at them and
providing our feedback.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.650
And so over the past few years
of doing this I guess, we're

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.280
noticed a couple of trends.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370
A couple of recurring
issues that seem to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.780
affect a lot of apps.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.250
Not every app, for certain,
but lots of apps.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.470
And so we wanted to put
together an episode of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.940
"Android Design in Action" where
we highlight the top 10

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.670
items that we keep seeing
over and over again.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.540
So before we jump in, anything
else you guys want to say

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.170
about our review?

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.450
NICK BUTCHER: So that's what
you meant by formal or

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.320
informal setting.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.730
I thought you mean
sometimes review

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.540
apps in the bar, sometimes.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.030
ADAM KOCH: We: should review
apps in the bar, actually.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.810
Good idea.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.500
ROMAN NURIK: At a gala, maybe.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.020
OK, so let's jump in.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.600
So these are our top 10 Android
UX anti-patterns.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.417
Before we jump in, a lot
of this stuff is

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.300
not necessarily negative.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.340
It's really constructive
criticism via the ideas that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.200
you guys take some of this
feedback and see how you can

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.940
improve your apps.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.820
And so with much love, these are
our top 10 anti-patterns

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.410
that we've noticed.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.640
So let's jump in.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.270
The first is--

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.540
and we have funny little titles
at the top, so enjoy.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.990
The first is, thou must
load this, or else.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.290
Basically modal loading
dialogues.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.460
And these are basically-- and
it's pretty obvious, right?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.120
It's dialogues that appear that
say loading, or saving,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.790
or sending, or whatever.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.500
And sometimes you can't even
press Back to cancel.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500
If you have poor network
connectivity, there's just no

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770
way out, except for
pressing Hoe.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.660
And it's one of the easiest ways
to tick off your users.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.980
Especially those that, like
I said, aren't in a good

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.700
connectivity setting.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.230
Or those that simply
are very quickly.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.460
They're trying to do a bunch
of things at once.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.940
The other thing I'll quickly
point out is, one of my pet

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.780
peeves is when you throw up
a loading dialogue when

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.870
switching tabs.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.680
Because basically, you
switch to tab.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.830
Maybe you accidentally
chose that tab.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.840
And now you have to wait for
that tab to load to switch to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.820
something else.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.790
So the solution to this is
really to try to use inline

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.870
loading spinners instead, like
in this little graphic here.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.630
Or better yet, just try to load
data in the background

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.200
where possible, so that you
can generally just avoid

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.120
[? showing ?] loading
spinners.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.320
So that's my, I guess, the
number 10 in the list.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.980
Anything else before
we move on, guys?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.510
ADAM KOCH: One thing that just
really annoys me, though, is

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.850
when I touch on a
list of items.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.640
And I go to the details,
and then it throws up

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.870
that loading spinner.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.780
And then I hit Back, and I can't
go back to the list of

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.960
items again.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.360
It's just so frustrating.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.090
NICK BUTCHER: I think generally,
dialogues are

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.120
fairly poor [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.440
Generally anything that's
blocking, anything that says

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.580
you have to deal with
this first.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.740
Unless it's completely
unavoidable, then try and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.410
avoid dialogues.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.260
But especially learning
dialogues.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.450
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.830
OK, moving on?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.260
ADAM KOCH: Let's go
to number nine.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.240
In the wise words of MC Hammer,
can't touch this.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.620
So we've brought this up
many times in ADIA.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.130
And this is definitely a
recurring theme we see when

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.100
we're looking at apps.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.320
So the first one is small
touch targets.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.170
So really, all touch targets
should be 48dp.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.200
We did write here that it could
go down to 38dp if you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.170
absolutely need to.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.840
But really, 48dp is what you
should be aiming for.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.290
Why?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.090
Because that's sort of maps to
roughly nine millimeters, or I

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.100
think somewhere between seven
and nine with a little bit of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.180
variability.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.120
Which really ends up being the
perfect touch size for the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.850
average person's fingers.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.220
So unless, I guess, you're
targeting a particular user

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.100
group with extremely small
hands, many babies, you should

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.310
really be shooting
for 48dp here.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.630
And then the second one-- and
this is something we see

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.960
frequently, all the time--
is no touch feedback.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.660
And if you put an app in front
of any of us, you'll probably

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.610
see one of the first things
we do is we actually

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.400
go and touch something.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.720
And then we slide our finger off
a little bit, just to see

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.950
if there's any touch
feedback there.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.570
So it's a pretty common mistake
to make, especially

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.560
when you're not using the
standard button components.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.490
Because you may have to do a
little bit of extra work to

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.590
add that touch feedback.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.950
But it really means that your
app feels much more

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.120
responsive.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.510
ROMAN NURIK: And I think it's
also-- the no touch feedback,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.900
as well as the previous
anti-pattern--

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.840
it really changes your app's
feeling of perceived latency.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.960
When things don't respond, or
you can't do certain things,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.000
there's an increased sense
of perceived latency.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.320
Or users perceive that
your app is slower

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.960
than it actually is.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.450
So it's one of the fastest--

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.040
people talk about speed
all the time.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.760
Let's make our app faster,
faster, faster.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.050
It's not just about raw speed.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.140
It's really about
perceived speed.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.075
ADAM KOCH: And the
funny thing is--

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:41.190
go ahead, Nick.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.310
NICK BUTCHER: Sorry, I was going
to say, I think it's

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.320
really important when
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.960
tools like digital interfaces.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.810
Where the hottest style is all
about white space, and

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.230
[INAUDIBLE], and so on.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.050
And it's really important to
communicate what is tappable.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.880
What you can interact with.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.670
And I think touch feedback is
something that instantly

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.490
reacts to you and lights up the
entire area which you can

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.215
interact with.

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:00.490
Will communicate back to you.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.720
And so you'll know next time,
all right, this is the area I

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.410
have to play with.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.340
It's really important.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.670
ADAM KOCH: Cool, all right.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.945
Should we move on?

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:09.370
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.870
So number eight,
visual design.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.040
I think this was the one
I'll talk about.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.890
So in general, design does not
mean playing with Photoshop

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.740
until you use all
of the effects.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.600
Until you use all of the layer
effects, like here on the

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.920
left, with the drop shadows
and all of that.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.550
There are a couple of concepts
here going on.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.640
Basically, when you think about
visual design for your

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.970
app, focus really on content,
rather than Chrome.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.470
Users really aren't installing
your app just to see the

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.930
pretty buttons, and the
pretty top bars, and

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.580
all these fancy things.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.790
They're really installing your
app, probably because they

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.860
care about the content or the
functionality that you offer.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.430
So really make that shine.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.200
If you're going to dedicate any
sort of visual attention

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.100
or visual resources to anything,
it should really be

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.590
the content.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.370
Additionally, a couple of other
things in the realm of

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.300
visual styling for your app.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.560
Try to be consistent.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.820
All too often, we see apps
that have three or four

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.180
different button styles,
or check

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.400
box styles, or something.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.310
And they're kind of mixing
and matching.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.950
And generally, that can be the
result of too many people, too

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.210
many cooks in the kitchen.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.670
Too many people working
on the same app.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.860
So where possible, try to
introduce consistency, using

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.340
things like Android's styles
and themes, framework, to

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.780
basically make it
really simple.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.070
To have consistent style
across your app.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.990
And the last thing in the realm
of visual design is poor

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.150
attention to detail.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.885
So it's not only about getting
the high level things right.

00:08:46.885 --> 00:08:51.060
Like getting the right color
and getting the right basic

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.930
theme down.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.670
It's really about attention to
details, with respect to

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.400
typography.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.990
Making sure you're using the
right typographic palette.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.520
Also, with respect to metrics.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.170
That's one of the biggest things
that people do wrong

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.000
that we see.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.060
Is developers don't use
the right spacing.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.720
So there's two little space.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.200
Or there's too much space
around an element.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.100
Or too small margins
around the sides.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.980
And things like that can really
break the concept of

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.020
alignment and visual balance
within your app.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.520
So definitely focus
on these things.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.720
And I think certainly, we've
covered most of these on

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.700
"Android Design in Action"
in episodes past.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.370
But definitely, this is
one of the things you

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.130
should focus on.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.580
Anything else before
I move on?

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.590
OK, let's do it.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.460
NICK BUTCHER: So in at number
seven, we've got

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.610
living in the past.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.980
Or as you said, if your app is
living in 2009, your users are

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.460
going to have a bad time.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.820
ROMAN NURIK: It rhymes.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.420
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I'm
just visiting Reno.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.870
I'm the South Park ski
instructor there.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:52.510
Sorry, right.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.130
So the first point I want to
make about this is the menu

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.680
button of shame, or the
legacy menu button.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.630
It's kind of very
little excuse.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.690
All of these [INAUDIBLE] we've
got on the slide here

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.010
generally point towards the fact
that you've not updating

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.400
your application to move
with the latest.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.500
It's one thing to look at the
platform distribution stats

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.160
and say, hey, somebody uses
it on all their devices.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.955
But that's not really being fair
to the users who are on

00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:22.420
your devices, or have these
shiny, new devices.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.370
Probably the people who are
downloading and installing

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.210
your application more often.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.900
So we really think you need to
be looking at, maybe not the

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.980
blazing latest release.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.230
But here we said you should be
targeting at least API 16,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.945
which is the first Jellybean
release,

00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:39.020
which came out at what?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.090
Google I/O last year?

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.622
So over a year old.

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:45.380
If you're not targeting that
newer version, you're probably

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.540
missing out on some new
functionality, as well as

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.160
probably degrading some
of the functionality.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.370
Because some of the shims
that their system

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.340
has to put in place.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.500
Like the [INAUDIBLE] button.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.980
So if you're below 14, I think
you've got a real big problem.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.350
Because you're going to get
this legacy menu emulator

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.790
button, button of shame.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.440
It could look terrible.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.790
Especially on devices like the
HT1, where it puts up this big

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:07.980
bar across the bottom
of your application.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.550
And really ruins all the time
and attention I hope you spent

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.820
on the rest of the design.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.720
So really think about that.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.210
And the other thing is
not picking up on the

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.590
modern look and feel.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.520
So for example, if I'm using
an application, and it has

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.730
some kind of gingerbread
era and stying.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.180
For example, it might
look kind of hollow.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.282
But then you touch something,
and you

00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:32.980
get that orange highlight.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.090
Or you scroll and you get that
legacy, rounded scroll bar.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.210
Maybe you're familiar
with that.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.730
That really breaks the
experiences for me.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.940
Suddenly it's just like, wow,
that was unexpected.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.980
What's going on there?

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.450
So wherever possible, you want
to be using the latest and

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.260
greatest styles.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.960
And building on top of them,
using them as your foundation.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.410
I think when I often see this
is with spinners as well.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.930
So you'll be using
an application.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.180
And they set a style on the an

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.190
indeterminate progress spinner.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.050
Often set the style
to indeterminate.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.330
And they haven't used the
appropriate theme default

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.140
syntax for it.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.050
So you get style spinner.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.150
And it just looks completely
gross and out of place.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.790
ROMAN NURIK: The other problem
with the loading spinner is

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.530
that the gingerbread era one
used frame animation.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.730
So there are basically
8 frames, like

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.990
dik-dik-dik-dik-dik and so on.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.030
And the hollow spinner
is actually

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.660
using a tween animation.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.620
So it's a much smoother
rotation.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.580
You actually see
each individual

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.890
frame as it gets rendered.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.740
Well, not each individual frame,
but each point around

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.230
the circle.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.270
So it's much, much better
to use the hollow style

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.470
interminable loading spinners.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.030
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so I guess
the takeaway from this, what

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.790
we're trying to say here, is use
the latest and greatest.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.130
And build on top of it.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:46.750
ROMAN NURIK: Excellent.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.000
Moving on?

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:50.750
OK.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.830
Polluted Android.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.640
Who is going to talk
about that?

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.030
NICK BUTCHER: I think
that's me again.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.300
So there's a page on the design

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.610
guide called Pure Android.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.320
And it is what it sounds like.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.520
It's talking about don't borrow

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.690
metaphors from other platforms.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.920
Don't use iconography or other
such from other platforms.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.440
If you're building an Android
experience for your Android

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.930
users, then build an
Android experience.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.670
I think we did a whole show
about branding inconsistency.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.330
Whether you should be
consistent with--

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:18.680
and what that means.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.560
What you should be consistent
with if you're on other

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.270
platforms, for example.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.783
So I'll refer you back
to that for the deep

00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:26.590
dive on this topic.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.950
But essentially, if your app
doesn't conform to the Android

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.340
platform, you're the one who's
going to look out of place.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.420
If I'm using 50, 60, 70 apps
on my Android phone, and I

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.670
switch to your app, and your app
doesn't look and feel how

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.110
an Android app should look and
feel, then you're the one

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.670
who's going to stand out.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.670
So some very, very common things
we might see might be,

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.210
for example, using right
pointing carrots to indicate

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.140
that there's a level below
of information.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.710
That just doesn't make
sense on Android.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.660
I mean, we have a
very different

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.390
default transition animation.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.185
So pointing right, and then
something expanding, and

00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:03.880
fading just isn't line up
as well as going back.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.980
It doesn't slide back
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.530
So I guess there's just no
special metaphor there.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.660
Especially with Android's use of
the horizontal metaphor for

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.770
moving between content.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.060
So taps, for example.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.210
You might page between
them like this.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.700
But then if there's a right
arrow, does that mean I'm

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:16.970
going down?

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.980
Or I'm going sides?

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.410
And every time, it just
doesn't work.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.480
So respect that.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.800
Tabs.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.050
On Android, tabs
go at the top.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.040
So if you're doing tabs at the
bottom, basically you're going

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.950
to look out of place.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.240
And it's going to be, why
is this app doing this

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.040
differently?

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.810
And the last one we call that
is just wholesale borrowing

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.070
from other platforms.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.480
This is if you see, say,
iconography from another

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.500
platform, or a picker from
another platform, which just

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.920
looks completely out of place.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.000
Just don't do it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.570
Just use the defaults, as what
you use is you expect.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.990
And doing otherwise is being
quite arrogant and aggressive

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.940
toward them.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.036
So stick with what the
platform [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:53.036 --> 00:14:54.530
ROMAN NURIK: And that
covers it well.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.860
Let's move on.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.310
All right.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.360
Was this me?

00:14:59.360 --> 00:14:59.960
This may have been me.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.770
I think this is me.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.900
And actually, this plays
into what Nick was

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.390
mentioning about branding.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.710
Which metaphors do you use?

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.490
Which UI patterns do you use?

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.340
This is the anti-pattern of the
navigation is my brand.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.370
Or the entire app should
be mine, right?

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.640
I should control everything.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.630
And generally, that's
the case.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.760
You should control
visual styling.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.210
You should control the
information architecture.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.060
And we did a whole
segment on this.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.690
But there are a few things that
you should really try to

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.870
use from the Android
design guidelines.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.150
Obviously, Pure Android,
that's very important.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.230
But also, anything related
to core app navigation.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.180
So things like the action bar.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.660
Things like tabs.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.500
And also things like
the navigation jar.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.360
So this anti-pattern is
basically apps that reinvent

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.910
the wheel, by creating
a custom top bar

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.940
with a centered title.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.480
And then two actions, one on
the left, one on the right.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.550
They're like a very
different looking

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.900
navigation jar indicator.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.950
This basically isn't
Android, right?

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.690
I mean, Android users expect
an action bar the top.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.910
The title should be
left aligned.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.600
There are certain things
that should existent

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.690
in the action bar.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.980
Navigation on the top left,
actions on the top right.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.430
Or very poorly implemented
action bars.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:24.360
And generally, this is because
of the lack of the tool kit

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.300
that allow you to bring the
action bar to earlier versions

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.980
of the platform.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.490
But Action Bar Sherlock has
existed for quite a while.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.250
And that's still
a great choice.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.590
But also Action Bar Compat
was recently released.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.140
So for designers and
developers--

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.540
well, for developers
especially--

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.070
if you're rolling your own
action bar, just stop.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.630
Stop doing it.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.680
And just use Action
Bar Compat.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.990
But also, navigation drawers.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.790
I'm not going to go through
all the details here.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.795
But there are a lot of specifics
in what should and

00:16:53.795 --> 00:16:56.970
what shouldn't go into
navigation drawer.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.620
Generally, anything that's not
really core app navigation.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.660
Something that the user's going
to be switching between

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.510
someone often.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.819
That probably shouldn't go
to navigation drawer.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.359
And we did another full episode
on this, so I won't go

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:09.410
into the details.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.339
But if you're a developer, you
should definitely be using

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.369
Drawer Layout and Action
Bar Drawer toggle.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.859
Try to avoid using any of the
other libraries out there that

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.560
don't implement this way.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.430
Because you're not going to get
the same interaction that

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.680
the platform provides.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.260
And in this vantage, I want to
quickly point out some things

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.990
that shouldn't go in the
navigation drawer.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.290
So Home, Explore, Shop
Now, My Profile.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.340
That's fine, and that's kind of
core top level navigation.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.500
Things like search--

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.570
its navigational, but by
platform convention, it should

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.160
really go into the action bar.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.580
So it does not belong here.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.180
Settings, also in the
action overflow.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.220
Help, About, Send Feedback, that
should all go into the

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.570
action overflow.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.120
Anything linking to other apps
that your brand offers, that

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.790
should probably not go here.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.590
Because chances are, folks don't
care about every app in

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.870
your portfolio.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.090
So generally, you want to put
that-- if you do want to place

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.390
it in your app, put that
somewhere deeper in the app.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.230
Maybe about your brand, and in
there, list the other things.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.700
And then obviously,
random things that

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.520
people will never click.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.380
Like my sister's friends'
website that I promise is

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:14.870
really awesome.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.810
Please check it out.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.990
That does not belong in
the navigation drawer.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.560
So try to keep it simple.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.960
Try to keep it to what's
in the guidelines.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.230
Let's move on.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.190
NICK BUTCHER: All right.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.490
So number four is custom
non-Android sharing.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.380
Now, I will note here that the
screen shots in this slide are

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.300
actually the positive, or the
good, sharing mechanisms.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.850
Not the examples of bad,
or non-Android sharing.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.900
I was looking for good
examples of that.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.970
But there's a lot of them.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:45.920
And we see it a lot.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.300
But I didn't want to
sort of ding any

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.480
particular app out there.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.120
So put in some positive
examples.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.030
Positive reinforcement is the
name of the game here.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.850
So Android has a great ability
to share or use this action

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.470
sending tent between
applications.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.600
So you should always use it.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.590
Always make it available
to your users.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.720
Again, along the same
things that we were

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.550
talking about before.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.870
It's just a frustrating
experience when the user goes

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.430
to try and share something, and
they're stuck with one or

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.840
two static options.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.060
As you can see here, on my
phone, I have tons of

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.230
different apps installed.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.360
I share to different
apps all the time.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.140
And so not having the ability
to choose the one that you

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.290
want to share to is just a
really frustrating user

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.510
experience.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.930
Just to quickly go over
the examples here.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.840
On the left, you've got the
share action provider.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.680
And so that's something that
goes directly in the action

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.060
bar, and actually has a pop up
menu that drops down there.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.440
And you can choose from your
most recently, or most

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.100
frequently, shared
applications.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.720
And then, the second one is
the standard system share

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.280
dialogue that you can
trigger using that

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.490
action sending tent.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.230
And then on the right, this is
a custom example, actually,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.750
from the Timely app, which
I really like.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.870
So in this case, they actually
have listed just a few to

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.745
start with.

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:04.870
But you can see that they have
this little drop-down at the

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.110
bottom saying "more", which
actually goes and

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.180
pragmatically fetches
the rest of the

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.640
sharing options available.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.620
So I guess the moral of the
story is try and always use

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.420
the system sharing tents.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.430
If you really must for some
reason, have a list of

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.860
specific networks.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.350
Maybe it's part of your
business goals

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.740
or something else.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.730
You should still compliment it
with the standard action

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.980
[? send ?] based sharing
alongside.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.650
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:33.700
Actually, one more thing.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.890
This actually is in the Pure
Android guidelines, right?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:40.300
So again, don't violate any of
the pure Android guidelines.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.110
Try to adhere to those
as best as possible.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.740
And this is--

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.778
I think it's called-- don't
hard code links to

00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:45.920
apps in your app.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.720
ADAM KOCH: And actually--

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.160
sorry, one last thing--

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.180
from a development standpoint,
it's actually much easier to

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.000
use the system sharing
tents than going off

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.500
and do it all yourself.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.370
So I mean, from a development
standpoint, it's also a

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.202
positive thing.

00:20:59.202 --> 00:20:59.700
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.046
All right, moving on.

00:21:01.046 --> 00:21:02.340
Mimicking Native with WebView.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.760
ADAM KOCH: I think
this is me again.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.280
So you can see here some quick
examples on the left.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:14.040
We've got the ADIA YouTube
playlist loading in a WebView.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.400
That's a great experience
there, to

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.700
browse the ADIA videos.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.490
This is really just
a bit of fun.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.980
Because actually, if you load
the YouTube website, it looks

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.900
fairly decent.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.540
Because it switches to
the mobile version.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.850
On the right there, you can see
the great example of the

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.320
ADIA, or the Android Design in
Action, or ADIA application

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.160
that's in the Google Play store,
which looks fantastic.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.110
It's very responsive, works on
all different screen sizes,

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.820
really works great.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.240
So let's move to some of
the talking points.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.690
So the first point.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:45.480
It's not genuine.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.280
It's kind of like lying
to your users.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.030
So it's not really the most
positive experience.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.290
Especially if you're taking
up a lot of the core

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.860
UI with a web view.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.710
And following from that, the
performance is generally going

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.000
to be degraded.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.930
If you have a drawer that's
built using a web view, you're

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.450
going to notice that
it's not as smooth.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.510
It's not as responsive.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.990
It just doesn't behave like
the user would expect.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.070
And then from the example on
the previous page, don't

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.110
package up a web app in an APK
just to be on Android.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.310
Just for the sake of being
in Google Play

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.890
Store to be on Android.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.060
We love web apps.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.390
Web apps work great
on Android.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.720
But when the user expects
them is in the browser.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.300
In the Chrome browser the system
browser, where they

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.310
sort of understand that the
UI conventions and they're

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.705
viewing a web page.

00:22:34.705 --> 00:22:35.930
NICK BUTCHER: And we're not
[INAUDIBLE] use WebViews at

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.710
all, right?

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.360
There's several components
where it makes sense.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.840
Like Gmail, for example,
renders HTML and email.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.880
And it makes perfect sense to
use, say, on a web view

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.590
control there.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.200
Or if you're rendering some
news content, then perhaps

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.300
that makes sense.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.800
I'm not saying don't
build your whole

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.880
application for this.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.670
ADAM KOCH: Exactly, yeah.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.880
So another good example is
Pocket, which uses a WebView

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.300
or HTML to render the
article views.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.950
And it actually works
really well in

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.480
those particular cases.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.090
We're really saying, don't just
throw a WebView into the

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.200
entire application, and make
it take over the sort of

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.130
standard core UI elements.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.650
ROMAN NURIK: One last point I
wanted to make about web apps

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.260
versus native apps is.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.000
There's a tendency for brands
to be like, oh we need to be

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.080
on Android, right?

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.340
And you mentioned this.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.670
And we need to be on android,
so we need to

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.510
make a native app.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.970
But a ton of Android usage,
that's regular users, most of

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.170
them use the browser
quite a bit.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.790
So that you're not losing
those users.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.230
They're going to access
your experience

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.420
through a different mechanism.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.770
And if you think that a web
based solution is the best

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.220
option, then that's going to
work for a lot of users.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.540
So don't immediately jump into,
oh, we need to just have

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.390
this hybrid thing, where we just
throw our entire web app

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.920
into a native APK So that
just doesn't work.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.720
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, and I think
you'll find, if you do go and

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.540
throw a web view in, make
it take over the entire

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.290
application, you're going to
violate a lot of these other

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:58.950
things that we've talked
about today.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.370
Like the touch feedback, the
touch size, the UI elements,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.080
the living in the past.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.410
All these things are very hard
to do if you're going to use a

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.480
WebView to take over your
entire application.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.130
Moving on?

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.400
ROMAN NURIK: Yep, moving on.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.270
Nick, you want to talk
about onboarding?

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.560
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE] we
have poor onboarding UX.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.920
So this is one of my
personal bugbears.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.470
When you fire up an application
and 101 different

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.550
things are competing for your
attention at the same time.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.320
And none of them are what I look
at your app for, which is

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.180
probably to see the content.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.400
This is a personal frustration
of mine.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.450
So there's many things that
people tend to throw in

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.300
at the first run.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.600
So things like requiring
registration straight away, a

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:46.230
splash screen, popping up in
their own login provider, and

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.060
so on, and so forth.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.380
And all of these things just
road bumps, or speed bumps,

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.790
stopping me from doing what
launched the app to do, which

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.110
is see some content.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.890
So I would much rather see an
application that gets me to

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.730
content as quickly as it can,
and then delays any necessary

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.820
steps until they are
truly last minute.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.870
So log on, for example.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.550
Let me see some content, and
try and interact with it.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.560
And if I try to do an
interaction which requires log

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.820
on, then prompt for it.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.680
Because at that point, I can
understand exactly why you're

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.000
asking for this thing,
and so on.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.680
Splash screens.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.040
Another personal bugbear, it's
been in our design guidelines

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.250
forever, that you shouldn't
really use splash screens.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.290
They don't really serve much
purpose, other than Delaying

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.940
you from getting to content
you want to see.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.250
So if you think that it's the
only way to embed branding

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.410
into your application,
then I think

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.410
you have bigger problems.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.480
There really are much better
ways to provide branding to

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.070
your application.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.260
Like using the action bar, and
your palette, and so forth.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.480
So I don't accept that
as an argument.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.130
And then conversely, there's
lots of things you can use to

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.550
actually easy onboarding
process.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.770
So for example, integrating with
popular log on providers.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:00.660
So things like Facebook,
Twitter, Google+ have

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.020
excellent single click
sign on providers.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.040
You can even do intelligent
things.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.370
Like use the package manager.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.080
Like a system component on
Android to detect of the user

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.460
has one of these native
applications installed, which

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.940
is a pretty strong indicator
that they-- a user of one of

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.540
these log on providing
services.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.350
- And use that to
show or hide, or

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.060
reorder your log on options.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.720
And they'll provide
a much slicker UX.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.140
If you really, really must force
someone to log in, with

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.850
a username or password, for
example, then there's some

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.650
clever stuff you can do.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.480
Like my phone already knows a
bunch of my email address or

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.340
usernames that were just
saved in the system.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.200
You can query for these and use
them all to complete, or

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.650
pre-populate fields.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.860
You can query the system
to the users.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.646
Full name, and telephone
number, and

00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:46.330
so on, and so forth.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.940
So you can pre-fill a bunch
of different addresses.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.920
I've even seen applications
going a step further.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.940
If you really have to sign up
on the phone, do you really

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.020
want to have to sit there
and peck out a password?

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.270
Why not offer to auto-generate
some random string.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.327
And let them hit Refresh
to rotate it

00:27:05.327 --> 00:27:06.180
to something different.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.320
Because the user can always just
recess it later, as long

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.870
as they have their
email address.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.220
ROMAN NURIK: And they're
probably not going to remember

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.290
their password anyway.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:13.890
It's like, I oh, I just want
to put in some password and

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.100
get past this screen.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:16.640
NICK BUTCHER: Exactly.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.000
So basically, do everything you
can to simplify the first

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.890
user experience, and get you to

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.550
content as soon as possible.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.865
I think too often when we're
like designing and developing

00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:27.100
apps, you've looked
at the application

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.640
so many times, right?

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.510
That you can see through
that process.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.010
Or you logged in
the first time.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.960
And after that, you then
continue to look at the

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.670
substance screens.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.550
Don't you about the first
impression that you're making

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.760
on your users.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.660
So super important.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.970
I mean, this becomes even more
important if you're lucky

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.570
enough to become featured,
or picked by a blog, or

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.430
something like that.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.840
You'd be surprised at how many
users will install your

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.940
application without fully
understanding the value

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:52.830
proposition exactly.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.210
Understanding what it does,
just to try it out.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.430
And it the first thing you see
is a bunch of overlays

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.400
explaining how to do stuff.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.150
And logins and pop-ups.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.285
They're forcing you to take more
steps before you get to

00:28:03.285 --> 00:28:05.510
the actual content, to show
them the actual value.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.760
Then, you'll have
a huge fall off.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.970
ROMAN NURIK: On the converse,
completely on the opposite end

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.220
of spectrum, if I open up your
app and I see an immediate

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.450
empty list of you with
nothing there.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.260
Just like a little plus button
on the top right, and really

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.700
just an empty screen.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.690
That is also poor communication
of the value

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.660
proposition.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.390
So empty states, which we'll
talk about very briefly.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.510
Empty states for collections are
actually a really valuable

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.492
way of communicating that.

00:28:34.492 --> 00:28:34.990
All right.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.390
Moving on?

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.120
I think we're running
low on time.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.505
The last one, number one.

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:41.150
We should have done a drum roll,
but I guess we didn't

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.700
have the time.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.870
Android is not just phones
in portrait.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.120
What this means is, if you're
developing an app and you have

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.590
a phone UI, don't lock
it into portrait.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.640
Make sure that the user
can rotate into

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.380
landscape quite a few--

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.290
I think something that
chopped up here.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.070
There's supposed to be a graphic
here, but whatever.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.430
Quite a few users actually
use phones in portrait--

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.560
in landscape, rather.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.320
Especially those with
maybe car docs, or

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.320
even desktop docs.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.660
So for example, if you're a
sports app, there should be a

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.570
landscape dashboard view,
or something.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.050
Especially if I'm in a car,
in some sort of doc.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:26.480
If you're another type of app,
or you're a news app or

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.980
something, consider--

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.150
think about how you
can rearrange your

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.480
text so that it works.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.750
And potentially even, switch
around your interactions.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.090
Maybe horizontal goes to
vertical swipe, or

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:37.830
something like that.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.890
I'm not really sure.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:43.310
But the point here is, don't
force your users to hold their

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.620
device in a certain way.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.710
And then another component of
this is that Android is not

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.430
only phones.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.700
Android involves tablets
as well.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.090
And the line between tabled and
phone is kind of blurry.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:57.920
But really, Android
is really just--

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.680
well, I guess one of the ways
you can describe most Android

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.710
devices right now is touch
screens ranging from about

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.730
three inches to about
10 inches.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.000
So responsive design is
really important here.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.580
Make sure that your
app can respond to

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.960
the size of the screen.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.740
And that it make best use of
white space, and best use of

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.680
content in all those different
configurations.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.110
Not only that, Android
is also--

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.520
it's not only about touch.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.400
There are some devices that are
D-pad focus at Google TV.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.080
So definitely think about ways
in which you can response to

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.710
your device in both portrait,
landscape, tablet, phone, and

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.292
different input types.

00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:35.730
NICK BUTCHER: I think it's
really important the point

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.340
you've thought about here
in this subtext.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.270
That it sounds scary as well
saying being responsive to all

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.200
these different form factors,
and so forth.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.610
But there really is so much you
can do very, very easily.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.550
Things like upping the font
size when you have over a

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.780
certain amount of space.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.895
Or changing the padding.

00:30:50.895 --> 00:30:53.970
Or going to a centered margin.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.420
Things like that can be
an hour of work, or

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.490
two hours of work.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.850
And make your application
vastly

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.390
better on a larger device.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.240
So it really is worth just
trying it out on a range of

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.300
devices or emulators and
seeing how it goes.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.250
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.760
With that, let's jump into some
quick honorable mentions

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.550
since we're running
super low on time.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.500
First, per the guidelines for
launcher icons, your app icon

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.460
should really be a distinct
silhouette.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.440
I know there are a couple of
Google apps that don't really

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.390
adhere to this guideline.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.380
But that's definitely
something that

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.420
we're looking into.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.010
Don't forget, like I mentioned,
don't forget the

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.710
empty states for your
collections.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.490
So if you have nothing in a
list, if you have, let's say,

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.030
a to-do list.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.640
And if you have nothing in
there, if you have no to-do

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.190
items, offer the user some ways
to add something to do,

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.340
maybe like a Plus button.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.470
Or introduce what is going
to happen once you

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.010
press the Plus button.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.050
NICK BUTCHER: Or you have some
sample content in there.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.790
Like the to-do list might have
some sample to-do items.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.430
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, some sample
to-do items, like milk,

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.450
cheese, eggs, and so on.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.970
Graphic assets should
be crisp.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.780
I think most folks are starting
to his correctly.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.510
But definitely make sure
to provide XHDPI.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:08.220
And now with Samsung Galaxy
S4, HTC1, XXHTPIS.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.900
Those are becoming the norm.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.480
Take advantage of platform
features.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.200
Make sure that especially if
you're in a category that is

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.890
heavy on widgets, like sports,
or news, make sure

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.440
to provide a widget.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.440
And then make sure to provide
expendable notifications.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.160
It's too easy, it's so, so.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.110
NICK BUTCHER: I have to run.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.480
ROMAN NURIK: Say what?

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.060
NICK BUTCHER: I have to go.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.830
I'm getting kicked
out of my room.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.250
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, OK.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.560
All right, see you, Nick.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.560
So make sure to provide
expandable notifications.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.600
They're just so easy to add.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.390
Lastly, notifications.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.660
You should use them correctly.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.900
Don't show too many
notifications.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.490
Show them in appropriate
fashion.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.540
Show them an appropriate time.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.660
And then for the icons
themselves, the notification

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.890
icons in the status bar, make
sure to use white icons.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:54.750
Don't add any color.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.260
Because the status bar actually

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.440
automatically dims that.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.160
So it's going to go from a blue
or red to some sort of

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.810
maroon, or some sort
of dark blue.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:03.920
That's just weird.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.590
So those are the honorable
mentions.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:10.110
Very last, last but not least,
if you have any anti-patterns

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:13.810
that we missed out on today,
and you want to let us know

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:18.400
about them, and share or maybe
rant about them, just comment

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.730
about it in either the event
or the Google+ page.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.570
And, yeah.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.670
We'll see what you
come up with.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.360
All right.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.790
So I think that was
it for today.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.510
Nick just dropped off, so I
guess we'll just end it here.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.240
As always, I'm your
host, Roman Nurik.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:33.850
ADAM KOCH: See you
later, guys.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.810
My name's Adam Koch.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.510
And over in London, we
had Nick Butcher.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.340
ROMAN NURIK: We had
Nick Butcher.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.990
And this is, that's.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.000
I'm not Nick Butcher.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.170
That--

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.142
Nick Butcher.

00:33:41.142 --> 00:33:41.800
All right.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.910
See you guys next time.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:34:38.672
