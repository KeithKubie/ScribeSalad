00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
Jess recently started a business
producing cosmetic products

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.950
made from natural ingredients.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.450
She wants to
advertise her products

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.870
by distributing bags of
samples in her neighborhood.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.360
She calculated that it
takes her two minutes

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.970
to prepare each bag.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.640
How many hours--
they give us minutes

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.070
here, now they want
hours-- how many hours will

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.650
it take to prepare
1,200 bags of samples

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.120
if she asks seven friends
to help her with her work?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.050
So the one thing we
could think about is,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.280
how long would it take
her to do it by herself?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.510
So it takes her, by herself,
two minutes per bag.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:54.540
And then we have 1,200 bags,
not 12 bags, 1,200 bags

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.850
which means it's going to
take her two minutes for each

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.900
of the 1,200 bags.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.294
Well that's 2 times
1,200 is 2,400 minutes.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:06.460
Now that's if she was just
working on it by herself,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.330
but she's got seven friends.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.140
And we can assume
that they would all

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.689
take about two minutes
to prepare each bag.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.480
Now this is a little
bit tricky because you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.432
might want to divide
this by 7 saying, hey,

00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:18.390
we're going to have seven
times as many people.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780
But you remember, she
asks seven friends

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.530
so there's actually
eight people involved.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.540
There's Jess and
her seven friends.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.990
So it's actually going
to be eight times faster

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.022
than if Jess did it by herself.

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.480
This is if she only
had one person.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.021
If you're going to
have eight people,

00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:37.670
you are going to take
eight times less time.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.150
So with eight people, it's
going to be 2,400 divided

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.310
by 8 is 300 minutes.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.380
And we're almost done, except
for the fact that they asked

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.030
for our answer in
terms of hours.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
So 300 minutes is
how many hours?

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.260
Well you have 60
minutes per hour

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.680
so you could say 300
minutes-- I'll just write min

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.389
for short-- divided
by 60 minutes per hour

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:14.210
gives us 300 divided
by 60 is 5 hours.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.840
So it will take Jess and her
seven friends, a total of eight

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.393
people, five hours to prepare
all of her sample bags.
