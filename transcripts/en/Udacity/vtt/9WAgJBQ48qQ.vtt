00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.630
Now you may have noticed, one of the annoying things about

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.640
using input this way, is that it's distracting to have the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.860
address bar on the screen when I'm taking a picture. One

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.880
thing you might want to do is take your app full screen.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.690
This is pretty simple to do. Just grab the dom element

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.850
that you want to make full screen, that you want to

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.630
be the root of the window and call its requestFullscreen method.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.370
Now, at the time of this recording, requestFullscreen is still vendor

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.650
prefixed, so we'll have to use webkitRequestFullscreen and

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.500
mozRequestFullScreen. One important thing to notice here is the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.570
difference in capitalization. Kind of annoying, but it'll

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.600
get fixed sooner or later. One important thing to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.410
note is that you can only call this API in the handler for a user action. Like,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.300
clicking on a button. This is to avoid

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.550
apps forcing users into full-screen mode. You can't just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.060
do this when you're loading the page.
