00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
the maybe the first 10,000 pictures that
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.929

but the next 10,000 might be decent and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
but the next 10,000 might be decent and
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960
but the next 10,000 might be decent and
the next 10,000 after that might be

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
the next 10,000 after that might be
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969
the next 10,000 after that might be
pretty good so the quicker I can go and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
pretty good so the quicker I can go and
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770
pretty good so the quicker I can go and
take that first 10,000 that are just

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
