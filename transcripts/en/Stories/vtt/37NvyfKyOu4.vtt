00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.580
SUBJECT 1: Making love in
our country, specifically,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.000
has to be very much planned.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.700
You have to pick
out a date, you have

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.860
a take out those four to
five hours of the night, cook

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.653
stories, we're at
your friend's place.

00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:15.015
SUBJECT 2: Yeah,
it's a headache.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.640
NARRATOR: This young,
unmarried couple,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.150
from Delhi, India don't want to
appear on camera because they

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.310
fear for their safety.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.650
In India kissing in
public or holding

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.000
hands can be considered immoral.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.270
And such acts can
even spark violence.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.650
In 2014 members of India's
ruling Hindu Nationalist,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.050
Bharatiya Janata Party set
about to vandalize a cafe all

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.197
because a couple was
seen kissing there.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.250
SANCHIT SETHI: I you prefer
living in a society wherein

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.960
people are doing what they want
It creates a whole, kind of,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.910
happy ecosystem.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.340
NARRATOR: That
was Sanchit Sethi,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.970
who together with
Blaze Arizanov,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.160
are among the co-founders
of Stay Uncle.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.700
A two and a half year old
startup that helps unmarried

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.630
couples in India book
hotel rooms discretely.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.530
The founders felt compelled to
create Stay Uncle after hearing

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.180
story after story of
young unmarried couples

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.519
trying and failing to conduct
relationships in secret.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.060
BLAZE ARIZANOV: The
courage came when

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.730
we saw those almost horror
stories which our couples were

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.520
sharing with us.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.360
How they were denied
hotel stays at 2 o'clock.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.246
How girls used to cry on the
reception window [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:23.620
The receptionists used to ask
them, are you a prostitute?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.550
How they were left
outside to wander

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.240
in the middle of the night
on dangerous streets because

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.340
of stupid, silly reasons.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.400
We just have to do
something about it.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.750
NARRATOR: The service
set-up is simple.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.900
Couples can log on to
Stay Uncle's website

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.210
to find an array of hotels
that will accept them

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.430
with no issue,
which is technically

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.340
the law for all hotels as
long as the guests are of age.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.270
But most importantly
couples who book

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.364
a hotel through the
website are assured

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:51.780
that they will be
safe from attack

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.072
at the hotel they
choose to stay in.

00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.530
SANCHIT SETHI: We
provide the sense

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.905
of confidence in these people
that all the hotels we work

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.605
with are going to be very safe.

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:02.222
There will be no
questions asked.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.680
And they will be
given a safe stay,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.304
there will be no
police raids, and all.

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:09.699
NARRATOR: However,
Stay Uncle was

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.448
difficult to get off
the ground initially.

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:17.850
SANCHIT SETHI: It has been
pretty difficult because what

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.780
we're trying to do is something
the industry's not used to,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.480
and the people aren't used to,
not even the customers, not

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.200
the suppliers.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.010
NARRATOR: Eventually some hotels
were won over by the idea.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:52.840
AJIT PANDEY: [SPEKING HINDU]

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.470
NARRATOR: The hesitancy
from hotel owners like Ajit

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.710
speak to deep seated
conservative ideas around love,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.550
sex, and intimacy, in India.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:18.090
CHANDRA PRAKASH: [SPEKING HINDU]

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.110
NARRATOR: Chandra Prakash is the
president of Akhil Bhara Hindu

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.210
Mahasabha, one of the oldest
national political parties

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.190
in India.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.420
And though his opinion of
Stay Uncle may seem strong,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.090
they are representative of
conservative values regarding

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.500
physical intimacy in India.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:47.214
CHANDRA PRAKASH:
[SPEAKING HINDU]

00:03:47.214 --> 00:03:49.740
NARRATOR: Yet for young
women and men in India

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.720
services like Stay
Uncle represent

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.440
a gradual, but significant,
cultural shift in attitudes

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.180
about dating among
India's youth.

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:03.010
SUBJECT 1: I mean, it's called
making love for a reason,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.630
you need this to grow.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.530
Romance is all about physical
intimacy after a certain level.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.580
Well, you can be all
romantic, but you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.620
have to express it in
cards and gestures.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.992
You know, there's only
so much they can do.

00:04:15.992 --> 00:04:18.033
So yeah, the physical
intimacy is very important.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:18.959
SUBJECT 2: It's very important.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.680
SUBJECT 1: They are providing a
platform with a lot of safety.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.950
That's the biggest
concern for everyone, one,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.540
we are safe, second,
no one gets to know.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.146
and Stay Uncle takes
both of those criterias.

00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:29.860
SUBJECT 2: Yeah.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.235
SUBJECT 1: Stay Uncle is a
bold but very good and helpful

00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:33.900
initiative.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.360
BLAZE ARIZANOV: It's the culture
and you cannot always classify

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.690
culture as good or bad.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.890
It's a very subjective feeling.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.410
We just said, let's do it.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.740
Let's make a breakthrough.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.580
And let's see if this
is a sentiment which

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.880
other people share.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.600
Thousands, so far, share
our world view and share

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.450
our, sort of,
dream of the way we

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.910
would like to see India in
the next few years, coming up.

00:05:01.227 --> 00:05:03.310
NARRATOR: If you want to
learn about another group

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.490
that that's trying to change
the world around them,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.210
watch this video about
the Salvage Supper Club.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.830
This nonprofit organizes
dumpster dinner parties

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.560
that bring awareness to
the problem of food waste.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.160
SPEAKER 3: What we do is host
multi-course dining experiences

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.730
where every course is made out
of food that would commonly

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.656
go to waste.

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:24.030
It's prepared by chefs who
really know what they're doing

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.606
and it's food that people could
make on their own, often times.

00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:30.480
NARRATOR: Thanks for
