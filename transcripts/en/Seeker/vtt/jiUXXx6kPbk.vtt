00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.230
It's the e-cig apocalypse!

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.990
And I'm gonna be real -- I have a very bad
feeling about it, right in here.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.570
Hello friends, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.940
Is it me or was it practically overnight that
it went from people smoking cigarettes to

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.430
sucking on those little tubes that look like
ink pens?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.840
In the past couple years, electronic cigarettes
have shot up to a multi billion dollar industry.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.480
It happened so fast, government officials
are like AHHHHHH WHAT IS THIS WIZARDRY AND

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.029
HOW DO WE REGULATE IT?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.260
Meanwhile, minors can buy e-cigs legally in
many states, they're being given away as free

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.829
samples online, and the companies are actively
marketing themselves as a "tobacco free alternative

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.149
to cigarettes" that will "help you quit".

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.149
OKKKKK.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.489
This is my skeptical face, guys.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.079
While all the legal junk is worked out, it's
up to SCIENTISTS to take a good hard look

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.840
at these newfangled devices.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.620
Last week, the largest major review of the
research on e-cigs was published in the American

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.580
Heart Association's scientific journal.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.489
They found that the claims of the e-cig manufacturers
are...not supported by the data.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.810
One of the big claims that came under fire
was that e-cigs will help you quit...or at

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.950
least smoke less.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.450
The scientists found, based on 5 population-based
studies, that those who used e-cigs to quit

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.520
were actually significantly LESS likely to
be successful, by about 30%.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.470
And that's probably related to....claim #2
that was kicked to the curb: that it's a safe

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.330
alternative that only releases pure nicotine
and water vapor.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.900
In their research, the scientists found formaldehyde,
propylene glycol, and lead amongst other well-known

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.260
toxins in the vapor.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.560
Sound familiar?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.930
It's just...like...cigarettes!

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.500
UC San Francisco's tobacco research center
stated that "E-cigs do not deliver pure nicotine

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.940
and harmless water vapor".

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.470
It may not have tobacco in it, but the e-cigs
are still delivering the same carcinogens

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.380
that are known to cause chronic disease and
cancer.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.370
And the second hand vapor is emitting it as
well.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.990
Then there's there's the most disturbing part
of the study to ME.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.150
A growing number of middle and high schoolers
report having tried e-cigs instead of cigarettes,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.340
and the number of teen users more than doubled
to almost 2 million from 2011 to 2012.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.360
It's even more now in 2014, which is a concern
given that 90% of lifetime nicotine addiction

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.039
begins in the teen years.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.340
The e-cig industry seems to be intentionally
targeting teens--they use cool marketing with

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.110
colors and candy flavors, they sponsor youth-driven
events like rock concerts all the while claiming

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750
that they're harmless.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.050
Some teens in the studies didn't even know
that it contains nicotine, even though they

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.730
may be able to buy them.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.130
Let's be real: this industry's goal is to
sell a product and develop lifelong buyers,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.440
and if they are allowed to sell addictive
substances with misleading claims, then they

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.260
will....and personally, I don't think they
should be able to.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.730
But I want to know what you guys think.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.390
Tell me your thoughts about e-cigs down below
and I'll catch you next time on DNews!
