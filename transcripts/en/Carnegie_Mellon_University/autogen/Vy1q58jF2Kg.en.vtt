green chemistry is the design of

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370
green chemistry is the design of
 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.640
green chemistry is the design of
chemical products and processes that

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650
chemical products and processes that
 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.650
chemical products and processes that
reduce and eliminate the use and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
reduce and eliminate the use and
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.770
reduce and eliminate the use and
generation of hazardous substances we're

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780
generation of hazardous substances we're
 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.700
generation of hazardous substances we're
really in this wonderful space of having

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710
really in this wonderful space of having
 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.970
really in this wonderful space of having
these inventions that you can apply all

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980
these inventions that you can apply all
 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.210
these inventions that you can apply all
across chemistry to to destroy things

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220
across chemistry to to destroy things
 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.730

and Anna and really a metaphor for what

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740
and Anna and really a metaphor for what
 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.690
and Anna and really a metaphor for what
we've actually got is like fire in water

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
we've actually got is like fire in water
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.910
we've actually got is like fire in water
in other words you can take chemicals

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920
in other words you can take chemicals
 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.250
in other words you can take chemicals
you don't want and put them in a very

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260
you don't want and put them in a very
 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.980
you don't want and put them in a very
sophisticated and incinerator and burn

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990
sophisticated and incinerator and burn
 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.660
sophisticated and incinerator and burn
them at very high temperatures and they

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
them at very high temperatures and they
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.080
them at very high temperatures and they
will go away right but you can't do that

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090
will go away right but you can't do that
 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.310
will go away right but you can't do that
in water because of course the water

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320
in water because of course the water
 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.350
in water because of course the water
would just boil well with our catalyst

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360
would just boil well with our catalyst
 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.420
would just boil well with our catalyst
and hydrogen peroxide you get exactly

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430
and hydrogen peroxide you get exactly
 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.280
and hydrogen peroxide you get exactly
the same result you take these molecules

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290
the same result you take these molecules
 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.800
the same result you take these molecules
that are not don't go away easily in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810
that are not don't go away easily in
 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.810
that are not don't go away easily in
nature that lasts and water forever

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820
nature that lasts and water forever
 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.120
nature that lasts and water forever
essentially on many years and years and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130
essentially on many years and years and
 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.819
essentially on many years and years and
water or in the environment and tamil

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829
water or in the environment and tamil
 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.429
water or in the environment and tamil
peroxide or hammer them to oblivion in

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439
peroxide or hammer them to oblivion in
 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.350
peroxide or hammer them to oblivion in
in minutes at room temperature

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360
in minutes at room temperature
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.510

with tiny quantities of the tamil

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520
with tiny quantities of the tamil
 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.280
with tiny quantities of the tamil
catalyst and small amounts of hydrogen

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290
catalyst and small amounts of hydrogen
 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.850
catalyst and small amounts of hydrogen
peroxide so so we're in this really

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860
peroxide so so we're in this really
 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.690
peroxide so so we're in this really
wonderful space of knowing that we have

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700
wonderful space of knowing that we have
 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.070
wonderful space of knowing that we have
solutions to real world problems

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
