00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:04.039
(keyboard clicking)

00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:13.994
- I'm happy to introduce Ari Ne'eman.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.308
I think many of you have
heard Ari speak before.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:21.720
He's the President and Co-founder
of the Autistic Self, oh.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.140
- Was, was.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.226
- Was, he was, but he's gonna
tell you what he's doing now,

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.365
and he's here to talk to us about

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:31.803
quality in-home and
community-based services

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:34.670
to support successful community living.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.920
Ari, thank you.

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:43.795
- Well, thank you so much.

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:45.339
It's an honor to be back here at

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.672
the Update in DD Conference.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.039
I'm sure at some point
they'll have the timer

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.657
continue to move, but in the meantime,

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:56.157
I'll just keep track from my phone.

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:59.493
My name is Ari Ne'eman,
many of you know me

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.462
from some of my past roles.

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:05.629
From 2006-2016, I ran the
Autistic Self-Advocacy Network,

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.507
a National advocacy organization

00:01:09.507 --> 00:01:14.141
run by, and for, autistic
people, speaking for ourselves.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.606
From 2010-2015, I was
one of President Obama's

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:21.021
appointees to the National
Council on Disability.

00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:24.849
I currently direct a
project called MySupport

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:27.325
which I'll talk a little bit about here

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:30.350
which focuses on giving
people with disabilities,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.643
and families, more tools to find workers

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.643
that share their values.

00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:39.416
I'm really pleased to have the opportunity

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:42.455
to talk with you on the topic

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.920
of home and community-based
service quality.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.587
There has been a
tremendous amount of change

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.185
in our field, in the world
of developmental disability,

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:58.518
over the course of the last 10-20 years.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.141
That change has largely
been for the purpose

00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.474
of promoting more self-determined lives,

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:11.602
more quality of life,
more choice and control

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:14.605
in people's outcomes, but one of the

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:17.839
unfortunate challenges that we have

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.610
is that it's relatively rare

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.811
that we go to a service provider,

00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:24.875
and we pick up their brochure,

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.727
and they say we are against

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:31.002
self-determination, choice and control,

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.419
and for coercion,

00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:35.255
restraint, and you know,

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.722
generally speaking, if
you look at the marketing

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:43.616
in our field, from the service providers

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:46.273
to the health plans in some states,

00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:49.343
to any number of other entities,

00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:51.965
folks say they're for good things,

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:54.548
and they're against bad things.

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:59.483
The problem that we have is, historically,

00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.483
we've had very few tools to evaluate

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:07.676
whether that is in any
reasonable sense, true.

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.931
In the context of quality measures,

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:15.899
there's a long history of states using

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.466
healthcare quality measures usually

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:22.291
to hold managed care plans accountable

00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:24.442
for particular kinds of outcomes,

00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:26.307
but most of the quality measures

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.089
that have been used historically

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.752
have focused on very traditional,
medical care outcomes.

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:34.356
They may evaluate the
degree to which folks

00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:38.957
were in an emergency room
in the last 12 months,

00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:40.879
or the prevalence of diabetes,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.170
or the speed with which particular forms

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.709
of medical treatments are used

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.128
within a certain timeframe upon entering

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.941
an emergency room or a doctor's office,

00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:55.214
but as we've started to
see more of an emphasis

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:59.291
on quality improvement in
long-term services and supports,

00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.566
and in home and community-based services,

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:05.182
we've started to see
an emphasis on quality

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:07.515
around measuring outcomes in

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.844
the home and community-based
service world.

00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:15.807
I recently completed, along with Steve Kay

00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:18.724
from the University of
California San Francisco,

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:20.615
a two-year term of service on

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:23.666
the National Quality Forums work group

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:27.506
on home and community-based
services quality measures.

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:28.694
What I'm going to be doing here

00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:30.186
is I'm going to be going through

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.838
a variety of quality measures
that states are using,

00:04:33.838 --> 00:04:38.296
sometimes to evaluate the
performance of managed care plans,

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:40.236
within states that have adopted

00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:42.681
managed care frameworks for their

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.210
disability and aging services,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.658
sometimes to evaluate the performance

00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:50.191
of individual service providers,

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:53.086
and sometimes to evaluate themselves,

00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:55.849
and to really ask and challenge themselves

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.190
what we can do to improve
the quality of services

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.859
we may be administering at the State's

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:04.728
or Regional Center level.

00:05:04.728 --> 00:05:06.261
So, with that old maxim of

00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:11.153
"In God We Trust, Everyone
Else Please Bring Data",

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:12.789
let's jump right into it.

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.694
One of the first domains
that the NQF work group

00:05:15.694 --> 00:05:19.291
on HCBS quality looked
at was service delivery

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.445
and effectiveness.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:24.568
I want to highlight four quality measures

00:05:24.568 --> 00:05:28.151
used in actual
state-managed care contracts

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:33.786
or quality improvement
systems that look to measure

00:05:33.786 --> 00:05:36.964
quality in disability services.

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:40.620
The first, the number of
service hours delivered

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.517
minus the number of service hours approved

00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:45.623
is used by the state of Delaware's

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:49.480
Managed Long-Term Services
and Support System.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.222
The second, the percent of
people with disabilities

00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:56.611
responding yes to: Do
the services you receive

00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:58.858
meet your needs and goals?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.629
is from the National
Core Indicators Project,

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.719
it's a quality improvement
system historically used

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.404
only for people with
developmental disabilities

00:06:07.404 --> 00:06:09.744
and it recently expanded to the aging

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.455
and physical disability world.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.219
The proportion of
Individualized Care Plans

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.830
with goals unmet comes from the New York

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.983
Managed Care System.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.665
And the fourth, which
also relates to the number

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:27.000
of late/missed visits and talks
about the reasons for them

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.185
comes from Tennessee's system.

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.073
One of the things I
think is really important

00:06:32.073 --> 00:06:34.454
to highlight here, and
we're gonna be seeing this

00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:37.653
fairly consistently
across each of the domains

00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:41.131
of quality measurement
that are being utilized

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:45.593
by states and by service
providers for different purposes,

00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:49.120
is that these are very
different kinds of measures

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.864
and they have very different
strengths and flaws.

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:57.436
Generally speaking, states
will seek to incorporate

00:06:57.436 --> 00:07:00.936
at least some measures that can be derived

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.907
specifically from utilization data,

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.750
so the number of service hours delivered

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.519
minus the number of
service hours approved,

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.844
and then compliment those
measures with measures

00:07:14.844 --> 00:07:17.277
that are derived from survey data,

00:07:17.277 --> 00:07:20.199
like the National Core
Indicator's Project.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.191
NCI surveys large numbers
of people with disabilities,

00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:28.011
family members and
providers for the purposes

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:32.178
of determining whether or not
someone has choice control,

00:07:33.212 --> 00:07:37.250
autonomy and other dimensions
of quality in their life.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.865
The reason why, usually,
in well-designed systems

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:46.032
states will cup a couple
data from quality measures

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:51.172
from utilization data with
quality measures from survey data

00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:56.451
is that generally speaking,
it's possible to see

00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:59.725
really significant flaws in both.

00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:04.126
We all know that survey data
is often highly subjective.

00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:07.423
People are often not aware
of the degree to which

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:11.665
other options may exist so
to talk to someone about

00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:13.727
whether or not they feel they are included

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:17.306
in the community if all
they've ever been exposed to is

00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:20.526
a group home and being
included in the community

00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:23.509
to them means that somebody
takes them to the mall

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:27.509
once a week, is often not
the most useful metric

00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:32.745
because there isn't
really any determination

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:37.280
that there's been an informed
process by which folks

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.635
are deriving their
answer to that question.

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:45.178
At the same time, data
that comes from just strict

00:08:45.178 --> 00:08:49.670
analysis of the kinds of
services that people receive

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.607
is often at times misleading.

00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:54.554
For example, if we look
at the Delaware statistic,

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:56.564
the number of service hours delivered

00:08:56.564 --> 00:08:59.202
minus the number of
service hours approved,

00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:01.883
one problem with looking at that statistic

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:05.299
as the sole measure of
quality is that a particular

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:08.871
health plan may be more likely to approve

00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:12.403
more service hours than somebody needs

00:09:12.403 --> 00:09:16.671
as a means of preparing
for crisis situations

00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:21.088
in which a pre-authorization
requirement for adding

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:25.126
more service may
significantly delay access

00:09:25.126 --> 00:09:27.302
to necessary support.

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:29.775
So if all we're looking at is the ratio

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:34.596
of services delivered as
compared to services authorized,

00:09:34.596 --> 00:09:38.125
we also have the potential
to really run into issues

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:41.727
associated with how
we're delivering services

00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:45.727
warping how we're measuring
quality in services.

00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:49.704
One of the other, and
more tricky, components

00:09:49.704 --> 00:09:51.763
when it comes to measuring quality,

00:09:51.763 --> 00:09:54.880
and this was a really heavy
emphasis in the discussion

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.297
of HCBS quality measures on the NQF panel

00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:05.003
is how we look at quality
specifically within the context

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:07.670
of planning around service provision

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.867
as distinct from quality around

00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:14.018
how service provision is delivered.

00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:17.077
We generally know that within the context

00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:19.571
of home and community-based services,

00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:22.886
choice and control over
what you're getting

00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:26.053
matters just as much as whether or not

00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:29.715
and what particular form
of service provision

00:10:29.715 --> 00:10:31.351
you're receiving.

00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:34.955
So a growing number of quality measures

00:10:34.955 --> 00:10:38.198
are looking at the degree to
which people are reporting

00:10:38.198 --> 00:10:40.899
they have the right to
control what goes in their

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:44.550
service plan, the frequency
with which their services

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.149
can be reassessed, the
degree to which individuals

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:51.535
have easy access to service coordinators

00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:54.723
and can clearly communicate
with them over time.

00:10:54.723 --> 00:10:57.153
Some states have incorporated measures

00:10:57.153 --> 00:10:59.679
like the percentage of
service coordinators

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:03.268
who have been trained in
self-directed services

00:11:03.268 --> 00:11:08.072
and can offer that to an
individual as an option.

00:11:08.072 --> 00:11:10.465
One of the challenges that comes up

00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:14.623
when trying to measure
quality within the process

00:11:14.623 --> 00:11:17.634
of determining how services are delivered,

00:11:17.634 --> 00:11:20.967
is that often an emphasis on the process

00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:27.918
can detract from an
emphasis on the outcomes.

00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:30.767
So we have some states
that have chosen to measure

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:33.677
the percentage of individuals who choose

00:11:33.677 --> 00:11:37.010
to self-direct their service as a metric

00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:41.976
in quality outcomes in home
and community-based services.

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:43.801
Other states that have chosen to measure

00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:47.451
the percentage of individuals
who end up in home

00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:49.259
and community-based services,

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:52.543
or who end up in integrated employment.

00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:54.547
And then we have other
states that have chosen

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:58.094
to measure the degree to which
those options are offered

00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:02.260
as an alternative within the
service planning process.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.156
And the challenge that
we really run into there

00:12:05.156 --> 00:12:09.371
is if the emphasis is solely
on the planning process

00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:13.039
and not on the broader
focus of what ends up being

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:16.437
delivered, we may have a situation

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:20.930
where a service coordinator
receives training

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.364
in self-direction or receives training

00:12:23.364 --> 00:12:25.282
in integrated employment,

00:12:25.282 --> 00:12:27.392
but that training does
not really translate

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:31.309
into concrete outcomes
in the field afterwards.

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:35.875
The National Core Indicators project

00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:39.152
and other similar surveys
like the Council on Quality

00:12:39.152 --> 00:12:43.052
Leaderships Personal
Outcomes Measure Survey

00:12:43.052 --> 00:12:45.534
and others have long
looked at the question

00:12:45.534 --> 00:12:48.358
of choice and control over people's lives

00:12:48.358 --> 00:12:50.405
and this is something
that's highly relevant

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:52.894
within the context of the
home and community-based

00:12:52.894 --> 00:12:57.206
settings rule and many states
are now asking themselves

00:12:57.206 --> 00:13:01.366
within the context of their
settings transition plans,

00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:04.781
every state must deliver
to the Federal government

00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:07.867
and each state has but they're
periodically revising it,

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:10.951
a settings transition plan
indicating how they will comply

00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:15.118
with the home and community-based
settings rule by 2019.

00:13:16.117 --> 00:13:19.037
States are now asking
themselves how can I measure

00:13:19.037 --> 00:13:22.730
compliance with
requirements of the settings

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.099
transition rule like facilitating choice

00:13:26.099 --> 00:13:30.016
in who provides services
or optimizing autonomy

00:13:31.406 --> 00:13:35.156
or allowing for privacy,
dignity and respect.

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:40.396
Often very broad-based
aspirational concepts

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:42.733
that in order to show
compliance with new Federal

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:46.338
requirements must be
operationalized at a very

00:13:46.338 --> 00:13:48.395
practical level.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:52.562
NCI and other quality
measures often look to survey

00:13:53.403 --> 00:13:56.795
instruments around questions of quality

00:13:56.795 --> 00:14:00.593
like, can you see your
friends when you want to?

00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:02.938
Did you pick who you live with?

00:14:02.938 --> 00:14:05.695
Did you pick where you live?

00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:08.255
Did you get to pick who
your case manager is?

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:11.222
Or can you switch case
managers if you have a problem

00:14:11.222 --> 00:14:12.623
with them?

00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:15.105
Can you pick who your roommates are?

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:18.025
As a way of evaluating the
degree to which their state

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:21.624
or health plan or
potentially in the future

00:14:21.624 --> 00:14:24.634
a Regional Center is delivering compliance

00:14:24.634 --> 00:14:27.310
with the settings rule
or other program goals

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.452
in home and community-based services.

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:34.402
Self-direction is often
used as a metric for this

00:14:34.402 --> 00:14:38.294
in part because it fits one
of the basic requirements

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.968
for a really good quality
measure and that's

00:14:40.968 --> 00:14:45.135
significant variation across
the country in outcomes.

00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:49.629
So this chart from the
National Resource Center

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:53.796
on Participant-Directed
Services shows the proportion

00:14:54.674 --> 00:14:58.443
of people with disabilities
who are self-directing

00:14:58.443 --> 00:15:02.933
as compared to the number
of individuals on SSI

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:04.961
within that given state.

00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:08.440
One of the things you see is
that California, at the top,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.543
is dramatically, dramatically
more likely to see

00:15:12.543 --> 00:15:15.465
self-direction as an
outcome within the state

00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:17.723
than the rest of the country.

00:15:17.723 --> 00:15:21.278
So there's significant
variation, in fact about half

00:15:21.278 --> 00:15:23.861
of people with disabilities
who self-direct live

00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:28.028
in California, largely as a
function of the IHSS program

00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:32.187
and so self-direction
often serves as a very

00:15:32.187 --> 00:15:34.523
good indicator for evaluating home

00:15:34.523 --> 00:15:37.012
and community-based services quality.

00:15:37.012 --> 00:15:40.163
If we look at different
states self-directed programs

00:15:40.163 --> 00:15:43.640
you have some that have
similar level of intensity,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.045
California, Oregon and
Washington, New York,

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:50.282
Massachusetts, others,
Texas, others that are really

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.300
just getting stood up and that's something

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.799
that's helpful because a
quality measure doesn't

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:59.823
do very much for us if
it's a survey in which

00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:03.990
consistently across every
state 95% of people say

00:16:05.609 --> 00:16:08.442
they're happy with their services.

00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:12.038
Again, this is a powerful
argument for coupling

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:14.737
multiple quality measures and looking,

00:16:14.737 --> 00:16:18.244
prior to determining a
quality measure for use

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:22.411
in a particular purpose, that
there is variation in outcome.

00:16:26.567 --> 00:16:29.486
Within the context of
both the settings rule

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:32.256
and broader program design goals

00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:33.975
in home and community-based services,

00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:36.922
states are beginning to look very closely

00:16:36.922 --> 00:16:41.831
at community inclusion and
measures of community inclusion.

00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:45.498
Usually what states
will do is they will tie

00:16:46.764 --> 00:16:50.700
specific financial outcomes to metrics

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.175
of community inclusion,

00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:54.761
and home and community-based services,

00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:58.054
and in long-term services
and supports as a whole.

00:16:58.054 --> 00:17:00.322
So many of the states
with the longest running

00:17:00.322 --> 00:17:04.999
managed care systems for
long-term services and supports

00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:06.999
will reward health plans

00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:10.778
that increase the number of individuals

00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:14.497
who transition from an ICF or nursing home

00:17:14.497 --> 00:17:17.330
in a given year, from the expected

00:17:19.056 --> 00:17:22.139
rate of transition based on past trends.

00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:25.899
So if you're increasing the
speed at which individuals

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:30.344
leave institutional
settings then a health plan

00:17:30.344 --> 00:17:34.790
is more likely to qualify for
additional bonus payments.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.633
Often states will withhold
a certain percentage

00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:41.860
of a capitated payment,
between three to five percent

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.399
is common, and basically
give multiple health plans

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.999
competing within a state
an opportunity to win

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:54.186
that pot of funds representing
three to five percent

00:17:54.186 --> 00:17:56.987
of capitated payments within the state,

00:17:56.987 --> 00:18:00.846
almost from the other
health plans in the event

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:04.447
that they show better outcomes than them.

00:18:04.447 --> 00:18:08.149
The idea here is to
reflect for rebalancing

00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:11.047
from institutional to
community-based settings,

00:18:11.047 --> 00:18:14.964
an emphasis on competition
between health plans

00:18:16.049 --> 00:18:19.301
as to who can accelerate that process.

00:18:19.301 --> 00:18:22.263
What's relatively new and
one of the things looked at

00:18:22.263 --> 00:18:26.962
by the NQF panel is measuring
quality within the context

00:18:26.962 --> 00:18:29.646
of home and community-based
services themselves.

00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:33.731
So New York, which has recently
embarked on a relatively

00:18:33.731 --> 00:18:37.339
aggressive project of
promoting supported employment,

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:40.103
has incorporated within
their managed long-term

00:18:40.103 --> 00:18:44.270
services and supports proposal
a indicator on the proportion

00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:47.890
of individuals in sheltered workshops

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.452
who transitioned to integrated
community-based employment

00:18:51.452 --> 00:18:53.835
and then the future
health plans in New York

00:18:53.835 --> 00:18:57.177
may be in a position to see
additional reimbursement

00:18:57.177 --> 00:18:58.914
in the event that they see more aggressive

00:18:58.914 --> 00:19:01.479
integrated employment outcomes.

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:05.839
Hawaii, in which transportation
is a very significant issue,

00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:09.166
decided to prioritize a
survey instrument tool

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:13.608
around individuals
receiving HCBS who reported

00:19:13.608 --> 00:19:16.417
they had adequate
transportation when they wanted

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:18.147
to go somewhere.

00:19:18.147 --> 00:19:22.314
New York, again, has emphasized
integrated employment.

00:19:23.252 --> 00:19:26.726
So we're relatively new
in around quality measures

00:19:26.726 --> 00:19:30.893
that are focusing on transitions
within one kind of HCBS

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.964
to another kind.

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:37.119
The next frontier there
is really to start to look

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:41.574
at how we measure HCBS service
quality and transitions

00:19:41.574 --> 00:19:43.994
within residential placements.

00:19:43.994 --> 00:19:46.474
States may soon be
adopting quality measures

00:19:46.474 --> 00:19:49.921
that evaluate the percentage
of people who transition

00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:52.682
from group homes to supported
living or shared living

00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:57.362
settings in a very similar way
that we've seen in the past.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.984
States evaluate the percentage of people

00:19:59.984 --> 00:20:04.151
who are transitioning from
nursing homes and ICFs.

00:20:07.128 --> 00:20:09.203
One of the other really important concepts

00:20:09.203 --> 00:20:12.786
that has been emphasized
in an emerging way

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:16.065
in quality measurement
is the idea that services

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:19.606
are not just directed
towards the individual.

00:20:19.606 --> 00:20:22.697
Particularly for people with
developmental disabilities,

00:20:22.697 --> 00:20:25.090
the idea of having
access to natural support

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.108
and family support is absolutely critical.

00:20:29.108 --> 00:20:33.241
So quality measures that
are looking at the degree

00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:37.408
to which parents, family
members, other caregivers

00:20:39.465 --> 00:20:43.632
can report that they are
able to maintain their health

00:20:44.853 --> 00:20:47.613
in light of their caregiving obligations,

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:50.838
can report that they've been
receiving clear instructions

00:20:50.838 --> 00:20:54.415
around paramedical
tasks that they may have

00:20:54.415 --> 00:20:58.582
associated with the delivery
of services that a family

00:20:59.418 --> 00:21:02.571
member may be expected to take on.

00:21:02.571 --> 00:21:05.290
Obviously we want a quality
measure that's going to be

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:09.169
telling us if a family
member is expected to perform

00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:13.006
substantial medical tasks
but isn't being given

00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:17.546
any kind of instruction or
support as to how to do that.

00:21:17.546 --> 00:21:22.234
As well as other measures
that are looking at the idea

00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:26.164
that the health of the family relationship

00:21:26.164 --> 00:21:28.825
is an important component in the quality

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:30.229
of service provision.

00:21:30.229 --> 00:21:32.849
I want to emphasize why this matters,

00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:35.612
especially as we start to see the shift

00:21:35.612 --> 00:21:38.190
towards managed care.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.357
Typically, and there's variation
and certainly California

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:47.032
is one of the significant
sources of the variation here

00:21:47.032 --> 00:21:49.860
as a state that is generally
not put its developmental

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.960
disability services and managed care,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.234
but in most of the country
a managed care contract

00:21:55.234 --> 00:21:57.671
lasts between three to five years.

00:21:57.671 --> 00:22:01.554
So a state will contract
with a health plan,

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:03.706
usually one of the large
national health plans,

00:22:03.706 --> 00:22:05.536
sometimes local nonprofits,

00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:08.763
and they will say you have control over,

00:22:08.763 --> 00:22:11.166
you have responsibility
over this population

00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:14.267
with some shifts in
open enrollment periods,

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:16.833
between competing health
plans over the next

00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:21.650
three to five years, and if
you are that health plan,

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.318
one of the things you very quickly realize

00:22:24.318 --> 00:22:27.485
is that families who have a commitment

00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:32.470
to supporting their
relative with a disability

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.648
can probably hold on, in a lot of cases,

00:22:35.648 --> 00:22:37.295
for three to five years,

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:41.462
even with a relatively poor
quality of service provision.

00:22:42.766 --> 00:22:46.599
So if all you're counting
on for a health plan

00:22:47.965 --> 00:22:52.308
to be incentivized to
deliver high-quality services

00:22:52.308 --> 00:22:55.586
is the fear that someone's
going to end up in an ICF

00:22:55.586 --> 00:23:00.082
or more expensive placement in
the event that those services

00:23:00.082 --> 00:23:04.827
are not delivered, often times
health plans will operate

00:23:04.827 --> 00:23:07.354
under the assumption that's six years out.

00:23:07.354 --> 00:23:10.612
That's seven or ten or fifteen years out,

00:23:10.612 --> 00:23:13.281
we don't need to concern
ourselves with that.

00:23:13.281 --> 00:23:17.448
So one of the purposes of
measuring dimensions of quality,

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.207
which maybe down the line
are going to correlate

00:23:21.207 --> 00:23:25.015
to dimensions of cost,
is so that you can say,

00:23:25.015 --> 00:23:28.525
health plan you are
financially on the hook

00:23:28.525 --> 00:23:30.860
for meeting these
measures that will tell us

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.620
if the families who are
providing unpaid supports

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.787
to people with disabilities
are barely holding on,

00:23:41.094 --> 00:23:43.622
even if that family is
going to end up holding on

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:46.339
past the term of your contract.

00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:50.946
And that's a very consistent
theme in other metrics as well.

00:23:50.946 --> 00:23:53.185
We generally see that supported employment

00:23:53.185 --> 00:23:56.273
is more cost-effective
to payers than sheltered

00:23:56.273 --> 00:24:00.632
workshop services over a
long enough time frame.

00:24:00.632 --> 00:24:04.090
So health plans are not held
accountable for delivering

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.789
integrated employment outcomes within

00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:09.176
that three to five year time frame

00:24:09.176 --> 00:24:11.749
with which they have contracts,

00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:15.732
they may say, alright,
this is an area of our OI

00:24:15.732 --> 00:24:18.477
that's realized seven to ten years out,

00:24:18.477 --> 00:24:20.563
we don't have to focus on that.

00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:23.874
So again, one of the overall
goals in caregiver support,

00:24:23.874 --> 00:24:26.543
in integrated employment
and in other areas,

00:24:26.543 --> 00:24:29.880
is to make sure that
health plans and others

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.386
who have responsibility
often on a short-term basis

00:24:34.386 --> 00:24:37.469
in evaluating and delivering services

00:24:38.318 --> 00:24:41.465
to people with disabilities
are responsible

00:24:41.465 --> 00:24:45.373
and have a financial
incentive to promote quality

00:24:45.373 --> 00:24:47.898
even if the consequences
aren't going to come

00:24:47.898 --> 00:24:49.231
for years later.

00:24:51.224 --> 00:24:54.400
We're short on time so I'm
gonna jump forward a little bit.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.785
We have other measures that are available

00:24:56.785 --> 00:24:59.358
in your program books around workforce,

00:24:59.358 --> 00:25:01.858
human and legal rights, equity

00:25:03.115 --> 00:25:06.115
and holistic health and functioning.

00:25:07.476 --> 00:25:09.320
I do want to highlight a couple of things

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.002
within this context:

00:25:11.002 --> 00:25:15.579
Equity is an area in
which quality measurement

00:25:15.579 --> 00:25:18.079
is often still relatively new.

00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:23.565
States have very different
ideas or different priorities

00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:26.340
around where their
equity considerations are

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.586
in home and community-based services.

00:25:28.586 --> 00:25:31.490
If you are a very diverse state,

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.065
or to talk in the California context,

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:37.774
a very diverse Regional
Center, you may have particular

00:25:37.774 --> 00:25:41.497
priorities around equity
in the delivery and outcome

00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:43.914
of services across linguistic

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.685
and racial and ethnic minorities.

00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:51.194
Many of you are very familiar
with the racial disparities

00:25:51.194 --> 00:25:53.320
in the California Regional Center systems

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.860
delivery of purchase of service funds,

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.139
and that's a significant
area in which equity

00:25:59.139 --> 00:26:02.372
is being measured and
hopefully in the future

00:26:02.372 --> 00:26:05.658
that will lead to more equitable outcomes.

00:26:05.658 --> 00:26:09.825
There's also been a focus
on how we can look at health

00:26:12.682 --> 00:26:15.162
within the context of how health

00:26:15.162 --> 00:26:18.996
intersects with long-term
services and supports.

00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:22.696
Because quality measures
have mostly come about

00:26:22.696 --> 00:26:26.688
when states have adopted
managed care systems,

00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:31.156
and most state-managed
care systems in the 1990's

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:35.323
and early aughts emphasize
non-disabled adults and children,

00:26:36.674 --> 00:26:39.952
usually quality measures
focus when they looked

00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:43.383
at medical outcomes,
just on medical outcomes

00:26:43.383 --> 00:26:47.550
in the context of primary
and specialty doctors care,

00:26:49.451 --> 00:26:53.618
hospital services and other
traditional acute care outcomes.

00:26:54.461 --> 00:26:56.408
One of the things that's
being looked at now

00:26:56.408 --> 00:27:00.106
is how we can start to focus
on outcomes that specifically

00:27:00.106 --> 00:27:02.840
look at individuals who are receiving home

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.590
and community-based
services and their special

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.007
healthcare needs.

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:10.344
So I want to touch on

00:27:12.342 --> 00:27:14.071
a couple of just closing principles

00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:16.384
that I think are important for considering

00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:19.306
what quality measures may be doing for us

00:27:19.306 --> 00:27:23.659
over the course of the
next five to ten years.

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:27.452
One of the most important
things that quality measures do,

00:27:27.452 --> 00:27:30.818
in addition to holding health
plans, service providers,

00:27:30.818 --> 00:27:33.109
Regional centers accountable,

00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:37.192
is they give very clear
instructions to the field

00:27:38.597 --> 00:27:42.387
about where innovation
should be prioritized.

00:27:42.387 --> 00:27:44.804
I mentioned that my new rule,

00:27:46.196 --> 00:27:49.287
I manage a project called MySupport,

00:27:49.287 --> 00:27:51.642
which is an online provider directory

00:27:51.642 --> 00:27:55.575
that makes it easy for
people with disabilities

00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:58.871
to find workers that share their values,

00:27:58.871 --> 00:28:03.187
answering match questions
around personality, values,

00:28:03.187 --> 00:28:05.721
support needs and other components,

00:28:05.721 --> 00:28:08.429
to make it easy for folks to find workers,

00:28:08.429 --> 00:28:12.262
one of the reasons we
entered into the process

00:28:13.488 --> 00:28:17.929
of developing the MySupport
platform is it had become

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:22.096
very clear that states and
people with disabilities

00:28:23.171 --> 00:28:27.008
advocating to states about
what kinds of qualities

00:28:27.008 --> 00:28:29.865
should be promoted in
the future were heavily

00:28:29.865 --> 00:28:33.375
emphasizing self-direction as an outcome

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:35.480
that should be encouraged.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.195
In California, that's
taken the role of the

00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:41.252
"may come swiftly and
within our days" upcoming

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:43.953
self-determination program.

00:28:43.953 --> 00:28:48.119
In other states that's taken
the role of health plans

00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:50.480
being required to increase the percentage

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.275
of individuals with
disabilities and seniors

00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:55.871
who are self-directing their own services

00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:57.871
on a year-on-year basis.

00:28:58.976 --> 00:29:01.475
But one of the things
we say when we embark

00:29:01.475 --> 00:29:05.142
on quality measurement
is we want our system

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:11.252
to move in this particular
direction and in doing so,

00:29:11.252 --> 00:29:15.447
we tell technology
providers, service providers,

00:29:15.447 --> 00:29:18.833
advocates and other stake holders,

00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:23.249
this can be an area of
common focus and common cause

00:29:23.249 --> 00:29:26.249
over the course of the coming years.

00:29:27.506 --> 00:29:30.090
In the future, one of the biggest areas

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.637
in which quality measurement
has not yet focused

00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:36.993
but we're starting to
see an emphasis around,

00:29:36.993 --> 00:29:40.743
is quality measurement
at the provider level.

00:29:43.123 --> 00:29:46.587
There's a long track record
of using quality measures

00:29:46.587 --> 00:29:50.423
to hold a health plan
or a state accountable

00:29:50.423 --> 00:29:54.261
for outcomes across the
broad scope of services,

00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:57.462
the broad scope of
providers within a system.

00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.757
What we've started to
see is the introduction

00:29:59.757 --> 00:30:04.358
of reimbursement strategies
to particular providers

00:30:04.358 --> 00:30:08.150
that reward them for
delivering better outcomes.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.301
One of the biggest areas
this has been happening

00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:12.614
is in employment service provision.

00:30:12.614 --> 00:30:15.512
A number of states have
adopted employment service

00:30:15.512 --> 00:30:19.836
provision reimbursement models
where a service provider

00:30:19.836 --> 00:30:24.004
is no longer reimbursed
solely for the number of hours

00:30:24.004 --> 00:30:27.556
of job coaching they provide
but instead it can be

00:30:27.556 --> 00:30:29.429
reimbursed for the number of hours

00:30:29.429 --> 00:30:33.219
the people they are
supporting are working.

00:30:33.219 --> 00:30:35.841
That's a very significant shift.

00:30:35.841 --> 00:30:40.006
It means that service
providers don't realize a loss

00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:44.234
if they're doing better at
encouraging natural supports.

00:30:44.234 --> 00:30:47.843
Starting to fade out their roll over time.

00:30:47.843 --> 00:30:50.084
We're beginning to think
about how we can apply that

00:30:50.084 --> 00:30:53.051
to residential service provision as well

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.436
as we look to encourage the
possibility for residential

00:30:56.436 --> 00:31:00.457
service providers to help
facilitate natural supports

00:31:00.457 --> 00:31:05.330
and community relationships
in a way that will mean that

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.039
that provider's rewarded
for what we want to see:

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:11.899
people getting support,
people getting help

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:16.200
from their broader
community instead of solely

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.866
through paid service provision.

00:31:18.866 --> 00:31:22.626
We've also started to see
opportunities for providers

00:31:22.626 --> 00:31:26.369
to take on some degree of
risk within the service

00:31:26.369 --> 00:31:27.868
provision system.

00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:31.645
At the Federal level, and
there's some very deep concerns

00:31:31.645 --> 00:31:36.369
that the implementation of
this may not keep to our values

00:31:36.369 --> 00:31:39.458
around community inclusion,
there's now a proposal

00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:43.911
to introduce the PACE model
in which a service provider

00:31:43.911 --> 00:31:47.623
becomes fully responsible
for the broad scope

00:31:47.623 --> 00:31:50.521
of somebody's LTSS and medical services

00:31:50.521 --> 00:31:53.893
for non-elderly people with disabilities.

00:31:53.893 --> 00:31:56.335
But the overall concept here is,

00:31:56.335 --> 00:32:00.054
we've for a long time been
emphasizing measuring quality

00:32:00.054 --> 00:32:03.327
in how we hold our states accountable

00:32:03.327 --> 00:32:06.086
and how we hold our
health plans accountable

00:32:06.086 --> 00:32:09.523
and in the future quality
measurement can be a tool

00:32:09.523 --> 00:32:12.722
we use to go to providers and say,

00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:16.668
"We expect you to deliver
the kinds of self-determined,

00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:20.585
"included lives that we
want for our community.

00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:24.983
"We're going to make sure
that in the ways we pay you,

00:32:24.983 --> 00:32:27.963
"and in the ways we compensate you,

00:32:27.963 --> 00:32:31.567
"you have the opportunity
to benefit from that."

00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:33.398
I'm going to stop here
and hopefully we've left

00:32:33.398 --> 00:32:35.121
enough time for the panel.

00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:37.050
Thank you all very much for your time.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.300
(applause)
