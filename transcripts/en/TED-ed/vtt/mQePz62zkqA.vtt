00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.118
Have you ever walked into a grocery store

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:12.559
and wondered where all those variety
of apples came from?

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.119
You might find SnapDragon,

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.379
Pixie Crunch,

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:16.599
Cosmic Crisp,

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.531
Jazz,

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:18.329
or Ambrosia

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.489
next to the more familiar
Red Delicious and Granny Smith.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.248
These delightfully descriptive names

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:30.540
belong to just a handful of the over
7,500 apple varieties in the world.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.949
This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.248
Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers

00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:44.000
who seek specific qualities in an apple.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.290
On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.179
On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.573
So, breeders have to consider everything

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:59.076
from how well apples grow
in certain climates

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:02.616
to their color, taste, and size.

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:07.813
And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new.

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:11.333
To create apples 
with desirable characteristics,

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:15.792
breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics.

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:17.544
Once the parents have been selected,

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.857
they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring.

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:23.991
The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father,

00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:28.641
and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother,

00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.622
through a process 
called cross-pollination.

00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:33.892
Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple,

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:36.812
the seeds are collected and then planted.

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:40.884
It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples,

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.022
but because of the way 
traits are inherited,

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:46.022
all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.142
and characteristics.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:50.312
This means that to achieve 
a desired quality,

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:52.122
it takes a lot of offspring,

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:55.772
not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part.

00:01:55.772 --> 00:01:58.662
When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities,

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:01.252
it's selected for further evaluation.

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:04.071
Of the original crossed seedlings,

00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.401
about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage.

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.956
They're then sent to new farms

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:14.022
where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:16.542
affect the plant's growth.

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:18.773
The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones

00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:22.531
must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency.

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.532
Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple,

00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:27.853
like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh,

00:02:27.853 --> 00:02:28.822
when it ripens,

00:02:28.822 --> 00:02:30.773
how sugary its juice is,

00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:32.693
and how long it stays fresh.

00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:36.444
Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples,

00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:40.253
selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best.

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:43.522
These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar,

00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:46.074
or new apple variety.

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:48.775
To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar,

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:52.874
all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling.

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:55.185
Branches, called scion wood,

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:59.551
are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood.

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:02.775
Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk -

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:04.743
that's the lower section of another tree

00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:06.863
that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar

00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:10.254
for its superior roots 
and growing ability.

00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.967
Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:15.323
with the desired qualities.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:17.684
Each new plant takes up to four years

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.794
before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat.

00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:24.695
Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all:

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:26.327
universities,

00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:27.245
companies,

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:30.044
and even individuals can create
new cultivars.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:34.355
But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge -

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:36.905
naming the fruit.

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:38.705
After a cultivar is patented,

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.584
a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark.

00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:46.336
That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones.

00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:48.468
That name must be completely original,

00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:51.456
and the catchier, the better, of course.

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:55.325
With over 7,500 varieties and counting,

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:57.705
that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady,

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.186
Sweet Tango,

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:00.244
Kiku,

00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:01.996
and EverCrisp.

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.057
The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars,

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:09.746
the more creative and delectable
these names will become.
