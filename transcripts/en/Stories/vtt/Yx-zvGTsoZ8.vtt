00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.850
SUBJECT 1: I've been called
the supermodel of hands.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.080
I think it's because I've had
the longest career of any hand

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.890
model out there.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.390
In those little
seven inches, I have

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.370
to convey a whole feeling, a
whole story, a whole thought

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.154
process about what's going
into that advertising campaign.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.840
I wear gloves quite
often, especially when

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.250
I'm outside, to protect
my hands from the elements

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.770
and from the things
that can happen.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.270
But I take really
good care of them.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.500
And you'll see why
I'm a hand model,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.270
because I have flawless
skin and nice long nails,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.030
and very graceful hands.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.910
And that's really
become my signature.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.334
I never know when I'm going
to have a hand modeling job.

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:42.750
So I could get
called now and have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.070
to be somewhere in an
hour, so my hands always

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.130
have to be ready to go.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.520
I have lots of polishes that
I bring around every job, just

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.380
the basics.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.551
I bring sunglasses,
because a lot

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.175
of times you're under
really hot light,

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:55.549
so you have to
protect your eyes.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:00:59.980
I'm the first to joke about it.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.887
Like, I wear gloves.

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:01.720
I go out to the bar.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.930
I can completely make fun of
my life, because everybody just

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.895
makes fun of me all
the time pretty much.

00:01:06.895 --> 00:01:09.677
It is a fun job to be silly
about, but you know what?

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:11.260
I am the most serious
about what I do,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.910
and I am the most
professional person.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340
Hand modeling is
incredibly competitive.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.014
So that means if
I have a paper cut

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.013
and the next hand model
doesn't have a paper cut

00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:25.550
and they don't have to pay the
expense of having Photoshop,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.841
they're not going to choose me.

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:28.609
So I always just
have to be perfect.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.650
And you can't have a lot
of ego involved with it,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.690
because we audition a
lot and sometimes people

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.718
reject your hands.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.850
So there's two very
different ways of working.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.250
One is for print, where
we're working with a camera

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.240
and it's stills.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.210
So that means having my
hands look the most graceful

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.470
and support the product in the
best way they possibly can.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.967
If you're on TV or video,
it's a whole different set

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:52.550
of techniques.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.550
That's all about hitting a
mark and doing a movement,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.710
and being able to recreate that
movement time and time again.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.890
I love to do both.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.060
And I've really created
a technique around it,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.534
so now I actually teach it.

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:05.200
And there was never
someone to teach me,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.241
and I'm really glad that
I can teach other people

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.970
this very unique
thing that really

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.930
only I can teach, in a sense.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.240
I think hand modeling
is really my dream job.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.990
I get to be a performer, and
yet I run my own business.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.270
I've done this for
a really long time,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.920
so my hands look like
they're in their 20s.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.445
But I'm really not, obviously.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:29.110
But I've been able to parlay
this into a nice long career,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.490
much longer than most
models are able to do.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.770
So I feel like I can really
age gracefully into this career

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.890
well into my 90s.

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:43.740
NARRATOR: To learn about another
fun way to make a living,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.412
check out this next video about
a scientist who climbs trees.

00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:48.870
SUBJECT 2: The most
common reaction

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.995
I get when I'm on a flight
sitting next to somebody

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:52.970
and they ask what do I
do, and I tell them I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.370
study sleeping sloths
and I climb trees,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.370
they think it's a joke.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.840
And then I tell them
no, I'm serious,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.381
and I show them
pictures on my phone,

00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:01.190
and they're like, that is the
coolest job I've ever heard of,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.420
and how is that really a job?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.352
And how do I get to do that?

00:03:04.352 --> 00:03:06.060
