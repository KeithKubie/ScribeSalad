&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.370


00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.016
&gt;&gt; Hi everybody.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.960
If you've just arrived, welcome
to the Mystery and Fiction Tent.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.006
My name is Maureen Corrigan.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.206
I am a regular reviewer
for the Washington Post

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.806
and the book critic
for Fresh Air on NPR.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320
Thank you.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.720
The Washington Post has been a
regular sponsor of the book festival

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
since its inception 10
years ago and I'm happy

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.580
to say I think I've been here
every year through all kinds

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.460
of weather including this
kind of weather for 10 years.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.930
I am so thrilled to
be able to introduce

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.193
to you a writer I greatly
admire, Scott Spencer.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.140
I first became a fan of Scott
Spencer's when I read Endless Love

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.156
which still stands as one

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.053
of the most elegantly erotic
novels I've ever read.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.713
So I highly recommend it to you.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.713
I also had the pleasure of reviewing
for Fresh Air, A Ship Made of Paper

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.480
and both Endless Love and A Ship
Made of Paper were nominated

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.106
for the National Book Award.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.623
Here's an inside story
about Fresh Air.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.063
Terry Gross and I sometimes
tussle over authors.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.696
If she is interviewing an author
I usually don't get to review

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.273
that author and vise versa and
there are certain authors we always

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120
tussle over.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.830
And she won with Scott
Spencer 'cause it's her show.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.943
So she got to interview
him for Man in the Woods

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.096
which is his wonderful new
novel and what could I do?

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.940
But I'm thrilled to
say that at least I get

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.870
to introduce him to you today.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.400
So without further
ado Scott Spencer.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Maureen.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.150
So you realize every time you review
one of my books it gets nominated

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.810
for the National Book Award
so I'm counting on you now.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.210


00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.860
Excuse me.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860


00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.730
I'm gonna talk a little bit about
the one thing I know something

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.263
about which is writing a novel,
about writing in general,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.053
and I hope that there's time.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.670
I'm gonna make sure
there is time for me

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.246
to hear what you guys
are thinking about.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
Maybe we can even in this sort

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.003
of spacious environment get
some kind of conversation going.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.413
I think there are microphones here.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.286
You know, there's a cliche that
writing teachers tell their students

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.126
and I think it's a cliche that goes,
you know, straight to the heart

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.920
of what people think about writing
and that is write what you know.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.030
And I've taught in, I've taught
in graduate writing programs.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.870
I've taught in undergraduate
writing programs.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.563
I've taught new writers as different
as, you know, very well healed kids

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.990
at Williams College up in
Massachusetts to prisoners

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.076
in maximum security prisons.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.293
And they all have been
told write what you know.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.163
And it's not the worst
advice you can have

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.280
because you have to start somewhere.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.703
You have to go somewhere
for your material

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.470
and minding your own biography,
and minding your own travels,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.006
and minding your own life
is a decent place to start.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.570
But after having written 10 novels
I realize that there is a lot

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.823
of writing that I believe in much
more than write what you know

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.146
and that is write what
you don't know.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.083
And it's, you know, it was
John Gardner the late novelist

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.623
in his book, I think it's called On
Moral Fiction described the novel

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.103
and the story as a kind of moral
laboratory where you test hypothesis

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.303
of human behavior and figure
out what would happen,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.650
what is a good thing to happen,
what is the good/bad outcome,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.716
how do people behave under stress,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.146
what binds us together,
what pulls us apart.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
And that laboratory, I
mean it's a laboratory.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.936
It's different from a
scientific laboratory.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.756
I mean, if you're working for
General Mills you have a job.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.853
You have to make a little piece
of rice crunchy if you put milk

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.003
on it and that's your job.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.556
But what the laboratory work of
a novel is more like pure science

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.523
where you're just going
in for the investigation

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.320
and you don't really have a vested
interest in what the outcome is.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.743
So I do believe in write
what you don't know.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.856
And I'll actually refine that
a little bit and I'll say,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.050
write what disturbs you,
write what confuses you,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.430
and really write what
scares you half to death

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.200
and I've written a
lot, really a lot.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.266
It's what I mainly do.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.666
And sometimes it's all I do.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.960
I've written journalism.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.226
I've written reviews, travel
pieces, investigation and each time,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.543
each time I get one these jobs, each
time I get one of these assignments

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.383
or get myself one of
these assignments,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.116
it's been like going
to night school for me.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.103
And it's been like
graduate school really.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.240
I mean, I had one assignment
from Rolling Stone to do a piece

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.456
about the crooked financier
Marc Rich.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.856
I had no idea who he was.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.036
No idea who he was but sort
of plunged in and found out,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.356
got another job to write about
another Mark, Mark Knopfler.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.923
You know the guitarist whose band
was Dire Straits and who happens

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.983
to be, I found out,
just about the living,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.016
the greatest living
guitar player around.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.310
I got another job investigating this
Christian filmmaker who made this

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.523
like the Left Behind series
and found out all about that.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.030
But the real Journey without
Maps, that's actually a title

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.270
of one of my heroes' books.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.163
That's a Graham Greene book
about his life as a traveler.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.843
But that real journey
without map, the real voyages

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.373
of discovery have been novels and,
you know, I've written 10 of them.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.796
And as a writer of 10 novels
I often get to question,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.063
does it get easier as you go along?

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.916
And what I always forget to
say is if it does get easier

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.453
as I go along then that means
I'm not doing a very good job.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.206
I mean, I like-- actually Joyce
Carol Oates had a great answer

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.406
to that question once.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.873
They asked her, you
know, if with the passing

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.406
of time does writing
novels get easier

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.920
and she said nothing gets
easier with the passing

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.566
of time including the
passing of time.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.230
You know, in my 10 novels, I've
imagined or tried to imagine my way

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.330
into predicaments that
might not seem very far

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.820
from my so-called life because,
you know, writers are like magpies.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.680
If we see something, we just pick
it up and bring it back to our nests

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.313
and see how we can use it.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.730
I mean, like I've written
about fatherhood.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.440
Fatherhood is something that's
always been interesting to me.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.493
I was very close to my
father so I'm his son.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.053
I know it from that perspective
and I'm a father with two kids.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.116
But writing about that really
wouldn't take me very deep

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.683
into the unknown.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.816
So what I did was write a book
called The Rich Man's Table trying

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.850
to imagine my way into what it would
be like if I were Bob Dylan's son

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.696
and he refused to recognize me.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.500
And then in another novel, Waking
the Dead, I wanted to write

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.716
about my home in Chicago
but rather than just kind

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.643
of recapitulate my own experience
there, I wrote it from the point

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.433
of view of an on-the-make
politician who's making his way

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.680
through Chicago machine politics.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.483
In Endless Love, I sort of
remembering my first real girlfriend

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.066
but then I was wondering what
it would have been like if

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.423
when her father said I
should stop seeing her

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.570
if I burn their house down.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.770


00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.983
And as used to people-- as used
to reading novels as people are

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:49.900
because we've been
reading novels as a culture

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.213
for a couple hundred of years more.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.950
I can't tell you how many people.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.703
&gt;&gt; Even people who kind of know
me think that I possibly did

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.010
that because you do plunge yourself
into this alternate reality.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.586
This what-if, so much, and part of
doing your job is to make it seem

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.223
as if it were something
that really happened.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.866
You know, like in A Ship Made
of Paper I set that in this town

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.276
that I call Leyden, New
York and it's a town

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.610
that I've used quite a few times.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.976
And I suppose I could write
a novel about my life there.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.703
It's not completely without
interest, about my poker game

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.073
and my tennis and where I shop and.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.686
But I thought it might be more
interesting if I imagine my way

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.603
into what it would be like being
an African-American person living

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.316
in this sort of slightly
precious upstate New York town.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.490
Now, just to detour for a second,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.410
I wanna talk about this fictitious
little town called Leyden,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.180
New York because I've used it a
few times and I'm using it again

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.213
in the book I'm working
on right now and it's

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.680
in very much in Man
in the Woods too.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.140
And I partly am writing about
this town because I've been living

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.170
in a town like that for 25 years.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.016
It's longer than I've lived
any place else in my life

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.136
and I'm still very, very, and I
think of myself as a big city guy

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.923
and I can't believe that I've
actually spent the majority

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.016
of my life in a little town.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.150
So I'm very surprised of that.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.543
But I see that when you do
live in a town like that

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.376
that you do have a chance of seeing
a microcosmic version of the world.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.540
And unlike big cities where people
understandably guard their privacy,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:02.660
there is not that much
sense of privacy.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.600
There's not the same kind of a
sense of privacy in a small town.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.586
So you get to hear
people's stories and you get

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.570
to watch people's lives progress in,
you know, like an ongoing soap opera

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.350
with very easy access, excuse me,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.196
with every easy access
to their lives.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.830
So now onto Man in
the Woods which is

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.030
yet another book set in this Leyden.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.116
And I thought, I thought it was
going to be when I started off

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.610
with fairly tight and
efficient book.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.743
But, you know, you
always have to think that.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:43.996
You have to tell yourself this.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.413
In order to begin you have
to tell yourself it's going

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.713
to be a little simpler than
it's ever really going to be.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.336
But like every other book that I've
written, it meant going on many,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.690
many voyages of discovery and
many, many reconnaissance missions

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.686
and there is an awful lot of writing
about what I do not, did not know.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.190
Well and here are a couple of the
things that I had to find out.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.843
One of the things I had to find out
in this book is what is the external

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.730
and internal life of
a carpenter, you know,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.593
John Updike always talked about.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.726
It's one of the hardest
things for novelists to do

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.926
because we're so strapped
to our desk.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.036
Yeah, I'm a little nervous
so they're circling the tent.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.823
Anyways John Updike always
had trouble finding jobs

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.726
for his characters.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.926
I mean, but I knew that my
character was a carpenter.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.370
And so one of the things
that I needed to know

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:01.900
and I don't mean know just in
this kind of term paper way.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.053
But I mean know in that visceral,
deep way that you have to get

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:09.593
to in order to be able to write.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.480
And I needed to know what does
it feels like to love wood.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.523
What do you smell like?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.056
What does your food taste like?

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.790
What does it feel to be that
person who knows wood as well

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.093
as a dermatologist knows skin or as
an accountant knows the tax code?

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.313
And then I needed to know for
this character, Paul Phillips,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.563
what does it feel like
to be self-sufficient.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.163
What does it feel like to be able
to fix things and to make things

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.090
and to just do it for yourself,
to not have to depend on society

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.640
and in all the networks
of health that we have

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.700
and to need basically
nothing for modern life?

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.570
Nothing that modern life has to
offer is really of interest to you.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.490
Then further on in the book I
needed to know what it feels

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:09.626
like when you're getting
ready to kill yourself

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.466
and especially if you're a bookie.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.193
Oh yeah, and you have to
live in Los Angeles too

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.173
and so this is what I've found out.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.240
I'm just gonna read you a
quick little section here.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.790
And this bookie's name is Tom Butler

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.500
and he's reached the
end of his rope.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.846
Using his forearm, Tom Butler
pushes the dishes of dried toast

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.970
and the unfinished cups of
coffee and the sour winds

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.783
of half grapefruit in
its snug little bowl

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.943
over to the far side
of his kitchen table.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.460
Using a paper towel, he dries the
area and places 50 sleeping pills

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.580
and his notebook in front of him.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.623
He creaks back in the wooden chair
and folds his arms over his chest.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.916
He's in his underwear and his
Hawaiian shirt is unbuttoned.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.433
This bottle of pills,
this blue spiral notebook,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.686
they are all that is left
of the kingdom of his life.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.586
Even the dishes and cups have
receded into the darkness.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.290
The clock ticking on
the wall is invisible.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:19.943
The exhaust fan over the
cook stove is running just

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.236
in case it takes them a
while to find his body.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.556
As for the rest of his house it
may as well have ceased to exist.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.883
The bed, the sofa, the TV,
the Bowflex, the free weights,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:37.623
the safe in the wall and the world
beyond these walls, the houses,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.583
the stunned palm trees, the pale
yellow sky, the pianist, the gamers,

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:47.606
the oohs and the ahs, the favorites,
the long shots, the spreads,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.030
the people, and the money, the money
that is owed and the money they owe,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.343
a dream, a dream, a
dream you can't remember.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.510
[ Silence ]

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.010
[ Applause ]

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.010


00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.050
The other thing that I needed to
and probably the most important

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.323
and the most difficult
voyage of discovery

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:24.863
in writing what I didn't know in
this novel is it was actually easier

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.270
to imagine my way into wanting to
kill yourself than it was to do this

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.130
and that is, what does it
feel like to kill someone.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.170
You know, there's a
lot of death in novels.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.080
But I wanted to go
where, this sounds vain,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.306
but I wanted to go
where Dostoevsky went.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.240
And somehow make it new.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.156
And I wanted this character
who took a life.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.190
I wanted him to feel the way
I would feel and actually,

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.256
I'm the best person to do

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.456
that because nobody
knows but me, I suppose.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.953
I'm just gonna read one more
short section to give you a sense.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.563
And this is the man thinking
who has done the killing.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.886
Could it really be that simple?

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.656
Could a human being be removed from
the ranks of the living with little

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.326
or no fuss and no consequences?

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.100
What about his house?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.433
What about his belongings?

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.433
Was there no one out
there to come forward

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:34.900
and say hey, where is my husband?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.966
Where is my father?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.900
Where is my lover?

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.033
Where is the man who worked for me?

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:42.966
Where is the guy at the next desk?

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.166
Where is my buddy I went to
the track with every July

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.100
or played cards with or jogged with?

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.700
Where is that grumpy bastard
with the good looking brown dog?

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.966
Where is my tenant?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:52.766
Where is my next door neighbor?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.966
Was no one curious?

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.433
Was no one making a stink?

00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.166
Wasn't there anyone
wanting an answer?

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.303
Could a man really be
plucked from the body of life

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.163
like a little splinter and just blow
away and leave no trace of himself?

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.076
But he has left a trace in Paul

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.240
and here he is carrying
a black garbage bag

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:17.623
into what he has already placed
some broken Coors bottles

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.346
and empty bleach container
with crumpled cigarette packs

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.646
and a waterlogged paper paperback
edition of Bonjour Tristesse

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:28.486
with his animal companion trotting
a few feet in front of him.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.720
He's walking Shep the dog
and cleaning the country road

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.880
over the winter's debris
that spring has exposed.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.443
And as he does he hopes to remove
the toxins in his bloodstream

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.723
through the dialysis of good deeds.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.510
[ Applause ]

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.773
&gt;&gt; Now, one last-- final-- one
final thing about the characters

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.196
in this book and that's,
I have a dog character

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.830
in this book named Shep.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.476
He is taking that walk with that
guy as he's cleaning up the road

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.716
to swish his conscience and
Shep is the closest thing

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.590
to nonfiction in this book.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.540
And because Shep is my dog.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.190
And I have a dog named Shep
and I thought, you know,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.786
I feel about my dog the way
everyone feels about their dog.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:29.403
And so I wanted to put him in my
book and I thought that would be,

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:33.673
that would be at least
something that I knew going in.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.866
But even there, even there I
realized I didn't know as much

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.570
as I thought I did about my own dog.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.596
You know, there was a piece long
time ago, at least 10 years ago,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.140
in the Atlantic Monthly and I guess
these old magazines they have this

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.226
really adorable looking
dog on the cover.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.373
And the headline says,
your dog doesn't love you

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.330
and your dog is seeing other people.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.823
I don't know what it said.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.823
And basically, his thesis was
that all these adorable things

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:16.780
that dogs do from, you know,
panting if they key you

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.993
and all the loyalty is basically
because you're their source of food.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.306
And I thought to myself,
yeah good, good.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.103
Good for the dog.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:31.436
I don't want that kind
of relationship

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.490
where somebody is just sort
of slavishly devoted to me.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:36.096
And I sort of remembered that piece
and remembered my reaction to it

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.070
or against it when I was
portraying Shep in this novel.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.866
And then I realized that Shep
really cares about three things,

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.643
protein, comfort, and safety.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.983
And since I am giving him plenty

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.256
of all those things I'm
like aces with Shep.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.886
And so Shep actually at that point
became a much more interesting

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.416
character to me because he
was no longer just, you know,

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.096
he wasn't my dog anymore.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.963
He was somebody who I was having to
imagine my way into the way I had

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:22.730
to imagine my way into Tom Butler
as he is going to commit suicide.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.276
The way I had to imagine
myself into Paul Phillips

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.200
when he kills a man
with his bare hands.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.746
Alright. I'm gonna stop
just almost mid thought

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.893
in case somebody has
something they wanna ask

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.426
because I certainly have
like six more minutes.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.510
[ Pause ]

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.710
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you
when you get an idea

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:57.540
for a book, how does that happen?

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.703
Are you having coffee or
playing poker or are you doing--

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.443
and what happens when you
decide ah, that's the next one?

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.900
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.226
I find that there are two lucky
places for me to have my ideas

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.943
and one is listening
to music, live music.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:19.593
Somehow I don't know what it is.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.033
It just puts me into a
nice little state of mind

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.686
where things occur to me.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.173
And the other time
is when I'm driving.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.300
And one of the ways I know that it's
a good idea is if I don't forget it.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.300
And I don't write it
down immediately

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:39.813
because I'm gonna give myself
that chance to forget it

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.453
because if this is an
idea I'm really gonna use,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.976
it's something I'm gonna live
with for like three years.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.716
I wanna make sure it's
the real thing.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.700
So I let my memory or lack of
memory kick the tires on it,

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.923
you know, before I hop in.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.773
And the other thing is that, you
know, people can have a lot of ideas

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.163
but not every idea sort of triggers
that writing thing inside you.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.726
And so I've had what seems
to me like a pretty good idea

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.646
or a good notion, or a good
setup, or interesting character

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.423
and I'm just gonna assume
in some sort of spiritually,

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.116
they've gone on to somebody else
'cause I wasn't the right person

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.290
for them.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.356
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a big fan of
Endless Love, the book.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.580
The movie not so much and I'm a
movie lover so that's saying a lot.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.763
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But we're making it.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.030
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.630
&gt;&gt; That's what they say.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.496
&gt;&gt; I hope you have
more clap this time

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.296
because you're obviously pretty
young when they did it last time.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But believe or
not I am less clapped.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.030
[ Laughter ]

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.690
&gt;&gt; Because the business had
become all that more corporate

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.836
and distant but go ahead.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:24:59.216
&gt;&gt; Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:05.323
But your character, it's so much
like Gatsby observing his love

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.390
or in Marjorie Morningstar, the
way she is observed it resonated

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.336
with me the same way
and I'm wondering

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.003
if it was difficult especially
because you were so much earlier

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.030
on your career to see the
movie go such a different way

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.810
where the inner life
is so secondary.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:26.930
That's the first part of my question

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.503
and the second part is how do
you pitch your book where it's

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.023
about the person who's doing the
observing more than the love object?

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:37.810
&gt;&gt; You mean pitch a book
to a publisher or somebody?

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.643
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't, you know,
if I went in to pitch that book

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:44.973
to a publisher, they would
look at me and say, hey,

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.513
how did you get my number?

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.780
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.046
&gt;&gt; I mean and not because, not
because of the book necessary but,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.780
you know, there is no reason
for a publisher to listen to me.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.886
I mean, that book was
very, very successful.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.220
I'll probably never have a book
that was so universally accepted

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.156
or successful as that but I
sold that for 10,000 dollars

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.396
and I was thrilled that
I got that much for it.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.216
So I didn't pitch this book.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.856
I wrote the whole thing
out and then gave it

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.483
to somebody simply
to publish this, so.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.723
But, you know, as to my
feeling about the movie,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.323
it sort of connected to my
answer to the first one.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.243
I mean, I had no money.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.693
I had a kid that was, you
know, three months old

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.903
and I was pretty happy to get paid
and buy a house in the country.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.580
I didn't realize that the movie was
going to be some sort of like icon

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.020
of bad movie making
as it has become.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:52.540
And I'm not trying so say, you know,

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.940
actually I remained
very good friends

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:57.693
with the screenwriter of that move.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.020
This woman name Judith Rascoe
who has written all kinds

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.833
of wonderful movies and art
films and mainstream films

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.730
and she sent me this thing
that there's some sort

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:09.203
of like reevaluation of the Franco
Zeffirelli version of Endless Love

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:17.336
and kinda say that it's like a
Douglas Sirk film or something.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.686
But I didn't care for it.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.113
The point of the movie was almost
the opposite of what I was going

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.846
for in the novel which is sort of a
celebration of that sort of insane,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.400
heedless teenage love
and I think the tag line

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.503
on the movie poster was the
love that every parent fears,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.856
and so that's not going to the
direction I was thinking about.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.750


00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.210
[ Pause ]

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.410
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think--

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:58.410
&gt;&gt; One more question, real quick.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:00.610
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, we have
one more minute.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.276
Please go ahead.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.676
&gt;&gt; How did you get pass the
people that dissuaded you

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.143
from ever becoming an author?

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.410
Obviously you're--

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.076
&gt;&gt; Well, 'cause they didn't
have another suggestion for me.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.476
&gt;&gt; No alternatives.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.743
&gt;&gt; I mean, you know, in my family
making money wasn't that important.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.056
My father worked in a factory so,
you know, the idea that, you know,

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.363
I was gonna starve to death
or, it didn't hang over me

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.053
like a sword the way it would
have if my father was a doctor

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.320
or a lawyer and I felt that
I had to maintain that sort

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.793
of upper middle class lifestyle.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.106
So I didn't really, I mean all
that was standing between me

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.320
and becoming an author
was learning how to do it.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:47.996
Okay. Well, thanks for coming out.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.643
It's great to see you all.
