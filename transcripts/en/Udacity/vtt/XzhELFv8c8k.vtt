00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.370
Xcode is a very powerful integrated
development environment and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.740
it may feel a bit overwhelming at first.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.810
That's okay.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.735
Let me show you one of the features of
the interface builder part of Xcode.

00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:12.850
That'll make your life a little easier.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.380
It's called the document outline.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.030
Here, I'm looking at
the completed pitch perfect.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.870
Just so you can see
the document outline in full.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.280
Your pitch perfect cap won't have
any of these UI elements just yet.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.280
Here, I have Xcode open to
the main.story board file.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.090
And the document outline is not visible.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.439
See this little button here?

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.610
This is what shows or
hides the document outline.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.950
Clicking on it causes
a document outline to open.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.240
In this document outline, we can see
our record sounds view controller.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.030
The view and
all of the UI elements inside that view.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.250
Sometimes you may need to click
on this disclosure triangle

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.280
to see the items inside of it.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520
If you're looking for
an easy way to find and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.620
work with your ui elements,
the document outline is the place to go.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.400
This is especially true once your
app starts to have more than

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.920
just a few buttons and labels.
