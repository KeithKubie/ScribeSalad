00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.750
Now that you've got a handle on visual encodings and

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.310
data types, we'd like you to go find your own visualization to decompose it.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.410
Here's what I mean.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.840
This graph shows medals won by each country during the Summer Olympics.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.420
This graphic is actually a cartogram, where the geography, or

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.720
the area of each country, has been distorted by the number of medals won.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.034
Larger bubbles indicate a country that's won many medals, like Russia and

00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:28.270
China, while smaller countries have won fewer medals, such as Singapore.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.509
For whatever data visualization that you find, I'd like you to indicate what

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.020
are the variables, what are the data types, what are their visual encodings and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.310
to what extent are those encodings effective?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.680
You can find eight examples from the link in the instruction notes.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.620
But be sure to find a different graphic than the ones provided here.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.960
We want you to go two steps further, though.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.810
The examples here only describe the encodings for the variables.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.720
Be sure you also identify the data types and

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.180
describe the effectiveness of the visual encodings.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.950
Do you think the display analogs aid in the interpretation of the visualization,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.020
or do you think they distract from the viz?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.970
So take some time to find a visualization and answer these questions.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.250
Once you've posted a link or image of the viz with your response in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.900
the discussion thread, check this box to continue.
