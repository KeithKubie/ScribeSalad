00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.200
Schalk: Hello, my name
is Chris Schalk.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.567
I'm a Google
Developer Advocate.

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:05.567
And I'm here
with Yoichiro Tanaka,

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:07.234
the creator of OSDE,

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:09.400
which is an Eclipse plug-in

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.567
that allows you to do
Open Social Development

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.400
entirely within Eclipse.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
So let's go ahead
and do a demonstration

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.901
of how to use the OSDE plug-in
inside of Eclipse.

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.567
So, first of all, after I've
installed the Eclipse plug-in,

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.901
I can create a new project.

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:27.567
And you'll notice
the project type here

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.901
is an Open Social project now.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:31.400
And so I'll click "Next,"

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.567
and I'll just give it
a basic name like "OSDE Test."

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.901
And I'll give it a title,
like say, the same thing,

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:41.067
"OSDE Test,"
as well as--

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:42.734
I'll just fill in
the author e-mail.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.067
You'll also notice that
I can specify other features,

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:47.234
such as
the Open Social Version,

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.234
as well as other
just general gadget features.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:54.234
But I'll just accept the default
and click on "Next."

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.901
And now on this page,
I can create different views

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.901
for canvas, profile,
preview, home, etc.

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.567
So, in this case,
I'm gonna create two views--

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:07.067
one for canvas of type HTML,
and I'm going to go ahead

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.234
and create external JavaScript
in a separate file,

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:13.234
as well as generate a little bit
of JavaScript file

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.400
in the form of an init function.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
And I'll do the same thing
for the profile view.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.567
So you have type HTML
and generate some JavaScript.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.734
And then at this point,
I'll click "Finish."

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.100
And this will create

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.734
our new Open Social Developer
environment project.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:31.901
So I can open this up,

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:34.400
and so you can see
I have our gadget.xml,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.734
so that's our gadget spec,

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:37.901
as well
as two JavaScript files

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.734
that contain
the code for each view.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.734
Now, you'll notice
the gadget.xml file

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:44.567
is already open,

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.234
and we're looking
at an editor.

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:47.501
It's like a simplified editor,

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.234
so I can just enter in
the fields directly here.

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:51.567
Likewise, I can open up

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:55.400
and specify
the different options.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.601
And now if I--Also, on the
bottom, I can tab through.

00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.334
So, for example, if I wanted
to access the different views

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:01.901
directly through here,

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.400
I can edit the views
inside here.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.234
Likewise,
I can change the locale

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:09.234
or add internationalization
for my gadget application,

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.067
same thing
for user preference.

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:12.567
And then finally,
if I want to just edit

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.067
the source code
directly for my gadget,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.400
I can just click on "Source"
and edit this way.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.067
So, in this case,
the code that's defined here

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:23.234
is--as a default
is actually pretty easy.

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:24.901
It's just a simple div.

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm gonna actually replace
the code

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.234
with some of my own code.

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:32.267
And I happen to have
some code handy here.

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:35.067
So, first of all, I'll just
create, like, my own div,

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:37.901
where I'm going to display
my friends,

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:42.067
instead
of what's generated here.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:46.734
And then, likewise, I'm going
to go into the canvas.js file.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:49.400
I'm gonna open that
into a Text Editor.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.734
And right now
it's just an empty init file--

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:52.901
init function, that is.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:54.067
So let me switch back over

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:59.067
to my ready-to-go
JavaScript code.

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:02.067
And I'll--all I'm doing is I'm
loading in two functions--

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:03.901
"load friends"
and then "unload friends."

00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:07.234
And then I'm actually replacing
the init function here.

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:10.067
And what this code does
is it simply goes and fetches

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:13.734
a set of friends and displays it
into the gadget body itself.

00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:14.767
Okay?

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.734
So let me just
paste that in there.

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.067
And now I'll hit "Save."

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:21.901
So now I'm ready to run
the application.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.400
But before I run it,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.567
I'll actually have
to start up the local--

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:28.734
local server,

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:30.901
the local Apache server.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:35.400
And so, in this case, as you
notice here on the menu bar,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.234
there's a little icon there that
looks like the Open Social icon,

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:40.234
and it says,
"Launch Apache Shindig Server."

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:42.901
So let's go ahead
and click on that.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.901
And that will launch essentially
Apache Shindig right here.

00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.234
And you can see the progress
of it in the console.

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:51.901
And then once the server
is ready to go,

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.567
I'll be able to launch
my application.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:58.234
And I do that
by clicking on the gadget,

00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:00.834
and I can do a right-click
and then, as you notice here,

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.567
I've got OSDE
and then "run application."

00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:04.734
What this actually does

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:07.901
is fires up a separate
Jetty Server process

00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.067
that allows the gadget
to be accessed

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.234
from the Shindig Server.

00:04:12.234 --> 00:04:13.234
Okay?

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:14.434
So I click
"run this application."

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:17.200
And likewise,
I can change various default--

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.567
or various settings.

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:21.067
So like, what's the owner,
what's the viewer,

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:23.234
as well as the country
and language,

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.567
or if I wanted to see it
in an external Web browser.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.501
So, for this one, because
I already have sample data

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.901
in the database--

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:32.234
and that's a feature as well
that's provided--

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:34.901
I'll just select the viewer
as John Doe

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.400
and click "Okay."

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.734
And so now I'm running the
application entirely locally,

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:42.067
and it's fetching the gadget,
and there we go.

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:45.567
I can see
the actual friends of John Doe

00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:47.901
working directly
within the gadget.

00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:49.901
So now
I have created my gadget.

00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:52.400
I can go ahead
and test it further.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.067
But at this point, I can say,

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:59.734
"Okay, great, I want to go ahead
and create, say, a Java--

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.901
an Open Social Java
client application."

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:05.901
And so we have
this feature here in OSDE

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:07.567
that allows you
to create a Java project

00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:09.067
for the restful protocol

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:13.234
that will create
a sample bit of code.

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:16.567
So I'll just create
this rest project.

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:19.734
And at that point,
I can just accept the defaults

00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:21.067
and hit "Finish."

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:23.067
And that will create
a new project,

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:24.901
and I can click "Yes."

00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:28.901
That will allow us to jump
into the Java perspective.

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:30.067
So here we are.

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:34.901
We actually have
a new sample Java client code

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.901
that will go
against our local server,

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:38.567
which is still running,
by the way.

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:41.067
And I can go through
and specify--

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:44.067
Instead of, like, CSchalk,
I can say,

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.734
"Let's go ahead
and keep it John.Doe,"

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:48.734
which is part
of the sample data.

00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:50.734
And at this point,
I can run the application,

00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:53.400
since it has
a main method in here.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.067
So I'll just go ahead, click...

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:59.067
"run as Java application."

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.501
And then
we'll watch the console.

00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:02.400
And as you notice here
in the console,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.400
it actually cre--
you went out and fetched

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.901
these same friends
directly from the server,

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:10.067
but this time it was using
the rest protocol.

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.234
And that pretty much
concludes the demonstration.

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.734
The only other thing
I wanted to show

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:15.901
is that you have, like,
a nice menu option here.

00:06:15.901 --> 00:06:18.567
You can also create
the sample data.

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:21.067
So this is actually a first step
that you'd want to do.

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:25.267
I can show you the public
certificate for OAuth.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:29.567
And I would say that concludes
the demonstration of OSDE,

00:06:29.567 --> 00:06:31.567
an Eclipse plug-in

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:33.901
that allows you to do
Open Social Development

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.067
entirely inside of Eclipse.

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.467
Thank you.
