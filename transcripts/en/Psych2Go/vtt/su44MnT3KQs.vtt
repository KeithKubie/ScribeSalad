00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.840
[Intro]

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.840
Have you ever felt
out of place in this world

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.280
or feel like you never
truly belonged anywhere?

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.140
Do people usually think
you are odd, eccentric,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.380
or describe you as
having the head in the clouds?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.620
Don't worry.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.380
This doesn't mean
they're insulting you.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.700
In fact, take it as a compliment.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.200
If you're identified with any of any traits,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.720
it means you are creative.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.360
To understand your mysterious
talents and elusive nature,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.220
here are 7 signs you're a highly creative soul.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.700
1. People often call you playful.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.820
Playfulness is a trait
that is usually looked down upon

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.320
because people associate it
with immaturity and unreliability.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
But did you know that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.180
there are actually many benefits
to being playful?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.020
It turns out that those who are playful

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.840
get better grades in school,
can handle stress better,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.780
and are more motivated in life.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.280
According to a study,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.460
those who have a playful nature
are naturally more creative,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.780
because they can easily change perspectives.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.320
This allows them to be
effective problem solvers

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.400
as they stumble upon
unusual and novel solutions.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.620
So the next time someone founds
upon your childlike behavior,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.140
remember that
your mental flexibility is a strength

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.240
that helps you overcome challenges
while letting you have some fun.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.380
2. You're a night owl.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200
Do you often stay up late?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.060
According to the research
published in the journal personality

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.840
and individual differences,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.760
it turns out that

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.960
those are night owls
tend to find more creative solutions.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.460
In fact, night owls scored higher

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.380
on three creativity tests
than early birds.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.800
Experts believed that
the reason behind this,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.300
is because their unconventional
schedule and habits

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.320
may encourage them to find alternative,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.960
and out-of-the-box solutions.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.780
So the next time your parents
tell you to go to bed early,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.840
tell them that
you're just being creative.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740
3. You get distracted easily.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.460
It turns out that sometimes,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.220
too much focus can distract
you from being creative.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.900
In stead of concentrating too much
on one specific part of a picture,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.180
creative souls tend to drift
here and there,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.560
exploring different options and ideas.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.140
Researchers also discovered that

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.300
creative achievement is associated
with one's inability

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.540
to filter out sensory information.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.080
So if you're sensitive to
constant tapping, loud chewing,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.380
talking or outside noises in general,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.160
it's because your brain
has trouble ignoring them.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.020
Although this sounds like a nuisance

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.540
when you want to get things done,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.140
the upside is that
you're prone to being innovative.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.620
4. You're neurotic.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.460
Do you feel often stressed out
or worried more easily than others?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.340
The good news is that your neuroticism

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.900
makes you more creative!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.940
Although the anxiety you experience

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.140
can make you unhappy on a daily basis,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.420
According to research,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.280
the part of your brain
that is highly active

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.720
in your neurotic individuals,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.600
is also responsible
for self-generated thoughts.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.800
While neuroscientists don't
understand the direct link

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.860
between neuroticism and creativity,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.860
They believe that
the active part that triggers neuroticism,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240
is also related to our imagination.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.160
5. You're good at coming up
with lies, stories, and excuses.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.760
Sounds crazy
and a bit over the top, right?

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.140
But according to a study

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.820
done by Professor Gino Francesca
at Harvard Business School,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.940
and author Dan Ariely who wrote

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.780
"The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty",

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.240
there was a correlation between
dishonesty and creativity.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.500
This is not to say that
every creative person

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.480
prefers to lie, cheat or steal.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.980
But it's because their active imagination

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.040
that makes them superb storytellers.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.100
Francesca and Ariely state that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.540
creative people
subconsciously convinced themselves

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300
that their actions are justified.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.220
Interestingly enough though,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.180
creative people usually don't believe
that they are dishonest.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.040
Because their imagination convinces them

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.460
that what they think is real.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.760
6. You have a messy room
and work environment.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.280
This doesn't mean a gross workplace
that is unpleasant to be in.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.800
But one study
published in sage journals,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.280
shows that disorganized
desk and environment

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.740
can promote creativity.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.180
Researchers conducted three experiments

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.880
to see how messy rooms
affect people's creativity.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.380
They concluded that
disorderly environments

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.440
can inspire the individual
to break free from tradition,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.220
which encourages them
to produce novel ideas.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.940
Organized environments however,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.780
influence people to play at safe,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.480
take less risks,
and think inside the box.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.980
7. You enjoy talking to people
from all walks of life.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.000
Creative individuals aren't afraid
to go out and meet people

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.860
who can give them new ideas,
and refreshing perspectives.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.540
They like to be experimental,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.600
and welcome things
that are less traditional.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.200
This makes them resilient

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.280
as they have
a high tolerance for failure,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.800
if it means embracing
exciting new experiences in exchange.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.600
To boost your creativity,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.100
we'd recommend that
you talk to people who

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.020
challenge what you think you know.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.760
Which of these signs
do you most resonate with?
