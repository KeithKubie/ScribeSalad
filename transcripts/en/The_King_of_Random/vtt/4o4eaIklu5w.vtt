00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey guys welcome back to the lab in this video,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.350
we're taking liquid nitrogen and putting in a vacuum chamber to see if it will change from a liquid to a solid.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.800
I've seen videos online of other companies trying this experiment and actually

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.380
solidifying nitrogen in their lab. So, can we replicate that experiment here in our lab today?

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.489
Let's give it a try.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:20.220
I flip the gauge around on my vacuum chamber, so that when we place it upside down,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.710
we can still get a visual readout. Now we can take our little dish, fill it up with liquid nitrogen right in the center,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.409
go ahead and attach our vacuum chamber,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.960
And turn the pump on. Look at the way that vibrates.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.420
Check this out.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.890
It's actually vibrating right now because there's a positive pressure as the nitrogen is expanding it's trying to lift this off.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.500
It's almost like an air hockey table.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.219
Everything set, let's expose the vacuum port, and turn on the pump.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.580
*vacuum noise*

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
K, it is pulling vacuum. We're at 3 inches of mercury.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.720
Liquid Nitrogen is still boiling.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.160
Now, theoretically, what should be happening here is,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.300
as we remove the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.739
atmosphere from the jar, the boiling point of the nitrogen should drop. So it may get to a point where it actually starts crystallizing and freezing.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.760
Right now we are at 11 inches of Mercury, and the vacuum is fighting that nitrogen because the nitrogen is expanding and the vacuum is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.960
working really hard to counteract that.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.340
So about 14 inches of Mercury now,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.470
I'm noticing the bubbling of the nitrogen is actually

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.820
reducing, which means it's cooling down to the point where the liquid may start to think about crystallizing.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.849
Oh, you know we should do is put a little bit of styrofoam underneath help insulate it, cause' right now

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:36.291
I bet the plastic it's sitting on is quite warm.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.480
K, cool. So I'm actually going to stop this right now.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.020
Let's let the pressure back in, and I'm going to stick a roll of duct tape underneath it.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.380
Wow, that's cool. I gotta roll of duct tape with a little glass lid, we'll just stick that underneath there,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.760
and that should insulate the bottom now enough in where it doesn't draw heat from the Plexiglas. We'll add little more nitrogen,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.300
just to keep things happy.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.350
Cool, and now you can see the nitrogen vapor, that should slowly disappear and become very clear.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.480
Wow, the nitrogen has little bursts that pop up very radically.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.850
Yup, just like that. That's amazing. I don't know what's going on there, but it's like a little explosion from the bottom every now and then.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.360
Wow, that was a good one!

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.360
This thing's working hard.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.059
Man, you know we're down to about 18 inches of mercury right now, but it's getting hard to see through the glass jar.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.720
So I think what we're gonna do is stop the experiment here, transfer this into the pressure cooker,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.449
and then with the acrylic lid we should get a lot better view.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.719
It looks pretty chunky, wonder if it's just frosted right] down in there in the atmosphere.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.639
Alright guys, so update: I've cleaned everything out of the jar, so there are no little chunks or crystals in there.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.540
We're gonna pour in fresh liquid nitrogen,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.909
and we're going to use the pressure chamber this time, so that we can get a good clear look through the acrylic and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.840
see exactly what's going on.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
Everything set let's get it pumping.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.290
Now, we seem to have hung up right around 19 inches of mercury here.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.149
19 and a half, come on you can do it! You're so close.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.140
Oh, shoot. My little filter that I built for this thing, the hot glue just melted 'cause this is getting too hot.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.110
Maybe I should use a little nitrogen to cool it down.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.549
Yeah, it's so, so hot. It's just repelling right off, it's not even doing much.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.820
So we're at 21 and a half inches of mercury, making very slow progress.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760
I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do it.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.300
My vacuum pump's going crazy spilling oil all over the place, here.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.989
Oh, my hot glue's melting. This thing's just hanging by a thread right now.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:49.339
I've got electrical tape holding this filter together, so it doesn't push oil clouds all over my workshop. Electricity and snow, is it a good idea?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120
Wow.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:04.738
Makes for some good snowball snow after warming up. There are 22 inches of mercury now, we're making pretty slow progress, but it is progressing.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.110
If you look at the nitrogen now, we've only got a little bit left. A lot of its been vaporized.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.220
So, let's keep this thing going until there's absolutely no nitrogen left,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.440
and then if we introduce the air back in, if something does liquefy then we'll  know we did it, 'cause right now

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.919
I'm having a really hard time seeing anything frozen down there.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.700
Oh, there we go. I think this is the last of the nitrogen.

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:38.369
Okay, that's it. Our nitrogen is completely gone, and I don't know about you, but I didn't really see anything frozen down there.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.130
Alright guys, so I'm actually a little bit discouraged even pulling 22 inches of mercury in a vacuum chamber,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.820
we were not able to successfully make solid nitrogen.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.709
So, right now this container is still under vacuum pressure, if we open this valve and let the air back in and we can take the container out.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.059
There we go, so we got a bunch of vapor, but we've just got a big frosty glass. There's nothing in there at all.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.400
No, nitrogen no solid.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.620
Ooh! It's just very very cold.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.780
now if I had a stronger pump perhaps

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.369
we could have seen the nitrogen actually solidify. I did get down to 22 inches of mercury,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.810
which I think is pretty good vacuum.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.639
But it still wasn't enough to get it to transition. Even when the nitrogen got down to a very very thin layer,

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.478
I thought for sure it was going to flip over and it just didn't, it just evaporated.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.419
So if you guys have any ideas on how we could actually make this work, let me know in the comments below,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.760
maybe it's something we could try in a  future experiment. In the meantime, Thanks for joining me for this experiment, I'll be looking for you in the next one.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.620
Well, this is a lot harder then I thought.  We may have a failed experiment.
