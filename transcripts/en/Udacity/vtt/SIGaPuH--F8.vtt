00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the final question, I'd like to explore something.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I don't have a good answer for this, but I'd like you to play with those parameters over here--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the data weight, the weight smoother, the control parameters p_gain and d_gain.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Play with them, try to find a setting that gives me fewer collisions on average

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
than my current parameters and maybe reaches the goal even faster.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I should warn you these are about the best variables I could find,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but I didn't really apply twiddle to this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I did more of an approximate investigation of what a good parameter might be.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When you apply twiddle and try this, you will find that it's hard to apply

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because your function might never return, so you have to build in the time somehow.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's fun playing with those to see if you can find a better solution than what I gave you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you do so, don't expect the correct answer from me. I didn't implement it myself.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But I want to give you the opportunity to play with those parameters

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and see what the effects are on this solution.
