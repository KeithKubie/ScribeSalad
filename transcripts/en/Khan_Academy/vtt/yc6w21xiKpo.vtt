00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.460
So what do we have right here?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.731
Well, this is just
a water molecule.

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:07.230
And this right over
here, let's see,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.720
we have 1, 2, 3 carbons
in our backbone.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.130
So this would be
meth, ethy, propane.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.760
We all have single
bonds right here.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.110
So this is propane.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.700
Let me write that out.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.960
This is-- give myself
some space-- propane.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.760
And then on the
number 2 carbon, I

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.490
have both a methyl
group and a bromo group.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.680
And bromo comes before
methyl in alphabetical order.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.740
So I could write this as
2-bromo-2-methylpropane.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.764
So that's this molecule that
we have right over here.

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:49.180
Now, what we're
going to imagine--

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.730
it's sitting in
some water, and I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.490
have one water molecule
drawn right over here.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.230
Let's imagine that we have
this bromine right over here.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.920
It's pretty neutral.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.702
It is neutral because it
has seven valence electrons.

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:04.660
Or you could say, it has
the charge equivalent.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.930
It has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.110
And then it has half
of this bond that's

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.000
composed of two
electrons, so that's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.210
what's keeping this
neutral right over here.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.680
But we do know that
bromine-- well,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.312
it's not completely unstable
if it were to take an electron,

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:24.520
because that would get it
to eight valence electrons.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.890
We know that it's more
electronegative than carbon,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.730
which means that, if
it's sharing a bond,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.620
it's more likely to take the
entire bond than carbon is.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.740
So let's imagine a scenario.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.680
Let's imagine a scenario
where bromine takes these two

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.100
carbons in this bond
right over here.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
And this isn't going to be a
super-fast thing that happens,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.690
because this molecule
right over here,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.429
the 2 bromo-2 methylpropane,
is actually reasonably stable.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.970
So I'm not saying this is going
to just happen automatically.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.500
It's going to happen super-fast.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.970
But it could happen.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.770
And so to show that
this isn't going

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.050
to be only a one-way
reaction, I'll

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.110
show that it's in equilibrium.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.530
So the equilibrium, I'll
draw two arrows like that.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.570
And so once this
happens, the bromine

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.460
would turn into a bromide anion.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.449
So let me draw it right over.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.460
So the bromide anion-- so it's
going to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:24.060
And then both electrons
from that shared bond,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.120
it now has a negative 1 charge.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.390
Now, if that happened, what
would happen to this left over,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.820
to what's now going to be the
thing that the bromine was

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.760
connected to, I
guess you could say?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.060
Well, let's draw that.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.590
So we have this carbon,
our number 2 carbon.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.640
We have the CH3
right over there.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.090
And we go back to CH3.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.500
And then I had this
blue methyl group.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.570
So I had this blue
methyl group right here.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.705
And the way I'm drawing, it
kind of pops out of the page.

00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:00.610
My attempt to draw it popping
out of the page-- so this

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.130
is it popping out of the page.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.750
And now, what's its
charge going to be?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.950
Well, it just gave
up half of this bond,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.950
the equivalent of an
electron's charge.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.540
So it just gave
up-- you can kind of

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.570
think of it as giving
up an electron.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.165
So this is going to
have a positive charge.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.970
And a positive charged
carbon like this,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.520
we would call this
a carbocation.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.610
So this right over here is a
carbocation, positive charge.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.930
And the reason why this is
not a crazy thing to happen

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.970
is that this is a
tertiary carbon, which

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.720
means it is connected to
three other carbons-- 1, 2, 3.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.800
A tertiary carbon, one
way to think about it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.660
is that this positive
charge can kind of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.660
be shared with its
brothers a little bit more.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.545
So a tertiary carbocation is
more stable than a secondary

00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:57.862
and definitely more
stable than a primary.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.320
Secondary would be if it was
only connected to two carbons.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.361
But this is tertiary-- so
let me write this down.

00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:05.180
This is a tertiary carbocation.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.640
This carbon is connected
to three other carbons.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.530
That's where the
tertiary comes from.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.602
So once again, it can happen.

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:14.310
I'm not saying that
this reaction is just

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.100
going to go superfast
in that direction.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.839
that's why we did these
equilibrium arrows.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.830
Now, let's bring this
oxygen into play.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.580
Sorry, not the oxygen, let's
bring this water into play.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.410
So this water, as you can
imagine, the water is neutral.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.610
It seems pretty
reasonable in the state.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.840
But the oxygen end
of the water does

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.260
have a partial negative charge.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.430
We've seen in the past that,
because oxygen is a lot more

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.170
electronegative
than hydrogen, you

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.310
have a partial negative side
on the side of the oxygens,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.700
and you have a partial
positive charge,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.990
on the side the hydrogens.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.970
And so you have this
positive carbocation.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.100
This has a partially
negative charge.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.900
So you could imagine
that this molecule might

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.032
be attracted to this is nucleus.

00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:13.740
Now, it's not going
to be super attracted

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.720
the way that a
hydroxide anion would.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.104
A hydroxide anion has
a full negative charge.

00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:20.270
This only just has a little
partial negative charge.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.730
But it could still be attracted
to something very positive

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.600
like this.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.440
So in this situation, the water
molecule is a weak nucleophile.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.150
So this is a weak nucleophile,
not as strong as a hydroxide

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.790
anion that has a
full negative charge.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.581
But if it sees something
positive like this

00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:39.330
and it bumps in
the right way, you

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.350
can imagine that one of
these pairs of this oxygen

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:55.130
would then go and essentially
form a bond, making

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.802
this carbon right
over here neutral.

00:05:57.802 --> 00:05:59.260
So what is that
going to look like?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.560
And this would happen
faster, so I'm not

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.430
going to do this
as in equilibrium.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.080
This could happen like this.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.790
And let me just copy
and paste the bromine,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.000
so I don't have to
redraw the whole thing.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.110
So let me copy, and
let me paste it.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.115
So that's our bromine right
over there, draw it right there.

00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:24.450
And actually, let me
erase this little smudge

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.940
and make sure it still
has a negative charge.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.490
So negative charge--
it's a bromide anion now.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.920
And now, let me draw
the everything else.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.290
So I have this carbon.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.540
Let me scroll down a little
bit, so I have some space.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.070
Carbon, I have the
carbon in the back-- CH3.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.320
I have the carbon on top-- CH3.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.940
I have the carbon in
front, like that-- CH3.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.130
And now my oxygen, or I should
say, this molecule right over,

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.420
the water molecule, has
attached to the carbon.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.530
So these two electrons,
you could say,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.800
they've attacked the carbon.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.460
They now form a bond
with the carbon.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.770
So these are those two
electrons in this covalent bond.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.650
And now, let's draw
the rest of this.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.890
So you have oxygen.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.660
You have these two electrons
over here, these two

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.200
valence electrons.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.170
And then you have one hydrogen
and then another hydrogen.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.240
Now, what is going
to be the charge

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.200
right over here on the oxygen?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.735
Well, it had a partial
negative charge,

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:35.360
just because it's
more electronegative.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.360
But it just gave essentially
half of a bond, half of a pair.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.740
Or it's now sharing a
pair with this carbon,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.420
so it's equivalent of giving
up one electron's equivalent

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.130
of charge.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.360
So you would now say
that this thing right now

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.380
has a positive charge.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.480
So you could imagine maybe
another water molecule

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.640
comes along.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.114
Let me draw another water
molecule right over here.

00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:05.530
We're sitting in
water, so there's

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.470
plenty of water molecules.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.430
So another water molecule might
come along and say, OK, well,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.840
this thing right over
here is positive.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.750
But this oxygen is hogging
these bonds a little bit more

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.150
than the hydrogens, especially
now that it's become positive.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:30.070
And so this might give its
pair to a hydrogen proton.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.570
And then this bond
with the hydrogen

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.980
will go entirely to the oxygen.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.230
Let me draw that in
a different color.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:44.420
So this bond right over here
goes entirely to the oxygen.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.220
Electronegativity means if
this is more electronegative

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.990
than that, that
if a bond breaks,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.870
that pair is more likely to
go to the more electronegative

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.440
molecule, or I should say,
the more electronegative atom.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.190
So what will this look like
when all is said and done?

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.350
So let's draw an
arrow like this.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.530
So let me draw my
main molecules.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.310
So I have the carbon.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.480
It bonded to another
carbon right up there.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.385
It bonded to another
carbon right over there.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.630
We have our carbon in
front just like that.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.860
We have the bond
with our oxygen.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.910
So we have our bond with
our oxygen right over there.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.850
So that's our oxygen.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.340
We have this bond
with a hydrogen.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.050
We have this pair.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.100
And now, it has
gained this pair.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.920
It has gained this pair
that was with that hydrogen,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.500
so just like this.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.765
This is now neutral.

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:47.440
It went from being
positive-- over here,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.150
it only had half of this bond.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.120
So it's kind of the equivalent
of one electron charge.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.342
Now, it has a whole bond.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:54.550
So now it has the equivalent.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.850
It literally has both electrons.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.400
So now this thing is neutral.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.510
And now this molecule
right over here

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.150
becomes a hydronium cation.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.440
Let me draw that.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.460
So this is water.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.360
So let me see.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.990
So that's the two
hydrogens right over there.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.600
This is that pair
that is on top.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.150
And now it is sharing this
pair with the hydrogen,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.850
essentially with a proton,
so with this hydrogen

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.530
right over here.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.850
And now, this will
have a positive charge.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.510
This is a hydronium
cation and maybe

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.137
this bumps into
another water molecule

00:10:35.137 --> 00:10:36.470
and does the same thing with it.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.780
And it just keeps
going on and on and on.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.700
And of course, we can't forget
our bromide anion friend.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.620
So there's our
bromide anion friend.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.920
We've got a negative
charge right over there.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.930
And so what are we left with?

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:58.080
Well, we are left with-- well,
there's this hydronium cation.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.480
It's a positive charge.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.920
You have this bromide anion.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.050
And now, what is this
molecule now called?

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.200
Well, we'll go into more
detail in the future.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.170
But when you have a hydroxyl
group attached to the carbon

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.840
backbone, it is an alcohol.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.040
And so our main backbone, once
again, has 1, 2, 3 carbons.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.470
So that tells us prop.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.490
But instead of just saying
propane, it's propanol.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.110
So let's write that down.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:32.200
This is propan-- and some people
say just propanol, generally.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.605
But if we want to be a
little bit particular,

00:11:34.605 --> 00:11:37.922
the hydroxyl group is attached
to the number 2 carbon.

00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:39.130
So we would say, propan-2-ol.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.750
And of course, we still
have this blue methyl group.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:53.990
So we could say 2-methyl--
let me just make this--

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.630
2-methylpropan-2-ol is
what we are left with.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.260
Now, let's think
about what we can

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.620
name this reaction we just saw.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.210
Well, we've just
substituted a bromo group

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.680
with a hydroxyl group.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.290
So I think it's
reasonable to say

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.570
that this is going to be
a substitution reaction.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.470
And we substituted with a--
it was a weak nucleophile,

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.072
but it was a
nucleophile nonetheless.

00:12:23.072 --> 00:12:24.280
So it involved a nucleophile.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.600
But this one, unlike
the Sn2 reaction

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.240
in the rate-determining
step-- and this

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.448
is the rate-determining step.

00:12:34.448 --> 00:12:36.450
This is the slowest
step of the process.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.210
Everything else
will just kind of

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.090
start happening once
this thing happens.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.690
This thing kind of
is in equilibrium.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.490
This is the
rate-determining step.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.740
Only one reactant is involved
in the rate-determining step.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.080
In this case, it
was the bromo group.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.540
So you might guess what
we're going to call it.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.860
It's substitution involving a
nucleophile, so nucleophilic

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.740
substitution.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.020
You can imagine, this
stands for nucleophilic.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.450
And only one
reactant is involved

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.140
in the rate-determining step.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.230
So this right over here, this
whole reaction that we've now

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:22.490
drawn is an Sn1 reaction.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.300
We're now going to
explore one of the most

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.600
fundamental reactions
in organic chemistry.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.370
And first, let's
look at what are

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.340
the things that
are going to react.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.590
So over here, I have
a hydroxide anion.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.980
It has a negative 1 charge,
and that negative charge

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.180
comes from the fact
that oxygen is neutral

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.850
if it has six valence electrons.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.870
But this has 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 plus half

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.790
of this bond with hydrogen.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.830
So you could think of that
as another electron or it's

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.220
share-- it's got
half of these two,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.640
so that's another
electron, which

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.380
gives it a negative 1 charge.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.860
Now, this right over
here, it has one carbon.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.650
I guess, you could
say, in its backbone.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.290
So it's a methane.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.860
And it has a group right over
here consisting of bromine.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.967
So this is bromomethane.

00:14:13.967 --> 00:14:15.550
So let's think a
little bit about what

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.380
might happen under
the right conditions.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.840
So this hydroxide anion, we've
already gone over the fact

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.580
that you can kind of view it as
having an extra electron, which

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.300
gives us its negative charge.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.610
Well, if you have a negative
charged anion like this,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.460
it will be attracted
to positive things.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.730
And one example of a
positive thing is a nucleus.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.760
And so in this
reaction, we are going

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.930
to refer to this hydroxide
anion as the nucleophile.

00:14:48.124 --> 00:14:51.670
Phile literally refers to
things that something likes.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.430
This thing likes--
it's a nucleus lover,

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.690
I guess you could say.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:01.330
And so it might want to share
maybe a pair of electrons

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.710
with a nucleus.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.740
Now, over here, I
have this bromo group

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.860
in the bromomethane.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.490
And bromine is quite
electronegative.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.430
It is more electronegative
than carbon.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.520
So even in this bond--
we have two electrons

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.590
in this bond right
over here-- bromine

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.150
is going to hog the electrons
a little bit more than carbon.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.055
And also, electronegativity
says that if this bond were

00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:28.820
to break, it's more likely
that this pair, the pair that's

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.980
in this bond, is going
to go to the bromine

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.950
than it's going to
go to the carbon.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.680
So the way that this reaction
works-- and it's really

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.430
kind of happening in
one step, and this

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.120
is key to the name
of this reaction,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.690
as we'll see in a second-- is
that this nucleophile right

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.400
over here might say,
hey, let me share.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.740
I've got this extra charge.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.120
Let me share some of that
charge with a nucleus,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.410
in this case, the carbon.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.090
Let me draw it like this.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.590
In this case, the
carbon, so it would

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.100
share this pair, which
would form a bond.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.930
Carbon would have
half of the pair.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.620
Oxygen would have
half of the pair.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.100
So it would share this pair.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.080
It would share this
pair with carbon.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.390
Now, if carbon is now
sharing half of this,

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.710
it's essentially
getting an electron.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.240
It doesn't need this electron,
which bromine is already

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.500
hogging a little bit.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.830
And so bromine would take
this entire pair back.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.330
Whenever we draw full arrows
like this, just normal arrows

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.080
that you're used to
seeing, it's referring

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.590
to the action of pairs.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.440
So this whole pair
is going to bromine.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.390
This pair right over
here is now going

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.000
to be shared with the carbon.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.540
It's going to form a
bond with the carbon.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.840
So when we do both
of these steps,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.830
after both of these steps,
it would look like this.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.120
Let me draw my
bromine first, which

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.050
is now going to become
a bromide anion.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:55.950
So bromine 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, and now it

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:01.540
gets both of these
electrons from this bond.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.810
So it has both of those
electrons right over there.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.867
Now, this will have
a negative 1 charge.

00:17:07.867 --> 00:17:08.700
How do we know that?

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.099
Well, bromine is neutral, when
it has seven valence electrons.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.569
This thing now has eight.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.845
So this now has a
negative charge.

00:17:18.845 --> 00:17:20.470
Now, once again,
let's think about what

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.530
happens to all of this business.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.900
So let me draw my
carbon first, my carbon.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.010
Now, let me draw this
hydrogen that's popping out.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.770
So this hydrogen that's popping
out, let me draw it like that.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.200
So that's the bond,
trying to show

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.130
that's popping out of the page.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.384
So that's that hydrogen.

00:17:37.384 --> 00:17:38.800
I just made them
different colors,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.800
so we can keep track of
the different hydrogens.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.490
Then the hydrogen that's
going into the page, that's

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.050
that one right over there.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.350
And you have this
hydrogen that's going up,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.570
so that hydrogen
right over there.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.380
And now the hydroxide anion
has bonded to this carbon.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.420
Now it will be a hydroxyl group.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.480
So this thing has now bonded.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.440
So let me draw the bond in the
color of these two electrons.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.110
It has now bonded.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.780
So those two electrons
now make up this blur,

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.810
this bond right over here.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:14.790
And now we have our oxygen,
but with those two, these two

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:20.022
right over here, and then
the bond to the hydrogen.

00:18:20.022 --> 00:18:21.230
Now, what just happened here?

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.115
The oxygen is now neutral.

00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:24.290
Why is it neutral?

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.220
Well, it has 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.830
And then it has
half of this bond,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.030
so you could view
that as an electron

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.950
or the equivalent of
an electron charge.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.450
And then it has
half of this bond.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.710
So it has the electron
charge equivalent

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.480
of six valence electrons,
which makes oxygen neutral.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.730
And now bromine is negative.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.938
So one way to think about
is that the negative charge

00:18:41.938 --> 00:18:45.500
has been transferred to the
bromine in this reaction.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.300
Now, in this reaction,
bromine has left.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.340
And that's why we call
this the leaving group.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:58.326
We call this right over here the
leaving group of the reaction.

00:18:58.326 --> 00:18:59.950
This thing right over
here is the thing

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.790
that is going to leave.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.592
That is the leaving group.

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:05.800
Now, the other thing that
you might find interesting,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.510
it looks like kind of
this hydroxide anion--

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.330
some people even say--
attacked this bromomethane.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.630
The bromomethane left.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.900
The bromine left, not
bromomethane left.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.950
It attacked the bromomethane.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.524
The bromine left.

00:19:23.524 --> 00:19:25.440
So in some ways, you'd
say that there's really

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.140
two reactants over here.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.180
You have the hydroxide anion,
and you have the bromide anion.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.440
And this carbon right over
here with the hydrogens,

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.750
this was kind of the thing
that just to some degree

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.360
facilitated the reaction.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.340
This thing bumped
into it and attached,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.760
and then this thing left.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.874
And so in this context,
we would call the carbon

00:19:43.874 --> 00:19:46.290
with a three hydrogens-- we
would call this the substrate.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.510
Now, what should we
call this reaction?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.080
Well one way to think about it
is, we substituted this bromo

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.720
group with a hydroxyl group.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.410
So it might make sense to call
this a substitution reaction.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.695
Substitution has occurred.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.414
Now, what did we
substitute with?

00:20:10.414 --> 00:20:12.080
Well, we substituted
with a nucleophile.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.310
And how many reactants
were involved

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.980
in the rate-determining step?

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.188
And I know that might not
make a lot of sense to you,

00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:27.610
but this had essentially
one determining step.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.680
This had to want to
bump in the right way.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.240
And this would want to have to
leave right at the same time,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.180
or roughly the
same time, in order

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.020
for this reaction to occur.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.070
So this reactant
and this reactant

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.400
were involved in
figuring out, well,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.640
how fast is this
reaction going to happen?

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.202
And we're going to see future
reactions, where you don't have

00:20:47.202 --> 00:20:49.410
both reactants involved in
the rate-determining step.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.000
We'll see only one
reactant involved

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.440
in the rate determining step.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.790
But I'll just write this right
over here-- two reactants

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.620
in rate determining step.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.700
There's a garbage truck outside.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.440
I think the garbage truck
has left now, safe to resume.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.570
So as we were saying,
there are two reactants

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:18.160
involved in the rate
determining step.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.270
And so the shorthand
for this reaction

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:27.720
is to call it an Sn2 reaction.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.970
It's substitution with
a nucleophile, where

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.796
both reactants are involved
in the rate-determining step.
