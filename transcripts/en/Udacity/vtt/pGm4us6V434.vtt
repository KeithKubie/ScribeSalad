00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.530
And what's cool about these unit rates
is I can use them to make decisions.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.530
So let's say I'm comparing Pretzelicious
pretzels to Pretztastic pretzels.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.850
And these are more expensive but
they're a little bigger.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.180
What I really care about is which
one's a better deal, Pretzelicious or

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.150
Pretztastic pretzels.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.410
Compare their unit rates and
choose the best answer.
