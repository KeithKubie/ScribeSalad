00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.944
Top interview tip is do your research.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:08.293
There's nothing worse

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:11.343
than when I've been interviewing candidates

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:12.643
where they've come to the interview

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:14.744
and made a major boo-boo,

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.904
which just told me that they hadn't done any research.

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:18.953
And I'm probably a stickler for research

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:20.295
because as a former journalist,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:22.292
it's something that's kind of core

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:25.223
to what your whole career is about.

00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:27.492
So, yeah, do your research,

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:30.742
and I think from that you'll find confidence

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:33.190
will come quite easily within the interview

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.614
because you're prepared.

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:35.709
So, yeah, be prepared,

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:36.625
do your research,

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.169
and confidence will be the outcome of that.
