[inaudible]

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 1>joining me today is a lawyer,</v>

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.610
a gun rights activists in the host of know are on NRA TV.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.950
Colia no,
are welcome to the Rubin report.
How's it going man?
How's it going?

5
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:18.610
My friends going good.
It's good to be in la.
I am a,
I'm glad to have you on.

6
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:22.330
We've been trying to do this for about a year.
Yeah,
you're a busy man.
Yeah,

7
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:24.700
I just don't like to think so.
It might just be a facade.

8
00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.770
I put it on to avoid people but knowing actually,
but in reality now it's,

9
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.270
it's been,
it's been a pretty busy year.
Yeah.
Like extremely so.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.820
And it doesn't ever seem to slow up and just want to think it does.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.010
Something else jumps off well,

12
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:38.260
if you think coming on this show is going to help slow it down.

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.700
You are sorely mistaken.
Yeah.
Well I'm a bit of a masochist in that regards,

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.070
so we'll see.
We'll see.
By the time this hour he's done work sort of on earth.

15
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.000
Hell,
we can really shine you.
I'm pretty sure there will be some.
Yeah.
Well,

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.910
don't worry because there will be equal amounts on me just for sitting here with

17
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.270
you.
That's the interesting thing.
You know,
it's,

18
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.770
I don't want to say I've been blind to it,
but just being,

19
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.920
just seeing some of the reactions and responses that I got,

20
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:06.370
especially like for instance,
when I was on Mar,
when I,
after I did Bill Maher,

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.671
you know,

22
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:11.050
I saw some of the comments from the other side just for ease of communication.

23
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.410
But for people who normally don't agree with me and his audience,
they were like,

24
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:17.110
oh,
why would you have the NRA guy on there?
Even a,

25
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.360
it was a tweet I responded to yesterday and even though I was on my no tweeting

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.920
deal that I like to put myself on because so toxic in there sometimes.

27
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.410
How often do you do that?
Every 30 minutes.

28
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.310
I'm trying to do weekends disappearing at all of August.
Uh,
see it man.

29
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.310
Twitter's toxic man.
When you're in the lane that you and I are in,

30
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.920
it's toxic man.
And he can really,

31
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.110
even though you don't think you're taking that in,

32
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.680
even when you just kind of scrolling through,
you're taking it in.
Yeah.
You know,

33
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.860
and it's like a constantly up develop as this pattern of just,
yeah,

34
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.670
don't respond to that because they're baiting you.
I mean,

35
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:58.660
and things of that nature.
But,
um,
I,
I saw a tweet and she's like,
yeah,

36
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:02.680
I love Phil Mar.
Oh,
I love this episode,
but you have that in Ira guy on there.

37
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.690
And I'm like,
Jesus,
are we not allowed to have discourse anymore if it,

38
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.740
especially if the disagrees with something that you believe in.
Uh,
and you know,

39
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:14.350
and I was like,
this is a very dangerous road we're going down.
If that's,

40
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.170
if that's going to be the case because you forget,
you know,

41
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.230
we live in this country together and we're not all the same.

42
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.970
There's about 350 million of it.
Yeah.
We might not all think the same thing.

43
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:28.960
Exactly.
Pretty crazy.
It's,
it's ton of sense.
It,
at least for me,

44
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.570
it's a little disheartening.
Um,

45
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.770
because I grew up under the guise and understanding the importance of discourse

46
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.860
and being able to talk things out,
even if you do disagree with someone,

47
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.940
but then even still having the ability to set aside whatever views I may have on

48
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:47.170
a particular issue and then be able to speak with you cordially or have respect

49
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:50.140
for you even though we don't agree that's the way I was brought up.

50
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.440
And so to see the country kind of falling into this ink extremely Detroit like

51
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.190
divisiveness,
it,
it's,
it's a,
it's an,
yeah.
You know,

52
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.280
I don't want to know me and get all emo on you,
but it does,

53
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.240
it was like we don't have the guest cry until the end,
but we can do it this way.

54
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.870
But that's exactly why I wanted to have you on because you are okay going into

55
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:13.870
enemy territory.
I'm not calling this enemy territory,
but you did.

56
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.870
You did marsh show where you knew a certain percentage of the audience was just

57
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:20.080
going to hate you.
And we talked about it briefly right before we started,

58
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.090
but you found mar to be basically pretty,
pretty respected,
even yet open,

59
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.080
even though on policy you probably disagreements with you with 80,
80% of this.

60
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.700
Pretty much.
Yeah.
And you know,

61
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.880
and it was something that I ended up perspecting about him in that regard.

62
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:38.190
Cause like I said,
I kind of,
I went in prepared for war.
I didn't go into do war,

63
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.000
but I went and prepared for it.
You know,

64
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.730
it was like prepare for the worst hope for the best.
Um,

65
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.970
and I'd say I got the best in a sense of it was,
uh,

66
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.920
it was a discourse where he challenged me,
but it wasn't this kind of

67
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.380
tumultuous kind of butting of the heads where would just turn into something

68
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.970
that was just ugly.
Well,
he wasn't trying to get yet.

69
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.250
Try to understand you cause that,
that,
you know,
I'm trying to do that here.

70
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.250
I think there's a couple of other places where people are trying to do that.

71
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:08.680
But yeah,
that's the thing that's been good lost.

72
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.380
And that's an interesting thing you pointed out there.
It's,

73
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.480
I think sometimes people take offense to that idea.
It's like,
well,

74
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.350
I don't want your intruder intriguing.

75
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.510
I think in tree kind of offense people sometimes because it's like we all grow

76
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:23.290
up with a typical understanding of what we expect certain people to be like.

77
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.160
And then when certain things don't fit,
it's like,
hmm,
that's interesting.

78
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.210
How did you get there?
Right.
And I don't,
I think when it's innocent like that,

79
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:32.290
I don't think there's an issue there.

80
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.970
When you use it to try to kind of muscle people into believing a certain thing

81
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.480
based on what they are,
then that's when we start having problems.

82
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.270
You know what I mean?
It's like you see me,
it's like,
how do you,

83
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.180
as a black guy that happened to me when I first started doing what I did with

84
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.330
the NRA,
um,
uh,
Russell Simmons are,
and I'll never forget this.
I was like,

85
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.290
I was like in Virginia Beach,
I think.
Um,
and Russell said,
Aye.
Aye.

86
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.200
Aye did my first sets of videos rolled out with the NRA and I get this tweet

87
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.970
from Russell Simmons and he's like,

88
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.260
how can you as a young black man pushed daddy you,
you know,

89
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.650
the typical rhetoric in that regard,

90
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.920
even though he often is all about trying to get people to,
exactly.

91
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.520
Which was a really,
yeah.
And so I,
you know,
I responded,
I said,
you know,

92
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.960
like I didn't know advocating for self defense and self reliance was a bad
thing.

93
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.060
I didn't know that only non black people were allowed to do that.
You know what,

94
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.790
I'm right.

95
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.790
And so that was kind of like my first foray into that world of wait a minute,

96
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:31.981
people have an expectation of me based on my race that I'm not going to say I

97
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:34.510
was oblivious to,
but it just,

98
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.780
when it was coming from people that look like me as well with the same level of

99
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:44.110
intensity,
that's when I go,
wow.
Okay.
All right.
So here,

100
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.520
that's what this is.
Yeah.

101
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.880
So I wanna I wanna back up to a little bit of childhood and growing up cause

102
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.130
your evolutions,
conditioning.
But Let,

103
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:52.570
let's just say with this for one second because I think there's something really

104
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.500
interesting about that thing right there that often if you listen to the media,

105
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.550
they'll you that that police are hunting down black men and all of this and then

106
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:04.250
at the same time you're saying,
well,

107
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:08.000
we should be able to arm ourselves and protect ourselves from the white

108
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.740
supremacists to whoever,
whoever doing that,

109
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.510
but meaning that lawfully and legally we should be able to take care of

110
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:17.900
ourselves.

111
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.290
If you believe that the system is so corrupt and the police are so corrupt and

112
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.060
there's racists running around everywhere,

113
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.770
you're trying to bring the power back to yourself.

114
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.440
That's to me that's very empowering.

115
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.370
Yet somehow this seemingly is lost when this conversation hits the mainstream.

116
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.450
It's amazing.
I don't understand it.

117
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.580
It's like in one breath you're talking about let's,

118
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.200
let's take the current administration for instance,

119
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.270
like don't paint it as this the most vicious and valving on the planet,

120
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.770
and then it's like,

121
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.550
well then let's give the same guns that you have for your own self reliance.

122
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:52.100
I would you would use to protect yourself against this monster that you've said

123
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.240
existed and let's give it to them and then place your entire alliance.

124
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:58.130
And with respect to your safety on the same people you,
I,

125
00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:01.910
you're telling me I should be scared of it doesn't look horrible.

126
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.290
Give him your weapons.
What again,
just it's,

127
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.350
it's mindblowing.
Right?
And so what it does though,

128
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:12.310
it exposes this notion that the,

129
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.230
there's an absence of ability to,

130
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.470
I don't want to say by ability or people just choosing not to critically think.

131
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.600
And we're at a point now where we have access and I tell people,
it's like,

132
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.910
it amazes me some of the questions that I get.

133
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.630
And it's like you literally have a device that gives you access to all of the

134
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:36.560
information in the world and it's in your pocket.

135
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.050
And in the case of my overabundant tasks,
I have two of them.
Right?
And it's like,

136
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:43.280
it takes you right into phones.
You,

137
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:46.840
I assume you have like eight guns on you at all.
You write those rifles,

138
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.250
some here,
so.
Right.
You know,
and it's,

139
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.420
it's amazing how when we have such access to so much information,

140
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.820
we've become so lazy at reaching for it.

141
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.910
This was almost like back in the day when we didn't have this access,

142
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.840
we were more adamant about search searching and seeking it out and critically

143
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:06.890
thinking about things.
It's almost,
we become too fast for our own good.
Right.

144
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.350
So the obsession now is instant information,

145
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.000
instant information regardless of whether or not the information is of any use

146
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.680
or good or if or if that's even correct.
Yeah.
You know,
and so it's,

147
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.420
I hate it cause you know,
I,
I blogged,

148
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:23.930
I've done all of those things and actually get people to get mad at me when I

149
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:25.820
don't jump on a certain issue quick enough.

150
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.660
And when I say Cook enough within 30 seconds,

151
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.200
the second I'll see that sometimes then goes down in the news and uh,

152
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.210
literally two minutes go by or I'm at dinner and I wasn't looking at my phone

153
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.660
and then I'll get a slew of tweets.
People,
wow,
I see you didn't comment on that.

154
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.390
You must be an article.
Could God paid off,

155
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.960
God forbid it involves a black person and there's a gun within 10 miles,

156
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.320
I have to jump on it.
Yeah.
You know,
and,
and there are some cases,

157
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.030
I understand there are some people who do,

158
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.180
who are just now getting into this who are just now getting into firearms and

159
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:55.070
they are black.
Right.
And you know,

160
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.770
they look to me for understanding and direction cause I've been doing it for so

161
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:01.260
long so that I understand.
Um,
but,
but other people,

162
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:04.500
it's just this constant desire to be like,
Aha,
I got you.

163
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.130
I knew you were Kuhn kind of deal.
Right.
And it's like,

164
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.560
like give me 30 seconds to even read the article you just sent me 10 seconds
ago.

165
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.380
Right.
And then from there,
and then not to mention,
you know,

166
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.590
there's a thing called work that I do.
So yeah,
I'm still doing that as well.

167
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.560
So I'm,
you know,
I'm juggling a lot of things.
I don't have to tell you,

168
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:25.740
you probably have to be 10 more articles to even ascertain anything close to the

169
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.870
truth.
Bingo.
And that's the one thing that I,
a lot,

170
00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:31.950
I think a lot of people don't do.
And I almost tweeted that the other day.
I go,

171
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.030
you know,
it's very dangerous to read headlines,

172
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:39.360
especially in the day and age of clickbait titles,

173
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.520
to just read headlines and then make an opinion based off of that or think you

174
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:46.680
know and understand what happened at a particular story.

175
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.570
Because there are so many articles that I've read about me and what I've said

176
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.190
where the headline said one thing and to cover their asses within the article,

177
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.460
they'll clarify exactly what they,
what it is that I said,

178
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.340
but they're banking on the idea that people were just going to read the

179
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:06.360
headlines and then run with that.
And so it ends up making a fool of you.

180
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.480
I'm full of people.
Well what's your personal policy on that?

181
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.110
About how to respond to that?
Do you go all in on the fight?
Do you and your it,

182
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.470
cause I,
this has happened to me in Rochester in the last week.
Daily be said.

183
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:20.820
I was all right.
Cheerleader that correct me if I'm wrong here.
You're black.

184
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.960
I think so.
How am I doing for the,
for an orange juice,
you suck.

185
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.240
No.
Well I mean,
but this is the level of pity.

186
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.040
But then it's about how much time do you want to invest in,

187
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.220
in defending yourself and by doing that defense,

188
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:37.770
do you just add intensity to the people going,

189
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:40.740
I see we can get them to defend himself.
And then before you know it,

190
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:44.520
your whole life is dedicated to defending yourself from fake attacks rather than

191
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:47.820
doing the work that you care about.
Well two things.
One,

192
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.940
they do it to you cause you're dangerous.
You're dangerous.

193
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:54.210
Not Because you agree with me in certain,
in certain issues,

194
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.750
you're dangerous in the fact that you're just simply willing to talk to me.

195
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.750
So for,
it's the same thing happen.
When I did,

196
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.100
I did the interview with killer Mike.
Right?
They jumped all over him.

197
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.780
Not because of what he said,

198
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.530
but just because he sat down and had the conversation with me half the time they

199
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:12.900
don't even listen.
Oh,
that's,
that's interesting.

200
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.300
Getting pointed out because I was talking to my friend,
I'm like,
I'm like,

201
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.250
how can anyone watch this interview and not walk away with saying,
you know,

202
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.780
that was a great conversation with two people who don't agree on everything,

203
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.450
but there's some things we were grilling is like,
cause they don't watch it.

204
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.260
That tells like,
what do you mean?
It's like I had this,
this weird blonde moment,

205
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:32.490
right?
Yeah.
I'm like,
what do you mean?
He's like,
they didn't watch it.
He's like,

206
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.350
they don't actually watch the video.

207
00:11:34.351 --> 00:11:37.620
They just read the title and then assume they know what happened in the video

208
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.560
and to make their opinion from there.
And I'm like,
damn,
you're right.

209
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.860
I hate going down in the weeds with too much in this because it feels like we're

210
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:46.740
just responding to all of the craziness.
But even in the,

211
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.970
even in like the youtube ecosystem.
Yeah.
When we put videos up,

212
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:55.960
sometimes within 10 seconds there's a hundred comments and that was an hour
away.

213
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.890
I want that time machine because I would be a lot more productive.

214
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.210
But it's always the haters that that's why I won't bring it up cause it,

215
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.730
cause then that hate is the thing that's always leading us.

216
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.670
And then I think that brings it back to where you started a moment ago,

217
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.410
which is that we're in this polarized thing and it's because the haters are,

218
00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:16.720
are sort of paving the road and everyone else is just going down the road.

219
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.300
I think a few of us are actually trying to better road that more of us can get.

220
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.440
I,
the interesting thing about the discourse the way it is now,
right?

221
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.410
And so our politics have become our entertainment.

222
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.820
That's the one that's the dangerous aspect,
right?
So if it's not vitriolic,

223
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:36.160
if it's not snarky,
if it's not any of those things,

224
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.420
it people don't pay attention to it.
And I'm the biggest advocate of like,

225
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.730
all right,
look if you,
if you don't agree with me on something,

226
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.990
you don't have to be an ass about it right now.
Can I be snarky?
Hell yeah.

227
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.800
You know,
I,
I can absolutely be Saki,
but what I,

228
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:52.840
what I tried to do to respond to the initial question you asked me about how do

229
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.870
I,
like,
how do I go all in?
Do I respond?
So like for instance,
on Twitter,

230
00:12:55.871 --> 00:13:00.871
what I've kind of held myself back to doing now is if I can tell that the person

231
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.610
is literally seeking out an answer or response,

232
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.540
that's I'm going to give them that same energy in terms of,
okay,
no,
let's,

233
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.520
let's have that conversation.
Right?

234
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.590
Because there was a point in time where everything I responded to when I respond

235
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:17.980
to it through the lens of just being this snarky as,
you know what I mean?

236
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.220
And Yeah,
sure.
It was,
I entertaining myself.
Absolutely.

237
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.020
But then I had to ask myself,

238
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:25.270
was I really moving and conversation and the dialogue along,

239
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.670
even though it is Twitter,
it's Twitter,
it's a dumpster fire,
right?

240
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.010
But what I started,
it has some importance,
does just the truth.

241
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.560
That's why it keeps coming up in so many of these conversations.

242
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.230
We've got high level people with great minds that are open and engaging,

243
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.940
that are still involved in the stupidity of that.
So it's like,

244
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.820
I always feel guilty when I bring it up with the guests more.
It's like,

245
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:48.790
I don't want to touch that thing again.
And then on the other hand,

246
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:50.650
we all know it's real.
You know,
it just,

247
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.100
it just is whether we want it to be or not.
Like you said,
whether we like,
Nah,

248
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.450
this the meeting of expression right now.
Um,
and so we have to,
if they're,

249
00:13:57.451 --> 00:14:01.510
you know,
just like either adapt or die,
you know,
but you know,
it's,

250
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.440
it's,
I try,
I try to be what it is.

251
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:07.570
I tried to be the opposite of what I complain about.

252
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.850
At least I try in terms of like,

253
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.390
sometimes I'll see snarky messages and then I'll respond by trying to be

254
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:15.250
reasonable.
I say,
okay,
I get it.

255
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.190
You don't like me but answer this question for me.

256
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.840
And I tried to move the dialogue along.
No,
it isn't happening to,

257
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.680
it gets deleted.
Yeah.
Almost every single time.
Yeah.

258
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.790
The second you shed a little light on it.
Grad scatter.
Yup.
What is the,
uh,

259
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.490
before we dive too much into your past,

260
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.610
what is the thing that they're criticizing you most for?

261
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:40.900
Like you come across to me as a pretty rational,
decent open guy.

262
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.410
You're trying to empower yourself.
Okay.

263
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.170
So what is it that they're always going after you?

264
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.500
Is it that thing that the black men shouldn't be for guns?
I mean,

265
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.690
is it that simply stupid?
So I'm like,
so I don't,

266
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:56.660
I'm not gonna be so naive as to assume it's simply just because I'm black and

267
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:59.390
I'm in the guns.
They are already thinking holds up.
That's part of it.

268
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:02.570
That's a big part of it is just aligning myself in the organization that they

269
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:07.160
seemingly,
that they see as being a racist organization that hates black people.

270
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.930
Okay.
We're going to talk plenty about the NRA,
right?

271
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.830
So there's that element of it.
But then there's,

272
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.140
there is also this idea that being a young black man,

273
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.650
that I am supposed to run from guns because of the projected image that we've

274
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.770
all had forced down our throats with respect to black men in firearms in this

275
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:29.060
country for decades.
You know,
black man with a gun,
he's a thug,

276
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:33.470
he's a drug dealers and gang banger period.
So now when I,

277
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.120
um,
young attorney educated,
um,

278
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.650
open minded and you know,

279
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:43.640
with respect to different issues and then I'm pushing the narrative of the

280
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:47.960
second amendment,
it sets off an explosive level of cognitive dissonance.

281
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.610
And people who have what I love this quote and I believe was Bush who said it,

282
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.810
the soft bigotry of low expectations,
right?

283
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.290
And it,
they hate it.

284
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:06.110
They hate it the same way they hate you now because you can't control someone

285
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:10.760
who's willing to think independently outside of what a stereotypically expected

286
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:14.050
of you.
Right?
Um,
and that's what the lady was coming in.
And so it was like,
Yo,

287
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.100
do progressive,
you're liberal,
you know,
so,
so for tone,

288
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.890
but you still have that ability to step outside of that and say,
you know what?

289
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:21.110
Let me let me,
okay,
I can see that perspective.

290
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:23.810
That's dangerous for people who want to control people.

291
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.380
So when I want to control the way you think,
the way you see yourself,

292
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.880
I cannot allow you to develop it and ability to think independently on separate

293
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:36.350
issues because then I can't control you.
So if I,
if I say,
you know what,

294
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.770
I can do everything for you depend on me.

295
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.760
The last thing I want you to do and understand is,
you know what?
Wait a minute.

296
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:45.230
You mean to tell me I could protect myself?

297
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.020
You mean to tell me I don't have to depend on calling a cop in order to come

298
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:51.770
save me if someone does try to break into my house because then I can't control

299
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:52.604
you.

300
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.290
I can't own your vote because what the gun has done for me and a lot of people,

301
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.190
it serves as a catalyst for the awakening of a lot of people don't understand.

302
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:06.080
You know what,
I can do more for myself than I realize,
you know?
And once that,

303
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:09.980
once that spark is set off than a lot of things,
you start to realize,
you know,

304
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:12.740
I don't,
you know,
what maybe,
you know,
not on,

305
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.870
I'm holding myself to a different level of accountability.

306
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.030
Maybe I might try to do this on my own,
you know,
it doesn't just feel good.

307
00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:20.930
I mean,
putting aside,

308
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:23.870
I know a lot of people are into facts over feelings these days,
right?

309
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:28.871
Shapiro but doesn't that statement right there that that you can do more for

310
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:32.620
yourself?
It just feels good.
It feels amazing.

311
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.050
Some power back to yourself and going the government or you,

312
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:40.820
whoever you are that are not in charge of of my life,
my responsibility,

313
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:42.710
my livelihood,
and my family.
The rest of it,

314
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.630
it's the most invigorating feeling in the world.
And I'm with you.

315
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:51.380
I'm all about facts,
feelings,
and I'm mean it from the standpoint,

316
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.240
I don't allow my feelings to dictate the facts,
you know,

317
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.930
I do think feelings are necessary,
right?
Cause we,

318
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.860
cause within the absence of them,
we just become cold,
calculated creatures,
right.

319
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.130
And we are still human.
We are,
you know what I mean?
So it's like now at least,

320
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.160
right.
So,
you know,
when I talk about the issue of firearms,

321
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:12.330
I do actively try to inquire.
I was,

322
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:16.800
I was having a discussion with a lady not too long ago about just general

323
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:20.940
firearm issues with respect to her son,
right?
Who's young,
black man.

324
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.020
And I asked her,
you know,
like,

325
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.650
are you fearful of the idea of him carrying a gun and so forth and so on.

326
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.360
And I have to bring myself back when I'm having a discussion with someone like

327
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:34.170
that because I don't have kids.
Right.
So yeah.

328
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.490
And my godfather that,
yeah.
So,
and,
and I,
and I,
and I love her,

329
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:42.300
but it's not the same for a woman who has a son.

330
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.980
So I have to be cognizant of that and understand what goes into that.

331
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:49.660
When she's thinking about whether or not she,
he,

332
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.740
she's okay with him owning a firearm.
And,
and then on top of that,

333
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:57.000
having this idea that her son is more likely to get killed by a cop because he

334
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:59.670
has a gun on him versus when he doesn't,
you know,

335
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.730
and that's where the feeling component comes in where it's necessary.

336
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:07.710
I think you,
if you can't sympathize with that,
then it makes you dismissive.

337
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.670
And so then that person can't relate to you,
then we can have that conversation.

338
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.590
You know what I mean?
And that comes from personal experience.
Absolutely.
Cause,

339
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.280
uh,
when I was reading your bio there,
I mean,

340
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.540
it's really interesting stuff about how you evolved sort of politically and

341
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:23.950
personally,
but when you started getting into guns,
you kind of hide,

342
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.290
had to hide it from your mom either.

343
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.000
So everyone actually a little bit about growing up and then sort of your kind of

344
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.020
politics and then how do we have,
we gotcha.
So I've,

345
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.290
I grew up largely a closet anti gunner.
I didn't realize I was,

346
00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:40.200
I gonna to the wall.
There was one present,
right?

347
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.780
I wasn't kind of rapidly running out,
running out,
screaming,

348
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:45.840
I hate guns or anything like that.
But when a woman was president,

349
00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:49.040
I remember there's one moment,
um,
when I was in college,
I had a roommate,
um,

350
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.550
one of her friends brought a gun over.
I was like,

351
00:19:50.551 --> 00:19:52.550
you need to get the hell on my part.
You can get the hell out of my,

352
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.990
out of my apartment.
And,
um,

353
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.980
had a good friend of mine who randomly just asked me,
hey,

354
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.060
do you want to go to the range?

355
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.310
Never even thought about it and ever even crossed my mind,

356
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.060
which is how I know a lot of times I can decipher based on certain comments

357
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:11.061
whether or not somebody is actually coming from a place of ignorance or place of

358
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:16.370
understanding.
Because I was at guy never even thought about going to raise,

359
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:17.550
never thought about shooting gun,

360
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.880
but could tell you all the opinions in the worldwide.
And like,
right.

361
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.360
And so when I hear that rhetoric now,
I can usually point it out and I'm like,

362
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:27.570
you've never shopped before.
You've never even held a gun before.

363
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.700
And so from that perspective,

364
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:32.700
we went to the gun range and a shot for the first time and I was hooked.

365
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.600
Now I was hooked,
not from a political standpoint now,

366
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.750
not even from an empowering,
oh my God,
I can protect myself now standpoint,

367
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.910
it was just pure fascination with the mechanics,
the physics,
all of it.
Um,

368
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.520
I'm very kind of like curious mind.
So for me it was like kind of like this,

369
00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:52.000
like the idea that I'm launching a project out faster than the speed of sound

370
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.170
and a little target,
like hundreds of yards away.
Like that was awesome.

371
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.900
So first shy,
you were hooked.
First shot,
terrified the second side.

372
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.890
So it was like 11 for love,
his second shot.
Right,
right.
Um,

373
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.680
so from that perspective after,
so after that,
I just,

374
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.250
I follow that rabbit all the way down the hall,
but it was,
like I said,

375
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:12.640
it was more from a scientific,
mechanical understanding of it.

376
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.040
Then as time went on,

377
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.630
then I started looking at it from more intellectual,
second amendment,

378
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:24.160
political activist standpoint.
And then I started my,

379
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:28.330
then the lawyer mind kicked in and they,
and I started looking at,
I'm like,

380
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.040
I'm hearing something.
Then we,
cause we,
during the time period,

381
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.090
that particular time period we had a couple of pretty big mass shootings that

382
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:36.430
happened and so I started paying it then.
So I'm now,

383
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:39.010
I'm paying attention more to this kind of like when you're thinking about buying

384
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:40.990
a car and you never see it on the road.

385
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:42.940
And then once you start thinking about buying you see it everywhere.

386
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.680
That was pretty much what happened now.
So I'm like,

387
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:49.210
I'm hearing the conversation about guns everywhere now and I'm like none of this

388
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:52.900
is making any sense logically.
Like what people are proposing.
It doesn't,

389
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.210
it was so pure,
it wasn't like an agenda driven.

390
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:59.410
It's like this doesn't make sense to me.
It's like a window.

391
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.870
Like a sticker on the window is not going to stop somebody from bringing a gun

392
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:03.970
in there saying that it's illegal.

393
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.070
You mean the sign that says [inaudible] not going to read the sign and be like,

394
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.440
oh exactly right.

395
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.660
So that's Kinda when I started jumping into the more activist advocate side of

396
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:21.730
things.
Um,
with respect to the second amendment.
Yeah.
And when you first got guns,

397
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.260
yeah.
You were literally hiding them.
I was from your mind.
Cause cause,

398
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.560
cause she was very much let me,
she was a single parent mom raising a black son.

399
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.890
She wanted to port every stereotype on the planet.
Right.

400
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.490
My mom over compensated with me tremendously because she under,

401
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:41.470
she understood in her mind the limitations that come with being a woman,

402
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.630
raising a man by herself.
So she overcompensated.

403
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.800
So where it's like usually typically have like mama's boys who were just kind of

404
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:51.010
like,
mom does everything for her.
She can do shit.
She was just like,

405
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.700
go wash your own clothes,
come here and go do everything.
She made me and I,

406
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.560
at the time I just thought she was just being a mean mom.
Right.
Not Realizing,

407
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:02.590
you know,
it was her overcompensating from the standpoint of like,

408
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:06.520
I gotta make this dude,
I gotta raise a man.
Right.
And so,

409
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.660
but so she was trying to buck.
So I knew once I started getting into guns,
no,
no,

410
00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:16.000
no,
no.
Because the perception was black man with gun gang banger.

411
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.020
Right.
And you know,
she had some insecurities and that she was like,
you know,

412
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.360
like they're going to come a point where I'm not going to be to control this
kid.

413
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.160
I don't know what it's going to be doing.

414
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.410
And so I didn't want to terrify her and make her think that I was living some of

415
00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:30.820
the Ferriss lifestyle that she,

416
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.750
and it was almost in a way to protect her more than was to hide it from my side

417
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.470
because I didn't want her to feel like she,
like she failed as a mother.

418
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.710
And so I knew if she saw the AK 47 that I had hidden under my bed,
in her mind,

419
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:48.110
she knows about guns.
All she knows is what she sees in the media.

420
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:52.370
And we all were like we had touched upon before,
that imagery is not positive.

421
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.590
So she comes home,
sees AK 47 in the bed.
She's like,

422
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.920
oh my God,
my son is a gang banger first to sit under the bed.
I said in the bed.

423
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:02.910
Is there anything you want to tell me here?
We talk about that later.

424
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.520
[inaudible] I already bought it as I did this kind of embarrassing because you

425
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:11.060
know both basketball fans,
I used to sleep with my basketball.
Oh yeah.
Oh Man.

426
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:14.120
Yeah,
ball was life.
That was everything.
Now you've still got any skills?

427
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.350
I don't know some,
some,
yeah,
I think that was something.

428
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.090
So I'm actually working on trying to for the next NRA annual meetings put

429
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:24.080
together like a to a charity.
Basketball on it.
If you're down.

430
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.520
Can I get in on that?
Let's do it.
All right,
let's do it.
But,
uh,

431
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.500
I've never slept with my guns though.
That was an odd phrase.
All right.
Okay.

432
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.070
So,
so from that point when you started getting okay with this and now you're

433
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:39.970
exploring it,
as you said intellectually,
yeah.

434
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.720
How long before you were really an advocate for this stuff because you always

435
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:48.670
sort of wanted to fight for something.
Yes.
The theme with you,
he was deaf.

436
00:24:48.671 --> 00:24:50.990
That that's what I wanted to do.
I wanted to be an advocate.

437
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:54.350
I wanted to be in the courtroom defending people.
That's,
that was my goal.

438
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.210
Like even to the detriment of my grades.

439
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:59.120
Like I focused more on like my mock trial stuff when I was in law school.

440
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:03.190
Then I did my actual work,
like the like schoolwise right.
And um,

441
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.910
I liked being divorced for people.

442
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:07.720
I like being able to speak to people who can articulate certain things away that

443
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:12.740
maybe I can,
and I never saw this cold going your way that it did,

444
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.090
but I'm doing exactly what I always wanted to do.
And,

445
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.310
and for me with the gun thing,

446
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.180
I remember being in like I'd be in like class in law school and the way that

447
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.720
they,
like the seats are staggered.
They're like stadium seats,
right?

448
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.150
So if I'm on my computer and you're behind me,

449
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:33.420
you can see what I'm doing on my computer.
And like I'd be in class and like,
um,

450
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.910
research and guns and stuff like that.
Right.
And Yeah,
all man.
Oh Dude,

451
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.530
like people.
And the thing is,

452
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:42.300
a lot of things that were being said about me I didn't even know about till

453
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.040
later on.
People were concerned.
Yeah.
Like really?
Like Yo,
it's like,

454
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.770
yeah,
he's like disease.
He's straight.
He's not doing anything crazy.
He's not,

455
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.010
you know,
um,
and uh,
I get it if you don't,

456
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:58.790
if you're not into that kind of thing,
um,
and you don't follow it,

457
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.200
the idea of how being passionate about something you perceive to be,
uh,
uh,

458
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:05.690
a tool that used for killing people and only killing people.

459
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.400
It's going to seem a little odd to you.
But because I came to it so naturally,

460
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:14.630
so organically without any of that,
it just made sense in my mind.

461
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:18.830
I was so unapologetic about it once I got over being apologetic about it,

462
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.640
that I didn't push it in people's faces.
But you know,
there was a,

463
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:23.450
there was even a time,

464
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.470
like that's how my Instagram got started was me separating.

465
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.670
So the people who followed me up until that point,
you know,

466
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.600
I had a girlfriend at the time,
it was like,
you know,

467
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.680
we get a lot of questions from people,
you know,

468
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.690
kind of tone down the gun stuff a little bit.
Um,
and it was,

469
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:42.740
it was kind of an innocent,
you know,
thing.
But I never really,
I just said,

470
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:43.574
you know,
forget it.

471
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.110
I'm just going to set up a whole nother page and I'm just going to do all the

472
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:49.620
gun stuff I want to do on that page.
Yeah.
Um,
and then now that's taken over.

473
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:51.350
I have,
I don't even use the other one.

474
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.230
I don't even know if I remember the password,
but it,
and so from there,

475
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.210
that's where things really started taking off.
And then with the in,

476
00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.130
and then when I started,
because I started doing gun reviews.

477
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.150
And so then from there when I got into the political component of it,

478
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:08.100
then I started talking to doing my commentary,

479
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.770
and then that's when things started really taking off.

480
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:13.210
<v 0>Oh.</v>
