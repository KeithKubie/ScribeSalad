After 3 seconds, the ball will be right here. Well, if you got those result, I am very impressed.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You have an amazing intuition about the motion of objects.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If, like me, you didn't get this question right the first time you tried,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
let's look at this as a motivation for why we want to quantify motion.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of quantifying motion,

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we should probably agree on some terms first.
