00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.491
Based on what we've done
in the last 2 videos

00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:03.405
we've been able to figure out

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:05.913
what the marginal revenue curve looks like

00:00:05.913 --> 00:00:07.494
for the monopolist year,

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:09.536
for the monopolist in the orange market

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:10.744
and this is what we got.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.574
Right over here, it
was a line with a slope

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:17.235
twice as steep as the
slope of the demand curve,

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:19.269
we'll see that's actually generalizable.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.866
There's an optional video

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.081
that I'll do very shortly

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.078
where I prove it with a
little bit of calculus.

00:00:24.078 --> 00:00:25.938
It's very important to realize

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:27.405
that this marginal revenue curve

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.940
looks very different than
the marginal revenue curve

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.407
if we were dealing with
perfect competition.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.269
If we were dealing with
perfect competition

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.003
there would be some
equilibrium price in the market

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.204
and all of the competitors

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.245
would essentially just
have to take that price.

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:43.412
Let's say that that equilibrium
price was $3 per pound

00:00:43.412 --> 00:00:46.681
then our marginal revenue
curve would look like this

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.188
if we were not a monopolist,

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:51.398
if we were one of the
many perfect competitors.

00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:52.768
I guess you could view it that way.

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:54.735
Because we would just
have to take that price.

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:56.268
If we wanted to sell 1000 pounds,

00:00:56.268 --> 00:00:59.939
each of those pounds we
would get $3 per pound

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.466
and then if we want to sell 1001,

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.268
we'll just get $3 per
pound for the next one.

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:04.604
It doesn't change.

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:06.275
We're just taking that price.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.602
With the monopolist things do change

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:12.432
because we are the only
producer in the market.

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:15.075
The price at which we can get changes

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.203
depending on what we produce

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:19.102
because we are the entire
supply for the market

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:20.868
and we have this downward sloping

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:22.280
marginal revenue curve.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.808
Now, with that out of the way,

00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:26.434
let's think about what will
be the optimal quantity

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:30.022
for us to produce if we
wanted to maximize profit?

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.535
If we think in pure economic terms,

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:33.344
that's what firms try to do.

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:37.535
They exist to maximise profit.

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.399
To do that, we're going
to have to think about,

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.463
and remember, it's not
to maximize revenue.

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:43.151
To maximize revenue we would have said,

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:45.160
"Oh, they should just
produce 3000 pounds."

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.658
It's not about maximizing revenue,

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:48.410
it's about maximizing profit.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.329
We have to take the
cost into consideration.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.034
To do that, we'll have to
draw a marginal cost curve.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.207
Let's say I did the research.

00:01:55.207 --> 00:01:56.667
Let's say we're the owners of this firm

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.141
and we have a marginal cost curve

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:01.075
that looks something like this.

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:04.139
Let's say our marginal
cost curve looks like this.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.097
It's important to realize,
we are the market.

00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:08.303
We are the only producers here.

00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:10.070
This isn't just our marginal cost curve.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.884
This is a marginal cost
curve for the market.

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:13.340
Another way to think about it,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.271
this is the supply curve for the market.

00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:16.600
It tells you at any given price

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.672
how much the market is willing to supply.

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:19.735
You could view it as a marginal cost

00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:22.087
or you could view it as a supply curve

00:02:22.087 --> 00:02:23.136
and we've talked about it before.

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:26.005
You could view a supply curve
as a marginal cost curve.

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:29.720
If you want the market
to produce 1 extra pound,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.142
what's the minimum price
you would have to give?

00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:33.736
that is the marginal cost.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.339
Now, with this out of the way,

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.002
let's think about what you would produce.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.301
Well, you would definitely
want to produce something

00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:43.551
you definitely start to produce
a few pounds right over here

00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.672
because the marginal
revenue you're getting

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.675
is way above your marginal cost.

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:50.469
Each incremental pound you're
producing right over here,

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.219
you're getting much more revenue,

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.537
you're getting $5 or $6 of revenue

00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:56.469
and it's only costing you
a little over a dollar.

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.138
It's like, "Okay, I'm
going to keep producing.

00:02:58.138 --> 00:02:59.266
"I'm going to keep producing."

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.402
Over here, you're still,

00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:02.387
each incremental unit you're getting,

00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:04.203
you're still getting more revenue

00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:06.139
than the cost of that incremental unit.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.608
That keeps being true all the way

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:14.354
until you get to 2000
pounds right over here.

00:03:14.354 --> 00:03:15.854
At this point right over here

00:03:15.854 --> 00:03:18.452
you don't want to produce
an incremental unit

00:03:18.452 --> 00:03:20.044
because if you produce one more unit,

00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:24.363
if you produce that 2001st
pound right over here

00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:26.386
then for that 2001st pound,

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:28.789
your cost is going to be slightly higher

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.387
than the revenue you get in.

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:32.785
You will actually take
a slight loss on that.

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.855
Your total profit will start to go down

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:37.939
and you don't want to
produce less than this

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.523
because you'll be leaving a
little money on the table.

00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:41.657
You'll be leaving that
little incremental pound

00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:43.978
where the total revenue
was just slightly higher,

00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:47.194
or the marginal revenue
on that incremental pound

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.725
was just slightly higher
than your marginal cost

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:50.746
on that incremental pound.

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:54.121
You will produce right over there.

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.054
Now, this is interesting

00:03:56.054 --> 00:03:59.716
because this is a different equilibrium,

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:02.117
or I guess we say this
is a different price

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.451
or this is a different price and quantity

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:06.529
than we would get

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.055
if we were dealing with
perfect competition.

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:11.054
If we were dealing with
perfect competition,

00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:13.356
our equilibrium price and quantity

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:16.187
would be where our supply
and demand curves intersect.

00:04:16.187 --> 00:04:17.860
It would be right over here.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.325
It would be a price of $3 per pound

00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:22.586
and a quantity of 3000 pounds.

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:25.089
Now, in order to maximize profit,

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:28.323
we are intersecting between
the marginal revenue curve

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:31.669
or our quantity that we want to produce

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.656
as the monopolist

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:35.260
is the intersection between
our marginal revenue curve

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.588
and our marginal cost curve

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:37.671
which is right over here.

00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:40.337
So we can see that there
is a dead weight loss.

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:44.056
There is a dead weight
loss by being a monopoly

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:45.012
although it's good for us.

00:04:45.012 --> 00:04:46.009
It's good for the monopolist,

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.460
it's not good for a society
at least in this example

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.191
and there's very few where
I can imagine it being good

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:51.857
but I guess there are a few

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:54.065
if you're trying to protect
the national industry

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:55.266
or something like that.

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.403
Over here, this is the quantity

00:04:57.403 --> 00:04:59.428
that we are deciding to produce.

00:04:59.428 --> 00:05:05.089
The consumer surplus is
the area above the price

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:06.428
and below the demand curve.

00:05:06.428 --> 00:05:10.878
This right over here is
the consumer surplus.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.078
The producer surplus
is looking pretty good

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.828
and this is essentially what
we're trying to optimize.

00:05:15.828 --> 00:05:18.855
Our producer surplus is this whole area.

00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:21.746
Our producer surplus is this whole area

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:23.244
right over here.

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:25.328
Producer surplus right over there.

00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:26.994
But we have a dead weight cost.

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.417
There's a total surplus
that we would have gotten,

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:31.415
that society would have gotten

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:35.250
if we were dealing with
perfect competition,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.592
right over here that's now being lost.

00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:40.457
But as we lose that, we were able to

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:42.005
increase the producer surplus

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:43.844
and decrease the consumer surplus.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:47.726
Beyond just having this
dead weight loss over here,

00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:50.123
it's also obviously given much more value

00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:51.837
to the producer, to the monopolist

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:55.837
and given much less value to the consumer.
