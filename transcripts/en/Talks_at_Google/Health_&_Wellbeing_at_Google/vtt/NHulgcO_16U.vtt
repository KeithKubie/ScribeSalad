[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.410
ED FINKLER: My
name is Ed Finkler.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.300
Like I said, thanks Josh
for that great introduction

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.970
and for getting me up here.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.790
We go back a little
ways, so it was nice.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.280
And I'll try not to tell any
terrible stories about him

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.390
in his young age and the
music we used to write.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.942
So anyway, yeah, my
name is Ed Finkler

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:26.150
and this is a talk, stronger
than fear, mental health

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.040
in the developer community.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.794
So who am I?

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.460
Well, you heard a
little bit about that.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.160
But at a basic level I'm a dad.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.250
I'm a husband.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.260
I'm a developer type.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.360
I've been a developer for a long
time, an occasional musician,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.252
kind of a big ultra
nerd, like nerdy stuff.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.210
I have a very large
collection of vintage video

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.610
games in my basement, to
the chagrin of my family.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.730
But I also have
a mental illness.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.250
Or actually I have a couple.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.530
I have two I've
been diagnosed with.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.030
They called that
co-morbidity, which

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.946
sounds like you're going
to be murdered twice.

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:02.902
But it just means that
you have two things.

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:07.240
And I'm just a lay person here.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.740
I'm not a doctor
or a psychologist

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.834
or mental health
professional of any kind.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.250
I'm certified in something
called mental health first aid.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.833
And I'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:17.230
But I'm here to
talk about what it's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.930
like to have a mental
illness from my perspective,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.290
my perspective as a kind
of a regular person,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.450
as a developer,
as somebody who's

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.500
worked as a tech professional
for the last 20 years,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.140
and also talk about how
mental health effects

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.680
our community and our industry,
people who work in this

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.680
and the community of
people who work in tech

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.030
and bring things together.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.490
So like he said, I work at a
company called Graph Story.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.200
I'm a CTO there.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.980
This is weird because for 20
years I have been a developer.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.395
And now suddenly I've been
thrust into the executive team.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:54.520
Which it's a small startup,
which pretty much means

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.042
I do the same stuff, but if
I make the wrong decision,

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:00.500
we'll just crash and burn and
everyone will lose their job.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.661
So that's cool.

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:03.160
Anyway, but that's
not what I'm here

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.650
to talk to you about today.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.580
I have an informal
survey though for you.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.288
And this is going to
be one of the things

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:11.470
where you've got to get
your wings shaken up here

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.720
and you're going to want to
raise your hands because--

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.060
also, you have to raise them
up because I can't see so well.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.190
There's so many cool lights
here that light me up

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.970
beautifully that I can't see
you as well as I'd like to.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.720
But I want to have
a question for you.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.650
How many of you need contacts
or glasses to see effectively?

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.750
I would like you to raise
your hand if you do.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.820
There are a couple
of you who do not.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.320
I'm very impressed with you.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.800
Your genetics are very good.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.080
Thank you.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.360
How many of you are free
to tell people that you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.980
wear glasses or contacts?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.750
Are any of you
afraid to tell people

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.050
that, that you have
this ocular device

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.539
that you need to use
to cope in society?

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.330
That's ultimately why
we have those things.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:00.850
So nobody's answered yes.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.770
OK, gotcha.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.810
That's kind of expected.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.840
Have you ever had somebody
tell you, could you try harder,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.050
try seeing harder?

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.760
Has anyone ever
said that to you?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.540
Has anyone ever suggested
that you squint instead of--

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.250
I think somebody's
shaking their head.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.970
I'm sorry.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.280
I'm sorry for that.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.380
We all should
apologize for that,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.320
because that's a terrible
thing to have to tell anybody.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.530
So in general, we're
pretty comfortable the idea

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.400
that most of us need some
kind of support or help thing

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.110
or some sort of medical
device that allows us

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.570
to cope in society as normal.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.260
Because as humans age, their
eyes tend to get crappy.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.360
Now OK, that's fine and dandy.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.960
So another issue, another
condition, diabetes--

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.820
my brother and my dad both
developed type two diabetes.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.260
So I'm probably not in
great shape in that regard.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.430
But I'm curious about this.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.420
How many of you would feel
comfortable in the workplace,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.370
maybe not excited about
it, but OK in the workplace

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.985
if diabetes came up
and you discussed that?

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:16.110
I would like you to raise
your hand if you would be

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.680
comfortable with discussing it.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.110
OK, so most people would
be comfortable about it.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.164
Yeah, maybe not the
most exciting thing.

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:25.580
Maybe you wouldn't
be like, hey, I

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.600
had a great weekend, diabetes.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.550
You wouldn't do
that necessarily.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.790
But you'd be
comfortable with it.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.080
And it's a serious condition.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.121
It's a serious condition.

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.570
Lots of people deal with it.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.970
If untreated, it can be fatal.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.310
It can be bad stuff.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.030
Now another condition that
has touched a lot of our lives

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.630
is cancer.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.213
I lost my brother two years ago
to cancer, one of my brothers.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.110
And that is a difficult
thing for a lot of us.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.900
I think most of us,
It's touched our lives

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.816
in one way or another.

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.780
We know somebody or we've
dealt with it ourselves.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.180
Now I want to ask that
same question about cancer.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.610
How many of you would feel OK--

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.660
again, not excited,
but feel OK discussing,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.520
if cancer came up
in the workplace,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.766
having that discussion?

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.390
Somebody mentioned and said, oh
you know, my brother, turns out

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.980
he has cancer.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.050
Raise your hand if
you would feel OK

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.130
with that, if that
discussion would be like,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.350
I'm OK with that?

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.950
Not everybody-- not
everybody necessarily.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.670
It can be tough.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.461
And it can be tough
because of the emotions

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.000
that are attached with that.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.030
A lot of us have lost
people because of that.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.140
How many of you would
feel comfortable

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.970
talking to your boss about
a mental health issue?

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.660
Raise your hand.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.830
Interesting.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.614
How many of you would be
OK talking with a colleague

00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:52.780
about a mental health issue?

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.710
So 1 and 1/2 maybe.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.660
I got zero on boss.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.700
Those are the lowest
numbers I've ever seen.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.770
I've given this talk 50 times.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.010
How about a friend or
family member, somebody

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.310
you're close with?

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.450
Most people, our hands don't
exactly shoot up quickly

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.460
when we talk about this stuff.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.020
That's interesting.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.960
Think about that.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.910
Think about, while we're
talking about this stuff,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.590
compare that with
cancer and how much

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.380
we talk about that in
our popular culture

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.089
and how much we talk
about mental health.

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.004
And I want you to think
about that while we're

00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:31.220
discussing this stuff.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.520
Now I'll talk a little
bit about myself.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.980
That's one of my
favorite subjects

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.015
is the diagnoses that I have.

00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:40.090
I have two things that
I've been diagnosed with.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.280
One is generalized
anxiety disorder.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.745
And the ones that I tend to tell
people my experience with it

00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:50.770
is that I have fight or
flight reactions when

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.820
it's not appropriate.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.090
It is appropriate to have a
fight or flight reaction when

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.740
my life is in danger.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.250
If there is a lion
that's going to attack me

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.450
and I need to either run away
or roundhouse kick this lion,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.030
that is an appropriate time
to have a fight or flight

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.020
reaction.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.820
My brain says, you
need to be in this mode

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.040
because you might need
to beat up something

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.470
or you might need to run
as fast as hell to get away

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.650
from this thing to survive.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.421
That is an appropriate time
your brain tells your whole body

00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:21.920
to kick in.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.920
Your physiology changes.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.370
Hormones and chemicals start
pumping through your system.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.460
Lots of stuff happens.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.240
Physiology dramatically
shift from a normal state

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.840
to a high stress state.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.330
And it changes because it
is a survival mechanism.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.500
It is not appropriate to have
a fight or flight reaction when

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.950
you're going to meet friends at
a bar that you've never been to

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.610
and you're standing
outside, and you're

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.980
so uncomfortable with the
idea of going into this place

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.690
and you're not sure exactly
where they're sitting

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.731
and you don't really know
what it's like in there

00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:57.070
and what's the layout like
and you just get freaked out,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.572
and you decide that maybe I
should just go back to my car

00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:01.030
and sit in my car
for a few minutes

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.700
and then just
drive home instead.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.650
That has happened
to me many times.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.560
That's happened
to me many times.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.470
It's not appropriate
to have it where you're

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.320
afraid to take the bus or other
kinds of public transportation

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.870
because you don't understand
the payment system

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.525
and you're so afraid of being
embarrassed, of standing up

00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:24.900
and people being mad at you
because you're slowing things

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.940
down and stuff like that.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.680
I just don't ever take those.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.760
I don't take the bus.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.701
I don't take trains.

00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:31.200
It helps.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.340
I don't live in Chicago
so there's less of that,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.380
but there are at least
buses where I live.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.559
And that is not an
appropriate time

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.039
to have those kind of reactions.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.860
But I do.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.537
I do have those
kinds of reactions

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:48.370
in those situations,
particularly situations

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.040
where I feel like I don't
understand the rules

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.250
or like I'm not competent
enough to handle this.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.140
I get very, very
deeply uncomfortable.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.780
My brain says something's
wrong, and you

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.870
have to protect yourself.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.330
It tells me that very loudly.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:11.705
I also have ADHD, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.

00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:13.830
And that's something that
gets thrown around a lot.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.420
A lot of people kind of
talk about that stuff.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.920
And there's some things that
are kind of typical that you're

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.380
used to that go along with ADHD.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.480
And my experiences
with it, a lot of them

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.290
are similar, that as an
adult, I have trouble

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.720
focusing on single tasks.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.220
So I often jump from one
thing to another a lot.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.380
I also tend to avoid.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.020
Avoidance is a whole
big thing, a big part

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.840
of my life that
I've struggled with,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.560
avoidance of unappealing tasks.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.910
And it's not stuff like,
well, you know, I don't really

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.060
feel like doing this right
now, but I'll get around to it.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.320
It's been more like, yeah,
I will just never do that

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.379
and my water will get
shut off because I just

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:52.920
didn't get around
to paying the bills

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.880
because I kept forgetting.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.255
And when I did do it, I was
like, I really don't want to.

00:09:56.255 --> 00:09:59.880
I feel strangely like almost
almost anxious about it

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.630
and uncomfortable.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.040
It's like I don't want to
deal with that right now.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.480
I've had that happen.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.976
I have the money.

00:10:05.976 --> 00:10:07.100
I just didn't pay the bill.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.060
But there's a couple
of other things

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.241
that often go hand-in-hand with
ADHD and the kind of stuff I

00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:15.740
deal with.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.544
And one of those
things is oftentimes,

00:10:19.544 --> 00:10:20.960
I have these two
different things,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.168
but they sort of go together.

00:10:22.168 --> 00:10:26.760
I have what I usually say is
a low frustration threshold.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.550
And this is fairly common
with people with ADHD,

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.510
that they often get
frustrated quickly,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.970
especially if the way they
expect things to go changes

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.090
rather suddenly.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.110
Most people aren't super
comfortable with that,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.020
but they can adapt OK.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.850
I have a very strong
emotional reaction to that,

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.140
oftentimes very--

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.520
and I think it ties in with an
idea that I feel uncomfortable

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.370
and I tend to get angry
in those situations.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.580
I get frustrated.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.820
Or I get very frustrated when
it feels like I'm just not

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.460
capable of doing something
and I get frustrated much more

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.390
quickly than seems normal
to the people around me,

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.700
than what seems like the norm.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.550
The intensity of my emotions
is often much stronger

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.130
than it seems like it
is for other people.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.830
Sometimes it feels like my
emotions are out of control

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.125
despite the fact that
I know logically I

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.330
am having a reaction
that is not in line

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.170
with the severity
of the situation.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.340
I know that.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:33.020
And yet I don't know how to turn
off that fire hose of emotion

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.310
that sometimes comes over me.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.730
And sometimes I just have to
sequester myself off and wait

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.820
until it calms down because
otherwise I will say and do

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.310
things that are destructive.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.550
I'll hurt people
around me that I love.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.860
Emotionally I will act out
in different kinds of ways.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.030
I'm also particularly good
at constructing bad outcomes

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.740
and hyperfocusing on them.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.930
So an example would be--

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.630
this happened to
me more than once.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.560
I've got an email
from the person

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.190
who is my manager,
my boss, and said--

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.570
hey, could you-- it's like
a Friday, late on Friday.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.030
Hey, on Monday could you
come in and we could talk?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.880
OK, all right, well
what's going to happen?

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.862
Oh, this is alarming.

00:12:23.862 --> 00:12:25.070
I don't know what's going on.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.820
Maybe he knew about
that thing that I did.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.210
Was that thing--
oh my gosh, oh no.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.610
And I would construct a scenario
where I'm losing my job.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.170
We won't have any income.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.670
I will be so shamed that
my family will abandon me.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.720
We will lose our house.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.980
I will be homeless.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.090
My career is shot.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.570
I will have nothing to live for.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.520
And I will live the
next couple of days

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.550
unable to put that aside, unable
to take that out of my brain

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.300
and say, you know what,
that's ridiculous.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.030
It's probably not
something like that.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.550
Everything's going to be OK.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.540
I want to tell myself that,
but it doesn't work that way.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.700
Those emotions are
so strong and I'm

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.920
so good at constructing
those outcomes

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.230
and I have very
detailed lists of that.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:14.090
And I live as if that is then
the predetermined outcome.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:20.970
And I get in on Monday and
my boss says, "So how's

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.086
that project going?"

00:13:22.086 --> 00:13:23.640
I'm like, "Oh, it's good.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.300
Actually we finished that up.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.690
Yeah, that was really good."

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.640
And meanwhile there's
sweat pouring off.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.883
And I'm like, [BREATHS HEAVILY]

00:13:33.383 --> 00:13:34.856
[EXHALES]

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.090
And it's like an
elephant has been sitting

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.280
on my chest for the
past three days,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.390
and suddenly it just got off.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.875
And there really wasn't
anything to worry about.

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:48.250
But I'm really, really good
at constructing those things,

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.700
really, really good at that.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.860
So how do I deal with it?

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.970
I take medication is
one thing that I do.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.590
I take about five
different things every day.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.030
And that's something that helps.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.300
And I've been dealing
with this 30 years.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.314
And right now that's
the kind of cocktail

00:14:05.314 --> 00:14:07.730
that works for me that helps
kind of keep myself in check.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:08.438
It's not perfect.

00:14:08.438 --> 00:14:10.560
It doesn't mean that
I never have symptoms,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.419
but they're a lot less severe.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.210
And I also see a
therapist every two weeks.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.600
And I talk about what's
happened with me, why

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.210
I do the things that I do, try
to break down those scenarios,

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.501
try to break down sort of
the process of that behavior.

00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.970
We go through thing a called
cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.303
which is a common thing that's
used with a lot of people

00:14:28.303 --> 00:14:30.870
with anxiety disorders
that's pretty effective,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.450
and talk about how and
why I do the things I do

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.211
and come up with
strategies to address that.

00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:38.710
Basically like kind of having
a coach for your brain instead

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.290
of somebody who's telling
you to do sit-ups.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.560
That's how it is
with my therapist.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.130
Your therapist
could be different.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.796
But that's how it
kind of works with me.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.400
And those things help.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.370
And I've gotten
better at things.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.800
Stuff used to be a lot worse.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.810
It's gotten better.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.580
It impacts my work every day.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.490
Every single day I am
living with my brain.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.490
And the work that I do involves
thinking and solving problems

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.720
and figuring stuff out.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.200
And things that affect the
way that my brain processes

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.900
work are pretty serious,
that affects my thinking

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.070
are particularly problematic,
potentially at least.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.120
Now sometimes it
gives me superpowers,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.340
absolutely gives
me super powers.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.220
I'm really good at
certain aspects of my job

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.870
because of the way
my brain works.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.970
I'm really good at constructing
negative outcomes, really good

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:31.470
at that.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.803
I'm actually really good at
constructing outcomes period

00:15:33.803 --> 00:15:36.440
and figuring out,
well, if we do this,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.610
how is that going to impact
our system over here?

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.110
If we do this thing
in the back end,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.240
how's that going to impact
how a user has to interact

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.323
with our system over here?

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.290
I tend to be kind of good
at anticipating security

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.550
issues for that reason.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.050
How could somebody
attack our system

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.100
in such a way that [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.860
I'm not an expert.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.520
I'm not some super infosec dude.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.700
But I tend to be better
at that than some people.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.060
I also, probably because
of some of the stuff

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.850
that I've dealt with in my life,
and I think a lot about how

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:12.056
things affect people, I
tend to empathize strongly

00:16:12.056 --> 00:16:12.680
with the users.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.222
And I think a lot about,
if we store data like this,

00:16:15.222 --> 00:16:17.180
how does that impact the
way that the user is--

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.040
what they're able to do?

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.430
And ultimately as a developer,
that's sort of my job

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.540
is to make tools--

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.730
not sort of, it is my job is
to make tools that people use.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.930
So it's rather helpful to be
able to empathize strongly

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.590
with users or people.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.415
And it's often tough
because the people

00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:35.790
who are building
this stuff often

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.373
have a lot of
difficulty understanding

00:16:37.373 --> 00:16:39.542
what it's like to be a user
of the thing they make.

00:16:39.542 --> 00:16:41.500
I'm a little bit better
at it than some people.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.290
Not perfect, but I'm
a little bit better

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.530
than your average developer.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.030
Sometimes it absolutely
gives me superpowers.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.900
And sometimes it
absolutely ruins me.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.310
Sometimes when
something happens,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.990
when those emotions kick in
and I can't control them,

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.870
it craters my day completely.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.250
It renders me unproductive.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.430
I can not do my
work effectively.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.369
I may not be able to
do my work period.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.750
I just can't.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.310
I cannot because I cannot focus.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.510
I cannot concentrate.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.440
I cannot do it.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.859
The toughest thing with all
of this in my life and dealing

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.344
with this stuff where--

00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:25.760
you know, I've been dealing
with stuff, particularly ADHD.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.190
I've had that since
I was in school.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.340
I know the whole thing.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.430
I can think of things that I
did in second or third grade.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.140
I was like, oh, that
was what was going on.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.556
I wasn't diagnosed
until I was 27.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.350
But been dealing with
that the whole time.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.980
Anxiety and depression
started becoming much worse

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.940
when I was 12 or 13.

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:48.640
But in dealing with all
this, the toughest part of it

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.840
for me was that feeling
alone, feeling like you

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.240
were not like anyone
else around you,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.980
feeling as if
everybody else seems

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.600
to be capable of
getting through life

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.274
and seems to be OK with this
stuff and they seem to get--

00:18:03.274 --> 00:18:05.690
like in high school, they seem
to get their homework done.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.360
They can read 100 pages of
Dostoevsky in a night and be

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.850
able to write something
about it, and I can't.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.050
What's the problem?

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.460
Why can't I do this?

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.500
And you feel, and I
felt for a long time

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.290
that I was incapable
of living this life.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.120
I always screw up
and I always fail.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.860
And people that I love will
always grow tired of me

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.360
and leave.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.670
And I will always do
that because I'm not

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.220
capable of sustaining--

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.660
doing things the right way.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.550
I always blow up and
something goes wrong.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.190
And that is how I felt for
a very, very long time.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.910
But there's a lot of
people who feel like that.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.400
A lot of people feel like that.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.970
And that is what I'm
here to talk about.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:59.150
And that is what we
formed OSMI to fight.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.870
To talk a little bit about
how this affects us--

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:07.750
if we just look at the general
population, one in five adults

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.180
have a mental disorder in
any one year in the US.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.910
That is 20% of the population.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.380
That is looking at the
general population.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.900
We'll get to the other
stuff in a minute.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.230
But at the very basic, if
we look general population,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.870
is it particularly abnormal
to have a mental disorder?

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.110
No, it's actually not.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.120
In fact it's extremely common.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.100
Anxiety disorders
are the most common.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.496
They affect about 18%
of the population.

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:37.120
The numbers add up to more than
20% because you typically have,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.350
again, co-morbidity.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.790
You have issues
where people will

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.915
be diagnosed with multiple
things at the same time.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.530
There is a World
Health Organization

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.740
study that was done in 2004 and
was released, I think, in 2008.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.230
And it's the most recent
study of what they call

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.475
the global burden of disease.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.030
This idea of disease
burden is a metric

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.940
they came up with which
combines premature death

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.560
and years lived with disability.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.990
The idea is that they're
trying to measure

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.570
the impact that a disease
has on a population.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.030
And in this study, they
found that the burden

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.420
of mental disorders was
the largest of all disorder

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.550
categories in North
America, larger

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.100
than cardiovascular disease
and larger than cancer.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.860
And this is a quote
from this study.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.010
"In all regions,
neuropsychiatric conditions

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.980
are the most important
causes of disability,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.860
accounting for
around 1/3 of years

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.320
lost to disability among
adults aged 15 years over."

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.580
The most important cause
of disability World Health

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.810
Organization said.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.250
That is across the globe.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.060
Look at economic cost.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.185
And these things are always
kind of a little fuzzy,

00:20:55.185 --> 00:20:56.972
but it gives you some ideas.

00:20:56.972 --> 00:20:59.180
Mental health conditions
are the second leading cause

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.820
of workplace absenteeism.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.180
I don't know what the first
is, but second, mental health

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.160
conditions.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.720
If we're just looking
at depression,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.900
workers with depression
lose about 5.6 hours a week.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.170
Workers without lose about 1.5.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.604
That's a significant difference
in terms of hours lost.

00:21:21.604 --> 00:21:23.270
And if we look at
sort of these numbers,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.800
you try to attach
dollar figures to this.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.383
Again, it's always
a little bit fuzzy.

00:21:26.383 --> 00:21:28.550
But again, just
looking at depression,

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:34.970
just one major category
of mental health disorder,

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.840
$43.7 billion in absenteeism
from work, 200 million days

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.340
lost.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.381
[INAUDIBLE] productivity,
direct treatment-- that

00:21:42.381 --> 00:21:45.380
is enormous impact, and
I think particularly

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.370
if you think about people either
not working effectively or not

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.850
being able to be in
the office at all.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.520
Because at the end of the
day, sick workers don't work.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.970
It doesn't matter what
they're sick with.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.650
People who are not healthy
are not as productive.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.620
Doesn't matter if
they have a cold.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.880
Doesn't matter if they got joint
pain and they can't get up,

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.884
they've got a back problem.

00:22:12.884 --> 00:22:14.550
Doesn't matter if
they've got depression

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.580
or they've got anxiety.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.504
It keeps them from
being as productive.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.546
Now we have, for
a couple of years,

00:22:23.546 --> 00:22:25.670
done what we call the mental
health in tech survey.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.490
And this is an opt-in
survey, so self-selective.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.680
So keep that in mind
if we go up and look

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.030
at some of the deeper results.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.160
But these are results
from our 2016 initiative,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.660
which has so far--

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.680
it's still open.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.900
If you want to take it,
that would be great.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.650
But this is data that
we had from 2016.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.680
As of November 16, this
is what it collected.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.720
And this just includes
people in the US,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.420
and it just includes
non self-employed folks.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.870
The reason I did that
was because there

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.650
are some differences
about the US compared

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.030
with other countries.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.490
Typically in the
US, your workplace

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.390
is your primary conduit
for health care.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.120
And people who are self-employed
have a different situation.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.940
They are their own boss.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.690
They can say, I'm going
to take a day off.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.610
I'm going to go get
treatment for this.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.650
They have different
opportunities.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.310
People who are employed
by an organization

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.017
have to work with
that organization

00:23:17.017 --> 00:23:17.850
and what they offer.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.250
So the four questions that
I want to show you-- there

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.110
is tons of data in here from
all people all over the world.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.200
And we have about
1,500 responses.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.182
This is just the
folks in the US.

00:23:31.182 --> 00:23:33.390
First question, do you think
that discussing a health

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.650
issue with your employer would
have negative consequences?

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.290
We asked about physical health.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.620
72% of people said
no, about 3/4.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.540
Maybe said 25%.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.540
Yes said 4%.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.179
4% said yes, excuse me.

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:53.470
Most people feel that if they
discuss a physical health

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.660
issue, probably would not
be negative consequences

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.280
in the tech workplace.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.500
For mental health, only
about a third said no.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.380
About 2/3 said yes or maybe.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.850
That's a very
significant difference,

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.430
and I think underlines
the attitudes

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.280
and perception of mental
health and the consequences

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.980
for speaking about it
openly in the workplace.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.560
Would you bring
up a health issue

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.600
with a potential
employer in an interview?

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.650
And again, we split this
between physical and mental.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:31.220
With physical, no
and maybe, 76%.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.180
It's not surprising.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.721
Most people don't
want to give people

00:24:33.721 --> 00:24:36.902
a reason not to hire them.

00:24:36.902 --> 00:24:39.110
There are a number of issues
that could go into that.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.568
Some would be like,
well, what does

00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:43.010
it matter if my knee acts
up every once in a while?

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.052
Some people will tell you
there is no way in heck

00:24:45.052 --> 00:24:46.760
you should ever tell
somebody that you're

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.100
planning on getting pregnant
because you will not

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.730
get the job.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.800
That is a physical health issue.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.775
So again, there's
lots of reasons.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.690
But yes, 24%, not that high.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.320
Let's compare that
with mental health.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.290
Only 7% of people said yes.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.480
Twice as many said no.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.520
Maybe was a little bit
lower, probably being

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.156
eaten up by that no.

00:25:13.156 --> 00:25:15.280
This in fact is higher than
the numbers-- or excuse

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.613
me, this is in fact a little
bit better than the numbers

00:25:17.613 --> 00:25:20.630
we had in 2014 when we
last did this survey.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.964
But it is still the case that
far fewer people would bring up

00:25:25.964 --> 00:25:27.880
a mental health issue
versus a physical health

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.671
issue in an interview
because they believe--

00:25:30.671 --> 00:25:32.170
I believe what you
can get from that

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.510
is they believe it is more
likely that a mental health

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:39.720
issue will be something that
eliminates them from contention

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.532
for that job.

00:25:40.532 --> 00:25:42.490
Now this is despite the
fact that the Americans

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.820
With Disability Act says it
is illegal to do so if you

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.977
have more than 15 employees.

00:25:46.977 --> 00:25:48.810
But it's also almost
impossible to prove it.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.294
Does your employer
provide resources

00:25:55.294 --> 00:25:56.960
to learn more about
mental health issues

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.705
and how to seek help?

00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:02.080
Again, the workplace being
the primary conduit for health

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.620
care, how does the
workplace educate?

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.620
How does the workplace
point out these resources

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.580
and their availability
and things like that?

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.221
Only 30% said yes.

00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:17.739
So 70% say no, employer
does not provide resources.

00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:19.280
And another third
says, I don't know,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.910
which I think is
just as bad as no.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.672
2/3 of folks who are working
as tech professionals,

00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.130
their employer
isn't providing them

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.032
with resources
about mental health.

00:26:34.032 --> 00:26:35.990
Keep in mind what the
World Health Organization

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.990
said about the importance
of this and the burden

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.475
that it has on our society.

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:43.850
And the fourth and last question
that I'll show you here,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.332
do you feel that
being identified

00:26:45.332 --> 00:26:47.915
as a person with a mental health
issue would hurt your career?

00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:00.570
And those numbers, only 12%
said no, I don't think it would,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.330
or no it has not.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:10.370
Everyone else says maybe or yes
I think it would or yes it has.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.240
The perception is such
that people believe,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.980
87% of folks who
answer these questions,

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.580
believe that being identified
as somebody with a mental health

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.200
issue is going to
hurt their career.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.056
Why would they be
willing to discuss it?

00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:25.680
Why would they be
willing to seek help?

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.550
Why would they be
willing to get better,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.939
as that workplace is a
conduit for health care,

00:27:30.939 --> 00:27:33.230
if they think there's going
to be negative consequences

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:38.190
for being known as that/ I
think that's a great question.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.630
I think a lot of people are
very afraid to discuss it.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.660
And it's tough because
change is really hard,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.280
because we are scared.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.563
Because frequently the
things I've encountered

00:27:49.563 --> 00:27:53.330
is that people just
don't know what to do.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.700
Employers are people
working in the workplace who

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.590
have some responsibility
for this stuff.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.140
They're often afraid of
endangering their workplace,

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:06.050
saying the wrong thing,
giving the wrong advice,

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.380
and endangering their
workplace as a result--

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.160
endangering the health of the
organization, the existence

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.080
of the organization.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.580
And people who are
employed are also

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.306
afraid of losing their
jobs, as is demonstrated

00:28:21.306 --> 00:28:22.430
in the information we have.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.170
People are afraid
to lose their jobs

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.650
because they're afraid that
they'll be identified as that.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.950
Now at OSMI, there are
things we can do to help.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.700
There's a lot of things
we can do to help.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.033
But there's five things that
I think you can think about

00:28:36.033 --> 00:28:38.370
right now that I think
will be effective

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.702
and I think will help.

00:28:39.702 --> 00:28:41.910
The first thing is-- and
this is kind of a meta thing

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.118
and it's kind of hard, you
know, what does this mean?

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:47.004
Make a commitment to change.

00:28:47.004 --> 00:28:48.420
But I think
fundamentally you have

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:54.410
to make a decision that you're
going to think and speak

00:28:54.410 --> 00:29:01.062
about mental health differently
than you do right now.

00:29:01.062 --> 00:29:03.360
And that's a matter
of changing yourself.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.860
And it doesn't mean that you
have to go around and say, hey,

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.990
I've got this thing.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.571
You know what, my brother,
he did this, my sister.

00:29:10.571 --> 00:29:11.820
You do not have to be like me.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.160
My therapist says I have a
confessional personality,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.340
and that is very accurate.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.800
I am a bit of an
oversharer, let's say.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.540
And that works out
for stuff like this.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.470
I'm good at this
because I can do that.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.178
It doesn't mean you
have to be like this.

00:29:26.178 --> 00:29:30.160
But being able to speak openly
about mental health issues

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.220
and speak to it without shame
and emphasize that there's

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.270
no shame in it, that
can change that world

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.220
around you, the social group
that interacts with you.

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:45.970
The social group you
interact with the most

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.600
is probably your workplace,
for better or for worse.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.430
Those are probably people
you spend the most time with.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.060
And you can have a significant
impact on those people

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.060
if you indicate to
them that they can

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.510
be less afraid of this stuff.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.300
It is almost certain
based on the numbers

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.070
that there are people
in your social group

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.230
who are dealing with
mental health issues

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.620
and are afraid to
talk about, right now,

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.960
and you don't know who they are.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.170
If you're able to speak
more openly about it,

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.690
you will help those people
feel safer, feel less stressed,

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.320
be mentally healthier, and be
more likely to seek treatment.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.470
The second thing you can do
is we've created handbooks

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.680
specifically to help people
with these kinds of issues.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.580
We have three.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.690
They are available
for free as e-books.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.460
There are handbooks for
employers and employees

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.700
on how to navigate ADA law
specifically dedicated to tech

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.342
workplaces and mental health.

00:30:50.342 --> 00:30:51.550
So there's one for employers.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.700
There's one for employees
dealing with ADA law.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.570
The third one is how to create
supportive workplaces that

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:03.400
promote mental wellness
within the workplace.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.960
All three of these
were developed

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.660
by Jennifer Akullian--

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.950
who has a PhD in psychology.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.520
She works at Keen IO--

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.440
with a little bit
of help from me

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.490
and some help from
Johanne Wu, who

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:21.036
is a PhD in
organizational psychology.

00:31:21.036 --> 00:31:22.660
These handbooks are
available for free.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.940
They're Creative
Commons licensed.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.440
And you can get them
right now at our website.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.129
The third thing you
can do is take a course

00:31:31.129 --> 00:31:32.420
called mental health first aid.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.680
It's an eight hour course.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.180
You can find lots
and lots of people

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.650
who will teach it in
this area, or in almost

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.900
any other part of the country.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.120
It is available in 22
different countries.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.056
In the US, I paid $50 to take
it and I got lunch with it.

00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:46.430
It was a nice
little boxed lunch.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.960
It was really pleasant.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.850
And that was really cool.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:54.680
And I learned a ton
about how to identify

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.130
if someone is in a
mental health crisis,

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:03.280
and then how to interact
with them most effectively

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.460
so that they are more
likely to seek help.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.900
The key here is--
you might notice

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.230
I did not say how to fix
their problem for them.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.130
That is not your job.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.030
You are not trained for that.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.320
I'm not trained for that.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.774
Do not try to fix their problem.

00:32:15.774 --> 00:32:17.440
People in tech,
particularly developers,

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.960
want to solve
problems for people.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.995
Do not do this.

00:32:20.995 --> 00:32:23.360
This is not your job.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.710
You don't have to
fix everything.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.390
You listen empathetically
and talk to them

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.700
in a way that's going to
encourage them to seek help.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.470
I think it's a very
important course to take.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.178
I particularly think
if you have anything

00:32:34.178 --> 00:32:37.930
to do with managing people, this
is an essential course to take,

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.150
because you will
learn a lot about how

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.170
to interact with people in a
rewarding and positive way that

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.116
helps them succeed.

00:32:47.116 --> 00:32:48.990
Tell people about the
work that you're doing,

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.820
the efforts that you're doing.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.070
You take this class.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.530
You read these handbooks.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.587
Talk about it openly.

00:32:53.587 --> 00:32:54.420
Share it on Twitter.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.294
Share it on Facebook.

00:32:55.294 --> 00:32:58.650
Share it on Google+.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.150
Take a selfie when you're on
a break at the training course

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.566
and say hey, I'm
doing this thing.

00:33:02.566 --> 00:33:03.910
It's really super cool.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:05.289
Talk about it.

00:33:05.289 --> 00:33:07.330
The more you talk about
it, the people around you

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:10.030
will be less afraid.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.096
I guarantee it.

00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:15.520
And the fifth thing, and I
think the most important thing,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.890
this is about peer support.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.450
And there's certain
organizations

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.485
like "Nami," NAMI--

00:33:20.485 --> 00:33:22.110
can't write exactly
what it stands for,

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.875
National Association
of the Mentally Ill.

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:25.770
I probably got wrong.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.960
Really focus on peer support.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.940
Tell people that they
matter in your life,

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.670
how they impact
your life positively

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.400
and how strong and
great they are.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.380
Everybody needs to hear this.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.200
There are few of us who would
not benefit from hearing this

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.000
from the external sources.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.830
There are few of us
who have a voice so

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.930
strong within
themselves that they

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.020
don't need it from anyone else.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.870
Everybody needs to hear
this, particularly people

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.992
whose brains lie to them.

00:33:54.992 --> 00:33:59.970
And my brain has been lying
to me for most of my life,

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.130
telling me that I didn't
matter, that all I

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.770
did was screw things up and
I was a burden to people.

00:34:07.231 --> 00:34:08.480
So what's the upside for this?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.139
And I don't talk about
just the upside for--

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.139
people, you feel better.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.659
You feel that you've
done some moral good.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.139
Why try to change the workplace?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.750
What's the upside
for the workplace?

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.260
And why?

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.330
Because it benefits the
organization and everyone

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.050
in it.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.500
Because mental wellness means
better employees, period.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.420
Employees feel valued and secure
and work more effectively when

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.354
employers demonstrate
commitment to their well-being.

00:34:33.354 --> 00:34:37.030
And people are going to
want to work for you.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.699
People want to work someplace
that respects them fully

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.408
and that doesn't ignore
their well-being.

00:34:41.408 --> 00:34:43.032
If I go back and I
think about the jobs

00:34:43.032 --> 00:34:44.710
that I liked in my
career and the jobs

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.050
that I haven't liked,
the ones that are liked,

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.630
it did not have a lot to do
with the work I was doing.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.770
It had to do with the people.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.770
Did I have good relationships
with those people,

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.370
respectful relationships?

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:01.080
Did we have a mutual respect
and concern for each other?

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.850
The people that I
always work hardest for

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.080
were people that I felt like had
concern about me as a person.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.450
They were concerned
about my well-being.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:13.310
They wanted me to be
happy and healthy.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.395
That's what makes for a good
workplace, not ping pong tables

00:35:17.395 --> 00:35:19.480
and not free lunches.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.105
That's what makes
for a good workplace.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.710
In 2016, Open Sourcing Mental
Illness was not a nonprofit.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.680
It was just a dude,
me, who had some ideas.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.895
That's all it was.

00:35:34.895 --> 00:35:37.257
I started to make
some changes though

00:35:37.257 --> 00:35:39.590
to do some stuff that was
maybe a little more ambitious.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.131
I had been speaking about mental
health for about three years

00:35:42.131 --> 00:35:43.440
at different tech conferences.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.427
It was mostly just me.

00:35:44.427 --> 00:35:45.260
It's mostly just me.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.510
We had started a little bit
of work on those handbooks

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:48.200
I talked about.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.100
That was about it.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.414
But in 2016 we had
some goals, and we

00:35:52.414 --> 00:35:54.080
tried to get some
money for those goals.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.760
Those goals primarily were
to become a legal nonprofit,

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.332
501(c)(3) to create e-books
and printed handbooks--

00:36:00.332 --> 00:36:02.790
the handbooks we put together
were not e-books at the time.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.290
You couldn't put
them on your Kindle

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.090
and fly around with
them, stuff like that--

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.730
to release an API and release
our survey data from 2016--

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.740
to do another survey too--

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.370
to do a video presentation
series, to do a video workshop,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.160
and to get more people talking
and speaking about this.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.700
So I wanted to raise some money.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.900
I did this on Indiegogo.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.990
Again, this was really people
were just giving me money.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.490
There was no
organization behind it.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.120
It was not tax deductible.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.450
And so I'd done a couple
other ones before,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.100
and they'd been
fairly successful.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.840
And the goal--

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.460
2015 had been $5,000.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.770
This year we said, oh,
hey, let's do $10,000.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:37.880
This is going to be a
huge amount of money.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.420
I'm kind of freaked
out about it.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.180
But I'm going to ask
for it because I want

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.485
to do some ambitious stuff.

00:36:43.485 --> 00:36:45.892
And I'm not going to sit
and be afraid of doing

00:36:45.892 --> 00:36:46.600
ambitious things.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.660
I'm really going to try to do.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.010
So we did this on Indiegogo.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.055
You get a reward.

00:36:51.055 --> 00:36:52.430
You give us a
bunch of money, you

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.640
get a T-shirt and
stuff like that.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.130
And our time to
goal was 72 hours.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.570
So we raised that
$10,000 in 72 hours.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:05.660
And the total that we raised
in 30 days was $22,481.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.970
That was really,
really, really awesome,

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.030
amazing, humbling, and I think
speaks to how many people think

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.920
that this is really
important, that we're not

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.080
doing a good enough job,
that we can do a lot better.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.930
And I think we can.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:23.555
This is a list.

00:37:23.555 --> 00:37:25.679
There's probably a couple
people missing from here,

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:28.060
but this is from 2015 and
2016, probably, again, about as

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.560
of November.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.590
This is 275 bad asses
who all gave money.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.850
They gave $10 or
they gave $1,000.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.380
It varies, whatever.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.280
But those are all really
amazing people who stepped up.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.819
And it is incredibly humbling
to put something out there

00:37:41.819 --> 00:37:44.110
and to realize that people
are willing to just give you

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.160
their money to do that.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:45.885
That is crazy.

00:37:49.371 --> 00:37:50.870
I didn't come out
here with, like, I

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:51.869
didn't write some paper.

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:52.880
I'm not a PhD in this.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.322
I just think it's important.

00:37:56.322 --> 00:37:58.280
And I tried to say
something about it because I

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.735
felt like I needed to.

00:38:01.735 --> 00:38:04.350
And it's very humbling to
get that kind of support

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.720
from this community.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.040
And as of recently,
we now have--

00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:16.070
well actually there's a
couple of people missing here.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.320
So we've got about 15 people
now are involved in this.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.250
Used to just be me.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.540
Now we've got about 15 people.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.980
I was afraid to try
ambitious things.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.729
All these people stepped
up and they said,

00:38:23.729 --> 00:38:26.160
you know what you're
doing, it's really awesome.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.420
I want to help too.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.060
And they're doing amazing stuff.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.530
People who are much smarter
and more capable than I am

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:33.810
are just doing amazing things.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.090
And you can see up there
it says board members.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.690
That's because we became
a nonprofit 501(c)(3)

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:44.780
organization as of
September of this year.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.290
And that's a huge thing.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:48.960
That's a huge thing.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.350
It turned from just somebody
doing some stuff, which was me.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:56.575
Now it is a real legal entity
and we're doing this work.

00:38:56.575 --> 00:38:59.200
And all these donations are tax
deductible and stuff like that.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:38:59.909
It's really cool.

00:38:59.909 --> 00:39:01.700
We also have, this is
an in progress thing,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.990
but this is our mental
health in tech 2016, a survey

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.340
graph and API.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.140
This is an open project
you can help with.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.660
You can also examine the data,
something like Kaggle.com.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.100
We have some stuff there.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.530
But you can do data
analysis with it.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.631
It is all stored in a graph
database, a Neo4j graph

00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:17.130
database.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.650
And you can check
that stuff out.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.820
And we're working on a
hypermedia API for it.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:21.960
These are things
that you contribute

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.084
to if you're interested in.

00:39:23.084 --> 00:39:25.200
If you're a data wonk,
check this stuff out.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.533
You can check it out on Kaggle
or you can pull the stuff

00:39:27.533 --> 00:39:29.250
directly out Neo4j.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.340
If you want to help
with writing code

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.240
for this API, all cool stuff,
and also need help for like,

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.335
how do we visualize this data?

00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:40.710
There's also something we did
call the OSMI forums, which

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.870
are formerly by a guy named Greg
Bauges who was here in Chicago.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.380
He moved to New York last year.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.930
And he works still at Twilio.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.560
And he spoke a lot
about this kind of stuff

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.970
in the Ruby community.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:55.740
And he had a site
called Devpressed.com.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.360
And it was down for
a couple of months

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.960
because, like a lot
of things, he was busy

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.930
and something broke and
didn't have time to fix it.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.649
We took that over.

00:40:05.649 --> 00:40:07.190
We talked to him,
made this exchange,

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.330
and now it's the OSMI forum.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.290
So otherwise it's the same.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.770
It is a place for
people who work

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.780
in tech who are tech
professionals to talk

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.020
about their problems openly.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.051
They can post-- they
make up an account name.

00:40:16.051 --> 00:40:16.800
It doesn't matter.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.570
We don't check and
validate that stuff.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.220
They can post anonymously
about their problems

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.636
and talk with other
people in tech

00:40:21.636 --> 00:40:24.480
about what's going on with
them, their specific issues.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.717
And that's a forum we
took over this year.

00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:29.800
And I should say I don't
even have a slide for it.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.180
We are working on
this video workshop.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.960
And we're going to
get a rough edit soon.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.320
And that's aimed at HR
folks and executive teams.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:43.230
That features Dr.
Akullian and Dr. Wu

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.490
and then me for
like five seconds

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.100
talking about why
this stuff matters

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.740
and why it needs to
matter in your workplace.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.260
So we accomplished
most of our goals

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.055
or at least getting
partway there.

00:40:55.055 --> 00:40:57.430
It's almost taken a little
while longer than it has been,

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.384
but we're doing OK.

00:40:59.384 --> 00:41:01.800
Now one question sometimes I
get asked is, well why do you

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.720
call it Open Sourcing
Mental Illness?

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.900
And they make some kind of
joke about where's the code.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.210
And you know, and
it's makes me pissed.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.470
I don't know.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.070
Hot button thing--
hot button thing.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.360
In all my career, last
20 years of my career,

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.842
it's all been based
on open source stuff.

00:41:21.842 --> 00:41:24.300
Not all the things that I've
created have been open source,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.860
but everything that
I have done has

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.874
been based on open source
technology, every bit of it.

00:41:28.874 --> 00:41:30.540
But I'm going to
assert that open source

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.820
culture and open source
community is not about code.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.030
That is a mcguffin.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.440
It's not about the code.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.280
It's about learning
and sharing together.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.820
And it's about growing together.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.330
And it's about
open arms and it's

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.880
about open minds
and an open hand

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:51.650
to pull the next person up
and help them help themselves.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:56.270
It's about a peer group that's
supportive and welcoming

00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.340
and embraces each other
to help each other.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.370
I started this in--

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.160
first time I talked about this
was at an unconference session

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:11.880
at php tek, which was out
in Roseland in May 16, 2013.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.225
And I've done about 50
conferences since then.

00:42:14.225 --> 00:42:15.960
I did this little unconf talk.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.630
And every bit of the success
that we've had turning this

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:22.650
to a legal entity, fundraising,
the people coming together,

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.900
all of the stuff that we
have done and all the success

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.361
that I've had over the last
three or four years talking

00:42:28.361 --> 00:42:30.360
about this stuff is based
on open source culture

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.140
and it doesn't really have
anything to do with code.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.812
This is what open
source means to me.

00:42:35.812 --> 00:42:38.145
And that's why I call this
Open Sourcing Mental Illness.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.460
That's all good.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.334
That's all fine.

00:42:46.334 --> 00:42:48.250
But I want to get back
to what I kind of think

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:52.520
is the heart of the
matter and wrap this up.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.730
At the end of the day, this
is what's going on, I believe.

00:42:58.394 --> 00:43:03.720
It's that our colleagues
and our friends

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.900
and our people, the
people that we work,

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.900
our colleagues, our community
members, the folks that we work

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.520
with in doing this
kind of stuff,

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.650
this sort of tech-oriented
stuff, these tech

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:18.840
professionals, it's our people,
our friends and our colleagues

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:26.090
and our people, a lot of
them suffer in silence,

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.510
because they're afraid
to talk about it.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.250
And sometimes some of
them just disappear on us.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.530
They go away for one
reason or another,

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.340
and we're left to wonder why
and regret and try to understand

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.494
what happened with them.

00:43:39.494 --> 00:43:41.910
And there's some that we can
save and there's some that we

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.010
can't.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:47.340
But the only thing that
allows these people

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.920
to suffer in silence,
and the only reason

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.320
we don't save more of
our kin and our kith

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.760
is because of fear.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.470
The only reason is fear.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:44:02.236
The only reason that these
people suffer, that we suffer,

00:44:02.236 --> 00:44:07.580
and that we lose many of our
friends is because of fear.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.440
We have to choose.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.570
You and I and all
of us have to choose

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.660
to be stronger than that fear.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.505
We have to choose
to be stronger.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.120
So thanks for listening.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.840
I hope you'll consider helping
us out with what we do,

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.690
sharing our message
and resources,

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:34.270
taking steps to support your
peers, volunteering with us

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.660
if you're interested.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.540
You can contact us
on our web site.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.250
If you feel like
donating time or money,

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.810
that is very helpful for us too.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.930
It is tax deductible.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.730
So thank you very much.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.162
I appreciate you giving me
the time to speak on this.

00:44:47.162 --> 00:44:47.870
Thanks very much.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:52.361
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:52.361 --> 00:44:54.420
SPEAKER: All right, thanks Ed.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.440
And for now, we do
have some mics up

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.960
if anyone wants to
ask Ed any questions.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.440
And we also have a
Dory at goed-dory

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.150
if you want to ask
your questions there.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.950
So feel free to
step up to the mic

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:10.800
if you have a question Fred.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.880
Otherwise we can go
straight to the Dory.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.995
So we'll go to the Dory.

00:45:13.995 --> 00:45:17.384
And so the question
here Ed is, I've

00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:19.800
been suffering from an episode
of major depression for two

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.760
years.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.260
Do you have advice
for how to combat

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.610
negative thoughts at work?

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.550
It's often hard for me to see
the positive side of project

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.010
proposals and designs even
when it feels like others can.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:36.650
ED FINKLER: I smirk because
that sounds familiar to me.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.480
Advice is tough
because something

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.644
that I've learned
sometimes the hard way

00:45:45.644 --> 00:45:47.560
is that you shouldn't
give advice about things

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.401
that you don't actually have
enough expertise to speak on.

00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:54.400
And one of the things
that also I think you find

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.566
is that particularly when
dealing with mental health

00:45:56.566 --> 00:46:00.130
issues, things that work
for one person often

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.580
don't matter at all.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.580
I feel better when I
drink a lot of water.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:07.394
I do.

00:46:07.394 --> 00:46:09.560
Doesn't mean you're going
to feel better because you

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.393
drink lots of water.

00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:11.940
Maybe it's a good idea.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.730
Hey, hydrate, that's awesome.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:17.780
That doesn't mean that's
going to fix your problems.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:23.599
So advice is tough
because there's not an,

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:25.640
oh, that's the way you
solve that kind of problem

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.840
situation for everybody.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.900
I think the thing
that I would suggest

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.560
is that the person who's
dealing with this, first off,

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.200
that sounds really tough.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.750
And that must be very
hard, particularly

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.540
to feel like everybody
else seems like they're

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.910
dealing with it OK and I'm not.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.830
I know that's not fun.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.050
I'm not going to say I
understand every single thing

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.008
everybody goes through.

00:46:52.008 --> 00:46:52.970
I don't.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:57.050
But that's something I
know a little bit about.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:01.460
So I can't give you
specific advice.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:08.120
But what I can say is
that taking that step

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:15.661
to speak to somebody about
it, an particularly somebody

00:47:15.661 --> 00:47:17.410
who's a mental health
professional I think

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.950
is really important.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.440
That can be really
scary though too.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.890
Oftentimes you're overcoming
a huge amount of inertia

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.595
to not do anything.

00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:28.970
I've run into
people who have had

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:31.370
maybe occasionally bad
experiences with one therapist

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:33.590
and they're like, I don't ever
want to see somebody again,

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:34.173
it's terrible.

00:47:34.173 --> 00:47:36.380
Or there's a lot of
stuff hung up on that.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.480
And it could be many reasons.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:44.550
The first thing I
hope is that they

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:50.010
have a peer around them who they
can speak with openly about.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.200
And I hope everybody
thinks about

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.060
that as maybe you're that peer.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.150
It's one of your co-employees.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.030
It could be anybody
who's saying this.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:01.530
And this is not
an uncommon thing.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:12.520
People in this situation are
afraid, typically, very afraid.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.300
And even if you don't deal
with this stuff yourself,

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.030
you can have an
immense positive impact

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.810
on someone's life by simply
helping them not feel

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.220
like they have to be afraid.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.180
And it doesn't mean fixing
their problem for them.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.820
But what it means is that
you're not going to judge them.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.370
You're not going to view
it as a character flaw.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:41.240
You're going to listen
empathetically and be

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.680
encouraging towards them.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.080
Say hey, it's OK.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.770
We're going to figure this out.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.770
The thing that I would
probably do in this case,

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:50.660
from a practical
standpoint, it sounds

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.170
like there's good
resources here at Google,

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.580
in your EAP and other things.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.590
I would look at what
those resources are.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.690
I would identify
somebody who specifically

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.350
deals with depression.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.600
And I'd go try to speak with
a professional about that.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.680
That can be scary.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.570
But it is harder and
it's probably not

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:16.700
going to get better until
you start seeking treatment.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:21.200
And I guess I'd ask
everybody around here, again,

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.050
if we're speaking
openly and honestly

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.780
and positively about
mental health, that

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.570
is something that's going
to help people like this

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.760
be more willing to get
the help that they need

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.080
and not have to suffer.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.880
This is exactly what
I'm talking about when

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.200
I say people suffer in silence.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:44.360
And so practically speaking,
you want to get help.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.370
If you need somebody,
find someone hopefully

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:48.364
that you can trust
who maybe you can

00:49:48.364 --> 00:49:50.030
talk about this a
little bit with if you

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.310
need some help
getting to that point

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.507
where you can seek out help.

00:49:54.507 --> 00:49:56.090
And maybe they can
help you with that.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.820
Be a person, folks
here, be a person

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.150
who somebody could turn to and
say, I'm scared to do this.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.080
Can you help me?

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.510
Could you maybe help me
set up the appointment?

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:10.700
Could you maybe go with
me and just sit outside.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:14.660
I constantly run into folks
who are afraid to go seek help.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:19.704
And just being that person
for them and saying,

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:20.870
yeah, I'm going to help you.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.380
If you need, I will call
to set that appointment up.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:29.260
But I'm here for you,
whatever you need.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.610
Being that person is what
this person needs the most.

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:36.430
And it's going to be a lot
easier for them, I think,

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.240
if we can all do that.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.480
So that's why I'd say, look at
what you've got in your EAP.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.920
The woman who
spoke earlier I bet

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.440
would have some specific
stuff you could help with.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.940
Just go and talk
and say-- you don't

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.080
have to spill your whole guts.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.996
Just say, hey, I've been
having some problems.

00:50:51.996 --> 00:50:53.620
I think it's related
to depression.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.790
I would like to speak
privately with somebody.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.690
That's all you've got to do.

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.580
And that's the first
step to getting better.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.680
And there is treatment.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.480
There are things
available for you.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.899
This can and will get better.

00:51:07.899 --> 00:51:09.440
Just got to go seek
the help and find

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.505
the people who can
help you with it.

00:51:11.505 --> 00:51:14.079
So yeah, that's what I'd say.

00:51:14.079 --> 00:51:16.620
SPEAKER: And being mindful of
the time, if you have questions

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.800
for Ed, you can always
approach him after the talk,

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.580
as he mentioned a
little bit earlier.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.520
I do have one question
of my own as well.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.180
Just in your experience
speaking on the lecture circuit

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.230
and also just working
with companies,

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.100
are there any success
stories or any use cases

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.280
that you've seen
examples from folks

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.730
you've spoken with at companies?

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:43.090
ED FINKLER: Yeah, the
first thing I'd say

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.970
is that I can speak
to this directly

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:51.400
in that when I go up and
speak about this stuff,

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.620
every time I speak I
have people come up to me

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:57.490
and say how important it was
for them to just hear somebody

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:01.360
speak openly without
fear about mental health,

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:06.729
that just that act can be
transformative for them.

00:52:06.729 --> 00:52:08.520
And that is humbling
because that is weird.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.100
I'm just up here
babbling about stuff.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.680
I'm oversharing and
acting like I'm an expert.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680
I don't know if I am.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.850
I don't know.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:21.290
But just that, I
guess, if you're

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.120
talking about success
stories, I see

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.650
that as a big success story,
because every time I talk

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:26.900
about it, people tell me that.

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:35.160
We have some examples in
our handbook specifically

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.680
that talks about some choices
that certain companies have

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.420
made.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.810
I think that the
employee programs

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:49.560
that they have at Keen IO that
were developed by Dr. Jennifer

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.812
Akullian, who is one of
our board members, really,

00:52:52.812 --> 00:52:55.020
really significant and cool
stuff that they're doing,

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.680
essentially a coaching
program for everybody--

00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.660
really cool stuff.

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.530
And so it's not just
mental health stuff,

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.220
but it's also like--

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.120
God, I hate this
term-- life coaching.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.350
But let's imagine that
it's not as weird as it is.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:13.034
So stuff like that I
think is really helpful.

00:53:13.034 --> 00:53:14.325
There's a company called Olark.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:20.340
One of the key things that
they do, and also Keen

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:24.421
does, is that they,
in the absence of--

00:53:24.421 --> 00:53:25.670
let me step back for a second.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.100
In the absence of
actively telling people

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.620
it's OK to talk about this
stuff and to seek help,

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.340
the default in our culture
is going to be a negative.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.760
The default is
going to be people

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.290
falling back and
assuming that they

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.670
can't talk about it safely.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:43.300
So companies must
actively inform

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.510
about the resources they have
and about the values that they

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.120
have that this is OK to discuss.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.550
So that means you can't
just put it in a handbook

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:53.739
that somebody gets when
they start their employment

00:53:53.739 --> 00:53:55.780
and then throw it in their
desk and they're never

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.070
going to look at it again.

00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.880
You have to actively remind
people again and again,

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.976
via multiple ways
of communicating,

00:54:03.976 --> 00:54:05.350
that this is
something that's OK,

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.650
that our values at this
organization are such.

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:09.532
You must do that.

00:54:09.532 --> 00:54:10.990
And the companies
I think have been

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:13.810
most effective at dealing with
that have been companies that

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.810
make that part of their values
and their DNA, their culture,

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:19.630
all the time, that
this is just as

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:21.564
important as every
other health aspect.

00:54:21.564 --> 00:54:23.230
And we are going to
talk openly about it

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.040
and we are going to
actively remind you

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.040
that these are the resources
that are available.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.560
And that yes, you
can take a day off.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.670
Reminder, you can take a day
off if you are feeling down

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.640
or stressed out or really
anxious or things like that.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.110
You can do that, and that's OK.

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:39.910
And that's just as
valid as if you're sick

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:41.743
or you hurt your back
or anything like that.

00:54:41.743 --> 00:54:43.660
It means you're not well
and you can do that.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.040
And that is perfectly valid.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.980
But people need to be
actively reminded of that.

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.560
I think that that's a key thing.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.542
SPEAKER: All right.

00:54:51.542 --> 00:54:53.000
Well thanks so much
for joining us.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:53.700
ED FINKLER: Well thank you.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.630
Thank you for having me.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.790
SPEAKER: Very engaging talk.

00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:55.530
ED FINKLER: I really
appreciate it.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.060
SPEAKER: And we
appreciate your time.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.070
Thanks everyone for coming.

00:54:58.070 --> 00:54:59.630
And we'll see you next
time, Talks at Google.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:00.546
ED FINKLER: Thank you.

00:55:00.546 --> 00:55:03.820
