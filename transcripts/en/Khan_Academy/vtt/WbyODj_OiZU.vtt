00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.885
I studied for an
English test today

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:05.570
and learned 80 vocabulary words.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.630
In 10 days, I will have
forgotten every word.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.100
The number of words that I
remember t days after studying

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.380
is modeled by-- so W of t, so
this is the number of words I

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.250
have in my head as a function of
time is going to be equal to 80

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.990
times 1 minus 0.1t squared
for t is between 0 and 10,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.270
including the two boundaries.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.800
That's why we have
brackets right over here.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.470
What is the rate of
change of the number

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.036
of known words per day two days
after studying for the test?

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.660
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.830
and try it on your own.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.340
So the key here is we come up
with this equation for modeling

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.650
how many words have retained
in my brain every day

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.060
after I first
memorized them, after I

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.007
got the 80 of them into my head?

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.340
And that's this expression here.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.130
And they want to know
the rate of change

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.890
two days after studying.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.780
Well, the rate of change,
I can take the derivative

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.850
of this with respect to time.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.030
So let's do that.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.100
So let's take the derivative.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.630
The derivative of
the number of words

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.330
I know with respect to time is
going to be equal to-- well,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.980
we have this 80 out front.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.520
That's just a constant.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.690
And now I can apply the
chain rule right over here.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.020
So the derivative
of 1 minus 0.1t,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.050
the whole thing squared with
respect to 1 minus 0.1t is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.300
going to be-- so I'm essentially
taking the derivative of this

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.170
whole pink thing, this whole
expression squared with respect

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.520
to the expression.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.538
So that's going to be
2 times 1 minus 0.1t.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.670
And now I can find
the derivative

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.350
of this inner expression
with respect to t.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.420
So the derivative of this inner
expression with respect to t

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.490
is just going to be 0 minus 0.1.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.560
So it's just going
to be negative 0.1.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.380
And of course, we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.130
This is going to be equal
to-- if we take 80 times 2

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.940
is 160 times negative 0.1,
that's going to be negative 16.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.662
160 times 0.1 is 16, so
negative 16 times 1 minus 0.1t.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.140
And if we want, we
could distribute the 16,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780
or we could just
leave it like this.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.002
But we're ready now to
answer our question.

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:45.710
We could write this
as the rate of change

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.600
of the number of words we
know with respect to time.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.550
Or we could use the
alternate notation.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.760
We could say this
is W prime of t.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.680
Either way, it's going to
be equal to this thing.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.130
Let me do that same color.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:07.096
It's equal to negative
16 times 1 minus 0.1t.

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:08.220
So what's this going to be?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.950
What is the rate of change
of the number of words

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.130
known per day two days
after studying for the test?

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.220
Well, we just have to evaluate
this when t is equal to 2.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:36.470
So W prime of 2 is going to be
equal to negative 16 times 1

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.446
minus 0.1 times 2
close parentheses.

00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:46.070
And that's going to
be equal to-- well,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.300
let's see, what is this?

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.640
This is 1 minus essentially 0.2.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.850
This is going to be 0.8.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.940
So this is going to be
equal to negative 16 times--

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.580
is that right?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.330
1 minus 0.2 is-- yep, it's
going to be times 0.8.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.830
And what is that going to be?

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.140
If I were to multiply 16
times 8, it would be 128.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.340
It's 2 times 8 times
8 so 2 times 64, 128.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.120
So this is going to
be negative 12.8.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.620
And just to really hit the
point home of what we're doing,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.780
the rate of change is
negative 12.8 words per day.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.320
So if you believe this
model for how many words

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.790
we know on a given day,
this is saying on day two,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.180
right at the day
two point, right

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.290
after exactly two days after
studying for the test, right

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.670
at that moment, I am essentially
losing 12.8 words per day.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.790
The number of words
I know is decreasing

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.268
by 12.8 words per day.
