Melinda: I'm Melinda Gates, I'm co-chair of
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
What I would like to say to Anita and so many
other girls around the world is that many

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.110
of us are working on your behalf and we realize
it takes a lot of things to change society

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.270
for girls.
Whether that's laws around education policies,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.710
laws around child protection, laws around
property right.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.439
And changing programs to think about how we
reach girls because a lot of times you're

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.949
not reaching the education system.
And I think that if we change the programs

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.480
so that we reach you in other places out in
your village, you can lift yourselves up economically

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.160
and make your way into college and onto school
and a better life.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.610
And so we applaud Anita and all she has already
done and those that she also encourages in

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.220
this struggle.
