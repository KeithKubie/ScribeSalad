the platypus has five x chromosomes and

the platypus has five x chromosomes and
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.599
the platypus has five x chromosomes and
five Y chromosomes you can ask the

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609
five Y chromosomes you can ask the
 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.009
five Y chromosomes you can ask the
question why I can't give you an answer

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019

and once the platypus is microchipped

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940

there we go it's released back into the

water just let them go dolly we hope to

learn how much difference there is

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949

just do not occur and there are no

occurring in those areas and so we're
 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.100

looking at what kind of effect these
