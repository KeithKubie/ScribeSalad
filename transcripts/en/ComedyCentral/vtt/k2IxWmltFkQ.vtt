- I grew up, um,
like, a reserved kid.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.586
I was, uh--yeah,
I didn't, like,

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.855
do any drugs or drink through
high school.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.758
I didn't smoke cigarettes--
cigarettes were bad, you know?

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.595
And, uh, so,
I went to college,

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.363
and I was like, "I'm gonna
keep doing that."

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.433
And, um, then I met this girl,
and she smoked cigarettes,

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.934
and I was like,
I love cigarettes.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.268
They're so great.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:46.272
Uh, I love everything about 'em.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:50.276
And, uh--and so I--okay,
I went to school, uh, in L.A.,

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.211
and I lived in a dorm
on the corner

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.347
of Exposition and Figueroa.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.616
And, uh, I don't know if
you know that neighborhood,

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.317
but...[chuckles]. Ugh!

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:02.788
Uh, and, uh, we were watching
a local news program

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:06.358
in my dorm room one night
called "The Action News."

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.528
And I've always loved that name.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.396
Action in your news!

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.199
Yeah, election coverage
with tits!

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.635
Uh, so we're watching it.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.204
There's a top, ten, um,

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.639
every night
on "The Action News."

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.474
And this top ten was
the top ten places

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:26.145
in Los Angeles
with the most beatings.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.148
[laughing]
Like, could you use

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.884
any other language besides--
beatings!

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.185
[grunting]

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.154
It was like--
we couldn't believe it.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:37.056
We watched the whole thing,

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.557
they got to number one.

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.059
Number one place in L.A.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.427
with the most beatings

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:45.331
is the corner of Exposition
and Figueroa.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.166
And they showed a picture
of the Chevron

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.001
we went to every day
to buy cigarettes.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.003
And I was like, all right, well,
we're quitting cigarettes.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.172
For sure.
Uh, no more smoking.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:56.375
Really do not need that
in our lives, cool.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.611
So anyway, like six months
later, I took a bunch of acid

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:02.514
and went to the beating Chevron
to buy cigarettes.

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:05.284
And I should say,
this is, uh,

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:06.685
my first time ever taking acid,

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.554
so acid hadn't made me sad yet.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:11.424
Uh, I don't know--
if you haven't taken acid,

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.359
it's a great drug.
You got to take it.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.927
But you only get six times.

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.630
You'll get six times,
and then your seventh time,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.200
it's just, like, images of
people dying,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.968

shot in the face, and then,

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.802
you quit doing drugs, you're
depressed for seven years,

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.771
and start stand-up comedy--
hi, I'm Dave Ross.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.974
Nice to meet you.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:33.045
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:37.716
I, uh--yeah, so,
we were happy, you know?

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.218
First time.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.920
We--we'd been dating
for six months.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.921
We're in love.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.222
Let's just dance around

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:44.323
and look at all the lights
and colors.

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:45.657
This is gonna be wonderful.

00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:50.063
Yeah, Watts has so much
to offer us tonight.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.597
And, uh, so we're
just sort of, like,

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.899
dancing up to the Chevron,
and I walk up to the window,

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.335
and I'm like, I'll have a pack
of Marlboro lights, please.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:58.604
And then I give him
a ten-dollar bill.

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.273
The guy gives me back a pack
of Marlboro lights

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:04.243
and $15.

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:07.413
Which is extra.
Um...

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.481
And look,
I'm a pretty honest guy.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:12.418
Normally, I would just
give the money back.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.520
You gave me extra.
Take this.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.489
But I was on fucking
acid at the time.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.992
And hone--I don't care
how honest you are.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:22.762
Your immediate gut reaction...
[laughs]

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.965
to getting extra money is always
just, "Hell yeah.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:28.201
Keeping this."

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.135
And acid--
all it does is it takes

00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:31.270
whatever emotion you're feeling

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.272
and multiplies it by 10 million.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.141
So, this guy gives me
extra money.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.443
I look at him and say,
out loud,

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:41.781
Oh, yeah!

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:45.450
Ooh, yeah, I am rich, man!

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.554
No more problems for Dave Ross.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.624
I'm showing my girlfriend
as we both, simultaneously,

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.793
Monty Burns our way
across the street, you know?

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:57.130
Talking about all the houses
and boats and cars

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.733
we're gonna buy with
all our new money.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.234
And as we're doing that,

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:04.737
the door of the Chevron
flies open.

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:07.406
The dude from inside goes
running across the street

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:09.341
and starts screaming
at me in my face.

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.144
"Give me my money!
You took my money!

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.379
Give me that money back!"
And I don't know what happ--

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.048
it's five bucks,
but I was like,

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.483
It's mine.
You're not getting this.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.652
And so, I pulled out my wallet.
It was in my pocket.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.321
And I showed him, there's no
money in the wallet.

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:24.823
And of course, the screaming
person is reasonable.

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:27.493
Uh, so what he did was,
he took my wallet

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.528
out of my hand,
ran across the street,

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.497
locked himself in the Chevron,

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.866
and called the cops on me.

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:38.170
I mean, you know, or on himself
for stealing my wallet.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.072
But either way,
I'm on acid now,

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:42.041
and the cops are coming.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.076
So, the next emotion
I'm filled with

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.745
is just epic fear.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:48.614
I had a bag of weed
in my pocket.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.182
I gave it to my girlfriend,
I was like,

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:53.753
Baby, take this and
never come back.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.723
She just grabbed it from me,
said, "I'll miss you,"

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:59.192
and just ran.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.526
And I don't know--
I don't know.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.527
There was something about
seeing her run

00:06:02.527 --> 00:06:04.363
that just put me in this, like--

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.298
I can do this, man.

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:08.200
It just changed--
it was fear,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.536
and now it's courage,
and I turned around,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.872
and in my head, all that was
happening was just, like...

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.207
[humming dramatic music]--
you know what I mean?

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:17.709
[humming dramatic music]

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:20.746
I was like--"Kashmir" by Led
Zeppelin's playing in my head

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:22.648
as I'm walking up the hill
to the Chev--

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.450
it wasn't a hill,
but it felt like a hill,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.551
you know what I mean?

00:06:26.551 --> 00:06:28.954
And I'm walking up the hill
to the Chevron,

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:31.323
and as I'm thinking,
I got to do this, man.

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:33.091
Oh, my parents can't find out.

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.728
I can't go to prison.
I got to make it through this.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.797
And as I'm thinking
all that crazy shit,

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:42.501
I, uh, I hear, "Hey!

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.971
"Hey!

00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:48.940
Hey!"

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.610
And I look over, and there is

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.980
a police officer
in a full uniform

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.981
staring at me.

00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:59.685
And I am staring at him.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.656
Don't think that that happens to
cops that often.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.624
I think normally, if a cop
talks, everyone's like,

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:08.794
"Ha ha, sorry, sir.
Ah, here I am!

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:12.097
Apologies."

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:13.966
But this cop was like, "Hey."

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.535
Actually, he was probably
just going, "Hey."

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.136
Uh...

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:21.974
But I was hearing, [howling].

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:23.109
[grunting]

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.444
Uh...[chuckles].

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:29.515
So, I just don't even move
as he stares at me.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.984
He stares at me, "Hey,"
and I'm just like,

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.019
What the fuck do you want?

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:35.954
Just looking at him--
we stare at each other

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:39.224
for minutes, prob--well, it was
probably ten seconds,

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.626
but, you know,
we stared at each other

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.362
for like 5,000 years,
for sure.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.231
I'm looking at him, and he
breaks, eventually.

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:49.135
And he goes, "Hey, man.
What happened here?"

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:53.473
And I just looked him dead in
his eyes and said, "Everything."

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:56.308
And then he said, "All right,

00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:57.877
you're on drugs, for sure."

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.978
And that's when
I started crying.

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:03.082
[laughing] I just started
crying immediately.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.317
I am! [sobbing]

00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:07.520
I didn't even try to lie.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.755
I am on drugs!
I'm sorry, sir.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.257
Don't call my dad!
Do you know my dad?

00:08:12.257 --> 00:08:15.161
[sobbing]
I'm sorry!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.262
And after that, I could only
say those two words.

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:19.765
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:21.867
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:24.503
And he's just like, "Oh, my God.
Calm down, man.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.372
"I'm not here to bust you.

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:29.508
"I just came for the--I--

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:32.844
I'm gonna go talk to that guy
over there."

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:35.514
So he went, and he talked
to the guy in the Chevron.

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:39.685
Came back like 17,000
years later, you know?

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.420
Hands me my wallet back,
and he's like,

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.023
"Do you have the guy's money?
I was like, Sure. Here you go.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.692
Uh, and he goes, "Listen.

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.895
"Like I said,
I'm not here to bust you.

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:52.632
"I just want you to be safe.
Please tell me,

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.967
what drugs did you
take tonight?"

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.102
In my head, I was like,
eh, can't be acid.

00:08:57.102 --> 00:08:58.604
Acid's too messed-up!

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:00.072
So I just panicked and said,

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:03.409
"Ah, meth."

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.779
And...[laughs].

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.548
He's like, "Meth?"
I was like...[laughing].

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:12.450
Not much, but yeah.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.554
Yeah, meth,
so, I do meth.

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.223
Ah!

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.558
He's like, "Oh, my God.
Go home.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.593
"Would you please go home?

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:24.563
You live over there, right?
You go to school here? Go home."

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:27.733
And I was like, Okay.

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:31.837
I'm sorry.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.475
And as I'm walking away,
I get like ten steps away

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:39.912
from this cop, and he stops me
and runs after me,

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.613
and he's like, "Oh, wait.
One more thing.

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:43.582
Was that your girlfriend I saw
walking away before?"

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:44.783
And I was like, yeah.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:46.652
And he goes,
"Dude, walk her home.

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:50.288
Don't you know how many beatings
there are in this neighborhood?"

00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:52.191
Thank you guys so much.
I'm Dave Ross.
