Speaker 1:          00:00          I know Robbie was angling for a fight with Darren till, but after Mazda all start steering until, which was the nasty man. People sleep a Mazda though. They do or do not know why I don't understand it. Go back and watch those backyard fights. That guy's been going at it a long time. Hey man, any man that's [inaudible] to both backyard but he just had again this weekend. Yeah, I know. That was crazy. It's not about, it's about, um, you know, you can't just talk like nowadays this era, you could just say whatever you feel like you could say what you want because he's social media. You want to get fans on your side and this and that. And he just happened to say it to the wrong guy at the wrong time. Like that. That's the situation. And you did it backstage to massive. Don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Like know mutual. I think I, I think it's mutual respect with me and mass with all, like I respect him, you know? I mean if we have to fight, we have to fight one day, but you know, like we feel the same when it's like if you're going to talk shit online when I see you keep the same energy. Like when I saw Ben asks went backstage, the only thing that stopped me from pushing his head through that wall back there, it was the fact that I almost blacked out blacktop when I was walking towards him. Then I realize Dana was right behind. So you were angry. It wasn't that I was angry. It was the fact that Bro, like if you're, you're, you came at me online like you had a problem with me. Like you, she started talking mad shit to me. Like you had a problem like saying things, putting up memes and all this.

Speaker 1:          01:33          To me that means like you have a problem. I don't know what I did to you, but you've got a problem with me. So when I see you now, like I want you to still have that same energy. Don't just act like we're cool. Like what's up bro? Yo, you want to hug it out. Don't act like that. Act like you still have the problem. Same problem. Well you think he's just trying to mark it. I mean Ben not ever happens. That's fun. Anger, that's attitude towards that. But that's what I'm saying. That's the thing. Like people are kind of letting them off for certain things now. Now what happens if mass for dog would have starts him like that? Yeah. Backstage because he did talk shit to what happened if that was him mass for it all starts like that. What happens? Yeah. You know, so that was my thing is I, when I saw him backstage, I almost wanted to push his head through the wall, you know, but not realize Dana's behind me.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Brian's mind. What happens if it all now in uh, in, in England because they don't like that shit over there. I don't know why, but I think he got away free Scot free. Really? I think, I know I haven't heard anything and everything's fine. He's in the back already. That's hilarious. But that's the case cause that's a salt. Yeah. But I mean, I guess you could say it's hard. It's hard to say assault when you're dealing with UFC fighter. Right. It's so hard. Like he played basketball off the cob. Solutely it's hard to say this. It's a tricky, tricky situation. Right, but he struck him out in the parking lot. Yeah, I have to a baseball game but I think data and then Dana put out a statement saying that that can't happen anymore. We got to do a better, something like that. We should do a better job of having security around two separate guys.

Speaker 1:          03:06          They didn't know. My father didn't let me near. Ben Asked when or a core cold dead. Yes. There was one time, not before this fight, but before previous fight where you were backstage. It was actually, was it a press conference? It was press conference and you were trying to talk to Colby. Like what's up man, I'll schedule it. Yeah. I was scheduled to fight Santiago [inaudible] in balls. That's right. And we were doing a big press conference and they happened to have like, I didn't even know he was there cause they hit, they had them hidden away the whole time. It wasn't until you are going to get on the bus to go to the press conference. He came downstairs like we were all meeting in the lobby and I saw him and right away I told her, I said, I don't know what it is. I just, I stopped my boy.

Speaker 1:          03:48          I just started your blood. My blood just started bawling. I started duct to a read. I was, I read man, that's not gonna work. That's not work. You'll, you got moving, reuse. Like we're getting him right now. We're moving and read, put it, puts him in a different car and every, all the other fighters ride together. And this is what I mean, he's already isolated. That's so fun. So we get there, but we have to line up to walk out. So he's lined up and he's just happened to be in my vicinity and I just free, I was trying and I was like, yeah, I'm not going to say, I'm not going to say I'm not gonna say nothing. I just look at him. Yo, I see you was talking all that shit online now. Now we in person, you can't talk. What's up with all that shit you was talking online, you thought she was tough.

Speaker 1:          04:28          What's up with that was that tough guy now and he's just like, I think he was reading his lines like what he was going to say when he got out there and Prescott, he uses like Wheaton and he heard me and he's like, shit, I don't want to say nothing. Shit. I could get my eyes. What bright here. I don't want to do that. And I could say all those thoughts was contemplating and Whitaker was standing next to him and Whitaker does one of these joint like look around, fuck this dude talking to, cause I had to watch the video over and over where it could look bad. Like he ain't talking to me and then saw Kobe is like, oh he's talking to Kolby. So Winokur just kindly slid off to the side and I'm getting, I'm like, what's up with all that shit you was talking.

Speaker 1:          05:10          And then he's like quiet, quiet. And then he sees the security kind of cause then they heard me and security kind of walks. I didn't even know there was a camera back there. Uh, and then security walks up and security's like, Yo, Yo, no, no, we don't need this. We don't need this. And this was, uh, what press con Kobi was about to fight. This was after that Conor. Khabib bus situation. Yes. And so they're like, Yo, who don't need this this week. We don't need this. And now once this security, he goes, he goes, stick, stick to stick to a network. Television Junior. Stick to this boy. You know, I'm like network television. What does that mean? Because I guess he was fighting in his first fight on now on paper view. But this is the thing, you were on Fox. Yeah. But this is the thing is he had never headline of car. To this day, I don't think he's ever headlined the card.
