00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.280
In this unit I'm going to teach about colors and materials. The application uses

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.630
the GPU to compute a color for each pixel and displays it on the screen. We'll

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.534
examine how this color is defined and what limitations there are in displaying

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:14.732
them. In the second half of this unit, we'll show how to create and control

00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:18.959
different types of materials. We won't go quite as far as this demo does in it's

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.452
selection of materials. It has some interesting styles that we'll discuss more

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:25.861
in the unit about shader programming. However, by the end of this unit, you'll

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:29.363
have a fair sense of how these images are formed. You should have a good start

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.685
on color theory and how materials are used. To get a flavor for the sorts of

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:37.232
materials you can apply to a surface give this demo a try now. You'll see the

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:39.373
link in the additional course materials.
