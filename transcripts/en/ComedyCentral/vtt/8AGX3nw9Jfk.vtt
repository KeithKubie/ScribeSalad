Okay, okay, okay. Let us know
in the comments

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.972
if you think that lava lamps
are cultural appropriation.

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:09.443
Cut. As always, good effort.
Some positive news,

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.245
the company’s expanding
medical coverage,

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:13.513
so you should all have insurance
by the end of the quarter.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:14.781
What does that mean?

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.216
Really, Hannah?

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.886
Okay, Doctor Ryan, explain
to me medical insurance.

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:20.654
Medical insurance is ...

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.724
It’s insurance
that you need for-

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.093
Nice. Hannah, can you
not bully Ryan?

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.028
He can’t help that he’s
the [bleep] of the group.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.331
Now, these policies
are very specific,

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.766
so I want you
to make sure you read

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.468
every word
of these packets,

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:37.037
including the fine print
and Braille.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.739
Pass.

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:46.914
You’re here early.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.415
Yeah. I didn’t go to sleep yet.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.651
My doctor just started me
on 50 milligrams of Vyvanse.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.185
It’s like Adderall on speed.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.121
I read this book twice,
I wrote a screenplay

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.656
and I organized
my barbecue collection.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.425
Are you sure that our insurance
covers psychiatric care?

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.031
Doctor Cleo isn’t a psychic.
She’s legit.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.600
My insurance card is actually
like a Six Flags VIP pass.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.001
For drugs.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.236
So you didn’t have to pay
for your Vyvanse?

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.437
I just show the pharmacy my card

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.705
and they give me
whatever I want.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.407
I’m never taking
this thing off.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:14.641
’Sup, geezers?

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.877
Hey. Whoa! Hannah, what happened
to your face?

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.212
Preventative Botox. This is
just the initial swelling.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.847
Doctor said it’ll go down
in like three weeks.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.082
Where did you go?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.318
A pop-up. In the back of a van.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.086
Are you sure you went
to a real doctor?

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.355
Yes, Nate. I’m not an idiot.
Our insurance covered it.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:29.823
Can you believe
I didn’t have to pay a dime?

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.124
Yes.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.360
I don’t think that our insurance
covers Botox.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.563
Did you not read page
11 of the packet?

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.131
I don’t know, that seems wrong.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.466
Exactly, it’s insurance.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.035
How’s it going down there?

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.870
Jesus, Jordan.
Are you okay?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.707
If by ’okay’ you mean ’tall’,
then I am better than okay.

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.675
By four inches exactly.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.377
Took a lot of stretching
and implants,

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:53.847
but I will be good to go
in about 37 rehab visits.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.315
Where’d the extra bones
come from?

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.583
My dad donated them.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.818
What happened to him?

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.152
He’s just shorter now.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.654
Jordan, height is
a pre-existing condition.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.422
Page 36, read the packet, Nate.

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.291
You guys all read
that big-ass packet?

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.093
I can’t even get you
to read my emails.

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:07.928
That’s because
they offer us nothing.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.733
I found an experimental doctor

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:15.535
that gives humans
reptile features.

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.574
There are rats
in the walls.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.876
Do snake eyes allow you
to sense heat now or something?

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.580
Oh no, I now there are rats
in the walls

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.281
because I put them there.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.818
My snake eyes are actually
purely cosmetic.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.720
Okay, seems clear to me

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.223
that you are all cheating
the system in various ways.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.326
It’s at least good to know
that we have full coverage.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.028
Full coverage?

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.768
No, we’re just lucky that all
our procedures are unnecessary.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.370
Sir?
Huh?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.672
Hey. Buddy, I just got word
that your insurance company

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.241
does not cover
emergency appendectomies,

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.575
so I’m going to have
to put this bag

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:56.810
of poison
back inside of you.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.011
But it’s already out.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.646
I don’t make the rules, sir.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.882
Didn’t your employee provide you
with an information packet?

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:05.318
I was busy reading the emails.
So many emails.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.557
Do I still have to do
this?
