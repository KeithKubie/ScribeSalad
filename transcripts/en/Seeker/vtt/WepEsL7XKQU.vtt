00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.050
Yeah!

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.050
I caught my Pikachu.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.559
Guess I got my exercise in for the day.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.460
Hey there gamers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.099
How are those weight loss resolutions holding
up in 2017?

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.570
Are you still going to the gym, or have you
fallen victim to playing that new video game

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.880
Santa gave you this year?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.509
OR even better, maybe you’re losing weight
while playing video games ...maaaybe.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.689
I know, you hear all these inspiring stories
about shedding pounds through a few rounds

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.440
of DDR, but can we really count walking around
the block a few times to catch a Squirtle

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.250
as actual exercise?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.660
In case you missed it, this mobile phone game
came out last year that ticked off a lot of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
people, it’s called Pokemon Go, and it forces
players to physically move around in the real

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.800
world to catch animals.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.080
Despite memes making fun of gamers finally
going outside and meeting daylight for the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.310
first time, there have been scientific studies
on walking around to catch Pokemon!

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.170
One 2016 study published in The British Medical
Journal surveyed 1,182 participants between

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.440
the age of 18-35 with an iPhone 6 (which would
track the steps each participant took).

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.220
Players step counts were then compared before
and after the installation of Pokemon Go.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.290
Before they installed the game, participants
took an average of 4,256 steps per day…

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.590
During the first week of gameplay this number
increased to 5,123 steps!

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.590
Before, gradually, falling back down to even
less than the pre-Pokemon average around the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.880
6 week marker, to only about 4,000 steps.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.880
Womp womp.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.790
Even if you took the peak number of steps
into account and assume these steps were taken

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.890
at a pace of 4 km/h, which is the assumed
average in the study...that equals only 11

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.270
minutes a day of exercise, which is a small
increase.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.790
And since that increase didn’t stick, it’s
hard to claim that this video game provides

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.060
a lot of additional exercise at all.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.020
By the way, there’s no set number of steps
you should take a day, but definitely aim

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.090
for more than 5,000; 10,000's even better.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.130
Now sure, that’s just walking.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.720
What about other games like Wii Fit, Nintendo’s
at-home exercise game?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.830
The Wii Fit was designed to be exercise, right?

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.030
Well, it's not, at least according to a study
conducted by the American Council on Exercise.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.240
In their study, participants first used a
treadmill while both their breathing and heart

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.730
rate were monitored – this was their fitness
baseline.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.120
Then, they played what the researchers decided
were the “most aerobically challenging”

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.110
Wii Fit games, all the while still having
their oxygen and heart rates monitored.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.750
After comparing the baseline to the Wii Fit
games, they found that the running-based games

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.190
most resembled actual exercise, burning about
5.5 food calories (5.5kcal) per minute.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.970
But in order to compare to running on the
treadmill, they would have to burn 10 food

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.190
calories per minute – give or take, depending
on your actual weight.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.190
Bottomline?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.620
The Wii Fit still is still isn’t as good
for you as actual exercise.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.550
The thing is, even though it’s not marketed
as exercise, there may be a game that counts.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.710
And if you play it, you know what I’m talking
about.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.000
According to a study in the Cardiopulmonary
Physical Therapy Journal – Dance Dance Revolution

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.760
is totally exercise.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760
DDR.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.750
The game requires players to sync movements
to music and follow along stomping on pads,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.040
spinning and… well… dancing!

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.880
Resarchers instructed study participants to
play for 30 minutes 3 times a week.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.150
At the end of the study, results showed an
average BMI decrease of about 2% for women

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.220
and 7% for men – and that was only after
6 weeks!

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.300
I know BMI isn’t the perfect measurement,
but it’s something!

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.980
The CDC recommends at least 75 minutes of
“vigorous-intensity aerobic activity”

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.500
a week, so it makes sense that this would
work as exercise, because participants did

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.610
more than that.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.890
We should mention that this is only aerobic
exercise.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.860
The CDC also recommends muscle-strengthening
exercise at least 2 days a week.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.540
But come on, DDR came out in 1998.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.510
What’s in store for 2017?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.780
Two words: virtual reality.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.780
Of course.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.670
The Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology
published a study showing weight loss from

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.099
female participants after they watched avatars
of themselves in virtual reality practicing

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.230
healthy lifestyles like walking on a treadmill
or eating smaller portions in the virtual

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.230
worlds.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.380
Apparently, simply watching their VR selves
be healthy, inspired them to be healthier

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380
too.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380
And that’s just the beginning.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.989
At the 2016 Virtual Reality Summer Expo companies
like Blue Goji designed controllers to be

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.380
strapped to your elliptical device, which
are then synced with your VR headset.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.809
And on top of that, there are even VR headsets
which make exercise less horrible.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.349
Do not tell me to go to that dance bicycle
stuff, I rather bike in VR.

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.710
So are videos games really exercise?

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.900
Mostly not, at least right now, but that answer
depends on what you play.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.300
DDR and VR games (with extensive equipment)
will increase your heartrate which is great,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.889
but are those truly video games...or more
just an exercise routine disguised as a video

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:40.889
game?

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.340
Something to think about as you walk around
trying to find that elusive Dragonite.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.310
And exercise doesn't just help your body,
it also helps your brain.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.580
For example, in this video we tell you how
exercise can improve your memory.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.270
Let us know down in the comments if you played
any of these games and what you thought about

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.099
them and thanks for watching DNews.
