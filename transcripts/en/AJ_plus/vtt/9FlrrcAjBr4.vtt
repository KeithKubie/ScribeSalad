00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
Nabi Saleh: A tiny village in the
occupied West Bank that has been waging

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.520
a sustained, unarmed resistance movement
against Israel's military rule.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.980
This is the birthplace of Ahed Tamimi, the Palestinian

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.560
teenager who confronted armed Israeli
soldiers in front of her house ...

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.060
and served eight months in prison.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140
Her slap reverberated around the world,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.560
catapulting her into the international
spotlight as a symbol of Palestinian resistance.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.280
In the days leading up to her release,
I came to Nabi Saleh to learn Ahed's backstory,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.180
and to experience for myself
daily life in this village, which is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.180
being choked by an illegal Israeli
settlement and which suffers regular

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.520
violence from the occupation forces. I
wanted to hear what lies ahead for the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.280
young generation of Palestinians growing
up under an occupation with no end in sight.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.920
We're in the Palestinian town of Nabi
Saleh, in the occupied West Bank, where

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.100
Ahed Tamimi grew up. And right across the
road over there is the illegal Israeli

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.880
settlement of Halamish. And the
presence of those settlers, and the many

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.980
soldiers deployed here to protect them,
has made life for villagers in Nabi Saleh a living hell.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.940
These are regular scenes in Nabi Saleh. Israeli soldiers

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.409
firing tear gas, skunk water,
rubber-coated steel bullets, and even

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.640
live ammunition, while unarmed
Palestinians march carrying flags and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.500
banners, and sometimes throwing stones.
For the past decade, the villagers have

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700
led a popular nonviolent resistance
movement to protest the Israeli settlers'

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.950
creeping confiscation of their land and
resources. This resistance campaign began

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.930
in 2009, after settlers took control of a
natural spring that's owned by one of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.820
the elders in the village. The Tamimi
family traces its roots back to Nabi

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.620
Saleh for hundreds of years. More than
500 people live here, most of them

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.940
extended family. Across the road, the
Israeli settlement of Halamish was

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.280
created in 1977. It's one of more than
200 settlements in the West Bank built

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.870
on occupied Palestinian land, in
violation of international law. Before

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.920
you can even enter Nabi Saleh, you have
to pass by the settlement and an army

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.030
base to protect it. An army observation
balloon with cameras monitors the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.340
village at all times. International law
allows Palestinians to resist occupation,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.660
even via armed struggle within the
bounds of the laws of armed conflict. The

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.120
villagers of Nabi Saleh have chosen a nonviolent path.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.780
But the Army's response has been anything but nonviolent.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.340
Ahed’s life changed on December 15, the day

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.780
her 15-year-old cousin, Mohammad, was shot
in the head at close range by an Israeli soldier.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.400
His injuries were so severe, he had to be
put into a medically induced coma, and he

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.480
lost an entire part of his skull.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.580
Hours after Mohammed
was shot, Ahed confronted two armed

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.800
soldiers in front of her family's house.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.240
The incident was filmed and shared on
social media by her mother, Nariman,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.650
who would later be arrested and charged
with incitement. Millions around the

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.730
world were captivated by the image of a
young girl showing no fear as she hits

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.840
out at heavily armed soldiers.
Four days after, Israeli soldiers came to

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.460
her house in the middle of the night and arrested her.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.480
While filming around Nabi Saleh, we were stopped several times by various Israeli soldiers.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.600
So they just told us that we're not allowed to film that either.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.600
And we were stopped by a guard for the settlement.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.860
What are we allowed to film?

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.260
– Not the settlements?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.800
– OK. Is that a law?

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.520
– In the Torah. Oh OK, so we're following the law of the Torah so no filming the settlements.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.020
– Don't photo.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.500
OK, alright.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.080
A few miles outside of Nabi Saleh, Israeli

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.760
soldiers threw a stun grenade at us for
filming around a checkpoint.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.080
– OK, Alright. Put the camera down. I don't speak Hebrew, I'm an American jour–

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.540
OK, OK.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.900
Like elsewhere in the West Bank,
childhood for the youth of Nabi Saleh

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.740
is anything but normal. For many here,
it's not a matter of if they'll get arrested, but when.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.220
Because of that, the
adults in the village organize regular

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.480
training sessions where they simulate
the experience of getting arrested,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.300
detained and interrogated to teach the
children their rights and what to expect.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.440
During her hours-long interrogation, Ahed remained silent, refusing even to say her name.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.780
As many as 700 Palestinian children under the age of 18 from the

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.040
occupied West Bank are prosecuted every
year through Israeli military courts.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.700
They're not accompanied by a parent, and
are often interrogated without a lawyer

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.050
or being informed of their right to
silence. Over the last three years, the

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.980
Palestinian child prisoner population has doubled.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.740
Ahed's first cousin, 11-year-old Samer, became known as "Spider-Man," because he regularly dressed up as his

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.860
favorite comic book hero during the
weekly marches. He liked how Spider-Man

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.450
helped people and thought wearing his
costume would give him special powers.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.260
I asked him what happened to his eye.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.020
There are so many remnants of tear gas and sound-bomb

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.050
canisters left behind by Israeli
soldiers, Samer's family hung them up in

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.800
front of the entrance of their home. His
mother, Manal, told me why.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.600
Manal says she’s been injured countless

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.040
times during the villages protests – one
time even getting shot in the leg with a live bullet.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.080
And she's been arrested
three times. The last time was during a

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.920
women's sit-in outside the military court at one of Israel's prisons, one week after Ahed was arrested.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.240
Why did they hit you when you were
arrested the last time?

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.700
Just days after she was released,
Israeli soldiers arrested her teenage

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.400
son Mohammed from their home. And like Ahed's arrest, it happened in the middle of the night.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.480
I asked Manal why they arrested him.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.700
Stone-throwing is the most common charge levied against

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:14.670
Palestinian children and is punishable
by up to 20 years in prison under

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.750
Israeli military law. After being
arrested, children are taken to

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.500
interrogation, where they're often tied
at the hands and feet, denied food and

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.170
water, and are physically and verbally abused.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.020
Manal says her son Mohammed's
interrogation was so severe, it nearly broke him.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.180
Mohammad's brother Osama, who was

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:23.100
arrested 10 days after him, was forced to watch his brother's interrogation – a form of psychological torture.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.580
How do you feel, as a mother, having two sons in Israeli prison right now?

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.020
Israel's occupation, which is more than half a century old and with no end in sight,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:04.770
puts Palestinians in the West Bank under
Israeli military law and a system that

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.910
denies them the legal rights of citizens.
Israeli settlers living in the same

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:13.650
territory have full democratic rights
and are governed by Israeli civilian law.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:18.480
That means a Palestinian and an Israeli
settler can commit the same exact crime,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.830
but be tried in different courts, with
different outcomes. Under the military

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.230
court system, Palestinians face a
conviction rate higher than 99%.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.280
This dual and discriminatory legal
system has been denounced by many in the

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.020
international community as exemplifying apartheid.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.140
As part of the preparations

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.760
for Ahed and her mom's return home,
they're about to raise a Palestinian flag right now.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.840
I wanted to visit their
home to see how the rest of the family

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.040
was doing – with half of its members
imprisoned by Israel. Ahed's older

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.690
brother, Waed. has also been in jail since
May, serving an 18-month sentence for

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.860
throwing stones. Her father, Bassem, is one
of the leaders of the grassroots

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.180
resistance here. He's been arrested by
Israel several times and was tortured in jail.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.820
You guys filmed Ahed as she slapped
the soldier, and you decided to publish

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.580
the video knowing very well that she might be arrested she might go to prison. Why did you do that?

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.320
Knowing that she went to jail because of the video, do you regret publishing it?

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.080
You would do it again?

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.560
Why do you say that it's normal?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.280
In the meantime, the emotional scars left on his children

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.050
are evident. Bassem says his son Mohammed,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.130
nicknamed Abu Yazan, copes with the
absence of his mother, sister and brother

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.200
by telling himself that they're just
away on vacation.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.440
He's in denial.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.160
But that's not where the trauma
for these children ends. Earlier this

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.650
year, Samer witnessed his 21-year-old cousin,

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:12.580
Izz Al-din Tamimi, get shot and killed in
his backyard by an Israeli soldier.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.700
The following footage is graphic.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.180
Israeli soldiers left Izz bleeding for 30

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:37.069
minutes before eventually transferring
him to a military vehicle. Once there, he

00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:40.400
was held for another 15 minutes without medical attention.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.840
The soldiers then surrendered him to an
ambulance. But it was all too late.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.200
The trauma that children like Samer
witness is even apparent in the games they play.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.880
Ahed's story has cast a spotlight on a new generation of Palestinian youth – their plight, their

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.900
hopes and their increasing influence in
the resistance against Israel's rule

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.010
over them. It's a generation with less
loyalty to the different political

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.390
factions, and growing disenchantment with
the Palestinian Authority, whose security

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.380
forces have coordinated closely with
Israel for more than two decades.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:03.360
What do you think Ahed's generation will
accomplish that your generation wasn't able to?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.360
12-year-old Salam is Ahed's
youngest brother.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.920
While Ahed's incarceration made
international headlines, it is not unique.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.880
Last year, Israel arrested 1,467
Palestinian minors. And there are

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:09.330
currently around 60 Palestinian females
in Israeli prison, many of whom have

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.799
longer and harsher sentences than Ahed.
The lack of attention other prisoners

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.420
get is a reality that Ahed's own family
members acknowledge.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.380
Ahed has captivated the world partly because she is a woman, she's a female –

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.440
As the hours count down for Ahed and her

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:04.120
mother's return home, the future for this
village and for the Palestinian people remains grim.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.379
It's been almost a decade
since you guys started your marches and

00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:11.370
protests. And during these past years
you've lost so many relatives – they've

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.300
lost their lives or they've been in jail. Do you think it was worth it, and was it the right strategy?

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.960
In part 2 of this series ...

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.520
This is total chaos right now.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.620
Ahed Tamimi is released from prison in a chaotic and emotional day.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.520
I sit down with the Palestinian teen icon to hear what's next for her.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.760
Hey guys, it's Dena and that's life in Nabi Saleh.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.540
Make sure you check out part 2 of this
series, which is the day of Ahed Tamimi's

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.260
release, and my one-on-one interview with
her. Please make sure to like and share
