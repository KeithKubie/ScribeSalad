00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.790
Why are we here? Where do we come from? And

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.390
what will become of us in the future? There are so

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.200
many big questions out there that science, specifically geneticis, has

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.600
some amazing answers for. Now in this course so far, we've

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.410
just begun to understand the fundamentals that scientists and researchers

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.660
are using every day to try to answer these questions. If

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.990
you've made it this far, then you've been equipped with

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.830
the essential knowledge you need to go to the next step.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.730
All you need to do is keep asking questions. And

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.420
fan the flame of curiousity and doubt. Genetics is the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.900
central subject tying all the major facets of biology together.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.150
And explaining the driving force behind evolution. Now while the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.650
future of personalized medicine is about to come crashing down

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.170
on top of us whether we want it to or

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.100
not. My passion for genetics remains rooted in the simple

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.180
curiosity about the origin of life and the human condition.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.520
I think Malcolm Potts and Roger Short summed it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.710
up best in their biology textbook about the evolution of

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.720
human sexuality. At one extreme there are those who

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.260
like to think that a chicken is merely an egg's

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.090
way of making another egg. Or maybe, as Richard

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.150
Dawkins would have it, the soma is merely the product

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.080
of an ageless battle between selfish genes striving for mastery

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.590
and seeking propagation through succeeding generations. Our life on earth

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.900
has not been a series of discontinuous acts

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620
of creation. But it is an unbroken thread

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.960
tying us all to our ancestors. And with

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.420
the potential of linking us to the innumerable

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.030
future generations. We are indeed trailing clouds of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.510
glory. The glory of billions of years of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.340
continuous evolution. We do not create life, we

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340
have only the privilege of passing it on.
