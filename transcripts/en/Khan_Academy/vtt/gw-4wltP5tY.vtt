00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.510
What I want to do in
this video is make sure

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.480
that we're good at
picking out what

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.890
the normal vector
to a plane is, if we

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.780
are given the
equation for a plane.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.680
So to understand that, let's
just start off with some plane

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.660
here.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.790
Let's just start off--
so this is a plane,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm drawing part
of it, obviously it

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.620
keeps going in every direction.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.850
So let's say that is our plane.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.680
And let's say that this is a
normal vector to the plane.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.720
So that is our normal
vector to the plane.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.570
It's given by ai
plus bj plus ck.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.700
So that is our normal
vector to the plane.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.520
So it's perpendicular.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910
It's perpendicular
to every other vector

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.210
that's on the plane.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.460
And let's say we have
some point on the plane.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.000
We have some point.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.150
It's the point x sub p.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.462
I'll say p for plane.

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:50.670
So it's a point on the plane.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.470
Xp yp zp.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.880
If we pick the origin.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.680
So let's say that
our axes are here.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.140
So let me draw our
coordinate axes.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.569
So let's say our coordinate
axes look like that.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.260
This is our z-axis.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.660
This is, let's say
that's a y-axis.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.900
And let's say that
this is our x-axis.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.760
Let's say this is our
x-axis coming out like this.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.070
This is our x-axis.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.490
You can specify this
is a position vector.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.880
There is a position vector.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.985
Let me draw it like this.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.460
Then it would be behind the
plane, right over there.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.200
You have a position vector.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.550
That position vector would
be xpi plus ypj plus zpk.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.480
It specifies this
coordinate, right here,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.167
that sits on the plane.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.500
Let me just call that something.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.400
Let me call that
position vector,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.940
I don't know-- let
me call that p1.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.390
So this is a point on the plane.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.810
So it's p-- it is p1
and it is equal to this.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.294
Now, we could take another
point on the plane.

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:02.960
This is a particular
point of the plane.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.730
Let's say we just say, any
other point on the plane, xyz.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.490
But we're saying that
xyz sits on the plane.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.080
So let's say we take this
point right over here, xyz.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.170
That clearly, same logic, can
be specified by another position

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.360
vector.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.180
We could have a position
vector that looks like this.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.570
And dotted line.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.950
It's going under the
plane right over here.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.610
And this position
vector, I don't know,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.130
let me just call it p, instead
of that particular, that P1.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.009
This would just be
xi plus yj plus zk.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.800
Now, the whole reason
why I did this set up

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.180
is because, given some
particular point that I know

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.480
is on the plane, and any other
xyz that is on the plane,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.570
I can find-- I can construct--
a vector that is definitely

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.242
on the plane.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:50.700
And we've done this
before, when we

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.826
tried to figure out what the
equations of a plane are.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:55.450
A vector that's
definitely on the plane

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.440
is going to be the difference
of these two vectors.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.500
And I'll do that in blue.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.080
So if you take the yellow
vector, minus the green vector.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.450
We take this position,
you'll get the vector

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.000
that if you view
it that way, that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.240
connects this point
in that point.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.690
Although you can
shift the vector.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.920
But you'll get a vector that
definitely lies along the plane

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.490
So if you start
one of these points

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.520
it will definitely
lie along the plane.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.870
So the vector will
look like this.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.280
And it would be lying
along our plane.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.250
So this vector lies
along our plan.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.780
And that vector is p minus p1.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.130
This is the vector p minus p1.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.880
It's this position vector minus
that position vector, gives you

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.380
this one.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.390
Or another way to view
it is this green position

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.190
vector plus this blue vector
that sits on the plane

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.060
will clearly equal this
yellow vector, right?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.945
Heads to tails.

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:45.455
It clearly equals it.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.080
And the whole reason
why did that is we

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.190
can now take the dot product,
between this blue thing

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.410
and this magenta thing.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.780
And we've done it before.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.860
And they have to be equal to 0,
because this lies on the plane.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.040
This is perpendicular
to everything

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.870
that sits on the
plane and it equals 0.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.790
And so we will get the
equation for the plane.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.420
But before I do
that, let me make

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.150
sure we know what the components
of this blue vector are.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.082
So p minus p1, that's
the blue vector.

00:04:11.082 --> 00:04:13.290
You're just going to subtract
each of the components.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.140
So it's going to be x minus xp.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:26.930
It's going to be x minus
xpi plus y minus ypj plus z

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.030
minus zpk.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.310
And we just said,
this is in the plane.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.432
And this is, this
right, the normal vector

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:35.390
is normal to the plane.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.740
You take their dot product--
it's going to be equal to zero.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:48.540
So n dot this vector is
going to be equal to 0.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.400
But it's also equal to this
a times this expression.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.560
I'll do it right over here.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.180
So these-- find some good color.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:05.910
So a times that, which is ax
minus axp plus b times that.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.420
So that is plus by minus byp.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.110
And then-- let me make
sure I have enough colors--

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.110
and then it's going to
be plus that times that.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.920
So that's plus cz minus czp.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.840
And all of this is equal to 0.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.330
Now what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to rewrite this.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.341
So we have all of these
terms I'm looking for, right?

00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:34.840
Color.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.060
We have all of the x terms-- ax.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.440
Remember, this is any
x that's on the plane,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.990
will satisfy this.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.330
So ax, by and cz.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.180
Let me leave that on
the right hand side.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.754
So we have ax plus by
plus cz is equal to--

00:05:52.754 --> 00:05:54.170
and what I want
to do is I'm going

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.330
to subtract each of
these from both sides.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.860
Another way is, I'm going
to move them all over.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.740
Let me do it-- let me
not do too many things.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.130
I'm going to move them
over to the left hand side.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.010
So I'm going to add
positive axp to both sides.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.740
That's equivalent of
subtracting negative axp.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.230
So this is going
to be positive axp.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.980
And then we're going to have
positive byp plus-- I'll

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:23.670
do that same green-- plus byp,
and then finally plus czp.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.839
Plus czp is going
to be equal to that.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.130
Now, the whole reason why
did this-- and I've done this

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.310
in previous videos, where we're
trying to find the formula,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.060
or trying to find the
equation of a plane,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.340
is now we say, hey, if
you have a normal vector,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.470
and if you're given a point
on the plane-- where it's

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.410
in this case is
xp yp zp-- we now

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.939
have a very quick way of
figuring out the equation.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.230
But I want to go the other way.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.040
I want you to be
able to, if I were

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:57.510
to give you a equation for
plane, where I were to say, ax

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.200
plus by plus cz, is equal to d.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.000
So this is the general
equation for a plane.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.460
If I were to give
you this, I want

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.840
to be able to figure out the
normal vector very quickly.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.180
So how could you do that?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.470
Well, this ax plus by
plus cz is completely

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.839
analogous to this part
right up over here.

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.130
Let me rewrite all this over
here, so it becomes clear.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.540
This part is ax
plus by plus cz is

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.360
equal to all of this stuff
on the left hand side.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.110
So let me copy and paste it.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.290
So I just essentially
flipped this expression.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:41.300
But now you see this, all of
this, this a has to be this a.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.510
This b has to be this b.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.190
This c has to be this thing.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.490
And then the d is all of this.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.099
And this is just
going to be a number.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.890
This is just going to
be a number, assuming

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.200
you knew what the
normal vector is,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.824
what your a's, b's
and c's are, and you

00:07:51.824 --> 00:07:53.150
know a particular value.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.351
So this is what d is.

00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:57.600
So this is how you could get
the equation for a plane.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.433
Now if I were to give
you equation or plane,

00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:00.550
what is the normal vector?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.424
Well, we just saw it.

00:08:01.424 --> 00:08:03.830
The normal vector, this a
corresponds to that a, this b

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.280
corresponds to that b, that
c corresponds to that c.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.460
The normal vector to
this plane we started off

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.240
with, it has the
component a, b, and c.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.110
So if you're given
equation for plane here,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.830
the normal vector to this
plane right over here,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:28.340
is going to be ai
plus bj plus ck.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.950
So it's a very easy thing to do.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.190
If I were to give you
the equation of a plane--

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.100
let me give you a
particular example.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.620
If I were to tell you that
I have some plane in three

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.830
dimensions-- let's say it's
negative 3, although it'll

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.320
work for more dimensions.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.850
Let's say I have negative 3
x plus the square root of 2

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.860
y-- let me put it this
way-- minus, or let's say,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.052
plus 7 z is equal to pi.

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:58.010
So you have this crazy--
I mean it's not crazy.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.620
It's just a plane
in three dimensions.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.970
And I say what is a normal
vector to this plane?

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.755
You literally can just pick
out these coefficients,

00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:08.460
and you say, a normal
vector to this plane

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.580
is negative 3i plus
the square root of 2

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.870
plus 2 square root
of 2 j plus 7 k.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.687
And you could ignore
the d part there.

00:09:19.687 --> 00:09:21.270
And the reason why
you can ignore that

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.170
is that will just
shift the plane,

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.320
but it won't fundamentally
change how the plane is tilted.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.060
So a this normal vector, will
also be normal if this was e,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.880
or if this was 100, it would be
normal to all of those planes,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.630
because all those
planes are just shifted,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.456
but they all have
the same inclination.

00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:42.580
So they would all kind of
point the same direction.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.709
And so the normal vectors would
point in the same direction.

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:47.500
So hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.450
We'll now build on this
to find the distance

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.540
between any point in three
dimensions, and some plane.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.739
The shortest distance that
we can get to that plane.
