00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:02.660
I think we're now ready to get
into the meat of the proof.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.160
In the last video, we
said if we can just

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.580
prove that each of these
parts are equal to each other,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.850
we essentially have proven
that that is equal to that.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.830
Because here in
yellow is another way

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.623
of writing the flux across
the surface and here in green

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:17.220
is another way of writing
the triple integral

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.827
over our region of
the divergence of f.

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:21.410
And what I'm going
to do in this video

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.260
and probably in
the next video is

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.580
prove that these two are
equivalent to each other.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.830
And I'm going to prove
it using the fact

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.520
that our original region
is a simple solid region,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.240
in particular is
a Type 1 region.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.030
And then that's
essentially going

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.500
to be it because you can
use the exact same argument

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.260
and the fact that it is a
Type 2 region to prove this,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.210
and the exact same
argument and the fact

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.720
that it is a Type 3
region to prove that.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.140
So I'm going to assume
it's a Type 1, which I can.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.130
It's a Type 1, 2, and 3 region.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.790
So given the fact
that it's Type 1,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.777
I'm now going to prove this
relationship right over here.

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:09.360
And then I'll leave it up to you
to do the exact same argument

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.490
with a Type 2 and
a Type 3 region.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.890
So let's get going.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.410
So Type 1 region, just
to remind ourselves,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:26.350
a Type 1 region is
a region that is

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.770
equal to the set of
all x, y's and z's such

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.060
that the xy pairs are a member
of a domain in the xy plane,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.640
and z is bounded
by two functions.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.940
z's lower bound
is f1 of x and y.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.220
And that's going to be
less than or equal to z.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.190
And z's upper bound, we
can call it f2 of xy.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.100
And then let me close the
set notation right over here.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.390
And let me just draw a general
version of a Type 1 region.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.710
So let me draw my
x, y, and z-axes.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.940
So this is my z-axis.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.930
This is my x-axis.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.470
And there is my y-axis.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.160
And so we might have a
region D. So our region,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.340
I'll draw it as a little
circle right over here.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.370
This is our region D. And
for any xy in our region D,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.050
you can evaluate the function f.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.420
You can figure out
an f1, I should say.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.760
So this might define an f1,
which we can kind of imagine

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.500
as a surface or a
little thing that's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.460
at the bottom of a
cylinder if you want.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.913
So every xy there,
when you evaluate

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:55.150
or when you figure out
what the corresponding f1

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.155
of those points in
this domain would be,

00:02:57.155 --> 00:02:59.640
you might get a surface that
looks something like this.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.490
It doesn't have to be flat, but
hopefully this gives the idea.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.190
It doesn't have to
be completely flat.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.330
It can be curved
or whatever else.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.130
But this just shows you that
every xy, when you evaluate it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.010
right over here,
it gets associated

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.650
with a point, this lower
bound surface right over here.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.520
And I'll draw a
dotted line to show

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.020
that it's only for the
xy's in this domain.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.790
And then we have an upper bound
surface that might be up here.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.840
Give me any xy.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.849
When I evaluate f2, I
get this surface up here.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.890
And once again, they don't
have to look the same.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.000
This could be like a dome
or it could be slanted

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.250
or who knows what it might be.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.110
But this will give
you the general idea.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.174
And then z fills up the region.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:40.590
Remember, the region isn't
just the surface of the figure,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.070
it's the entire
volume inside of it.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.200
So when z varies between that
surface and that surface,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.890
for any given xy in our domain,
we fill up the entire region.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.500
So we can fill up
this entire region.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.750
And this is the way I drew it.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.416
It looks like a
cylinder, but it doesn't

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:01.030
have to be a cylinder like this.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.620
And these two surfaces might
touch each other, in which case

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.260
there would be no
side of the cylinder.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.610
They could be lumpier than this.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.470
They might be
inclined in some way.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.020
But hopefully, this is
a good generalization

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.440
of a Type 1 region.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.870
Now, a Type 1 region, you
can kind of think of it,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.660
it can be broken up
into three parts.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.240
It can be broken
up into surface--

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.990
or the surfaces of a Type
1 region, I should say,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.385
can be broken up
into three parts.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.780
Let's call that surface one.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.490
Let's call this right
over here surface

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.770
two, the top of the cylinder
or whatever kind of lumpy top

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.730
it might be.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.170
And let's call the side, if
these two surfaces don't touch

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.090
each other, let's call
that surface three.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.390
There might not necessarily
even be a surface three

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.150
if these two touch each other
as in the case of the sphere.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.040
But let's just assume that there
actually is a surface three.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.030
So if we're evaluating
the surface integral--

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.290
we'll think about this
triple integral in a second.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.690
But let's think about how
we can rewrite this surface

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.690
integral right over here.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.802
This entire surface
is S1 plus S2 plus S3.

00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:12.260
So we can essentially
break this up

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.490
into three separate
surface integrals.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.276
So let's do that.

00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:16.650
Just remember
we're just focusing

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.230
on this part right over here.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.000
So the surface
integral of R times

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.058
k dot n, the dot
product of k and n,

00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:33.410
ds can be rewritten as the-- let
me write it this way-- can be

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.840
rewritten as the
surface integral

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:49.202
over S2 of R times k dot n ds,
plus the surface integral-- I'm

00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:50.660
just breaking up
the surface here--

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.134
plus the surface integral
over S1 of R times k

00:05:57.134 --> 00:06:04.940
dot n ds plus the surface
integral over surface three

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.760
of the same thing,
R times k dot n ds.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.450
Now, the way I've drawn it,
and this is actually the case,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.060
S3 is if those surfaces
don't touch each other.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.320
And for Type 1 situation
right over here,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.290
the normal vector
at any given point

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.660
on the side of the cylinder
for this Type 1 region--

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.149
if there is this
in between region.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.940
There always isn't.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.230
In a sphere, there wouldn't
be this surface, in which case

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.896
this would be 0.

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:31.760
But if there is this surface in
a Type 1 region, the one that

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.590
essentially connects the
boundaries of the top

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.540
and the bottom, then
the normal vector

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.040
will never have a k component.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.870
The normal vector will
always be pointing flat out.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.950
It will only have an
i and j component.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.820
So if you take this normal
vector right over here

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.450
does not have a k component
and you're dotting it

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.760
with a k vector, then the dot
product of two things that

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.250
are orthogonal, the k
vector goes like that,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.520
you're going to get 0.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.690
So this thing is going
to be 0 because k

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.830
dot n is going to be 0 in this
situation for this surface.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:08.480
k dot n is going
to be equal to 0.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.380
So this part right
over here simplifies

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.250
to this right over here.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.740
Now in the next video what we
can do is essentially express

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.770
these in terms of
surface integrals,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.414
but in terms of double
integrals over this domain

00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:26.080
right over here.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.810
We'll kind of evaluate
these surface integrals.
