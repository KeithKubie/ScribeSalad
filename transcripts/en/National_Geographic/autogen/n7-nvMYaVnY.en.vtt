our group our research team has been

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
our group our research team has been
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.089
our group our research team has been
working in southern Tanzania for a few

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099
working in southern Tanzania for a few
 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.589
working in southern Tanzania for a few
years now and we've found a very

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
years now and we've found a very
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.589
years now and we've found a very
exciting new type of crocodile this

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599
exciting new type of crocodile this
 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.020
exciting new type of crocodile this
animal is very small compared to what

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
animal is very small compared to what
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.630
animal is very small compared to what
you think of for typical crocodiles the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
you think of for typical crocodiles the
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.090
you think of for typical crocodiles the
skull was about three and a half inches

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
skull was about three and a half inches
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279
skull was about three and a half inches
in length it would easily fit in the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
in length it would easily fit in the
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.790
in length it would easily fit in the
palm of your hand and the the rocks in

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
palm of your hand and the the rocks in
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880
palm of your hand and the the rocks in
which this animal were found that are

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
which this animal were found that are
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.740
which this animal were found that are
dated at about a hundred and five

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
dated at about a hundred and five
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569
dated at about a hundred and five
million years so it's actually quite old

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
million years so it's actually quite old
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.600
million years so it's actually quite old
it's during the time of the dinosaurs

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610
it's during the time of the dinosaurs
 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.729
it's during the time of the dinosaurs
during the Cretaceous period and what's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
during the Cretaceous period and what's
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.240
during the Cretaceous period and what's
so special about this new crocodile its

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
so special about this new crocodile its
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580
so special about this new crocodile its
what the teeth look like in this and if

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
what the teeth look like in this and if
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010
what the teeth look like in this and if
you were to find just the tooth from

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
you were to find just the tooth from
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.170
you were to find just the tooth from
this animal there's no way that you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
this animal there's no way that you
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000
this animal there's no way that you
would ever think it was a crocodile of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
would ever think it was a crocodile of
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.270
would ever think it was a crocodile of
any kind a couple of other interesting

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
any kind a couple of other interesting
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369
any kind a couple of other interesting
things about this new crocodile that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
things about this new crocodile that
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.299
things about this new crocodile that
once again make it stand out is that the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
once again make it stand out is that the
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189
once again make it stand out is that the
nose openings the nose holes if you will

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
nose openings the nose holes if you will
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.950
nose openings the nose holes if you will
actually were directed forward instead

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
actually were directed forward instead
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710
actually were directed forward instead
of up and that's very suggestive of an

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
of up and that's very suggestive of an
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719
of up and that's very suggestive of an
animal that in fact does not live in

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
animal that in fact does not live in
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390
animal that in fact does not live in
water at all but was actually an animal

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
water at all but was actually an animal
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.120
water at all but was actually an animal
it was up and living in what we call the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
it was up and living in what we call the
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800
it was up and living in what we call the
terrestrial or environment or land

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
terrestrial or environment or land
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770
terrestrial or environment or land
living animal and one other interesting

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
living animal and one other interesting
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679
living animal and one other interesting
bit of anatomy about this new animal is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
bit of anatomy about this new animal is
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.530
bit of anatomy about this new animal is
its limbs its foreign hind limbs this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
its limbs its foreign hind limbs this
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450
its limbs its foreign hind limbs this
animal had relatively long and slender

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
animal had relatively long and slender
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.990
animal had relatively long and slender
limbs we might think about it moving

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
limbs we might think about it moving
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.830
limbs we might think about it moving
around quite and quite an agile way

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840
around quite and quite an agile way
 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.630
around quite and quite an agile way
amongst the vegetation the best

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
amongst the vegetation the best
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460
amongst the vegetation the best
comparison of animals that are alive

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
comparison of animals that are alive
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.520
comparison of animals that are alive
today would be something like a standard

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
today would be something like a standard
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700
today would be something like a standard
house cat or you know maybe opossum you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
house cat or you know maybe opossum you
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740
house cat or you know maybe opossum you
know so we're talking an animal of about

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
know so we're talking an animal of about
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.740
know so we're talking an animal of about
that body size

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
that body size
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.110
that body size
one of the things that stands out about

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120
one of the things that stands out about
 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.840
one of the things that stands out about
this crocodile is the nature of the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
this crocodile is the nature of the
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120
this crocodile is the nature of the
teeth and it's very different in a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
teeth and it's very different in a
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.570
teeth and it's very different in a
couple of ways first off it has distinct

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580
couple of ways first off it has distinct
 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.970
couple of ways first off it has distinct
types of teeth instead of having a

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980
types of teeth instead of having a
 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.030
types of teeth instead of having a
district basic conical tooth like you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
district basic conical tooth like you
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.480
district basic conical tooth like you
would see in most crocodiles here we see

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490
would see in most crocodiles here we see
 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.570
would see in most crocodiles here we see
a distinct canine like - followed by a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
a distinct canine like - followed by a
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.040
a distinct canine like - followed by a
series of small conical teeth and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050
series of small conical teeth and
 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.080
series of small conical teeth and
towards the back of the jaw - large

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
towards the back of the jaw - large
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.920
towards the back of the jaw - large
molar like teeth and having teeth that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
molar like teeth and having teeth that
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050
molar like teeth and having teeth that
are distinctive like that along the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
are distinctive like that along the
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.820
are distinctive like that along the
tooth row is is something that we

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
tooth row is is something that we
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830
tooth row is is something that we
typically think of as a mammalian

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
typically think of as a mammalian
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.920
typically think of as a mammalian
feature and if we consider how these

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
feature and if we consider how these
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.350
feature and if we consider how these
teeth may have functioned you might

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
teeth may have functioned you might
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.530
teeth may have functioned you might
consider that those large canine like

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
consider that those large canine like
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.780
consider that those large canine like
teeth at the front of the jaw would have

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
teeth at the front of the jaw would have
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880
teeth at the front of the jaw would have
been used for acquiring the food the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
been used for acquiring the food the
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.910
been used for acquiring the food the
middle teeth are moving the the food

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
middle teeth are moving the the food
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.010
middle teeth are moving the the food
product further back into the mouth and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020
product further back into the mouth and
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.180
product further back into the mouth and
then those molar that's where the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
then those molar that's where the
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.730
then those molar that's where the
business is being done in that those

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740
business is being done in that those
 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710
business is being done in that those
teeth are working together to process

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
teeth are working together to process
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.420
teeth are working together to process
food so to place this Tanzanian

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
food so to place this Tanzanian
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.880
food so to place this Tanzanian
crocodile into a comparative perspective

crocodile into a comparative perspective
I've been doing Museum work in different

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
I've been doing Museum work in different
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.710
I've been doing Museum work in different
parts of the world different parts of

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720
parts of the world different parts of
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.140
parts of the world different parts of
the United States spent time in the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
the United States spent time in the
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.360
the United States spent time in the
Kenyan National Museum in Nairobi Kenya

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
Kenyan National Museum in Nairobi Kenya
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.810
Kenyan National Museum in Nairobi Kenya
and in doing so looking at other

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820
and in doing so looking at other
 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.729
and in doing so looking at other
crocodiles that have been discovered

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
crocodiles that have been discovered
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.490
crocodiles that have been discovered
from in this case East Africa so that's

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
from in this case East Africa so that's
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.160
from in this case East Africa so that's
kind of our first point of comparison

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170
kind of our first point of comparison
 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.530
kind of our first point of comparison
when we find something in Tanzania it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
when we find something in Tanzania it
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180
when we find something in Tanzania it
might make sense well what did the other

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
might make sense well what did the other
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.979
might make sense well what did the other
crocodiles that were alive at that time

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989
crocodiles that were alive at that time
 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.560
crocodiles that were alive at that time
and living close by what did they look

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
and living close by what did they look
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.509
and living close by what did they look
like are they similar are they different

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
like are they similar are they different
 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.699
like are they similar are they different
taken together we see a number of

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
taken together we see a number of
 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.750
taken together we see a number of
features in this group of small bodied

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760
features in this group of small bodied
 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.460
features in this group of small bodied
terrestrial crocodiles that is land

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
terrestrial crocodiles that is land
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.130
terrestrial crocodiles that is land
living crocodiles that is suggestive

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140
living crocodiles that is suggestive
 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.310
living crocodiles that is suggestive
that they may be exploiting a niche that

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
that they may be exploiting a niche that
 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.470
that they may be exploiting a niche that
would otherwise belong to the mammals

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480
would otherwise belong to the mammals
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.600
would otherwise belong to the mammals
and we know that the mammals occupied

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610
and we know that the mammals occupied
 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.070
and we know that the mammals occupied
that niche in the northern hemisphere

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080
that niche in the northern hemisphere
 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.880
that niche in the northern hemisphere
small body size a diversity of different

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890
small body size a diversity of different
 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.610
small body size a diversity of different
skull shapes and tooth shapes so mammals

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
skull shapes and tooth shapes so mammals
 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.809
skull shapes and tooth shapes so mammals
were doing that in the northern

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819
were doing that in the northern
 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.540
were doing that in the northern
hemisphere in the southern hemisphere
