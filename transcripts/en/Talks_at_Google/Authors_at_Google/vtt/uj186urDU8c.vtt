[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:10.580
HAL VARIAN: OK, I'm ready to
do the official introduction.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.580
I'm Hal Varian and I'm
the chief economist here.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.080
I think many of you know me.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.079
Glenn Weyl is a
Principal Researcher

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.660
at Microsoft
Research New England,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.150
and this year he's visiting Yale
University as a senior research

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.730
scholar and lecturer in
the economics department

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.370
and the law school, where
he teaches a joint economics

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.970
computer science course
called "Designing the Digital

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.440
Economy."

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.630
Glen is a townie.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.320
He grew up in Palo Alto,
received his AB in economics

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.880
from Princeton, followed
by an MA and a PhD in 2008.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.580
He then spent three years as
a Junior Fellow at the Harvard

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.060
Society Fellows, and three
years as an assistant professor

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.150
at the University of Chicago,
before joining Microsoft.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.990
And over the period
from 2014 to 2018,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.140
he's been a Sloan
Research Fellow.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
And today he's here to
tell us about his book,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.770
"Radical Markets, Uprooting
Capitalism and Democracy

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.600
for a Just Society."

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.521
Take it away.

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.479
GLEN WEYL: Thanks, Hal.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.110
And thanks everyone for coming.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.240
So this work is the culmination
of many years of careful policy

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.790
design research with Eric
Posner, but in the 10 minutes

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.860
I have to introduce
it, I think, rather

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.200
than going into the details
of all of the proposals

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.210
that we have, it's
best to just give you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.957
a flavor of the
sort of broad idea

00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:41.290
that we're trying to get across.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.630
And I think that
that's best conveyed

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.320
by a thought experiment.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.080
So I want you to,
for the moment,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.420
suspend your practical
considerations

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.120
and come with me on a
journey of imagination,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.230
to a fictive city that I'm
going to call Marketopia.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.200
Marketopia is a
bit like Zootopia,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.170
except rather than
being defined by having

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.700
a diverse group of mammals
that inhabit it, instead

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.740
Marketopia is defined
by the fact that all

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.050
the major private
property in Marketopia--

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.470
let's put aside personal effects
like heirlooms, and pets,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.600
and so forth--

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.510
but all the land,
and the houses,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.780
and the airplanes, and
so forth, is continually

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.520
up for auction to the
highest bidder, in a manner

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.010
somewhat similar to the
way that search terms

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.010
are for Google advertisements.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.810
So basically,
whoever is currently

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.440
the highest bidder on
one of these pieces

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440
of private property controls
it for the time being,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.910
by making a rental payment
continually into a central pot

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.520
until someone else comes
along, and beats their price,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.640
and takes over that
rental payment for control

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.860
of that asset.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.740
And that's not just true of
private property in Marketopia.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.620
In fact, many things that we
would usually consider to be

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.790
determined by collective
decision-making processes,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:25.370
like the location of parks and
the politicians that govern

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.400
Marketopia, what sort of schools
they have, and what they teach,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.460
and so forth--

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.490
these are also determined
by an auction process,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.930
though rather than auctioning
them to the highest bidder,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.030
we add up the total
willingness of everyone

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.800
to pay for different
alternatives,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.620
and we implement the one that
people are willing in total

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.750
to pay the most for.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.030
And all the money that's
raised by these auctions

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.230
is continually returned to
all the citizens of Marketopia

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.560
in equal shares, as
a social dividend,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.530
or you might call it a
universal basic income.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.130
Much as in Norway and
Alaska, when they auction off

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.160
oil rights, they
return the revenue

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.940
that they raise to the citizens.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.640
Now when you hear this
idea of Marketopia,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.210
it might sound like sort
of the most extreme version

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.950
of a free market
that you can imagine.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.700
It's much crazier than
anything that, say,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.620
Adam Smith could have
imagined, because it makes

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.430
you realize that even though
we live in a market society,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.960
most things are not
available for liquid purchase

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.240
at any given point in time.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.610
Most of the land on
the Google campus--

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.640
most of the stock
of Google, in fact--

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.610
not just the marginal units
of stock that are currently

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.010
on bid, but most of the
stock that all of you hold--

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.426
these aren't things
you could just

00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:52.600
go out and buy at some
price at any point in time.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.680
Those are instead controlled
by often-wealthy concentrated

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.460
interests, and if you wanted to
grab control of those assets,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.580
you'd have to enter into
a long and drawn out

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.170
process of bargaining,
and probably

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.140
pay many times what the person
would be willing to accept,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.770
because they'd get wind that
you'd want to buy that thing.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.960
And so Marketopia is a far more
extreme, complete free market

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.650
than any society in history.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.400
And that might lead you to
think, OK, so in Marketopia,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.690
the wealthy are going to
dominate everything, right?

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.440
The wealthy are going
to be able to outbid

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.000
the prices that anyone
else is going to pay.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.350
They're going to take
control of assets

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.270
and they're going to
use that to dominate

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.130
everyone else in society.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.660
But then you have
to ask yourself,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.010
what do you mean by the wealthy?

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.970
Well, a wealthy
person is someone

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.340
who has lots of assets, like
stocks, and bonds, and houses,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.310
and land, and businesses.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.950
But in Marketopia, there
is no private ownership

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.820
of those things.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.620
All of those things
are continually

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.270
auctioned for the
public benefit.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.950
In fact, Marketopia is actually
the most extreme version

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.430
of the sort of common ownership
advocated by people like Karl

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.660
Marx that you can imagine.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.090
Much more extreme than
forms of socialism

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.520
that actually existed,
which ended up

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.720
in the control of those
assets by a concentrated

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.110
bureaucratic elite, that often
ended up tyrannizing over

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.360
the rest of the
population even more

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.210
intensely than the capitalists
that they claimed to replace.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.770
In Marketopia, on
the other hand,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.890
there is true common ownership,
because by construction,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.610
all the value of all assets
flow equally to all citizens,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.870
and by construction, every
citizen has an equal right

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.090
to compete for
control of assets.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.160
This might seem like
a paradox, especially

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.430
to those of us who grew up in
the Cold War and post-Cold War

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.240
periods.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.800
How can the most extreme form of
common ownership, of communism,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.310
go along with the most
extreme form of a free market?

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.630
Well, while that might
seem like a paradox,

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.300
it's actually a
crucial part of what

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.410
was the central tradition
in a field called

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.400
political economy, that
gave birth to economics,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.830
political science, sociology,
and many other fields

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.620
during the late 19th century.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.090
And this idea called competitive
common ownership was especially

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.000
associated with the
work of this guy here.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.980
And I wonder if
anyone recognizes him.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.480
Who is that?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.890
AUDIENCE: Henry George.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.790
GLEN WEYL: Wow!

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.340
This is the first time
anyone has actually

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.176
managed to identify him.

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:46.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.820
GLEN WEYL: Well, I'm glad
I came to the right place.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.550
So you could probably repeat
the following things for me,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.830
but Henry George was
the best-selling author

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.840
in the English language,
other than the Bible,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.460
for about 30 years.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.380
His book, "Progress
and Poverty,"

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.380
was the namesake of the
Progressive movement

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.400
in the United States.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.404
He helped inspire the Chinese
nationalist revolution

00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:13.320
and many other things.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.260
He was an enormously
influential person,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.120
and yet his ideas are largely
forgotten in the post-Cold War

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.320
era.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.159
And the goal of this book is
to revive the tradition that

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:28.950
was represented by
Henry George and others,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.669
like Leon Walras, many of the
founders of modern economics,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.570
who believed that free
markets, true free markets,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:41.385
and true socialism
went hand-in-hand.

00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:44.327
To argue that, while these ideas
were forgotten in mainstream

00:08:44.327 --> 00:08:46.410
culture, they continued
to be developed in a field

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.030
called mechanism design, which
won lots of Nobel prizes,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.190
but was largely applied to
things like auctioning off

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.780
search words at companies
like Google and Facebook,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.810
rather than to the big problems
of social organization.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.810
And to show that we can,
based on this tradition,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.090
have a new way of
organizing society

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.270
to address our most
pressing problems.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.270
And the way that we do
that is by developing five

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.550
detailed, practical
policy proposals,

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:23.730
building off of this spirit,
that instantiate this idea

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.790
and address, we think, some
of the most pressing problems

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.550
of inequality, slow
growth, and social conflict

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.736
over political issues.

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:35.735
So what are those ideas?

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.840
The first, which is
most closely associated

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.610
with this auction
I was describing,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.600
is the common ownership
self-assessed tax, in which

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.020
every owner of significant
private property

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.970
would self-assess the value of
that property at some value,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.940
stand willing to sell the
property at that value,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.040
and then pay a tax on
that self-assessed value.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.760
So this would be a way of
implementing the auction

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.860
that I was describing,
without taking

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.320
all ownership into the public,
so that people would still

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.090
have some incentive
to make investments.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:21.920
So people would still have an
incentive to make investments.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.850
And at the same time,
all assets would

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.070
be liquidly available
for turnover

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.590
to a better potential use.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.380
The second idea is
quadratic voting.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.050
This is a system of
sort of auctioning,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.030
but for collective
decision making

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.610
that would protect
minorities by allowing

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.910
them to express the greater
strength of their interest

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.079
in given issues
compared to majorities.

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.370
The way that it would work,
is that every citizen would

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.980
be endowed with a
budget of voice credits

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.270
that they could spend on
different politicians or issues

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.760
in a referenda that
are important to them,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.760
and they could put more
votes on the issues that

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.510
were more important
to them, but according

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.680
to a very particular rule,
which is that the cost in voice

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.200
credits of influence
on any given issue

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.450
would be the square
of the number of votes

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.960
that you buy on that issue.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.290
Third, we propose a new
system of migration,

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.960
in which immigration
would benefit,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.020
rather than just the
immigrants and the capitalists

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.320
in the wealthy countries,
instead it would

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.700
it would benefit all
citizens, because rather

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.800
than large corporations
or governments

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.500
determining who was
admitted to the country,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.130
instead individual citizens
would have the right

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.760
to sponsor visas for
migrants and to negotiate--

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.760
subject to some protections--
a share of the benefits

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.640
that the migrants received from
migrating to wealthy countries.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.430
So that would allow for
massively increased migration,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.650
but with the broad
support of the working

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.650
classes of wealthy countries.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.150
Fourth, we argue that
antitrust policy is

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.730
an incredibly powerful
tool for maintaining

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.620
a competitive and
dynamic economy,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.450
but that it has been
almost completely

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.770
unenforced in the two most
important areas in which market

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.020
power is accumulating
in our economy,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.440
and therefore we've
been ignoring about 80%,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.410
or maybe even 90%, of
the potential benefits

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.340
of antitrust.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.270
Those two areas are that, first
of all, institutional investors

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.840
like Vanguard, State Street,
BlackRock, et cetera,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.410
now control about a third of
the total corporate economy,

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.400
and are the four or five
largest shareholders of almost

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.690
every major corporation
straight across industries,

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.141
Google and Microsoft,
American Airlines and Delta.

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.640
And therefore, they
have no interest

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.070
in seeing these companies
compete with each other.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.600
And we've seen rising
prices in close correlation

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.740
to the growing power
of these companies.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.565
That's sort of the most
comprehensive market power

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:03.940
that's ever existed,
because it's

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.810
coordinated almost the entirety
of the corporate economy.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.500
Another area that's been
almost completely neglected

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.350
by antitrust policy
has been the power

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.140
that companies have
over workers, rather

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.130
than over consumers.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.010
Because if you think about a
typical consumption decision

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.770
you make, like what
type of water to drink,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.620
there's probably 10 or 15
reasonable alternatives

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.250
you have.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.740
Whereas if you think about a
job, what's your next best job

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.450
rather than working
at Google, it's

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.700
probably a way worse option.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.130
And maybe you have
one other option,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:46.100
but it's much less competitive
than is a typical product

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:46.600
market.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.800
And yet there's literally never
been an antitrust merger case

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.690
that blocked a merger
because of the way

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:58.060
it reduced options for
employment for workers.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.470
And finally, we argue that
the individual contributions

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.080
that people make to
the digital economy

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.920
should be treated as
essentially labor,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.590
and that there should be
a labor movement of people

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:16.000
who are contributing that
data, to organize, to demand

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.540
a fair share of the value
created by their data

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.050
from companies like Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.540
Because increasingly,
people are worried

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.010
about artificial intelligence
taking people's jobs,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.180
but as all of us here know, all
that artificial intelligence

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.160
is trained based on human data.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.500
And it's, in fact, a lot more
like some sort of broadcasting

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.260
of our data than it is
just brilliant engineers

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.450
programming computers to
go and take people's jobs.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.260
And so, if people
were more fairly

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.630
compensated for their
data, the digital economy

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.690
would be a source of economic
opportunity for people,

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.230
rather than an economic threat.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.630
Now all these ideas
are quite radical.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.790
All of them would require
fundamental changes

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.140
to our social institutions.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.160
And while for each of these
chapters, we have concrete,

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.880
near-term, non-controversial
steps we can make in that

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.150
direction, we also know that
as a broad social philosophy,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.090
no one would seriously consider
this if we weren't in a moment

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.960
of social crisis that
really, deeply required new

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.840
out-of-the-box thinking like
this to avoid potentially

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.160
catastrophic outcomes.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.920
But I truly do believe we
are in a moment like that,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.790
for three reasons.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.770
One is growing inequality.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:42.800
On the left here, we see a graph
of the share of national income

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.340
accruing to the top 1% and
the top 0.1% of the income

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.280
distribution, which has
doubled since the 1970s.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.790
And at the same time, we've
seen a dramatic reduction

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.690
in the share of income accruing,
not just to lower income

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.250
workers, but to all
workers in total.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.370
So the share of income
being paid out to labor,

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.060
as opposed to capital, has
fallen by 10% over this period.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.160
Now you might think as, say,
Ronald Reagan or Margaret

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.310
Thatcher would have
argued, that that might

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.100
be worth it if that's the
price of a more dynamic, more

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.870
competitive, more
innovative economy.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.640
But at the same time that we've
seen this declining share going

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.300
to labor, we've seen
an increasing power

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.500
of corporations to
exert monopoly power.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.930
That is represented by
this orange line here.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.540
I've taken the markup
that firms charge--

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.730
that is how much above
their marginal cost

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.710
they charge-- and I've
flipped it around,

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.050
so you can see how
closely it parallels

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.790
the decline in labor incomes.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.010
So that strongly
suggests that, far

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.110
from us getting a more
competitive economy

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.610
by deregulating, cutting taxes,
and relaxing antitrust policy,

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.090
we've actually seen an
increasing growth of market

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:05.930
power that is actually reducing
growth rates in the economy,

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.099
as represented in
this graph here.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.480
So what this shows
is growth rates

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.359
in different
wealthy countries in

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.280
the immediate post-war
period, and then

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.050
various periods thereafter.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.099
And the period of the
last several decades

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.819
has had growth rates that
are, in the United States

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.850
about half, and in many
other wealthy countries

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.510
about a tenth, of what they
were in the immediate post-war

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.550
period.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.720
This combination of stagnation
with growing inequality,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.640
I think, has largely discredited
existing economic ideologies,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.250
as coming out of
Reagan and Thatcher,

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.640
in the same way that the
combination of stagnation

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.430
and inflation during
the 1970s discredited

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.940
the previous
Keynesian orthodoxy.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.020
And this stagnant
quality, as we label it,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.150
and the discrediting of
existing economic ideologies

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.710
has also led to rising political
discontent and conflict.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.840
Together with the fact that, I
think, political institutions--

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.270
not just economic technocracy,
but political technocracy--

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.010
is increasingly being
viewed as illegitimate,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.550
there's growing conflicts
between minorities

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.600
and majorities, whether
over immigration,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.830
ethnoracial conflict,
or over, say, things

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.140
like gun ownership,
religious minorities.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.380
And yet the way that wealthy
countries have increasingly

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:45.260
resolved these issues has
been through the judiciary,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.840
or through supranational
institutions,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.580
in the case of the
European Union,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.100
that lack of the
democratic legitimacy

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.880
needed for countries to
come to some reasonable way

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.080
of resolving this.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.310
So there's an increasing feeling
that the economic policies

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.350
and the way that we
resolve political disputes

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.900
are illegitimate,
and that's leading

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.290
to the rise of populist
leaders, whether on the right,

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.880
like Trump or Brexit
movement, or on the left,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.140
like Jeremy Corbyn in
the United Kingdom.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.440
Given all this, I
think we increasingly

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.710
feel like the only
path out is these sort

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.390
of reactionary
populist movements

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.380
that don't really
offer an answer.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.990
And so we feel
the responsibility

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.150
at this moment to
try to put forward

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.550
an alternative,
progressive path that

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.390
can harness the powers
of market and technology,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:42.800
but to try to make a more equal,
prosperous, and politically

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.510
co-operative society.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.440
And I hope that
you'll open your minds

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.910
to these radical possibilities,
given what we're facing.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.080
And I'm looking forward to
chatting with all of you

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.792
and with Hal about it.

00:19:57.792 --> 00:19:59.000
HAL VARIAN: All right, great.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.879
Very interesting talk, and
let me raise a few objections

00:20:02.879 --> 00:20:03.920
here and there, and see--

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.240
because I know that's
your favorite pastime,

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.330
is responding to
these objections.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.940
You know, they say
a cynic believes

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.910
that everything has a price, but
an economist knows it's true.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.780
So an interesting angle
there on that division--

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.730
this dividing things up, but
then letting people trade--

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.025
what do you do about ability?

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:30.700
Ability Is very tricky, because
suppose you're a great singer.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.030
I love to hear you sing, but
it's very tiring for you.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.080
You don't want to do it.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.740
Can I outbid you, and
say yes, I bid him.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.816
He wants to have a
quiet evening at home,

00:20:41.816 --> 00:20:43.190
but I've got this
money I'm going

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.440
to pay him to go out and sing.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.660
GLEN WEYL: That's
a great question.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.330
We tackle that in the
conclusion of the book.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:54.100
For the main part of the book,
we only allow for capital

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.400
to be allocated in this way.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.610
And we think that, at least
in our present society,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.610
that could address
much of the inequality,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.210
though not all of the
inequality, that we face.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.800
So we calculate that
with our reforms,

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.410
you could get down below
the levels of inequality

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.070
in the 1970s, and significantly
better than in Sweden

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.940
at present.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.660
But obviously, there would then
be a shift towards inequalities

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.330
that are driven more by
ability, and away from those

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.480
driven by wealth,
And those would

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.370
have to be addressed
by future reforms.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.350
And we speculate
in the direction

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.970
that you're describing, Hal,
but we don't have a proposal

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.627
that we're happy with actually
putting forward on that.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.210
HAL VARIAN: Let me
suggest an article.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.690
it was something I wrote.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.487
It was my thesis actually
which was on fair division.

00:21:40.487 --> 00:21:42.070
GLEN WEYL: I know
that work very well.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.250
HAL VARIAN: OK,
well, then you know.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.750
Because there were
a couple of ideas

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.840
there about how you might
deal with this issue

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.210
of either redefining
what would be fair

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.360
when there's differences
in ability, or, in fact,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.000
going the very radical
plan of actually,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.745
I could outbid you to
sing and you'd do it.

00:21:57.745 --> 00:22:00.370
GLEN WEYL: Yeah, so I'm actually
very sympathetic to that idea,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.330
but for a bunch of
practical reasons

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.840
we talk about in
the conclusion, we

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.340
don't think we have a proposal
that actually makes sense.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.650
But at the philosophical
level, you'll

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.797
recognize your own writing in
what we say about that issue.

00:22:12.797 --> 00:22:14.380
HAL VARIAN: And it's
also interesting,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.120
because there is a
practical example.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.590
There were apprenticeships.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.210
So what happened in America--

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.850
I mean before there was
a United States, in fact,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.480
back in the
pre-revolution days--

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.526
you could bring an immigrant in,
and the quid pro quo was they

00:22:29.526 --> 00:22:31.150
worked for you for
seven years, and you

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.770
would teach them a trade.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.800
And so this was viewed
as a very successful way

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.551
to provide education,
and skills, and so on.

00:22:38.551 --> 00:22:40.300
GLEN WEYL: I wouldn't
say that too loudly,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.940
because on the internet, when
we certainly weren't advocating

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.010
indentured servitude,
but we just

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.560
talked about our immigration
system, which is not indentured

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.430
servitude, we got the most crazy
reaction from social media.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.530
So it's a sensitive subject.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.780
HAL VARIAN: Yes, yes, I agree.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.090
And it's also illegal, so--

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.715
GLEN WEYL: Yes.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.140
HAL VARIAN: The
self-assessed tax.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.220
That was kind of fun.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.270
I first heard this idea from
Dick Zeckhauser many years ago.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.950
And he claims that
the Greeks used this

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.172
for assessing to antiquities.

00:23:12.172 --> 00:23:13.630
GLEN WEYL: Yeah,
we talked about it

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.372
in chapter one in some detail.

00:23:15.372 --> 00:23:17.830
HAL VARIAN: And in fact, we
did something very much like it

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.660
for the top-level
domain names, when

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.900
we had this top-level
domain name auction.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.690
So Microsoft and
Google, for example,

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:31.570
both might one .doc as a TLD,
and the way it was resolved is

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.220
you each write down your price.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.240
The high bidder gets it
and pays the other bidder

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.640
the price that it bid.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.280
So it's a kind of
interesting mechanism.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.339
It's not, of course, perfect.

00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:47.130
Any economist could
shoot some holes in it,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.046
but it seemed to work
pretty well in practice.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.010
Data as labor.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.280
Well, we do that now.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.360
We pay labellers of data.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.560
We have just donated
9 million images

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.360
to the Open Image project.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.120
We paid lots of people
around the world

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.460
to label that data
with the contents.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.660
We did the same thing,
4.5 million YouTube videos

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.750
which we had people
label, and that

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.500
goes into the video project.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.450
Consumer panels like Nielsen,
that's around all the time.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.390
So there is a market
for getting people

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:31.880
to provide data labeling or
data of one sort or another.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.060
So it's not unreasonably--

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.950
I mean, it's a pretty
big market, really.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.783
GLEN WEYL: Yeah, I think
that the problem is

00:24:37.783 --> 00:24:39.400
that the vast majority
of data we get,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.470
we collect from
people who aren't

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.500
aware of the productivity
roles that it ends up playing.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.860
And trying to engage
those people more

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.380
and paying them a bit
more for those people

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.219
who are in context, who can
provide additional value.

00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:54.760
And in fact, Google
does a little bit

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.020
of that with the local
hosts and so forth.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.510
But I think trying to make
people more broadly aware

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.780
of that, and trying to create
a structure where they would

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.050
get direct compensation
for improving

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.610
the quality of the
data they provide,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.859
and be aware of the payments
they were getting for all

00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:14.550
of their data, would
in the medium-term

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.060
create the
opportunity for people

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:25.050
to build greater human
capital, really, and contribute

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.080
more online.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.080
HAL VARIAN: Well, there
is this question of what

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.246
the payment would look like.

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:31.650
If you take Facebook
as an example--

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.050
because I think you've
mentioned this--

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.350
Facebook had net
earnings of $10 billion,

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.910
and they claim there
are 2 billion users.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.390
And that means $5.00
a year per user.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.520
And Google has similar
numbers, of course.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.970
So these work out
to pennies per day,

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.760
in terms of the
compensation for information

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.900
that people are providing.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.550
And I would argue--

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.674
I certainly believe
for Facebook,

00:25:55.674 --> 00:25:57.090
and I certainly
believe for Google

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:01.200
and also Facebook, of
course-- a lot of this data

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.160
is used to improve the product.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.680
So people are
benefiting from it.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.344
It's benefiting as a public
good, not as a private good,

00:26:07.344 --> 00:26:08.760
but they get their
private benefit

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.884
from using better products.

00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:11.130
GLEN WEYL: Absolutely.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.580
I think that if we had more
targeted direct compensation

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.009
to people, we would get
larger product improvements.

00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:20.550
I would dispute with
you a little bit

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.633
about some of the numbers.

00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:24.590
I've done different
calculations than that exactly,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.470
but yes, at the moment
things are relatively small,

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.090
I think, by any calculation.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.020
But in a future where
artificial intelligence really

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.050
does come up to take
the role that investors

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.610
are pricing into your company
and into my company, it taking.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.090
I think that if we don't find
a way to directly compensate

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.809
people for the
data contributions

00:26:47.809 --> 00:26:49.350
that they're making,
that are fueling

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.020
those artificial
intelligence, we're

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.978
going to end up with a
lot of what I would call

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:55.620
fake unemployment, where
people are unemployed,

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.750
but not because they're
not contributing value,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.180
just because the value
that they are contributing

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.150
isn't being counted
appropriately.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.300
HAL VARIAN: If you'd look
at the web raters handbook--

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.460
I was just looking at
this a few days ago.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.590
I know several people
here have looked at this.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:15.120
We pay thousands of
people around the world

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.420
to answer questions
about page quality.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.180
That is the labeling, that
then goes into determination

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.420
of the algorithms and
the machine learning,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.800
that helps make the system work.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.180
So there is a direct market
in paying people to label,

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.790
and we could do much
more of that, for sure.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.790
But the question is, should
it be done through the product

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.130
improvement side of things,
or should it be done just

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.840
as a line item on the budget.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.810
We're paying people to
rate or evaluate this

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.930
or label this material
in a way that helps

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.752
us design a superior product.

00:27:47.752 --> 00:27:49.710
GLEN WEYL: And I think
that if more people were

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.990
aware of the contributions
that they're making

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.290
and were getting compensation
for it, you would--

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.020
I mean there are absolutely
markets as you're

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.730
describing for those labellers.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.000
They are a little bit sidelined,
and the public image that is

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.269
portrayed is one in
which you don't--

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:06.060
HAL VARIAN: I know.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.230
You're very right.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.314
I mean nobody knows about this,
even though it's easy to check.

00:28:10.314 --> 00:28:10.980
GLEN WEYL: Yeah.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.750
I think putting that more center
stage and making more people

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.640
feel like they're
participating in it,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.060
I think, would change the whole
feeling of using the internet,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.850
in a way that I think would
be productive for our social

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.770
conversation around technology.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.770
HAL VARIAN: Well, it is
interesting how many people

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.430
write reviews for Amazon,
or for Google, or for Yelp,

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.100
because people are volunteering
this information in many cases.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.040
And I think you
might want to argue

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.540
that, well, the incremental
addition to that free service

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.597
is worth paying for.

00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:45.930
And maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.730
Depends on how much
you're getting people

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.060
to contribute generously
of their time,

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.050
in terms of doing
these evaluations.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.465
GLEN WEYL: Yeah,
well, that's a--

00:28:54.465 --> 00:28:55.340
HAL VARIAN: Might be.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.490
It's an empirical matter.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:59.550
All right, I'm going to ask one
more question, and I apologize.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.990
This is slightly technical.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:06.909
Your chart on the inference
labor share and the markup,

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:08.700
I've actually been
working on that problem.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.490
This is a paper by
Eeckhout and De Loecker

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.370
that you're referring to.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.690
GLEN WEYL: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.490
HAL VARIAN: And
it's a little funny,

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:21.580
because remember, markup is
the price over marginal cost.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.750
So the markup can go up
either by price going up

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.940
or by marginal cost going down.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.970
And of course, we
think cost going down,

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.090
gee, that's a good thing.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.260
Price going up,
that's a bad thing.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.140
But of course by making--

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.190
by moving around these two
things you can change the--

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.540
level the ratio of
price to marginal cost.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.150
So in fact, if you
take the formula

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.480
in that paper for
the markup, it's

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.670
also a formula
for marginal cost.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.382
Just re-arrange the algorithm.

00:29:49.382 --> 00:29:51.090
And if you go out and
do the calculation,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.370
look at the same data-- or
the same sorts of data--

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.790
that they look at, you see
costs going way, way down.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.520
You also see-- one last point--

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.770
you also see prices going down.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.360
And the question
is, what's happening

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.550
is the marginal cost
is going down even

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.960
faster than the prices are going
down, so the gap is going up.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.090
GLEN WEYL: Marginal costs
fell dramatically as well

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.940
during the post-war period.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.060
And in fact, even more
dramatically, the productivity

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.440
went up more quickly.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.914
My view is not everything
has been terrible

00:30:21.914 --> 00:30:22.830
in the last few years.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.150
That's not the point.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.300
The point is that, if we don't
have social institutions that

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.940
reform and restrain
market power,

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.640
that keep up with the
progress of technology,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.490
we'll fail to realize the
potential that we can have,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.680
which requires
constantly breaking up

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.890
the sources of rigidity that
enter the economy as technology

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.670
advances.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.680
And I think we did
that more effectively

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.440
in the immediate post-war period
along certain dimensions--

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.420
though not all
dimensions-- than we've

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.100
managed to do it since then.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.310
So my argument is not everything
has just gotten worse.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.009
Of course not.

00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:56.550
We wouldn't have had economic
growth if that hadn't happened.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.710
But that we haven't
managed to keep up

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.110
in the innovation of
our social institutions

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.050
with the innovation that we've
had on the technological side.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.500
HAL VARIAN: So let me make one
other objection to the Eeckhout

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.090
De Loecker work.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:13.350
Because I don't dispute
anything that you just said.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.190
But if you look at that, the
surprising thing from other

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.610
contributors is, the same thing
has happened in pretty much

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.410
every industry-- that is,
labor share has gone down--

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.260
and pretty much
in every country.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.230
So it seems very strange to
say, somewhere around 1980,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.910
all these different
countries and all

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.640
these different industries
became less competitive.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.780
It's much more
natural to say, well,

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.310
in the 1980s we had a
technological shock that

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.400
lowered costs pretty much across
all countries and pretty much

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.690
across all industries.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.580
It's called the computer.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.390
Micro-computer.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.348
That's what we've done.

00:31:49.348 --> 00:31:52.110
And we've seen this
technology work its way

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.970
through with some leaders--

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.670
that is, some companies that are
doing very well because they've

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.140
managed to reduce their costs
and improve their quality

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.085
by using this technology.

00:32:03.085 --> 00:32:04.710
We've seen other
companies that haven't

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.543
done so well, because
they haven't done this

00:32:06.543 --> 00:32:07.810
to the same extent.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:12.210
So to me, the technological
hit that reduces marginal cost

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.210
is much more plausible
than the concentration

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.614
hit which increases prices.

00:32:16.614 --> 00:32:18.030
GLEN WEYL: And
what I would say is

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.060
that we had those marginal
costs falling before for reasons

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.670
that were, in fact, more
powerful than the computer.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.910
Air conditioning,
refrigeration, lots

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:28.620
of huge technological advances.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.840
Except at that time,
we had policy makers

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.540
who were innovating, coming up
with things like the welfare

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:39.090
state, and antitrust
policies, and labor unions,

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.790
that were keeping
up with technology.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.880
And in the 1980s,
we stopped trying

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.060
to keep up with the
innovations in social policy

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.370
that were necessary to
restrain market power

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.410
within the technology sector.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:57.480
And that's the reason why we
suddenly saw those prices not

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.260
track as far down with marginal
costs as they should have done,

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.830
to maintain both maximum
productivity growth and--

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.715
so that's--

00:33:07.715 --> 00:33:09.090
HAL VARIAN: But
the real debate--

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.110
the real question, I think
is, is this just difficult

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.750
to learn how to use and
adopt this technology?

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.240
When electricity came in, we
saw the same thing happen.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.349
When steam came in,
we saw the same thing.

00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:22.140
It just takes time for
this to work its way

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.515
through the systems,
so you would

00:33:23.515 --> 00:33:26.220
expect some companies are
going to be more productive

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.720
than others, because
they've learned

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.920
to master the technology.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.430
And two of those companies
are represented right here,

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.480
Microsoft and Google.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.540
All right, that's
my debate, and I'm

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.020
sure you've got some more
ready questions coming.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.047
Why don't we start here.

00:33:41.047 --> 00:33:41.880
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.210
Thank you so much for coming
to speak, and thank you

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.840
for hosting and providing
a lively discussion.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.550
My name's Stephen.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.940
I have one question for you
on a subject that you actually

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.660
haven't really touched on yet,
which is the quadratic voting

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.820
piece.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.770
Simply because I
think politics is sort

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.850
of the iceberg to all of this.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:08.090
It's the underlying set of
problems to all of this.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.530
And so I'm curious,
one, how does

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:14.250
that actually work, in terms of
how does one define the value

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.510
that each person is given?

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.050
Is it a static equal
value, or can you

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:22.230
buy more if you
have more income?

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.130
And two, if you're willing
to extend the conversation,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.070
just how do you think the
globalization of finance

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:35.340
has impacted this decoupling
of productivity and wages

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.760
that has happened over the past
30 years, which has greatly

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.270
contributed to rising inequality
and many of the problems

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.650
that you're discussing
and thinking about today?

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:51.040
GLEN WEYL: On the first
point it would be not static.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.379
It would be dynamic over time.

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:53.670
People would get voice credits.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.794
They would get a flow of
voice credits the same way

00:34:55.794 --> 00:34:58.414
that they get a flow
of a social dividend.

00:34:58.414 --> 00:35:00.330
But it would be equal
across all people there.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.330
Would be no opportunity to use
outside financial resources

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:04.670
to purchase more.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.400
Unless in some much
more advanced society

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.920
when some of these other
ideas have been implemented

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.590
we have much greater
equality in which case

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.430
we might consider allowing
people at least at some rate

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.010
to purchase more credits.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.560
In terms of the globalization
of finance, look,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.310
I'm not 100% critical of what
happened with neoliberalism.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:27.470
I think that there's been
a huge amount of growth

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.840
in the developing world,
and to a large extent, that

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.290
is attributable to the opening
up of the international system

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.060
to allow opportunities
to many more people.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:41.790
Unfortunately, while we opened
up to other parts of the world,

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.330
I think our economy
domestically,

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.910
within the United States and
within other wealthy countries,

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.440
allowed in this greater market
power and, to some extent,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.660
the external markets
were used as a wedge

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.670
to consolidate the
power of capital

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.660
within national boundaries.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.780
And so I think we
need to rectify that,

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.500
because otherwise we're going
to get a populist backlash that

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.380
reacts to the fact that
things got better abroad

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.630
and they didn't get
so much better here,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.180
and that feels
like something that

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.160
can be cured by xenophobia.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.880
Which it can't, really, but you
see how people get that logic.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.240
So we need to find a
better way to unite

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.490
the interests of people
within the country

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.980
and around the world.

00:36:27.034 --> 00:36:28.700
AUDIENCE: What do you
think we can learn

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.910
from the political failures of
the followers of Henry George

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.880
and so on, insofar as
the land value tax,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.270
the optimal policy they
were proposing at the time,

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:42.020
largely ran aground in the
Lloyd George budget in UK?

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.780
The House of Lords largely said,
this endangers our interests.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.170
Here in California,
something like Prop 13,

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.350
which is largely the exact
opposite of an allocatively

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:55.027
efficient policy, is impossible
to get rid of, seemingly.

00:36:55.027 --> 00:36:57.110
What do you think we can
learn from these failures

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.540
for creating better
policy in the future?

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.270
GLEN WEYL: I think a major
problem for Georgism,

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:05.030
fundamentally, was the failure
of the Chinese Revolution,

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.630
because it ended
up meaning that--

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:13.400
Sun Yat-sen, who was founder
of the Chinese Revolution,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.890
basically had the same
relationship to George

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.540
that Lenin had to Marx.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.310
And the problem was that
Lenin was much more ruthless.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.910
He managed to-- the
Bolshevik Revolution managed

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.310
to survive and communism
spread, and that

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.740
became the leading
alternative to capitalism.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.620
And so we got stuck
in a discourse

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.850
where everything was about
capitalism versus communism.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.240
And so I think,
ultimately, if you

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.080
can have a comprehensive
ideology that

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.450
helps people rethink things,
like Milton Friedman did--

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.490
he really changed
the whole discourse--

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:54.110
I think that we can
have a path where people

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.790
understand and believe in that.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.380
And I think he came
close in England.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.520
I think you change a
few things and Georgism

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.510
would have been very
successful in England.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.600
But I think that the
communist revolution was

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.590
a big part of what stopped it.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.510
Thanks for the talk.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.510
Really interesting point
about the concentration

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:19.130
of assets in a few very large
asset managers, money managers.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.250
My question is, where
does the political will

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.950
come from to sort of
go after these guys?

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.270
They control a lot--

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.460
and I guess this is
more broad, too--

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:34.240
they probably have captured
the Congress, they're lobbying.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.460
They're incredibly strong
versus the very diffuse sense

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.265
among the populace
that, oh, it's probably

00:38:39.265 --> 00:38:41.390
bad to have four companies
controlling the majority

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.840
of stock in the United States.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.290
GLEN WEYL: First of all,
the most powerful basis

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:54.710
of the protection of capital
rents is free market rhetoric.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.400
It's not just, or
even mainly, things

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.800
done in the dark back rooms.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.510
Free market rhetoric
is something

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.000
that so many people in
this country believe in,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.360
and if we can deny to the
capitalist monopolists

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.920
the use of free market
rhetoric, by saying

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.240
that true free markets
require radical reforms,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.310
radical egalitarian
reforms, I think

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:23.300
we can change the political
dynamic around these things

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.490
significantly.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:29.660
But second of all, you know,
it comes from young people.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.980
It comes from students.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.770
That's where-- that's how
Milton Friedman changed things

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.380
in the direction that
they went in the 1980s.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:41.570
"Capitalism and Freedom" sold
terribly among academics,

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.240
initially, and it was very
unpopular in the press,

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.950
but students loved it.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:50.210
And he had a coherent view,
and it applied to many things,

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.415
and he really changed the
whole political discourse

00:39:52.415 --> 00:39:53.040
in the country.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.370
So I do believe that
in the medium-term,

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:59.780
ideas clearly exposited
that try to directly connect

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.140
to the public can have a
huge effect on world history.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.330
AUDIENCE: I'm a newbie to
economics and politics.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.270
Recently, I watched Ray Dalio's
"How the Economy Works in 30

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.230
Minutes."

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.390
He talks about
borrowing and lending,

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.270
and he says because of
that, we have credit.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.990
And it's human
nature that we tend

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:26.870
to borrow from the future, which
leads to some economic crises,

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:27.730
because of cycles.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.660
So I'm just wondering,
in your ideal market,

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.340
will there be economic crises?

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:38.330
And if there are, will
there be differences in how

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.731
we address economic crises?

00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:41.730
GLEN WEYL: I think that
that's a great question.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.146
I can't say that I confidently
predict that there wouldn't

00:40:44.146 --> 00:40:46.694
be crises in the world
that I'm describing,

00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:48.860
but I think that they would
probably be less severe.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.568
And the reason is
precisely what you just

00:40:50.568 --> 00:40:55.750
said, which is that debt,
and the rigidities associated

00:40:55.750 --> 00:41:00.410
with private property as well,
are a leading cause of what

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.260
happens during economic crises.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.380
And In this world, there
would be far, far less debt,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.020
because it would be much
less important to take

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.380
on debt to own assets, because
the value of all assets

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.580
would be greatly reduced.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.910
People would be effectively
closer to renting assets,

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.610
and therefore many of the
sources of instability

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:24.880
that come from debt finance
would be much less severe.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.390
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:33.710
My question is, it seems to me
like perhaps some products are

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:39.680
not naturally amenable to
constant liquid exchange.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.550
Like housing, for example.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.910
I might want to live in a
particular place for decades

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.420
at a time.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.230
And if I'm outbid on it,
and I don't want to leave,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.750
then getting me to do
so requires violence.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.520
Or, for example, physical
infrastructure, like trains.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.560
It seems like there
would be an enormous cost

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.500
if the administration
of this infrastructure

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.540
were constantly changing hands.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.648
So, I mean--

00:42:06.648 --> 00:42:08.606
I think that that gives
you enough to reply to.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.020
GLEN WEYL: Obviously, you
could maintain stability

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.960
in this world by
charging a higher price,

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.080
so that it's harder for someone
to take something from you.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.670
Now in our present world, as
well, stability is costly.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.570
Wealthy people, they live
in safe areas that aren't

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.220
hit by natural disasters.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.540
They own their houses outright.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.060
They usually don't rent,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.640
So they enjoy much
greater stability.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.090
The poor, they rent or
they are underwater often

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:45.290
with their homes, either
figuratively or literally

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:49.100
sometimes, living in
very dangerous areas.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.220
And so in this society, just
like in our present society,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.320
stability is costly.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.120
But the difference
in this society

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.820
is that everyone would
have an equal, or a far

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.210
closer to equal, basis to
pay for that stability,

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.150
as they desired it, than
in our present society,

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.330
because you would tax the
wealthy's demand for stability

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:11.420
at the cost of the opportunity
of the less well off.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.420
Whereas in our
present society, they

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.360
can enjoy that stability
at no cost to themselves,

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.403
or a much more limited
cost to themselves.

00:43:27.794 --> 00:43:28.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, it's me again.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.110
I have lots of questions.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:37.020
So with regard to both
the self-assessed tax

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.980
and the quadratic voting,
I'm sure the answers would

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.860
be slightly different, but
the question and problem

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.410
that I'm posing, I think,
aren't quite the same.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.410
Which is, how would you
limit collusion and sort

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.310
of gaming of such a system,
in which individuals could,

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.570
on the self-assess tax side,
more or less set a price that

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.730
is above market, that
others could buy,

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.910
but low enough to
maintain a lower tax?

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.380
And then on the political side--

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.970
this happens in our
elections already,

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.300
people running spoiler
candidates in primaries,

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.370
or having some sort
of spoiler referendum

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.381
to try and split a vote.

00:44:13.381 --> 00:44:15.630
How would you imagine that
could be protected against,

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.140
particularly when, if I were
to put my energy in one issue,

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.350
I would necessarily
be putting less energy

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:25.550
and voice into another?

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.300
GLEN WEYL: It's more
than I have time for,

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.860
to go into detail about
each one of the points,

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.960
in terms of collusion
and so forth.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.160
But that's an absolutely
central thing to the book.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.830
I definitely encourage
you to read the book.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.280
But the short version is,
all those sorts of problems

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.530
exist in our present system.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.644
They are dramatically
reduced, if not eliminated,

00:44:49.644 --> 00:44:51.060
in the system that
I'm describing.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.920
I'll just give you one example.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.560
Right now, there's
the problem, when

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.680
you have an election, of a
spoiler candidate running

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.530
and possibly messing up
the main two candidates.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.376
But maybe even worse,
there's the fact

00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:06.000
that you can end up
with two candidates

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.896
that everyone despises,
but everyone votes for one

00:45:09.896 --> 00:45:11.520
candidate to block
the other candidate.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.072
That's, I think, an even worse
problem than the spoiler.

00:45:14.072 --> 00:45:16.530
In this system, you can show
that that's not mathematically

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.210
possible, because
what happens is

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.120
that, because of the
quadratic nature of the cost,

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.100
if you really hate
Hillary Clinton,

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.860
you'll vote at least as much
against Hillary as you'll

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.020
vote in favor of
Trump, and vice versa.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.540
And so that pushes
two candidates

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.660
that everyone hates
down to zero votes.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.510
And so then that leads
other candidates to rise up,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.710
so you don't end up with these
perverse strategic things,

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.210
where the two leading
candidates get

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.940
reinforced just to
beat the other one.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.990
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry,
could you repeat that?

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.140
I don't--

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.880
GLEN WEYL: So if you have
two candidates, both of whom

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.440
are really hated
by the other side,

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.830
but no one really likes
them, then what happens

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.470
is that those candidates
get negative votes on them.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.260
So they go down
to zero net votes.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.560
And so anyone else
who is not despised

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.480
ends up becoming a
leading candidate.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.900
And so you can prove that
that will lead to it never

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.900
being the case that you just
get a perverse thing of two

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.834
people that are really
disliked winning just

00:46:15.834 --> 00:46:16.750
to beat the other one.

00:46:19.312 --> 00:46:20.020
Yeah, back there.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.027
You were waiting.

00:46:23.027 --> 00:46:25.360
AUDIENCE: How do you think
blockchain technology relates

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.470
to the ideas in your book
or the research you've done?

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.150
GLEN WEYL: That's a
wonderful question.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.990
Vitalik Buterin, who is
the founder of Ethereum,

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:38.624
just wrote a wonderful long
post about that, which I would

00:46:38.624 --> 00:46:39.790
definitely recommend to you.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.581
And he and I are writing
something together

00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:44.940
that should come out this
week about the relationship.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.840
But very briefly,
what I would say

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.290
is, the exact technological
relationship is complex

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:51.530
and it will evolve.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.550
But philosophically, I think
they're very closely connected.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:58.480
In particular, both are
trying to figure out

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.930
monetary, market
based, distributed,

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:06.520
decentralized systems for
ensuring through rules

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.310
of the game, rather than
through discretionary authority,

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:16.240
that we have a more egalitarian
distribution of economic power.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.610
I think a major
weakness in blockchain

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:21.820
thus far has been that
it's focused primarily

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.830
on the cryptographic
protocols, rather

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.780
than on the substantive
rules implemented

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.280
by those cryptographic
protocols, and as a result,

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.430
some of the rules have
ended up giving power,

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.550
in fact, to oligarchic
groups, say, in China,

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.020
that end up controlling them.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.603
So they don't really achieve the
goals that they're aiming at.

00:47:37.603 --> 00:47:39.490
What they need is a
substantive set of rules,

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.100
to be implemented by those
cryptographic protocols,

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.680
so that they actually
instantiate their goals.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.210
And that's precisely
what Buterin

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.340
tries to argue in this
piece, and that we're

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.610
arguing together.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.670
So I think that there's a tight
unity of purpose between these,

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.890
though the actual technological
connection is something that's

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:01.390
going to need to develop in the
coming years, or months even.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.640
I'm actually speaking at
the main Ethereum conference

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.200
on Saturday about exactly this.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:08.410
Go ahead.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.940
AUDIENCE: Just going back
to the previous question.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.570
To be honest, I
think trying to apply

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.482
any rigorous mathematical
proof to the political system,

00:48:17.482 --> 00:48:19.190
especially the American
political system,

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:20.820
is doomed to failure.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.620
But I think one
question I would have,

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.290
in terms of implementation,
you mentioned

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:31.510
that this quadratic voting
system seems extremely radical.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:33.644
What are the sort of baby
steps that you mentioned,

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.560
in terms of actually
trying to implement this,

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.550
especially in the US?

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.255
GLEN WEYL: Absolutely.

00:48:39.255 --> 00:48:40.630
We don't have the
computer going,

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.190
but I can show you afterwards.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:45.777
We have a nice user
interface, that

00:48:45.777 --> 00:48:47.860
even for people who haven't
completed high school,

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.740
makes it very intuitive
to do quadratic voting.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.812
And we've been using
that to do polling,

00:48:52.812 --> 00:48:55.020
and we've gotten some very
interesting results, where

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.980
we were able to elicit
intensity of preference

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.550
much more reliably than you
can get from existing methods.

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.090
That's a good place to start.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:04.450
But the next place that
we really want to go

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:12.069
is ratings, say, of ride-sharing
drivers or products online,

00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:14.110
where you have this problem
of people often going

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:20.140
to extremes and a lot of sort
of trolling-type behavior.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.049
And if you made
something costly,

00:49:22.049 --> 00:49:24.590
and made there be real tradeoffs
for people that would budget

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:26.530
to upvote or downvote
things, I think

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.540
you could get much more
reliable and useful feedback

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.930
In a variety of circumstances.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.540
AUDIENCE: But in terms of
actually putting into place

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.567
in American elections--

00:49:36.567 --> 00:49:38.650
GLEN WEYL: My view is that
once you start using it

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:39.910
in some of these
commercial domains,

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.500
you gradually expand
them outwards.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.630
As people get more used to
it in different domains,

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.088
there will be a
greater willingness

00:49:45.088 --> 00:49:47.746
to experiment in other domains.

00:49:47.746 --> 00:49:49.120
Blockchain is
another place where

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.328
I think that it's quite
likely that this will be used

00:49:51.328 --> 00:49:54.130
in some reasonably near term.

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:57.160
And I think people will get
used to the technology-- it's

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.720
sort of like, e-government
happened to a large extent

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.570
because of all the
advances that were made

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:06.852
in the private sector, and
then those were imported

00:50:06.852 --> 00:50:07.810
into the public sector.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.860
So I expect something similar
would happen with this.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.514
HAL VARIAN: We'll take
one more question.

00:50:14.514 --> 00:50:15.180
You had the mic?

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.290
Go ahead.

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:20.692
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
sharing your ideas again.

00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:22.150
I look forward to
reading the book.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.170
You said that the primary
urgency of what you propose

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:33.490
is because there is
an impending doom,

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:37.180
almost, if we don't do something
about the current status quo.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:42.970
But do you see this
Marketopia being implemented

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.666
without massive upheaval?

00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:46.540
Because I think what
you're trying to suggest

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.150
is that we need to save
our society, almost.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:53.290
But from the way I see it,
it seems like we almost

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:56.830
need to almost throw
away society in order

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:00.610
to implement this
without the oligarchs,

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:03.490
without the current
special interests,

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:08.140
basically taking control of
this or skewing in a way that,

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:14.800
basically, either ruins it or
prevents it from ever seeing

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.930
the light of day.

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.010
GLEN WEYL: I believe
that revolutions

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.560
are not always,
but almost always,

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.630
more destructive than
they are productive.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.250
And on the other
hand, I do believe

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.680
in the power of
democracy and ideas,

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.130
if widely disseminated,
thoughtfully engaged

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:36.090
with, and widely understood.

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.790
I think public understanding
is the greatest accountability

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:41.790
against special
interest capture.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:46.110
So I put my faith
in that, ultimately,

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:49.020
and I hope that young
people, including

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.900
some people in this
room, will build

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.650
on the transmission of different
aspects of these ideas,

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:59.200
so that we can keep the
broad public engaged

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.530
and keep the political
process accountable to that.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:08.610
I think you saw with what
happened in the last year

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.146
or two, how much desire
there is for change,

00:52:11.146 --> 00:52:13.020
and if that's channeled
in a direction that's

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.030
productive rather
than destructive,

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.710
I think that we
have an opportunity

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:21.300
to build a much better society,
like Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.660
I believe, did, rather
than just having

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.730
upheaval, a violent upheaval.

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.700
HAL VARIAN: OK, thank
you very much, Glen.
