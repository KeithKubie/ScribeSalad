00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.520
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is already a
growing problem.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.960
But is the food we eat making it worse?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.830
Hello everyone, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.389
Every vegetarian has their own reason for
going meatless.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.189
For me, meat’s just too chewy.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.269
For others, the drugs farmers feed livestock
might be behind their rationale to go meatless,

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.509
and this one is actually something meat eaters
should know about.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.859
According to the Food and Drug Administration,
antibiotic use by the meat industry is on

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:28.859
the rise.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.669
The most recent FDA report said the amount
of antibiotics sold to farmers and ranchers

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.300
for administration to livestock has gone up
by 20 percent between 2009 and 2013.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Why is this a problem, you ask?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.399
For the most part, human antibiotics are administered
to animals that aren’t sick.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.940
Livestock destined for your grocery store
don’t exactly live in spa-like conditions.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.670
These animals are often crammed together in
cages or pens that aren’t the cleanest,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.879
which means they can get sick and might not
grow to a healthy size.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.790
It would make sense that improved living conditions
would yield healthier, bigger animals, but

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.809
that costs money, and drugs are a cheaper
option.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.850
Human antibiotics added to animals food and
water supply can help them grow as much as

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.500
3 percent larger than they normally would,
which is significant in an industry where

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.850
the product is sold by the pound.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.030
And while this might be good for the farmers,
it’s pretty bad for the rest of us, particularly

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.590
those among us who eat meat.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.990
Giving healthy animals antibiotics kills off
weaker bacteria and creates a perfect environment

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.149
for antibiotic-resistant bacteria to grow
and thrive.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.180
Those bacteria travel to us, the consumers,
directly in the meat or indirectly on the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.590
hands of workers who may be exposed to the
antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-rich meat.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.790
If you eat undercooked meat where those antibiotic-resistant
bacteria are present, you could get sick with

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.420
a bacteria that an antibiotic can’t treat.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.979
The CDC says around 2 million Americans get
infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.109
every year.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.670
And at least 23-thousand people die from those
infections.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.660
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, the US
uses far more antibiotics in livestock than

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.549
other nations, Norway and Denmark use about
six times less antibiotics raising animals.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.780
Feeding antibiotics to animals is illegal
in Canada and a number of European Union nations.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.590
A federal policy was put in place last year
that would force drug manufacturers to label

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.800
their products as unfit for animal consumption
unless prescribed by a veterinarian.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.500
But this policy didn’t address a major loophole.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
Farmers can argue that they’re feeding their
livestock drugs to prevent illness, which

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.030
is an effect of the antibiotics in the animals’
food supply.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.580
The meat industry doesn’t publicize figures
about drug usage in livestock so it’s hard

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.890
to say just how much antibiotics make it into
our food supply.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.410
But according to a study published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.030
more than 63-thousand tons of antibiotics
were used by livestock farmers in 2010.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.060
Researchers expect that number to rise by
67% by 2030.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.860
On the other hand, some companies are beginning
to cull or even eliminate the use of human

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.700
antibiotics on animals.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.230
Recently McDonald’s announced it was phasing
out antibiotic-fed chickens in its U.S. restaurants.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.810
Chipotle and Panera have been offering antibiotic-free
meat for a while now.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.310
But in the mean time, it’s still legal practice
in the United States.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.660
If you wanna know more about antibiotic resistance
and the search for a cure, check out this

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.060
episode of Seeker Stories that follows a team
of researchers to the bottom of the ocean

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.920
to find the next antibiotic.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.810
"You say this is a crisis, if you had to rate
it on a scale of 1-10, where are we at on

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.810
the antibiotic crisis?"

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.810
"Eleven.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.810
It's very serious.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.600
We are about to return to a pre antibiotic
era where even basic surgeries and other basic

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.900
procedures could lead to death by bacterial
pathogens."

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.540
And if you’re on mobile, we’ve got a link
to that video down below.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.840
So what do you guys think.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.180
Are you worried about antibiotics in your
meat?
