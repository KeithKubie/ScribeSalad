00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.810
In the last video, we
saw how you can actually

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.440
view a demand curve as actually
a marginal benefit curve.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.580
That for any given the
quantity of the good you're

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.384
selling, that that
point on the curve

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.050
is actually showing
the marginal benefit

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.570
for that incremental unit.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.067
So this is a marginal
benefit for that first unit.

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:20.150
This is the marginal benefit
for that second unit.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.800
And there's multiple ways
that you could view this,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.280
assuming that we're talking
about this new car here.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.470
Maybe if you're going
to only sell one unit,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.250
someone really wants it really
bad, the benefit for them,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.430
the marginal benefit for
that first unit for them,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.370
is going to be $60,000.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.892
Now, let's say if you
want to sell two units,

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:38.100
that second unit might be
bought by that same person.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.800
And they might say, well,
I already have one car.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.050
The benefit of getting that
second one's only $50,000.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.880
That's the point at
which I am neutral.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.910
That's the point at which I'm
right on the fence of willing

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.660
to buy that car.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.610
Or it might be another person,
another person who's just not

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.526
as enamored as the first
person, who says, OK,

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:54.510
for $50,000 I do like that car.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.932
And then for the third, the
third person there, once again,

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.640
they're not as enamored
as the first two,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.320
they would be willing
to buy it for $40,000.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.709
And what we saw is
at some point you

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.340
could say, look, let's say that
we decide that the price ends

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.290
up being-- for whatever
reason-- $30,000.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.441
And so when the
price is $30,000--

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.940
and this is kind of viewing it
in the traditional notion of,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.921
at a price, what quantity
were you selling it.

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.170
But when you think about
that reality, what's actually

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.000
happening is that this fourth
person is right on the fence.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.940
Their marginal benefit
is exactly $30,000.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.500
So in their mind,
they're saying,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.256
I am giving away $30,000.

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:34.670
And in exchange for that
I'm getting something

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.430
that is worth $30,000.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.975
So it's kind of
like, hey, will you

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:39.850
be willing to trade this
dollar for a dollar?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.500
Well, you probably would be
kind of on the fence about that.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.250
You're very close
to going either way.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800
You feel like it's a good
deal if you could get it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.070
for maybe a penny less.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.286
It's a bad deal if you're
getting it for a penny more.

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:51.660
So right on the
fence, but you're

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.100
going to just barely
get this fourth person

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.040
to transact at this price.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.467
But what we hinted
at is if you do

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.550
have one price for everybody--
in the future we'll

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.980
talk about not having
one price for everybody--

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.100
but if you did have
one price for everyone,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.770
these first units
were kind of sold

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889
below where they
could have been sold.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.030
They were sold below
their marginal benefit.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.040
So remember, we're
viewing this same demand

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.650
curve we're now viewing as
a marginal benefit curve.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.390
So this first unit
right over here,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.960
it could have been
sold at $60,000.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.270
But now, we're selling
it for $30,000.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.110
So this right over
here, this was $30,000.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.210
I'll just write 30 for $30,000.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.270
The marginal benefit is $30,000
higher than the actual price.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.820
The marginal benefit
of that unit,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880
the benefit that the
market got out of it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.880
is $30,000 higher
than the price.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.320
The marginal benefit
for the second unit

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.090
is $20,000 higher than the
price at which the product is

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.150
being sold.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.280
The marginal benefit
for this third unit,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.120
assuming this is
$40,000, is $10,000.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.790
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.290
the consumer surplus for
this first unit was $30,000.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.030
The consumer's got $30,000 more
in benefit, marginal benefit

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.010
for them and value
for themselves,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.400
than they had to pay for it.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.410
Here, the consumer
surplus was $20,000.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.970
The consumer got
$20,000 more in value

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.900
than that second consumer
was willing to pay for it.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.390
And here is $10,000.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.800
And then this fourth
consumer is neutral.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.865
The marginal benefit is
what they paid for it.

00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:32.240
And so when you
think about this,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.272
you can say, well, what's the
total consumer surplus here?

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:37.230
Let me write this down.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.640
What is the total
consumer surplus?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.140
And another way of
thinking about it

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.140
is, what is the total
excess of marginal benefit

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.010
above and beyond the price paid?

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.190
So how much surplus
marginal benefit

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.980
did they get, if you
take out the price paid?

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.000
And over here, the
total consumer surplus

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.120
is going to be the $30,000
for that first unit,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.860
plus the $20,000 for
that second unit,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.100
plus the $10,000
for that third unit.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.790
And so the total
consumer surplus

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.720
in this scenario when we
sold four units at $30,000

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.720
is-- And we're assuming
we're selling cars here.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.219
So we can't sell
parts of cars here.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.500
We can't sell 1.1 cars.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.250
I guess if we're talking about
averages, maybe we could.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.750
But let's just say we're selling
just whole numbers of cars

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.270
here.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.700
The total consumer surplus in
this situation was 30 plus 20

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.787
plus 10, which is $60,000.

00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:30.870
Everything's in thousands.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.080
So this is $60,000.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.320
So in this scenario,
in that week,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.220
the consumers would get $60,000
more in benefit for them,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.250
in perceived benefit for
them, than what they actually

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.000
had to pay for it.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.760
And if you think about
it, it's a little

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.180
unideal for the seller, because
they were selling something

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.630
at a lower price than maybe
what they could have gotten

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.665
from at least these
first few consumers here.

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:57.040
And that was because they,
just really based on the model

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.480
that we have here, they
just had to set one price.
