- EVERYONE KNOWS OUR TARGET
AUDIENCE...

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.940
IS 18 TO 34-YEAR-OLD MALES.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.610
BUT HOW DO WE
HIT THAT TARGET?

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:13.213
- HOW?
- HOW?

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.015
BY RELYING ON MARKET TESTING?

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.016
NO.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.051
- [scoffs]
NO.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.787
- BY TRUSTING OUR GUT?
NO.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.856
WE NEED MORE.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.925
LARS.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.727
AND SO
FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.162
WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING
A PROTOTYPE

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.265
THAT COMBINES ALL
OF OUR TARGET VIEWERS

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.233
INTO ONE COMPOSITE VIEWER.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.604
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE FUTURE OF TELEVISION.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:39.573
[thudding]

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:44.311
A FULLY FUNCTIONAL
18 TO 34-YEAR-OLD MALE.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.512
- PIZZA.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.582
- LET'S GIVE THEM A LITTLE
DEMONSTRATION

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.151
OF HOW HE WORKS.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.688
[TV turns on]
[upbeat music]

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.257

[all applaud]

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.962

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:06.400
[robot beeps]

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.202
HE LIKES IT.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.536
THAT'S A HIT.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.771
- UH, GEORGE, IF I MAY?

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.373
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LITTLE
SHOW MYSELF

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.943
AND I GAVE IT TO LARS AND,
WELL, I'M CURIOUS TO SEE

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.177
WHAT THE DEMO MONSTER
THINKS ABOUT IT.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:18.745
I THINK HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.
- OH.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:19.947
IT'LL BE A TRUE TEST.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.949
- FELL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT IT, GEORGE.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:23.350
- I'M LIZ.
[cameras snapping]

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.587
I'M AN AMAZING PERSON
WITH AN AMAZING LIFE.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.955
- AND I'M LIZ.
I'M--

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.289
[gunfire]

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:31.158
[robot buzzes angrily]

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.961
- YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME ACTUALLY
GIVE HIM A DIFFERENT SKETCH.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:35.095
[gun reloads]
OH, GOD, NO!

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:39.099
[gunfire]
- [guttural moaning]

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.973
[wet noises]

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.110
- YOU THINK HE'S
BADLY HURT, LARS?

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.678
- [flatulence]

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:52.579
