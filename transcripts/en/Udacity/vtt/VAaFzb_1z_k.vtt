00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.030
Several differences that we saw in the OCL from the First-Order Logic. It uses

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.940
the vertical bar, not only, to get at the length of things, but I'm sorry.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.940
Not not as we saw in the First-Order Logic to indicate the length of things,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.030
but it serves the role as the dot we saw before to separate the part which is

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.230
saying. What the, what the variable is from the remainder.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.230
The limitations on the value of i appear as part of the proposition itself.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.870
The limitations on the value of i are separated from the proposition itself,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.970
by the use of the implies OCL keyword. I've also cheated a bit,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.550
by using OCL's built in sequence class instead of vectors.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.060
OCL doesn't have vectors, it has sequences, but those are essentially the same.
