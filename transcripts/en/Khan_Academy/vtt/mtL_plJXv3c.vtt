00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.930
So I've done this series of
presentations about housing.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.670
And at least, my thesis on why
housing prices might have gone

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.260
up, and how you should maybe,
in simple terms, think about

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.220
the rent-versus-buy decision.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.420
But one thing that's happened, a
lot of people said, oh, Sal,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.200
you're making oversimplifying
assumptions.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.870
You're assuming interest-only
loans.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.490
You're not factoring in the tax
deductions of mortgages,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.300
et cetera, of interest
on your mortgage.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.850
Which I did, but I did make some
simplifying assumptions.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.900
So that we could kind of do back
of the envelope math, and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.670
just think about what the main
drivers are when you think

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.210
about renting versus buying.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810
But it is fair.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.930
That's just kind
of a first cut.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
You really should do a
multi-line model, trying to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920
figure out what could
happen to you.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.460
And then tweak your
assumptions.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.080
And really figure out what's
going to happen to you if

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.770
housing appreciates,
depreciates.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.170
If interest rates change.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.850
If you put 10% down, or
20% down, or whatever.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.250
So with that in mind, I've
constructed this model.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.350
What I called, this is the
home purchase model.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.570
And you can download it yourself
and play with it.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.390
I think this will prove
to be useful for you.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.765
You can download it at
khanacademy.org/

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:12.015
downloads/buyrent.xls.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.280
It's an Excel spreadsheet.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.060
So if you have Excel, you should
be able to access it.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.480
And maybe you want to
follow along while

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.730
you watch this video.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.980
So just khanacademy.org/
downloads/buyrent.xls.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.860
So once you download it,
let me explain what I

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.390
assumed in the model.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.030
So what I did in yellow, both
this bright yellow and this

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.330
less bright yellow, these
are our assumptions.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.090
These are the things that are
going to drive the model, and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.050
tell us whether over -- and I
calculated over 10 years --

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.630
whether we will do better
renting versus buying.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.120
And so if you download this
model and want to play with it

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.470
yourself, unless you are fairly
sophisticated with

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.250
Excel, the only things
you should change are

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.270
the things in yellow.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.639
Everything else is calculated.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.509
And it's driven by
these inputs.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.660
So of course, what matters
in a home?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.540
Well the purchase
price matters.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.810
So you just in put it there.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.250
The down payment matters.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.480
You could, if you want, you can
just write like I wrote,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.560
20% of whatever the
purchase price is.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.370
So you can write the exact
number, or you can just leave

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.995
it the way I did.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.370
And whatever the down payment
percentage is,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.690
it'll calculate it.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.510
This is the interest
rate you assume.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.140
This is the principal
amortization.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.110
So principal amortization just
means, well, if I just keep

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.370
paying this mortgage, after
how long is the entire

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.510
principal amount -- not just
interest, how long is the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.430
entire principal amount going
to be paid off in?

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.410
So essentially, a 30-year fixed
rate loan has a 30 year

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.780
principal amortization.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.200
If you have a 10-year loan,
you'd put 10 here.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.350
This is the property tax rate.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.030
This is what I assume because
I live in California, and in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.500
most areas of California,
that's the property tax.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.140
This is what I assume about
annual maintenance.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.390
That's just an assumption.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.010
Some houses might be less,
might be more.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.660
That's up to you to decide.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.280
This is housing association
dues.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.900
Maybe if you live in a community
that has a shared

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.500
golf course, or a shared
pool or something.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Put it at 0 if you don't.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.360
This is annual insurance, for
things like hazard insurance,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.600
and flood insurance, earthquake
insurance, or

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.530
whatever insurance you
need where you live.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.770
And in this bright yellow, I
say, what is the assumed

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.620
annual appreciation of
the house itself?

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.650
And this is a huge assumption.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.290
And that's why I put it into
this bold yellow color.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.540
Because we'll see later in
this video that to some

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.245
degree, that assumption is one
of the biggest drivers of

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:41.600
assumption.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.880
Or you could say the model is
very, very, very sensitive to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.390
that assumption.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.650
Here, this is your assumed
marginal income tax rate.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.190
And why does that matter?

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.140
Well because you can deduct the
interest that you spend on

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.520
your mortgage.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.380
And also you can deduct,
actually, the property tax.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.690
So if you can deduct $100 in
interest and property tax, if

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.850
your marginal tax rate is 30% --
so that means at what rate

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.720
are you being taxed on every
incremental dollar.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.540
If it's 30%, that means a $100
deduction will save you $30.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.740
If your marginal tax rate is
20%, a $100 deduction will

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.579
save you $20.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.060
So that's where that
comes into play.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.360
The 2%, that's general
inflation.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.890
And what this assumption drives
is, well, there's going

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.540
to be some inflation on things
like housing association dues,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.610
annual maintenance, insurance.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.890
And so this, what you assume
about, well, what is just the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.460
general rate of inflation, in
our model that's actually

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.360
going to drive how these grow
over the life of your loan.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.580
And then once you type in all
of these things, the monthly

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.650
mortgage payment
is calculated.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.140
I assumed that the interest
compounds once a month.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.570
You can, if you know your
geometric series, you can go

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.730
in there and you can tweak it
around so it compounds more

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.920
frequently or less frequently.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.070
But my understanding
is that most

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.470
mortgages compound monthly.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.560
And then this right here, so
this is everything that's

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.480
driving the buying
a home decision.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.260
Now these assumptions are so
that we can make a comparison

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.010
to, well, what if instead of
using that down payment to buy

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.210
a house, what if we actually
just save that down payment,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.050
put it in the bank, and
rent a house instead.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.460
So this is cost of renting
a similar home.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.580
This is the annual rental
price inflation.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.060
And I would argue, to some
degree, that rental price

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.140
inflation over the long term
should not be that different

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.640
than housing price inflation.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.350
Because to some degree,
rental is kind of the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.120
earnings on a home.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.090
And if earnings increase and
the overall asset doesn't

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.470
increase, your return
increases.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.440
Or the other way around.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.480
Your return decreases.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.800
But anyway, don't want to
get too complicated.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.710
And then this is the 6%, or
I just assume it's 6%.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.320
You can change it.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.690
This is what you assume that
you can get on your cash.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.870
So if I don't put the $150,000
down deposit on the home, and

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.690
I put it in, I don't know, maybe
I'm a good investor.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.700
I could put in the
stock market.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.160
Maybe I can get 20% a year.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.920
Or maybe I'm really risk
averse, and I put it in

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.720
government bonds, and
I get 4% a year.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.990
So this is the assumption
that you get in on that.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.260
And it actually should be an
after-tax return on that cash.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.350
So if my tax rate is 30% and I
think I can get 10% percent on

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.460
the stock market, I should
actually put a 7% here.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.840
So we want to make sure
that we're completely

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.950
accurate for taxes.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.800
So now let me explain the rest
of the model to you.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.380
I want to make sure that I can
fit it all within this window.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.290
Let me just squeeze
this a little bit.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.830
Excel on YouTube is a
new thing for me.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.150
That's not what I
wanted to do.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.060
So let me unfreeze the window.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.100
OK.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.430
So now I can show you
the rest of model.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.610
So all those assumptions
that we did,

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.290
that drives this model.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.940
Let me freeze the window
right here.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.790
OK.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.220
That should make things
a little bit easier.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.540
So this is the buying scenario,
up to line 40.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.950
This says, OK, at period zero,
what is the home value?

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.210
And don't type in
anything here.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.170
It's all automatically
calculated.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.340
So at period zero, what
is your home value?

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.580
And then it uses essentially
the appreciation numbers.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.050
And each period is essentially
a month.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.680
I actually wrote
that down here.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.050
And then it figures out,
what is the market

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.500
value of your home?

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.420
And it's completely driven by
that appreciation number.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.420
This right here is the debt, or
essentially the principal

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.210
payment on your mortgage,
or how much do

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.410
you owe to the bank.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.710
And as you see, as months go by,
when you pay the mortgage

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.510
note -- and I show that right
here, this mortgage payment.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.870
Some amount of that, which is
line 33, the principal paid.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.480
Some of that goes to decrease
the amount you owe.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.230
And then a lot of it, especially
initially, goes to

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.700
be actually the interest
on the amount you owe.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.590
And then obviously, if you
watch the video on

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.480
introduction to balance sheets,
your equity in the

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.170
home is the value of the home
minus the debt, or minus what

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.880
you owe the bank.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.660
So this actually calculates
your equity.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.450
Or essentially, one way to view
it, is actually to say,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.900
well, what am I worth?

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.539
Or what is this investment worth
to me at that point?

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.730
So these are kind of the
important numbers in the home

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.190
buying scenario.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.780
It is driven by-- This interest
on debt, it's

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.910
calculated by what interest
rate you assume, times the

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.930
debt you owe and the
period before.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.440
The mortgage payment, we
calculated that before, using

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.820
our mathematical knowledge
of geometric series.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.440
The paid principal, that's
going to be the mortgage

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.070
payment minus your interest.
Insurance payment, it's on a

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.300
monthly basis, right?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.270
So we essentially took whatever
our annual insurance

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.940
payment was and we
divide it by 12.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.720
But then we grow it by
the rate of inflation

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.760
on a monthly basis.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.580
So we took the inflation rate,
divided by 12, and we

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.340
multiplied by each
of these months.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.440
The housing association dues,
once again, this is on a

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.050
monthly basis.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.230
So we just took your assumption,
divided by 12.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.510
Maintenance, same thing.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.660
Property tax, same thing.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.910
Although I assumed that your
house gets reassessed.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.610
So you're in a state where every
year, or every several

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.310
years, the assessor comes, says,
oh, your house is worth

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.510
more now, so I'm going
to raise your taxes.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.460
That's not the case in a lot
of parts of California.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.970
But it's the case in many parts
of the U.S. So actually

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.950
to some degree, this, the dollar
value, the property tax

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.410
is driven by this home value
assumption up here.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.230
This income tax saving from
interest deduction, this is

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.710
assuming that at that marginal
tax rate, you can deduct the

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.700
property tax and the interest
on the debt.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.810
And then this is the total cash
outflow after adding back

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.860
the income tax savings.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.880
So this is essentially how much
cash goes out the door,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.740
even after the tax savings,
every month,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.240
in the buying scenario.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.830
That's what that is.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.270
So hopefully that makes
a little bit of sense.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.780
So what we want to do is, we
want to figure out, OK, you

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.520
could do that.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.830
You could buy the house,
put $150,000 down.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.400
And every month put this much
out, and as you see that

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.270
number grows.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.755
The mortgage is the same, but
a lot of these expenses grow

00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:26.890
with inflation.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.980
But I want to compare that to
what happens if I take that

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.730
exact amount of cash, after
adjusting for how much money I

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.170
get back from taxes.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.490
And if I said, well, I'm going
to use that cash to pay my

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.440
rent and any other expenses
associated with renting--

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.810
which really aren't much-- to
pay my rent, and then put the

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.470
rest in the bank.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.430
So what we're saying is, well,
that assumption was, that you

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.950
can rent a similar
house for $2,500.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.690
It may be right, it
may be wrong.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.860
It's up for you to play with.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.440
And of course it grows with
inflation slowly.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.140
Obviously your rent doesn't
increase every month, but I

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.830
assume it does fairly
continuously.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.260
It's a reasonable assumption
I think.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.110
Although you can change it.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.880
You can make it only
step up every year.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.700
And then this line down
here tells us the

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.100
savings while renting.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.810
And I'm not saying the savings
from, you know, something's on

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.920
sale so I save money.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.660
But your savings in terms of how
much you have in the bank.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.370
So if you rented instead of
putting that $150,000 as a

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.170
down payment, you could have
put it in the bank.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.590
So that would be your savings
account at period zero.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.660
And then your savings account
at period one would be this

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.820
amount of money and whatever
return you got it, plus the

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.730
difference between your
cash out from buying a

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.860
home and your rent.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.670
So this is your savings.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.650
So what I do in this model --
and I could show you, I could

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.670
scroll through multiple
periods.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.710
Yeah, this model actually goes
as far as Excel would let me.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.160
But the average house -- anyone
who's traded mortgage

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.540
bonds will tell you-- the
average mortgage loan has a 10

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.260
year expected life.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.135
Because that's when, on average,
people tend to move

00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:05.000
or refinance.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.957
So what I do is I figure out,
well, given your assumptions

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:11.720
-- you can make your own
assumptions -- given your

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.880
assumptions, what is
your home value?

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.890
So let me make sure
I can get to that.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.360
So given your assumptions, what
this calculates is, well,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.250
it tells you what the home value
is after 10 years, your

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.150
debt after 10 years, your home
equity after 10 years.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.980
And it assumes you were
to sell your house.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.630
Because that's what the
average American

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.710
does after 10 years.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.370
And so what is the
transaction cost?

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.770
You pay 6% to a broker.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.290
Hopefully that won't be the
case in 10 years and the

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.050
internet will dis-intermediate
real estate

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.190
brokers, but who knows.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.780
I apologize to if
you are broker.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:52.410
And then this line, line 54,
that tells you what the net

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.470
cash is if you sell your
house at a market

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.800
price, you pay the broker.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.380
This number right here is much
simpler to some degree.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.410
It just tells you, well
let's say you decided

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.270
not to buy the house.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.160
Given all your assumptions, how
much would you have saved

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.360
in the bank at that time?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.110
And so this number right here,
this number is the difference

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.030
between those two numbers
in 10 years,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.276
discounted back to today.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.390
Actually I meant to
present value it.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.860
But did I present value
these numbers?

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.790
Oh no, I didn't.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.120
So actually this was meant
to be the present value.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.040
I'm going to correct that
before you actually

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.560
play with the model.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.990
Right now I just took the 10
year value, so this is the

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.980
value in year 10.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.450
This is the difference
between the two.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.230
The present value would be if
you discount this by some

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.900
discount rate.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.080
Whatever you think, probably
the inflation rate.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.240
And it would tell you in today's
money, what is the

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.480
benefit or the advantage of
buying versus renting?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.600
Anyway I've spent 14 minutes
of your time.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.610
I encourage you to download this
model, play with it, and

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.640
then work out the assumptions.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.690
Because I think that's
the important thing.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.150
Some people, they'll
make some set of

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.810
assumptions and say, ah-ha!

00:13:58.810 --> 00:13:59.670
I should rent.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.730
Or they say, ah-ha!

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.360
I should buy.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.220
But they don't realize that they
made some assumptions.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.630
That although it looks really
reasonable, let's say I make

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.870
this 3% annual appreciation
assumption.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.410
That doesn't seem crazy.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.060
But it's amazing how much it'll
change the model if you

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.750
make that 3% into a 1%, or if
you make it into even a

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.280
negative 1% or negative 2%.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.180
It's completely possible.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.660
It's happened before in the past
that you have flat real

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.360
estate prices for a significant
period of time,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.880
even 10 years.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.410
And actually most of the studies
show that real estate,

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.350
over the last 100 years, has
actually roughly grown, in

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.000
real terms, maybe 1% or 2%.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.910
So actually 1% or 2% percent
here isn't that conservative.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.560
And actually especially after
a big real estate

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.470
boom, may be prudent.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.950
So play with these
assumptions.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.870
And I think it'll give you
an intuition of what

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.790
are the real drivers.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.250
Another big thing -- sometimes
you don't rent a similar home.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.210
You'd rent a smaller home.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.590
So that would be a different
type of savings.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.770
And there are trade-offs
there.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.380
But anyway, hopefully you'll
find this model useful.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.240
I think it should be.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.020
People, this is the biggest
investment of their life.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.290
They should do serious analysis
when they think about

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.270
how they want approach it.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.810
And I'd like to think
that this is

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.180
fairly serious analysis.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.540
This is about as serious
as you can get.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.450
So enjoy!

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.250
See you in the next video.
