00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.150
We all, naturally, want to be winners. And
so, consequently, a great many countries are

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.610
designed to reward winners. These are the
countries that pay a good deal of attention

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.300
to optimising the conditions of life available
to people who win. In such lands, if one is

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.100
a winner and falls ill, the hospitals are
outstanding: The transport laid on for winners

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.570
is superlative: The housing for winners is
spacious, light and uplifting: And winner

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.140
children are educated in establishments that
resemble five star hotels: Of course, in such

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.899
lands, provisions for losers are not so quite
so comfortable. There isn’t the money left

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.659
over. So housing for Losers can be challenging:
Transport for Losers is something of a humiliation:

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.200
And the children of losers start to learn
young about their negligible status. This

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.589
could all sound worrying, but it tends not
panic us very much for one fundamental reason

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.540
related to how the human minds work. Most
of us naturally assume that we will – at

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.680
some point – become winners. You can see
this optimistic part of the brain in action

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.140
in our well-observed proclivity for playing
the lottery. Millions of us show an inclination

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.560
to believe that we will end up holding a winning
ticket – despite the daunting odds. The

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.619
chances of winning the UK lottery are one
in 14 million. This often isn’t enough to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.119
put many of us off. If we don’t play the
lottery ourselves, we may feel a bit sorry

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.270
for people who do. We may smile at their folly
in getting statistics quite so wrong. But

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.799
in the way we vote, we may display a strikingly
similar mindset. We too may cast our votes

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.999
for political parties determined to reward
a tiny subset of winners and cast the vast

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:06.240
majority of losers to a less dignified end.
We would do well to study statistics.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.440
The chances of starting a billion dollar company in the US.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.560
The chances of earning less than $200,000 per annum in the US.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.520
The chances of needing to depend on the state for health,
housing, transport or welfare over a lifetime, in the european countries.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.640
In short, a degree of financial fragility
is the statistical norm; being a loser is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.180
the norm. We are far more likely to end up
with a mediocre salary, with delicate health

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.379
and vulnerability to ill-fortune than we are
to end up robust, invulnerable winners. Yet

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.050
still we insist on creating and supporting
Winner Countries. Here are five of the world’s

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.019
top Winner Countries, countries that go out
of their way to make the consequences of winning

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:06.520
as pleasant as possible. In 5th place Brazil, in 4th place India , in 3rd palce China, in 2nd place the UK  and in 1st place the US

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.099
There are a few notable loser countries on our planet.
They tend not to get the limelight. Here is

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:21.390
the list of the world’s top Loser Countries:
5. The Netherlands 4. Germany 3. Switzerland

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:31.099
2. Norway 1. Denmark In Loser Countries, voters
graciously assume that they are and will remain

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.079
losers – and therefore set about trying
to make their condition as pleasant as possible.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.860
They make sure there is a public transport
system fit for losers: Public housing fit

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.439
for losers: And public schools fit for complete
losers: In these Countries for Losers, it

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:57.959
can be awkward to be a winner. No one applauds
you for driving a fancy car. Money won’t

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.040
buy you schools any better than the loser
ones. You might even go to a loser hospital

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.969
of your own accord. And your taxes might be
quite high. Both Countries for Winners and

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:13.840
Countries for Losers have their advantages.
The question is whether we are voting for

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.989
societies that reflect our own statistical
realities. By accepting that we will almost

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.139
certainly be and remain Losers, we might be
sad no doubt, but we may also be liberated

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:36.480
to scheme to live in societies that make the
consequences of failing a lot less bitter.
