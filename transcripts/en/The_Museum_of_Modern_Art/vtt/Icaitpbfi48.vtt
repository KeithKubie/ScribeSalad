00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Well, hello, everyone. My name is Dave Kehr.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.440
I'm a curator in the Department of Film here
at the Museum of Modern Art,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.800
and I'd like to welcome you all to this little chat.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.000
We're sitting here in the Titus 1 Theater
at MoMA,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is where we have most of our film screenings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.180
It opened in 1939 when this building did,
so it is now the oldest continuously operating

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.560
movie theater in New York City.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.000
And probably through this conversation you'll
hear a little rumbling in the background,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that is the sound of the oldest continuously
operating subway in New York City,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.540
which is located right on the other side of
the wall here.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.400
So nothing wrong there, just turn down your
woofers and we should be fine.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.040
Today we're gonna answer your questions about
the film department

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.000
and what it means to be a curator of film.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.300
We got quite a few questions on the other
videos we've posted here

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100
and we're gonna start with some of those.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.600
And our producers will pass me your questions
as they come in,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
so let's get to the first one.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.200
And it's the big question, Heather Malcolmess,
susebbentley, and nesin have all asked

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.400
more or less the same question.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.560
It's, "How do I become a film curator?"

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.600
I think the good news is there is no answer
to that question.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.480
There is no real career path, educational
path to this particular job.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:38.600
I came from almost 40 years as a film critic
writing for daily newspapers

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.380
when the film department contacted me

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.560
and asked if I'd be interested in coming aboard.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.000
We have other members of the department who
have started here as assistants and have gradually

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.640
worked their way up the ladder.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.400
We have other people who were trained at some
of the archival programs at NYU or Rochester

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
and have entered that way.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:13.720
It's a funny kind of job in that I don't think there are a lot of jobs like it in this country.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.340
MoMA is very generous in that they consider
the film curator job to be analogous to a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.480
curator's job in painting or sculpture,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.600
so we have a great deal of latitude about
what kind of scholarship we wanna do,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.880
what kind of programming we wanna do,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.600
what kind of research we wanna do.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.340
Yeah, it's been a wonderful opportunity for
me and I certainly hope that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.820
people who have a passion for this kind of work

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.660
are willing to pursue it and hopefully will
restore the ranks of film curators in the future.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.140
The only bit of advice I've ever had to offer
anybody who have asked me about

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.920
writing about film or curating film is that it's,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.880
like so many things in life, it's all about practice and repetition.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.120
I think you develop your taste as a critic
by watching as many movies as you possibly can,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.840
and you develop your writing skills by writing
as much as you possibly can.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.480
I'm not sure if these are things that can
be taught as much as they can be learned

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.620
through trial and error.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.180
It takes a while to develop a sensibility
and it's something that no one can give to you.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.580
It's not a subtle thing.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.580
You have to arrive at that point yourself
through your own reflections,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.440
through your own experience, through your own understanding,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.700
so it's different for everyone.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.140
Yeah, let's see what else we might have here.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.420
And indeed, Ginerva of YouTube asks,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.740
"If there is a specific path of studies that
I should undertake in university in order

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.180
to become a film curator?"

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:06.080
And indeed, I think a good background in film
history is definitely a must.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.540
Depending on what branch you wanna go into
there are certainly more technical pursuits.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.300
If you're interested in film preservation
that's a very distinct branch,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.500
working with the film elements, with the nitrate film,
with the negatives.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.500
That's something you can learn and probably
should learn in a university environment.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:36.400
There are a number of programs around the
country, UCLA, USC, Rochester, Indiana,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.340
all of them producing very fine people in that field.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.920
But if you're interested in more of the programming
side, I think, again, it's a question of,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:53.400
developing your taste, seeing what you can,
writing what you can, being able to make a...

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.100
learn how to make a good argument,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.540
which is something a lot of people need to
learn.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.840
It's not always about having opinions,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.180
it's about justifying your opinions and being
able to share them with other people

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.400
and convince them that what you wanna do makes sense.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.520
It's a wonderful field and one that's treated
me very well,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.340
and I wish I had a secret password that would
open the door and you could jump right in,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.820
but I'm afraid there just isn't one.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.340
This is something that I almost feel that
the hand of fate came down and tapped me on

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.340
the shoulder to do this,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.960
and it's just not the kind of thing I ever
really thought I would be doing,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.000
but I certainly consider myself very, very lucky to be doing it now.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.440
Let's see, well, dmayer o n Instagram wants
to know what did I study in university?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.120
And indeed, I did not study film.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.780
I am actually so old that there were no film
programs when I was at college in the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.360
University of Chicago.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.540
I studied English as an undergraduate and
had a passionate interest in film.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.100
We had a very active film society on campus
which is still there, Doc Films,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.540
University of Chicago.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.520
And that was just a terrific opportunity,
again, to see a lot of movies.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.740
We showed films I think five nights a week,
often double features.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.000
In the days mostly what we were getting was
on 16 millimeter, so there was a very wide

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.900
selection of movies available at that time.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.860
And it was, yeah, an unguided education in
the sense that I didn't have a professor

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.620
telling me what to look at.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.740
But there was plenty of literature available,
as there certainly still is,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.240
and I think the best thing to do is just to
plunge in and follow your nose

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.000
and see where it leads.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.500
You never know where you're gonna end up.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.980
Indeed.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.020
Here's a tricky one from Tug Nadley on YouTube.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.000
"What do you see as television's role in film
history?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Does the MoMA collection contain any content from the small screen?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.560
And as new content delivery programs like
Netflix continue to blur the lines between

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.420
weekly series and single films thanks to binge
watching,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.760
do you think that television programs will
become more prominent in film history?"

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.700
Well, that's a lot of questions there, and
these are things that we

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.740
are still struggling with on a daily basis.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.360
MoMA has some television but it's never really
been part of our method,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.060
at least up until now to collect television.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:47.080
This is the oldest, first archive in the world
that started collecting film as an art form

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.060
back in 1935,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:58.340
so we very much evolved from that sort of
theatrical film perspective.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.280
When television started coming into the '50s,
it just wasn't something that the museum was

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.400
collecting,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.660
unfortunately, because an awful lot of '50s
television is now lost.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.340
And as we've gone on it's more that we've
collected television work by

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.060
directors who were basically known for their theatrical films.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.240
In New York we have The Museum of Broadcasting.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.340
They have a wonderful collection of kinescopes
from that period.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.660
UCLA has a fabulous television collection in Los Angeles.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.760
But just not something that the MoMA has been
much involved in,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.340
but that's certainly something we have to think about.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.480
And as you say, theatrical film and streaming
are starting to converge.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.700
There's a lot of overlap and we're seeing
a lot of

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:52.800
very interesting work by theatrical directors working in that new long-form format.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.340
They got a lot of new talents coming up through
the long-form format who have really never

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.200
made a feature-length film.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.440
So definitely something we need to consider
as we go forward,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.920
and I'm sure we will start looking to that kind of work more seriously.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:22.660
Inevitably, you know, that kind of format,
the extended series, is gonna become more important.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.960
It seems like people are starting to lose
the habit of going out to see a

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.480
90-minute, 2-hour self-contained narrative film in the
theater

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.260
and they're more and more staying home and
watching these long-form fictions.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.240
That's gonna change the way we think about
film and television,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.680
and the beauty of a department like this is
that we are able to grow and develop as the

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.220
medium grows and develops.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:55.440
So I think we just have to stay tuned and
see where things go,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.000
but definitely that's a major shift in our medium right now

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.600
and it's something that MoMA is gonna have to

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.360
deal with very seriously in the years to
come.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.800
Let's see...well a YouTube question from Eva.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.800
"Hi Dave! You were a critic before becoming
a curator.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.840
How did writing about films first inform or shape your curatorial work?"

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.440
I've had a line about that for a while is
that

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.120
curating is the extension of criticism by other means.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.880
It's another way of expressing your opinion,
another way of making an argument,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.240
I think, to put together a program that suggests
a particular point of view.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:50.600
Yeah, it's definitely always using your critical
judgment as a curator.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.120
At the same time, you don't wanna rely entirely
on your own taste.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.760
You have to be open to other people's suggestions,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.000
try to give an overview of something that you're focused on.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:11.240
We recently did a program of early '30s films
from the Fox Film Corporation,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.640
and that's a collection that consists of a
lot of important films by major directors,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.920
like John Ford, and Howard Hawks, and William
K. Howard,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:25.160
and also consists of a lot of silly comedies
and musicals that have no particular

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160
authorial stamp on them.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.600
And yet, those are certainly fun to watch
and worthwhile seeing,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.520
and we're glad to bring those back and find them an audience when we can.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.000
So rather than just being a strict didactic
about it, these are the important films.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.840
I like to also get into some of the unimportant
films, some of the marginal stuff,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.360
some of the mere entertainment that people
were also watching at that time.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:12:00.280
I think we just got something off the live
line from Tree Island Horror on YouTube.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.280
"Hi Dave, have you ever acted in a film before?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.480
Did you ever want to work behind or in front of the camera?"

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.760
I have never acted in a film and I can't imagine
that opportunity is going to come up.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.100
I have worked on two documentaries, television
documentaries,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.040
one about Clint Eastwood and one about the director Budd Boetticher.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:32.040
But yeah, from early on it was never...filmmaking
was not for me.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.600
I was always more of a film watcher, more
of an analytical mind than a creative mind.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:44.200
And I've never really felt that pull to do
that.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.760
You know, my talents are such as they are,
seemed aligned in another direction,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.640
so I pretty much stuck with that for the course
of my career.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:04.500
And let's see...Instagram from Michael Paul
Phillips.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:11.600
"Are there particular techniques and/or aesthetics
you look for in a film to be featured at MoMA?"

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.040
Well, no really.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:23.440
Yeah, the trick is to be open to as many possibilities
as you can while still maintaining,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.500
I guess, a sense of quality and relevance.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.840
The last thing you wanna do is have a checklist
in your mind,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.320
"A movie has to do this, this, and this in order to be a good movie."

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.200
Francois Truffaut once said that every great
film defines its own aesthetic, and I

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.640
agree with that.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.320
What makes an Orson Welles film great is not
what makes an Ida Lupino film great.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.680
Director has an idea of the cinema to them
and their films are the explication of that idea.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:14.360
More and more we're seeing directors who rely
on heavily digital techniques,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.320
the possibility of taking an image apart and putting
it back together in ways that

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.640
previous generations of filmmakers just...

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.720
it just wasn't available to them.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.040
So that's a huge shift in aesthetics, and
one that I've kind of struggled with.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.480
The point at which heavily digital special
effects film really becomes something closer

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.280
to animation than a live-action film,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.040
still something that nags at me.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.040
I don't have a clear sense of where I stand
on that myself.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:54.560
But again, I think the important thing is
to be open to those developments and recognize

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.600
them when they come

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:03.960
and not get attached to one particular notion
of this is a movie, everything else is not.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Let's see, what else?

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:20.400
From Instagram, elmapetersone asks, "From
your point of view, how important is the role of a curator

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.480
in movie art saving or popularization?"

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.600
Certainly in saving films we play a pretty
important role.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:39.600
When MoMA started in 1935 there really weren't
any programs in place to preserve old movies.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:47.520
The studios had their vaults but often they allowed
things to disintegrate.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.320
A lot of movies were lost.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.640
It really took Iris Barry, who was the first
chief curator in the film department here

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.700
to say she wanted to pluck these films, kind
of, out of that flow of product.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:10.840
There are certain movies that deserve to be
kept, preserved, restored, treasured.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.920
And because she did that, and because she
did that on such a wide scale,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:22.920
a lot of important movies have survived that
would not have survived if Iris Barry weren't there

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.000
to pick them up.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:35.760
For example, we have pretty much every film
that the Biograph Studios made

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.720
between 1909 and 1914

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:45.240
because Iris went and bought the negatives
when Biograph went out of business in 1939.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.960
So we have amazingly good copies of some of
the most important films by D. W. Griffith.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.960
That was a collection that yielded what we
believe is the first full-length movie to

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.800
star an all-Black cast, a film called "The
Lime-Kiln Club,"

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.520
starring a vaudeville comedian named Bert
Williams.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.440
We found that we had the rushes, unedited
rushes for that film

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.200
were in the Biograph collection.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.480
And when my fellow curators, Ron Magliozzi
and Peter Williamson,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.960
put that footage back together,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.280
it produced a 15-minute feature-length film,
which would've been absolutely the first one of its kind

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.800
and the last kind for several years.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:36.400
And in that case, that's something we've now
made available for loans to other museums

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.360
and we hope to get that out on Blu-ray one
of these days.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.160
For popularizing a film, I don't know.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.160
We kind of intervene after the
fact after a movie has had its commercial career.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:59.520
We do have a number of programs here, like
the New Directors, New Films show that premiers

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.080
new films,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.880
hopefully movies that are going onto a commercial
career.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:12.360
So we can help to some degree by drawing attention
to movies that we like,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:20.600
but I don't think that's something that the
museum can really influence on a substantial scale.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.000
I mean, that really has to roll out, and it's the judgment of the public and the judgement of the audience.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
There's not a great deal we can do to promote
things after we show them.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Wish there were, but you know, that's the
role of critics, again, the role of

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.040
fans and an audience is to support this work.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.340
And we're always happy to return to them.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.300
There are lots of movies that were misunderstood
on their first release and it's nice to come

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.880
back in the context of the museum show

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.480
and give them another look because they can
look quite different 5 or 10 years later.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.880
It's something that happens all the time,
and that's what we're here to do.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:06.100
Let's see, another live question from Morgan
B on YouTube.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.560
"Is there one lost film in particular you
wish could be salvaged and viewed?"

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.420
Oh boy, that's a hard question to answer and
I think everyone would have

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.200
a different response to that.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.320
I'm gonna name something you've probably never
heard of which is a film by Josef von Sternberg,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.940
who you may know from his films with Marlene
Dietrich.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.940
One of his last silent films called "The Case
of Lena Smith," made in 1928.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.180
One of the last silent films released by Paramount.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.700
We only have about 10 minutes of it but those
10 minutes look absolutely sublime.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:49.100
And if I had one movie I could make magically
reappear I think it would be "The Case of Lena Smith,"

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.100
but, you know, you have a wide
range of opinion there.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.760
"London After Midnight" is one that a lot
of people mention.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.460
Certainly we'd like to have the complete original
cut of Orson Welles "Magnificent Ambersons."

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.940
Unfortunately there's just too many choices
there.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.920
There are a lot of things that have been lost
and we just...

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:17.380
the temptation is to concentrate on what we've lost rather than what we have.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:26.160
I prefer to think about what we have and able
to work with these films,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.060
work with damaged elements,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:37.320
work with dirty negatives, scratched prints
to clean them up and send them back into the

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.000
world again in a nice, new form.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.080
There is certainly no shortage of things that
we can dig into the archives and relaunch.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.000
We had a nice experience with that this year,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.140
a film called "Rosita" which was the first American movie directed by Ernst Lubitsch,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.260
one of the great directors in this medium.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:08.100
And Mary Pickford, who was then the biggest
star in the world, invited Lubitsch to come

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:15.600
over from Germany in 1923 to direct her in
a film called "Rosita,"

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.160
which she subsequently kind of fell out of
love with,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.240
even though it got great reviews at the time and was apparently quite successful.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.520
She more or less abandoned it and allowed
her copy to dissolve.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.340
But in the 1970s the head of the film collection,
a woman named Eileen Bowser found print

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:41.240
a print of this in the Soviet Film Archive and repatriated it.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.680
It was printed in such terrible condition
we really didn't feel like there was anything

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.340
we could do with it until these new digital
tools appeared a few years ago.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.860
And we were able to get a really good-looking
image out of this severely compromised

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.900
nitrate print.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:03.260
We've shown it in a few festivals now with
a live orchestra and we hope to have that out

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.000
and available with a recorded score in
the very near future.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.140
So it's something you might wanna keep an
eye out for.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:21.780
Let's see...Natasha Giliberti, also from YouTube.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.280
"How do you feel about the state of film right now?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.440
Do you feel inspired by the work being made today?"

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.580
I feel good about the state of film right
now.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.840
I think it's a time when a lot of new voices
are being heard.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.240
It's becoming an inclusionary medium.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.840
It was very exclusionary for years and years.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.320
I personally don't spend as much time watching
new movies as I used to.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.540
When that was my job I would see 8 or 10 new
movies a week.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.160
These days, most of the work I'm doing is
with archival films, older films, so I don't

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.160
see that many new films.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.860
But I'm always encouraged by the level of
activity that's going on out there, just the

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.460
hundreds and hundreds of films that are being
made and released.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.800
I'm sure there's lots of exciting talents
there and I count on my fellow curators to

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.960
bring them to me because

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:16.680
I just don't have the time right now to sort through that great mass of material.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.540
But again, it seems like a very exciting time
to be a filmmaker for me.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:27.140
Suddenly new technologies make it possible
for features to be made on tiny, tiny budgets.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:35.580
A lot of the old gatekeepers have fallen away,
and yeah, it's an exciting moment in film history.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.700
We'll see which way it goes. Does it continue
to be feature-length films for theaters?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.060
Does it merge into the television trend?

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.280
Nobody knows, so that makes it kind of exciting,
too.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.040
It's a turning point moment, I think.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.520
Many, many new developments going on and we
just don't know where they're going to lead quite yet.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Okay.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.200
And gabiyank3e on Instagram asked, "How
instrumental is taste to curation?"

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.200
I think, as I said, it's kind of key.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.760
You need your own sensibility.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:23.320
You need your own approach to this big pile
of stuff that you're confronted with every day.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:34.460
And the trick is not to keep your blinders
on, not to rely too much on your individual taste.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.960
The danger of not being open to new forms
is really immediate, you know, and one that

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.560
I have found myself struggling with.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.900
But nothing exists without that bedrock of
taste, and I think that bedrock of taste is

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.160
developed experientially.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.920
You just have to watch and watch a lot of
movies.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.240
You find your judgment improving, you make
comparisons almost subconsciously,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.660
and your sense of what is good develops, changes over time.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.000
And I hope that process never stops.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.460
I hope I continue to shift my understanding
of this medium as it grows and branches out.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:31.480
benglon on Instagram asks, "Which film first
got you interested in cinema and movies in general?"

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.920
And I have the most boring answer of all,
"Citizen Kane," Orson Welles.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.000
I had always loved movies as a kid.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
But "Citizen Kane," when I, in fact, probably
saw it I was maybe 10 or 12 years old was

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.440
the first one that made me think,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.100
"People make these. There's a director there.
There's somebody making these choices and

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.360
making these images."

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.900
And that's what really got me excited.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.920
It's in the realization that these things
aren't just handed down, that somebody has

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.540
to create them, and I became fascinated by
that.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.940
Who were these people? Who were all those
names in front of the film?

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:16.160
I think a lot of people have an experience
with Orson because he's such a forceful personality,

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.660
such an immediate director.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:24.400
But after you see some Orson Welles films
then you can start to appreciate, say,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.380
Howard Hawks, or Yasujiro Ozu,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:33.740
directors who don't have that kind of aggressive
style, are much more subtle or restrained.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.040
It's what they're not doing that becomes expressive.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:45.860
And yeah, that's always been my point of view
from very early on has been the director.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.680
And I know for other people, I have good friends
who are interested pretty much entirely in

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.880
stars, tracing star careers.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.560
I think that's a very valid approach, too.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.600
People who are interested in the history of
a genre, the western and detective movie,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.360
also a very valid approach.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.760
Yeah, again, this is something you find
for yourself, I think, and you have to identify

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.400
your own interests and follow them out.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:29.880
Someone named chezfoxyjam on Instagram wants
to know about MoMA's film still collection.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.640
Does it ever go on view?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.480
Well, I wish it could but it's several million
stills.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:43.320
This is a gigantic collection, again, that
dates back to the mid '30s when MoMA started

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.640
collecting film material.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.000
A big part of what we have is the photo files
from "Photoplay Magazine,"

00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:02.840
which was kind of an upper middle brow publication
in the '20s and '30s and wasn't the scandal magazine

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.520
it became later.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:10.000
But it was famous for featuring just beautiful
photography on every film, beautiful photography

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.180
of the stars.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:17.820
We have just a gorgeous collection of original
large-format prints from that era,

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.160
and these things are stunning.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.580
And there are just lots of them.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.080
We haven't actually ever been able to do a complete catalog

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.300
of the film stills collection, and I don't
know if we ever will.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.540
There are just so many of them.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.340
Right now they all live in our film archive
out in Pennsylvania

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:44.140
but we make them available to researchers who can make an appointment through the moma.org website

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:52.580
and we will send for the photos you're interested
in and you can look them over in our Film Study Center.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.000
But yeah, that's something we're very proud
of and we're very happy to be able to make

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.240
available to scholars and publishers.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:15.100
And on Instagram, iyoweia asks, "How do you
select the topic and context to show?"

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:23.860
Yeah, also it's not a question of coming up
with abstract ideas mostly.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:34.020
It's you get a sense of what's available,
what new restorations people are working on,

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:40.140
what studios might have, a new group of films
available.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:49.940
We have just done a series of films made by
a poverty row studio called Republic Pictures

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.680
in the '30s, '40s, and '50s.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:59.160
The studio has been out of business for years
but now the rights are owned by Paramount Pictures.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.100
And they've spent a great deal of money making
nice new copies of a lot of these films, and

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.440
some very, very nice stuff that hasn't been
seen in years and years.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:16.860
Martin Scorsese took in an interest in it
and has selected a group of 15 films that

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.420
will be showing starting in early August,

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:25.400
personal favorites of Mr. Scorsese's, most
of which have not been seen, at least in good prints,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.840
for 30, 40 years now.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.960
So that's the kind of opportunity you look
forward to and you really wanna jump on that

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.080
when it comes to you.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:45.720
Where it gets complicated these days is that it's becoming harder and harder to find theatrical-grade prints,

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:53.700
by which I mean 35 millimeter or good digital
copies, high-resolution digital copies

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.000
that you can show in a large theater,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.760
like the one you see here, and have the contrast
and the detail to really hold an audience's attention.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.740
Those are becoming harder and harder to find.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.480
Studios now are mostly interested in television
sales for those things.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.000
They're not doing 35-millimeter prints any
longer.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.120
The old prints are starting to wear out,

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:26.160
so it's becoming more and more difficult just to do a basic retrospective of director X, or actor Y.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.120
You'll have big holes in your program, important
films that just will not be available, and

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.480
that's regrettable.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.880
So yeah, you learn to program around that.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.720
Luckily there's still plenty of choices out
there and plenty of programs we can do with

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.020
the things we can find and bring to our audience.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.980
But I do feel that frustration when I can't
do...

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:56.420
well, I'd say Ida Lupino, very interesting director.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:03.040
Not many of her films are currently available
in good 35-millimeter copies

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.980
or nicely produced digital editions.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.940
We're working on one now that we have in our
collection, a film called "Never Fear."

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.380
We should have that available in a few months.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.600
UCLA Film and Television Archive had done
a couple, the Library of Congress has done one or two,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.960
and eventually we'll have critical
mass on Ida Lupino.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.700
We'll be able to show her 15 films all together
at once.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:34.920
People get an idea of what her accomplishment
was, I think the most gifted woman director

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.240
of the 1950s.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.520
But we can't do it right now.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.000
It's gonna take a little while longer until
we get those elements back together and

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.640
put them in the kind of shape that we can show
publicly.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.120
Let's see, did this just come in?

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.520
Nuha Su on YouTube asks,

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:10.540
"Do you think that visual spectacle is taking priority over quality storytelling in mainstream cinema today?"

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.340
Yeah, I kind of do.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:22.240
It seems like the narrative impulse is drifting
more toward those long-form television programs

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.500
and theatrical films are becoming more and more

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:29.960
about spectacle, about the special
effects, about the big sound.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:40.940
Yeah, you know, certainly I miss the more
narrative, dramatic-driven storytelling in

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.020
theatrical films, but it's not like it has
vanished.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:51.740
It's resurfaced in those long-form Netflix
and HBO series, and such like.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.700
Again, this is a moment of sorting, I think,
in film culture.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.360
New mediums that arise that can tell stories
in different ways.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.000
Maybe the old mediums are receding a bit.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.380
Again, this is something that we're gonna
have to pay very close attention to

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:20.240
for the next 5 or 10 years and you'll see what direction
things go in.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:27.500
But it almost seems like that visual spectacle
that you're talking about is what people will

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.720
pay money to see.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.880
That's what they'll put down their 10 or 12
bucks and go to a movie theater to see rocket ships,

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.960
and they won't spend that kind of money
to see a story.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.180
Somehow the expectation is that that's what
you get on television for free these days,

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.580
and to me that's unfortunate.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.880
But no point in being pessimistic because
these things are changing,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.080
and again, I don't see that that impulse is being suppressed.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.340
I think it's just being channeled in a different
direction now.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:12.520
And well, here's a question about our restoration
of "Rosita" I was just talking about from

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.420
Annabelle Zakaluk.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:22.660
"I just got the opportunity to see your restoration of 'Rosita' at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival!

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.520
Truly amazing."

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.000
Thank you very much.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000
"I have many friends who couldn't go, and
will you be releasing it on DVD or streaming?"

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.860
Indeed, this is something we are working on
right now.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:50.500
Expectations have changed, I think, for, excuse
me, archives in the last few decades in that

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.240
MoMA was always oriented toward showing movies

00:35:53.240 --> 00:36:00.000
basically in this room in a basement on West
53rd Street in New York City, and that was enough.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.160
I mean, people had no wider expectations than
that.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:14.180
But now that we live in an era of YouTube,
and streaming, and mass produced DVDs,

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.660
that doesn't feel like enough.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.400
And I know there are lots of people certainly
watching this feed who

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.480
are not within striking distance of New York City,

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:28.740
and we are looking for ways to make our stuff
available to you, too.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:38.100
It's not something we can do overnight because
we have to digitize the films in the collection,

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.320
which is an expensive and time-consuming process.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.300
We have to figure out how to set up our streaming system,

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.560
or what kind of disc distribution if we end up doing that.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.980
It won't be happening in the next few months
but I think it will be happening in the next few years.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:59.440
We definitely are gonna make a more concerted
effort to get our work out in that form,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.000
so hopefully we can share it with more people
than who just live in this zip code.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.580
Instagram from michaelpaulphillips.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.740
"Film is widely perceived as entertainment,
that being true in a lot of what is on the screen today.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.960
Do you think film is a fundamental
tool with education purposes, and why?"

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:32.080
I think that's one thing that movies can do,
certainly, is educate.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.340
I don't think it's the only thing they could
or should do.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:43.800
I'm grateful that that's a medium that admits
to so many different uses,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.840
so many different perspectives you can take.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.420
Personally I don't much care for a didactic
cinema.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:00.520
I like to be able to reach my own conclusions
about what the characters are doing or what

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.000
the politics of the situation might be.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
But there are contexts where that's important.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.780
We have a large collection of propaganda films
made during World War II made by the U.S. government,

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:21.220
and you can see some very stirring propaganda
pieces, which if they were employed in the...

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:29.640
put in the service of less credible ideologies
would be very disturbing, because that kind of

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.300
insistent, didactic tone is oppressive.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.940
Yeah, you know, I'm not a person who likes
to make rules.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.760
I'm not a person who's going to say, "The
movie can only do this, do that."

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:52.740
But certainly film can definitely teach.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:58.640
And perhaps a good example of that are Frederick Wiseman's documentaries where he just

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.640
drops you into a situation,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.160
the workings of a hotel, or a high school,
or a prison just for hours at a time.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.580
And it's really left up to you to, again,
make sense of what you're seeing,

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.840
establish parallels,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.140
see what this person is doing as opposed to
what that person is doing.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.000
It never feels didactic, but certainly after
you've left a film like that you've learned

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.620
a lot about what that life is like, what that region is like, what that profession is like.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.640
So to me, that's, yeah, educational in the
best way.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.220
And from YouTube, Luis E R asks,

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:46.300
"What is the process of admitting a film into the museum's collection?"

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.000
It's actually a fairly formal process.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.040
We have, what's called the film committee, which is a group of advisors and donors who meet

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.200
every two to three months,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.780
to review films that have been proposed by
staff, by the curators,

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:11.740
whether or not we want to purchase those films, or accept them as gifts into the collection.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.400
It's the same process that's used to acquire
painting and sculpture at the museum,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.560
so it's something that's taken quite seriously.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.820
It's not just anything that comes across the
transom is automatically accepted.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.680
There's still a sense that if it's in the collection at the Museum of Modern Art that that means something,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.640
and it definitely is true here.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.220
Yeah, these works are vetted.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.300
It's not a random collection.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:40.000
It can certainly look that way if you looked at a list of what's being proposed at any given moment,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.340
but we're fairly confident that a film gets into
the collection it's there for a good reason.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.800
And a lot of people have looked at it, have passed on it, and we think it's something that

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.540
we wanna save for posterity

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.240
and we'll do our best to make sure that it is available for future generations.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.240
So it's something we take very seriously.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.620
And a live question from Mikhail S. on YouTube.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:15.940
"Do you think that with the cinematic direction
of TV shows, specific episodes or whole TV

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.850
Definitely.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:11.850
Again, relating to something we were talking
about earlier, we recently showed six episodes

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:12.850
of a TV series that Rainer Werner Fassbinder
did in the 1970s.

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:13.850
He did two other series and we've shown those
as well.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:14.850
We have the structure to do that.

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:15.850
It's not something we do regularly, and again,
it's coming from the perspective of this is

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:16.850
what are we going to do about "The Sopranos,"
or something like that which is clearly

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:17.850
an important cultural event, current purview?

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:18.850
be changing the next few years is

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:19.850
And there are new examples of that all the time, so that remains very much an open question here and

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:20.850
it's something we'll be thinking about and
debating for years to come, I think.

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:21.850
But maybe it should.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:22.850
Those are the first movies made in the United
States.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:23.850
here and

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:24.850
I won't enter that debate, but we have some
of the first film that passed through his camera.

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:25.850
And here's Alvaro and Anastazia who are asking,
"What is the oldest film in MoMA's collection?"

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:26.850
Well, we have all of the movies that Thomas
Edison made in East Orange, New Jersey.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:27.850
thanks to Iris Barry who acquired all the surviving negatives in the 1930s going up to the mid teens.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:28.850
There's a lot of disputed claims about whether
those are the first movies period.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:29.850
I won't enter that debate, but we have some
of the first film that passed through his

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:30.850
camera.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:31.850
So that dates to, you know, 1893, 1895.

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:32.850
A guy named John D. Collins, who has really
been just discovered in the last two or three years

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:33.850
made movies between 1915 and 1919

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:34.850
to the mid teens.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.850
A fantastic collection, and we're still working
on that.

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:36.850
Early film is its own thing, you know, very
interesting.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:37.850
It takes a little more work because they don't
have all the tools that were developed later

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:38.850
but there were definitely some important artists
working in those films.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:39.850
A guy named John D. Collins, who has really
been just discovered in the last two or three

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:40.850
years made movies between 1915 and 1919

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:41.850
when he died in the big flu epidemic that
year.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.850
And he clearly would've been a major filmmaker,
but again, someone who was just unknown

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:43.850
South Africa, Rome, Los Angeles, Dubai, Montreal,
Bulgaria, Greece, Taiwan, and even New York City.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.850
the collection at the George Eastman Museum
in Rochester and uncovered this work.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:45.850
So it's a fascinating field and one I think
that's growing very quickly in academic circles.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:46.850
And I feel a responsibility, I definitely
wanna get our movies out beyond our immediate area

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:47.850
So many, many things to look at, many things
to study.

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:48.850
Looks like we have a little note here about
the number of people who are tuning in.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.850
We'll be in Venice the end of next month showing
a new restoration at the Venice Film Festival.

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:50.850
We'll actually be back in Italy in October
at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival,

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:51.850
a great film festival to show a brand new restoration of an Ernst Lubitsch film called "Forbidden Paradise."

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:52.850
"Rosita" will be in Australia next year, San Paolo next year, so we're starting to make some inroads out there.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:53.850
I'm shocked, but very, very grateful that
you were able to join us for this session.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:54.850
And I feel a responsibility, I definitely
wanna get our movies out beyond our immediate

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:55.850
So I think we're running out of time here, and I hope we've covered a few topics of interest to you,

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:56.850
and I would love to be able to show our films
in Greece, and Bulgaria, and South Africa.

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:57.850

elsewhere.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:50:58.850
We'll be in Venice the end of next month showing
a new restoration at the Venice Film Festival.

00:50:58.850 --> 00:50:59.850
We'll actually be back in Italy in October
at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival,

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:00.850
a great film festival to show a brand new
restoration of an Ernst Lubitsch film called

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:01.850
We have a film playlist where we put together
all of our how-to-see videos that we talked about today.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.850
"Rosita" will be in Australia next year, San
Paolo next year, so we're starting to make

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:03.850
some inroads out there.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:04.850
and we'll have a link for that in the description
below.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.850
And if we didn't get to your question during
this session  please post them again and we'll

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:06.850
So I think we're running out of time here,
and I hope we've covered a few topics of interest

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:07.850
to you,

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:08.850
and I definitely appreciate all the great
questions and comments you've been leaving

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:09.850
in the comments section here on YouTube and
elsewhere.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:10.850
And if you enjoyed this video we'd like to
urge you to check out the other videos we

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:11.850
But certainly a film can definitely, definitely teach.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:12.850
drops you into a situation,

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:13.850
It's not a random collection.

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.850
Here's Alvaro and Anastazia who are asking,
"What is the oldest film in MoMA's collection?"

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:15.850
For more on the history of film at the Museum
of Modern Art you can check out the new film

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:16.850
portal on MoMA Learning,

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:17.850
and we'll have a link for that in the description
below.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:18.850
And if we didn't get to your question during
this session please post them again and we'll

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:19.850
try to get to those in the next few days.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:20.850
So thanks for tuning in.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.850
Please keep sending us questions and let us

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:23.350
