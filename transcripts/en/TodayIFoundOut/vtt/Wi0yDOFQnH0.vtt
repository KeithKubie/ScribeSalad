00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:14.480
The 
practice of referring to “excessive bureaucratic

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.590
rigmarole” as red tape dates back more than
400 years to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.210
and King of Spain, Charles V (1500-1558).

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.300
As heir to three of Europe’s most powerful
dynasties (Habsburg, Valois-Burgundy and Trastámara),

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.620
at the height of his power, Charles’ empire
stretched from Spain in the west to Hungary

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.519
in the east, and from the Netherlands in the
north to Sicily in the south.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.840
In addition, Charles had significant holdings
in the New World, and an enormous administration

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.710
to manage his vast empire.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.089
At the time, administrative documents were
bound in some fashion, either with rope, string,

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.420
ribbon or cloth.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.949
Sometime during the early 16th century, in
order to distinguish the most important documents

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.869
that required immediate discussion at the
highest levels of government (such as the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.450
Council of State), from those of less significance,
Charles’ ministers began tying important

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.290
papers together with red string or ribbon.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.120
Seeing the efficacy of such a system, the
method was soon adopted across Europe, and

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.899
in fact, England’s Henry VIII used red string,
ribbon or cloth to secure the petitions he

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.799
sent to Pope Clement VII requesting annulment
of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.799
1527.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.229
Note that well before this time, tæppe had
been an Old English word that meant “narrow

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.100
strip of cloth used for typing, measuring,
etc.” and its use dates back to at least

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.380
the late 16th century.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.649
So, while it’s not clear that Henry’s
court called it red tape, it is possible.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.819
As for the term “red tape,“ reference
to this string for important papers dates

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.930
back to the late 17th century where it was
written in Maryland Laws: “The Map . . . upon

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.209
the Backside thereof sealed with his Excellency’s
Seal at Arms on a Red Cross with Red Tape.”

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.740
The Oxford English Dictionary dates its current
meaning to 1736 and John Hervey’s Poetical

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.700
Epistle to the Queen: “Let Wilmington, with
grave, contracted brow, Red tape and wisdom

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.650
at the Council show.”

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.060
Another early instance of its metaphorical
meaning is seen more clearly in Catherine

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.450
Gore’s Stokeshill Place (1837): “My dear,
you mistake John Barnsley.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.400
Dearly as he loves a bit of red tape, you
never saw him try to inspire any other man

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
with the love of business.”

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.140
Shortly thereafter, the term became widely
used, including in Charles Dickens’ David

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.610
Copperfield (1849-1850): “Britannia, that
unfortunate female, is always before me, like

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.380
a trussed fowl: skewered through and through
with office-pens, and bound hand and foot

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:06.100
with red tape.”
