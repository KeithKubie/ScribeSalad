Speaker 1:          00:00          It took me a long time to understand what sacrifice meant. Um, because on the surface of it, especially the way it's acted out, like burnt offerings and that sort of thing, it just seems like, well, it seems so archaic and, and distant from us that it's not really comprehensible, but partly from reading John Piaget, I started and neat you for that matter. I started to understand that people often acted out conceptions before they understood what they meant. You know, when we act out a lot of things we don't understand because we're much more complex than we can represent. So we're always acting out things we don't understand. But so there's this idea in Cain and Abel that you have to make sacrifices in order to stay on the good side of God. And so I thought about that. Um, practically say not so much metaphysically but practically, and realized that that was equivalent to the discovery of time of the future because we do, we do act and that, and this is a peculiar discovery of human beings, may be a consequence of our expanded intelligences that we're actually aware of the future.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And we actually treat the future as if it's something that you can bargain with. Now, partly it's because the future is other people and they remember your reputation, they remember your past actions. And if you do someone a favor, then that favor is in some sense stored up in the future. So you can think about the future as a place of judgment about your moral actions. And it's not that far from that to imagining a god who's keeping track of that or who even is that. But in any case, the idea of sacrifice emerges in the story of Cain and Abel and Cain and Abel both make sacrifices to God in order to stay on his good side, let's say. And what a sacrifice means is that you give up something of value in the present so that you can be so that you can improve the future.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And you know, that's no different from what we call discipline. It's exactly the same thing. It's just thought that concretely acted out version of that. And so, you know, the idea basically was that, well God was in the transcendent heavens. And, and the first question would be, well, why is that when it's like, well, if you go out and, and really dark night and look up at the sky, you have a sense of what's beyond you, what, what's transcendent, what's infinite? And, and so to associate that with the highest of values is a reasonable association, right? From, from a say, from an emotional point of view. So it's not particularly primitive. It's a smart, um, metaphor or it's a smart intuition that, that, that, and it's above you. And you know, we tend to think of when you're moving towards an ideal, that you're moving up, that you're moving above, you're moving to the mountain top, right?

Speaker 1:          02:35          You're, you're going up, not down. And so it all sits within that same framework. And it's partly because when you go up, like on a mountain, you can see for long distances, right? So those are all those things are tangled together. So anyways, so the idea is that you have to give up something of value now, so you, so that you make the future better. And sometimes it's even something you love now. Now that's a good example too, because often the things that stop us from moving forward, our, our attachments to things that we should no longer be attached to. Right? And in fact, you can almost make that definitional if you're not moving forward in your life. There's a high probability that you have some idea or some mode of action or some habit that you're so in love with that you won't let go of it.

Speaker 1:          03:23          So, all right, so Cain and Abel, Cain and Abel make sacrifices and there's kind of a hint in the story that it's just a hint that came sacrifices. They're sort of second rate. But in any case it's ambivalent tay. But, but Abel, he just does wonderfully well and everything works out for him. And everyone knows people like that, you know? And so God accepts his sacrifices. But for some reason he rejects canes. And maybe it's the arbitrary Agnes of God or maybe it's cause Cains heart isn't in the right place when he's making his sacrifices, which is more likely. And so Ken goes and has a chat with God and he says, basically what he says is something like, how in the world can you possibly justify this universe that you created? You look at me and I'm breaking myself and half trying to adapt and to make things right and it's not working.

Speaker 1:          04:15          And then there's this able character and things come easy to him and everything is flourishing for him. And so like what the hell? And if you don't understand that question, then you're not thinking because it's very, very frequently the case when a serious catastrophe besets you in life that you essentially ask exactly that question. What's the meaning of life? What's the purpose of the world? How come there's suffering? And it's easy to become resentful and vengeful as a consequence of that. And so you got to think about what state of mind having your sacrifices rejected puts you in, especially when you see someone who's successful because that's where the jealousy and resentment starts to starts to what faster is probably the right word. And so God says to Cain exactly what he doesn't want to hear, which is, well, yeah, okay, but you have made lots of mistakes in your life.

Speaker 1:          05:12          So he basically says, sin is at your door like a predatory and sexually aroused animal, and you've invited it into your house to have its way with you and produce something creative as a consequence. So he was used as sexual metaphor, you know, and so that you've willingly gone down the negative path and you've allowed that to enter into you and, and to operate in a creative manner and you've spun off all these terrible thoughts and, and this justification for not acting properly. And that's why things aren't going well for you. And so don't lay that at my feet, which is the most brutal possible message he could have got. And so then he leaves the presence of God, let's say. And it says in the story that his countenance fell, which meant he was basically enraged. And so what does he do? It goes out and kills Abel.

Speaker 1:          05:58          And then that's, that's a very fascinating idea because Abel is his ideal. So kills is ideal. And when you kill your ideal, you're lost. And then he does that to take revenge on Abel, but also to take revenge on God, which I think is extremely interesting. And, and a deep, deep idea. Like these kids who shoot up high schools for example, you cannot understand what they're doing unless you understand the story of Cain and Abel. You cannot understand what possesses them until you can understand that someone, even someone who doesn't believe it doesn't matter. It's the psychological state of mind that matters, is they're out for revenge on being itself. And that's why they produce as much mayhem as possible in the shortest period of time. That's why they sacrifice in innocent people because it's much more vengeful and, and demonstrative to kill innocent people than to kill guilty people.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Right? Cause it's a worse sin, so to speak. And then they killed themselves and they killed themselves as a final demonstration of their belief in, in nihilism and the horror of existence. Because you might say, well, why don't they just kill themselves first and save everyone the trouble? You know? And there's narcissism in that too, because they know their names are going to be splashed across the page. That's their notoriety instead of their accomplishment. And of course, the media is unbelievably complicit in that. Um, but well, so when you're talking about motivation for evil, then you have to understand what it is that's driving it. And it is a deep resentment about the structure of being for being what? Saturated with suffering, but also for rejecting. You're rejecting your sacrifices and that, you know, that produces the bitterness of failure. And I'll stop with this. One of the things that's really interesting about the old testament is that, and the Jews in the Old Testament is that they don't take the path of cane every time they're walloped by God, which is like fairly frequently. They say, we must have done something wrong and we have to set ourself right. And that's, uh, an unbelievably heroic attitude because that's the alternative to cursing fate. It's like you take the responsibility for failure onto yourself.
