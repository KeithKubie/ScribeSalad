arguably better hardware but the games

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
arguably better hardware but the games
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080
arguably better hardware but the games
on 360 were probably looking better for

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
on 360 were probably looking better for
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690
on 360 were probably looking better for
a long time because of the amazing tools

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
a long time because of the amazing tools
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.160
a long time because of the amazing tools
that were running on the platform

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
that were running on the platform
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.780

I am super biased cuz I worked on a 360

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790
I am super biased cuz I worked on a 360
 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.940
I am super biased cuz I worked on a 360
but someone working on ps3 would tell

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
but someone working on ps3 would tell
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.200
but someone working on ps3 would tell
you that their tools were amazing to you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
you that their tools were amazing to you
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.730
you that their tools were amazing to you
that's why they could make fantastic

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
that's why they could make fantastic
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.790
that's why they could make fantastic
games so we're gonna explore tools on

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
games so we're gonna explore tools on
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.770
games so we're gonna explore tools on
running on Vulcan and now what we use a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
running on Vulcan and now what we use a
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.010
running on Vulcan and now what we use a
tool for all used tools for improving

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
tool for all used tools for improving
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.530

game performance and jeongu will show

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
game performance and jeongu will show
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.009
game performance and jeongu will show
you how you can use these tools and you

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019
you how you can use these tools and you
 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.560
you how you can use these tools and you
can use best practices to literally make

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570
can use best practices to literally make
 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.009

games sing using Vulcan and then we are

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
games sing using Vulcan and then we are
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.530

these Titans to tell you that Vulcan is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
these Titans to tell you that Vulcan is
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.120
these Titans to tell you that Vulcan is
viable on Android it's been a bumpy road

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130
 
 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.420
 
there are issues we know that I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
there are issues we know that I
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.930
there are issues we know that I
personally work on games that either

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
personally work on games that either
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.270
personally work on games that either
ship Vulcan only or shipped with Vulcan

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
ship Vulcan only or shipped with Vulcan
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.540

Vulcan is viable and we're gonna go to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100
Vulcan is viable and we're gonna go to
 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.420
Vulcan is viable and we're gonna go to
great lengths to show you how and why

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430
 
 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.360
 
one of the characteristics of Vulcan is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370
one of the characteristics of Vulcan is
 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.050
one of the characteristics of Vulcan is
well the driver overhead is much lower

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
well the driver overhead is much lower
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.990
well the driver overhead is much lower
compared to OpenGL which basically means

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
compared to OpenGL which basically means
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.180
compared to OpenGL which basically means
the things like state validation let up

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190
the things like state validation let up
 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.509
the things like state validation let up
in OpenGL happens all the time like

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519
in OpenGL happens all the time like
 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.420
in OpenGL happens all the time like
you're submitting a draw call and the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430
you're submitting a draw call and the
 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.880
you're submitting a draw call and the
drivers like other states correct yeah

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890
drivers like other states correct yeah
 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.949
drivers like other states correct yeah
they are submitting and Rocco are they

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959
they are submitting and Rocco are they
 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.920
they are submitting and Rocco are they
really correct yes they are you check

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
really correct yes they are you check
 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.900
really correct yes they are you check
right a second ago in Vulcan it's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910
right a second ago in Vulcan it's
 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.780
right a second ago in Vulcan it's
something that you do once you cash you

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790
something that you do once you cash you
 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.610
something that you do once you cash you
build your state pipeline and off it

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620
build your state pipeline and off it
 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.410
build your state pipeline and off it
goes you render as many turtles as you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420
goes you render as many turtles as you
 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.240
goes you render as many turtles as you
like with that pipeline and it's

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250
like with that pipeline and it's
 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.880
like with that pipeline and it's
immutable it doesn't need to be verified

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890
immutable it doesn't need to be verified
 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.289
immutable it doesn't need to be verified
every time this means lower driver had

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299
every time this means lower driver had
 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.910
every time this means lower driver had
lower CPU consumption lower CPU usage a

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920
lower CPU consumption lower CPU usage a
 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.350
lower CPU consumption lower CPU usage a
lower power consumption simple

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360
lower power consumption simple
 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.520
lower power consumption simple
assumption I mean you can use to build

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530
assumption I mean you can use to build
 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.069
assumption I mean you can use to build
as much as like which is for me one of

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079
as much as like which is for me one of
 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.560
as much as like which is for me one of
the main reason to start thinking about

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570
the main reason to start thinking about
 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.150
the main reason to start thinking about
Vulcan your CPU will be engaged

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160
Vulcan your CPU will be engaged
 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.330
Vulcan your CPU will be engaged
reasonably less than with a standard

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340
reasonably less than with a standard
 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.730
reasonably less than with a standard
OpenGL renderer which means that you're

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740
OpenGL renderer which means that you're
 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.770
OpenGL renderer which means that you're
gonna give more chances to the various

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780
gonna give more chances to the various
 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.770
gonna give more chances to the various
course to go to sleep and consume less

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780
course to go to sleep and consume less
 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.219
course to go to sleep and consume less
power

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229
power
 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.020
power
which also means that they're gonna have

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030
which also means that they're gonna have
 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.719
which also means that they're gonna have
less chances go into thermal throttling

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729
less chances go into thermal throttling
 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.010
less chances go into thermal throttling
I talked yesterday about it - for about

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
I talked yesterday about it - for about
 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.000
I talked yesterday about it - for about
20 minutes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010
 
 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.129
 
lower power consumptions means longer

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139
lower power consumptions means longer
 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.440
lower power consumptions means longer
battery life which means more money in

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450
battery life which means more money in
 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.469
battery life which means more money in
your pockets also Vulcan has been
