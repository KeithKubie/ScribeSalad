00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.980
And the correct answer, and this time there is a

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.689
correct answer to the best question, is bcrypt. Use it,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.450
learn it, love it. You may find yourself intim, implementing

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650
an algorithm like I described before because a lot of frameworks

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.860
to be honest, get this wrong but, make sure you're

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.710
using bcrypt. There is a python module for bcrypt. There's

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.340
I don't know, there's, bcrypt exists for almost everything, so.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.650
There you go alright good job guys that's that for now.
