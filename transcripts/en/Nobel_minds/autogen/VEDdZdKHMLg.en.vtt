my start into science was sort of
 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.289 align:start position:0%
my start into science was sort of
coincidental<00:00:04.220><c> because</c><00:00:05.220><c> i</c><00:00:05.430><c> was</c><00:00:05.580><c> in</c><00:00:05.850><c> sports</c>

professional athlete and I remember that
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.020 align:start position:0%
professional athlete and I remember that
I<00:00:31.099><c> got</c><00:00:32.099><c> sort</c><00:00:32.430><c> of</c><00:00:32.640><c> port</c><00:00:33.649><c> to</c><00:00:34.649><c> it</c><00:00:34.860><c> went</c><00:00:35.520><c> the</c><00:00:35.730><c> time</c>

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 align:start position:0%
I got sort of port to it went the time
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
I got sort of port to it went the time
and<00:00:36.420><c> so</c><00:00:37.410><c> I</c><00:00:37.489><c> enquired</c><00:00:38.489><c> whether</c><00:00:38.730><c> I</c><00:00:39.120><c> could</c><00:00:39.570><c> on</c><00:00:39.870><c> the</c>

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 align:start position:0%
and so I enquired whether I could on the
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.229 align:start position:0%
and so I enquired whether I could on the
side<00:00:40.350><c> to</c><00:00:40.800><c> some</c><00:00:41.480><c> research</c><00:00:42.480><c> and</c><00:00:44.780><c> this</c><00:00:45.920><c> was</c>

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
side to some research and this was
 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.779 align:start position:0%
side to some research and this was
relatively<00:00:48.239><c> successful</c><00:00:48.899><c> I</c><00:00:49.680><c> would</c><00:00:50.489><c> give</c>

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 align:start position:0%
relatively successful I would give
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
relatively successful I would give
swimming<00:00:51.180><c> lessons</c><00:00:51.899><c> to</c><00:00:52.289><c> the</c><00:00:52.620><c> professor</c><00:00:53.309><c> of</c>

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 align:start position:0%
swimming lessons to the professor of
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090 align:start position:0%
swimming lessons to the professor of
chemistry<00:00:53.969><c> and</c><00:00:54.510><c> he</c><00:00:55.079><c> would</c><00:00:55.230><c> let</c><00:00:55.410><c> me</c><00:00:55.440><c> work</c><00:00:55.829><c> in</c>

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
chemistry and he would let me work in
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
chemistry and he would let me work in
his<00:00:56.280><c> laboratory</c><00:00:58.460><c> in</c><00:00:59.460><c> exchange</c><00:01:00.059><c> and</c><00:01:01.070><c> so</c><00:01:02.070><c> I</c><00:01:02.100><c> got</c>

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 align:start position:0%
his laboratory in exchange and so I got
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
his laboratory in exchange and so I got
a<00:01:02.520><c> PhD</c><00:01:02.820><c> in</c><00:01:03.239><c> inorganic</c><00:01:03.660><c> chemistry</c><00:01:04.640><c> that</c><00:01:05.689><c> got</c><00:01:06.689><c> me</c>

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
a PhD in inorganic chemistry that got me
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.290 align:start position:0%
