00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.045
Voiceover: Let's say I am an economist,

00:00:02.045 --> 00:00:05.274
and I am curious about
whether, in general,

00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:07.681
things are getting more expensive or not,

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.143
and if they are getting expensive,

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:10.605
by how much?

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.009
The way I'd approach that is,

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.135
I'd think of, what are just
a bunch of goods and services

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:16.937
that the average person would buy?

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:20.427
I would think up some type

00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:26.083
of basket of goods and services,

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:27.803
and I would try to weight that basket,

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:30.137
based on how people
actually spend their money,

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:32.400
so I would say, "Okay,
40% of people's money

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.268
"on average are spent on housing;

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.516
"maybe another 10% is
spent on transportation;

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:40.137
"maybe another 10% is spent on food,"

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:41.675
and I would go out into the market,

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.742
and I would try to take an average

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.201
of what these things cost,

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.742
and I would sample a bunch of products,

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:47.946
a bunch of services,

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:49.943
so I could get a decent average of that.

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:53.944
This is not a simple thing to do,

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:54.974
but I am an economist,

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:56.441
and I am serious about
trying to calculate it.

00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.813
Let's say that when I
take that weighted average

00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:01.072
of all of the stuff, I
just come up with a number.

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:02.904
I'm not giving you the details

00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:04.888
of how it's actually calculated,

00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:06.144
but to give you the idea

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:07.667
of what they are doing.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.856
I get a number.

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:14.156
To rent, to buy or lease
your average automobile;

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:15.743
to lease your average apartment;

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:18.007
to buy your average servings of food

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.801
for a given family; all the rest;

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:23.501
let's say I come up with, that costs,

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.003
and I'm making up a number here,

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.833
let's say that it costs $20,000.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:30.007
My basket of goods and services.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.408
Just based on the way
that I've weighted it.

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:35.409
This is all happening in year 1.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.901
This is in year 1.

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.011
I'm curious whether between year 1

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:45.272
and, let's say, year 5,

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.170
and year 5,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.467
whether things got more expensive.

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:52.578
I'll take that same basket
of goods and services,

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:58.826
so, basket of goods and services,

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:00.012
and I'll try to figure out

00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:02.769
what is their weighted
average cost in year 5?

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:05.374
This is a lot harder than
it might sound right now,

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:08.208
because the baskets of
goods and services change.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:09.758
If computers get faster,

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:11.279
do you use the same computer,

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.466
or do you think about what
the average computer is,

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.124
which would now be a better computer?

00:02:15.124 --> 00:02:17.335
If most people's TVs got bigger,

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:20.083
do you use the same TV
in year 1 and year 5

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.743
or do you adjust for what
is now the average TV,

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:23.939
which is now bigger?

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.907
If houses have gotten bigger on average,

00:02:25.907 --> 00:02:26.996
do you use the same house,

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:28.208
or would you use the average house?

00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:29.740
There's a whole bunch of areas here

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.344
that you can really tweak,

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:33.742
and these are actually
huge subjects of debate,

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:36.750
on what is the actual increase in cost.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.938
Let's say that you're able to do this

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.539
in what you think is a
pretty reasonable way,

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.012
and you find that the
same basket of goods,

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:45.407
adjusted for things like
technology and all of the rest,

00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:50.080
now costs $22,000.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.387
Your takeaway from here

00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:54.991
is that the same things that cost $20,000,

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:56.067
the things that gave you

00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:57.671
the same standard of living in year 1,

00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.280
to get that same standard
of living in year 5,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.079
you now need to spend 10% more.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.032
It's gotten $2,000 more
expensive off of $20,000,

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:10.312
so it's gotten 10% more expensive.

00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:11.615
You, as the economist,

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:14.134
what you would say is, as
the way you've defined it,

00:03:14.134 --> 00:03:16.568
your consumer price index,

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:18.670
and this is abbreviated with CPI,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.535
consumer price index,

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:26.341
your consumer price index is up by 10%.

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:28.678
Or another way, based on
the way you measured it,

00:03:28.678 --> 00:03:30.199
and it changes from country to country,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.337
and even within countries,

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:35.005
they change the way that they
do these basket of goods,

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:36.400
but by the way you've measured it,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.408
you would say that price inflation,

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:43.573
or, you would say that

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:47.599
the price inflation has been 10%

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.338
between year 1 and year 5,

00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:53.635
or in general everything
got 10% more expensive,

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:55.610
or you would need 10% more money

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.748
to have the same standard of living.

00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:00.599
In general, when people are just referring

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.339
to inflation, so if you just see

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:05.335
the word "inflation" being referred to,

00:04:05.335 --> 00:04:07.053
especially in modern times,

00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:09.681
they are referring to price inflation.

00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.384
This general increase in the
price of goods and services,

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.104
measured by some type of basket of goods.

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:17.077
There is another type of inflation,

00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:20.072
and that is monetary inflation.

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.801
Monetary inflation; and they are related.

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:26.866
Monetary inflation is inflation due purely

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.301
to an increase of the money supply.

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:34.884
This is increase in money supply.

00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:39.138
In general, if this
increase in the money supply

00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:42.739
does outstrip the productive
capacity of the country,

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:46.827
it could very well lead
to price inflation,

00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.676
but in general what people measure,

00:04:48.676 --> 00:04:49.737
when they talk about inflation,

00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:50.672
from one year to the next,

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:52.276
they're talking about
this basket of goods.

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.152
They're talking about price inflation.

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:56.087
The other thing that you'll sometimes see,

00:04:56.087 --> 00:05:00.337
maybe in year 5, someone says,

00:05:00.337 --> 00:05:02.608
"Hey; I could sell you this house,"

00:05:02.608 --> 00:05:05.409
so this is in year 5,

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.890
"I could sell you a house,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:14.140
"and this house in year 5 is $660,000."

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.556
Is $660,000.

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:19.889
Someone might ask, what
would be that price

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.301
if we adjusted it for
inflation in year 1 dollars?

00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:25.403
What they're saying is,

00:05:25.403 --> 00:05:30.405
if you adjust for how much
value your money has lost,

00:05:30.405 --> 00:05:32.387
because if things are
getting more expensive,

00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:34.733
that means each dollar
is being worth less.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:37.132
You can buy less with each dollar.

00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:38.624
When people say, "How much is that,

00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:42.222
"adjusted for inflation in year 1 money?"

00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:43.339
you're essentially saying,

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.471
"What amount of money would that house

00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:47.407
"have had to cost in year 1,

00:05:47.407 --> 00:05:49.312
"that when you adjust it for inflation,

00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:51.683
"when you increase it by 10%,"

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:53.976
so that's the same
thing; increasing by 10%

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:57.886
is the same thing as multiplying by 110%,

00:05:57.886 --> 00:06:00.405
or multiplying by 1.1,

00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:02.670
so, "what amount of money would that house

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.384
"had to have cost in year 1,

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.403
"that if I multiply it by 1.1,

00:06:06.403 --> 00:06:09.680
"I get $660,000?"

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.929
We could do a little
bit of quick math here,

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:12.537
to figure that out.

00:06:12.537 --> 00:06:14.953
If we say, let's say that, I don't know,

00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:16.196
let's call it P.

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:18.266
P is the price of the house in year 1.

00:06:18.266 --> 00:06:19.862
I'll call it P1.

00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:22.135
That x 1.1 ...

00:06:22.135 --> 00:06:24.157
x 1.1

00:06:24.157 --> 00:06:28.073
is going to be equal to $660,000,

00:06:28.073 --> 00:06:32.068
when you factor in the 10%
inflation over these years.

00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:33.672
This is simple algebra right here.

00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:36.941
You can divide both sides by 1.1.

00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:40.198
Divide both sides by 1.1,

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:44.607
and we get, these cancel out,

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:48.025
you get the price of that house in year 1;

00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:51.395
$66 divided by 11 would be 6.

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:52.938
You could work it out with a calculator,

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:54.017
if you don't feel comfortable

00:06:54.017 --> 00:06:55.362
with what I'm about to do,

00:06:55.362 --> 00:06:59.366
but this would give you $600,000,

00:06:59.366 --> 00:07:01.605
if you work this math right out here,

00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:03.181
and you could figure out the decimals.

00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:04.273
What we could do ...

00:07:04.273 --> 00:07:06.799
I think you get the general idea here.

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:07.863
You can use your calculator.

00:07:07.863 --> 00:07:09.475
I did this one in my head,

00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:10.732
but the general idea is,

00:07:10.732 --> 00:07:15.061
a house in year 1 that is $600,000,

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:16.593
$600,000,

00:07:16.593 --> 00:07:19.565
if you factor in the
devaluing of the currency,

00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:22.268
or how much more expensive everything got,

00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:25.105
in year 5 would cost $660,000.

00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:27.136
You might hear someone say,

00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:28.363
when they're talking about inflation,

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:30.184
or they're talking about price increases,

00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:33.629
"This house in year 5 is $660,000,

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:46.357
"which is equal to
$600,000 in year 1 money."

00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:48.465
As an example of that,
I live in a neighborhood

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:51.609
where the houses have
gotten all of a sudden,

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:54.107
because I live in the
heart of Silicon Valley,

00:07:54.107 --> 00:07:57.133
it's not a fancy neighborhood by
any stretch of the imagination,

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.285
but the houses now are quite expensive,

00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:01.285
and we have neighbors
who moved in in the '50s,

00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:02.662
and they say, "My God; I bought our house

00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:04.660
"for $10,000, and now people

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.992
"are selling these
houses for so much more."

00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:08.998
The reality is, is that it is true;

00:08:08.998 --> 00:08:10.995
the house has appreciated,

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:15.233
but $10,000 in 1950 was
actually a lot, a lot, of money.

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:18.148
Doctors and engineers did
not make that much more

00:08:18.148 --> 00:08:20.234
than that much per year.

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:21.593
I don't know the exact amount.

00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:24.602
The reality is that you
actually have to adjust money

00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:26.263
for the year that you're talking about,

00:08:26.263 --> 00:08:28.405
and you have to adjust it for inflation.

00:08:28.405 --> 00:08:31.609
If you believe this 10% inflation number,

00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:35.483
hopefully people's incomes also
increased by the same amount,

00:08:35.483 --> 00:08:38.994
so the same person with the
same skills and the same job,

00:08:38.994 --> 00:08:42.741
who could afford the house
for $600,000 in year 1

00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:45.865
could now pay $660,000 for it,

00:08:45.865 --> 00:08:48.159
and it won't take an unusually large chunk

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.932
of their expenditure.

00:08:49.932 --> 00:08:52.741
It would take the same
chunk that it did in year 1.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.883
Hopefully that clarifies
things a little bit,

00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:57.262
and I'll, in the future, do more videos,

00:08:57.262 --> 00:08:59.700
going into the details of inflation.
