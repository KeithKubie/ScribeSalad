00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Edward Hopper is a painter of gloomy paintings that don't make us feel gloomy.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.860
Instead, they help us to recognize the loneliness that so often lies, at the heart of sadness.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.260
In his Automat

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.400
women sits alone drinking a cup of coffee

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.840
It's dark outside, and judging by her hat and coat, it's cold.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.180
The room is large, empty and brightly lit, the decor is functional,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.860
and she seems slightly self-conscious, and little a afraid.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000
Perhaps, she's not used to sitting alone in a public space

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.420
something seems to have gone wrong,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.900
and the viewer is invited to invent stories for her

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.200
of betrayal, or loss

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.800
She maybe trying not let her handshake, as she takes the coffee cup to her lips,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.960
It might be eleven at night, on a dark February night,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240
in North America

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.800
Automat is a picture of sadness, and yet it is not a sad picture.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.920
There can be something enticing, even charming, about anonymous diners.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.880
The lack of domesticity, offers a relief, from what can be, the fullest comforts of home.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.320
It may be easier to give a way sadness here,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.640
than in a cozy living room with wallpapers, and framed photos.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.760
Home often appears to have betrayed Hoppers characters.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.080
Something has happened there, that forces them out in to the night, and on to the road.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.240
The 24 hour diner, the train station waiting room, and the motel,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.920
are all sanctuaries for those, who for sound reasons,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.480
have failed to find their place, in a normal world of relationships, or community.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.120
Hopper's ability to portray solitude,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.200
came from his own familiarity with it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.720
He was born in 1882, in a ship builders town, Upper Nyack, New York.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.720
He lived a nice, middle class childhood, as a son of a merchant.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.640
And, yet inside, Hopper often felt awkward, indeed a bit like an outsider.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.400
In one early portrait, we see him gazing, almost distrustfully, at the viewer.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.680
Hopper longed to be an artist, and yet his parents insisted,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760
he trained an commercial art, to keep afloat financially.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.520
He hated it, and to escape, he took several trips to Paris,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.320
under the pretense of studying french art.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.640
But in truth, he didn't feel a connection to the salons,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.240
he absorbs some of the impressionist, but forgot Picasso's name.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.120
He preferred to be outdoors,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360
watching children playing in the Luxembourg gardens,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.240
listening to concerts and --.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.480
or travelling up and down the Seine, by boat

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.480
In 1913, when Hopper was 31,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.880
he settled in Greenwich Village, in New York,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.960
where he would stay for the rest of his life.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.960
This is where he discovered how crowded, and yet isolated, life could be in the city.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.520
The population of American cities was skyrocketing,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.680
and yet, they were inhabited by passing strangers, who were increasingly alienated from one another.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.000
Hopper would ride the L-train, and look down at, in his own words,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.680
dark glimpses of office interiors, that were so fleeting as to leave fresh and vivid impressions on my mind.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.760
In each room, a separate drama was unfolding, an unnoticed oblivious island, in the sea of people.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.240
Although Hopper painted a New York for over a decade,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.120
his paintings failed to sell, and he often struggled to find inspiration.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.920
Then in his early-forties, he met a beautiful social painter, named Josephine.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.080
Edward and Josephine took excursions to paint by the sea, they went to the movies, they went to the theatre,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.200
and eventually, they got married.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.360
Hopper was no longer, so alone.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.560
But, of course, as most of us discover in our relationships,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.160
Hopper's marriage didn't permanently end his feelings of isolation, and woe.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.880
He still felt lonely at times.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.080
He and his wife, couldn't quite figure out their sex life,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.640
and she often seemed to prefer, the company of her cat.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.640
Hopper discovered that even, when somebody loves us very much,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.400
There is always some essential part of us, that remains alone.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
It is, this recognition that makes his paintings so compelling,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.160
and indeed, by addressing loneliness, the art can at it's most therapeutic.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.400
Consoling us, and reassuring us that --, and sorrow are normal,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.160
and that we are neither strange nor shamefull, for experiencing them.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.880
Sad and lonely art, allows us as viewers, to witness an echo, of our own grieves and disappointments.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.960
And therefor, to feel less personally persecuted, and pursued by them.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.800
Hopper's art helps us to notice, the landscapes of loneliness in our own lives.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.000
A side effect, of coming into contact with any great artist,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.200
is that we come more aware of the things that the painter would had been receptive to.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.720
Nowadays we've come to accustomed to what one might call a "hopperesque",

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.440
a quality found, not only in the North American places that Hopper visited, but anywhere in the developed world,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.760
where there are motels, and service stations, roadside diners, and airports, bus stations,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400
and all night supermarkets.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.440
For example, service stations readily evoke Hopper's famous "Gas", painted thirteen years after "Automat".

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.480
In this painting, we see a petrol station on it's own, in the impending darkness.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.880
The isolation is made poignant and enticing.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.200
The darkness that spreads like fog from the right of the canvas,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.640
contrast with the security of the station.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.320
Against the backdrop of Night in the Wild Woods,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.200
and the last outpost of humanity, a sense of kinship seems easier to develop, than in daylight in the city.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.960
Hopper loved the introspective mood that travelling often puts us in to.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.320
He liked painting the atmosphere inside half empty train carriages, making their way across the landscape.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.160
But we can stand outside our normal selves, and look over our lives in a way that we don't,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.120
in more settled circumstances.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.320
We have all known the atmosphere inside Hopper's car C No. 293

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.280
that perhaps we have not recognized it as well, as when Hopper has held the mirror up to it.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.840
After Hopper's marriage, his professional life suddenly improved as well.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.760
He felt more creative,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.200
it was the era of the great depression, and yet his paintings began to sell.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.960
Critics rated, museums bought his work, and he received awards.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.200
Yet despite his succes, he remained deeply introverted,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.360
and instead of escaping his solitude, he embraced it.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.880
For decades, he turned down the awards, rejected the speaking opportunities,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.440
and lived simply, out of the public eye.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.720
He died in 1967,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.520
and yet his art remains, and retains the ability to help us to see, the loneliness in our own lives,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.400
from a wiser, and more mature perspective.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.480
Oscar Wilde, once remarked that there had been no fog in London, until Whistler painted it.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.680
There was of course lots of fog,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.520
it was just that it was harder to notice it's qualities, without the example of Whistler,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.080
did direct our gaze.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.520
What was said of Whistler,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.000
we may well say of Hopper.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.680
That there were far fewer strangely haunting,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.640
and consolingly beautiful service stations, and train carriages, motels and dinets,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
before Hopper began to paint.
