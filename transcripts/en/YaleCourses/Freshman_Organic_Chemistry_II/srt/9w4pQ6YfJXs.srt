1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,180
Okay. I realize it's reading period.
So we're supposed to be having fun.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,160
So the structure of glucose is really fun.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,733
Uh,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,660
I originally had this lecture mostly
about the synthesis of two unnatural

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:22,890
products. These last two lectures are
going to be where to be about synthesis,

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,270
one about unnatural products and
one about natural products. Um,

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,560
but glucose is such a great story
that I couldn't miss telling it.

8
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,130
So we might not get to the synthesis of
two on natural products or I might just

9
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,790
mention it at the end. Uh,
it's also a Nobel prize work,

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,560
but so is the structure of glucose and
there are no bell prizes and Nobel prizes,

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,980
but the structure of glucose
is a really great Nobel prize.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,020
Okay. So we saw last time
that their carbohydrates,

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,180
and I found who used the word first, it
was a guy named Schmid and 1844 he said,

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,100
meb allowed to denote compounds
with carbon plus hydrogen
and oxygen in the same

15
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:05,490
ratio that obtains in water
as carbohydrates. That is,

16
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:10,350
it doesn't have to be one to one,
one carbon to one water. So, uh,

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,490
there were examples,

18
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:16,491
known light grape sugar was isolated
pure in 1792 and it was given by do the

19
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,900
name glucose, which comes from the Greek
word glucose, which means sweetness.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,220
Okay? So that's where glucose came
from. But even more important,

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,970
the OSC ending,
which is just part of the word glucose,

22
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,050
came to be the generic
ending for all showrunners.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,610
So when you say something owes, that means
it's one of these carbohydrates. Hey,

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,200
and we remember that Cooper,

25
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:44,760
as soon as structure became something
that you could talk about because of the

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,593
Tetra Valence of carbon,

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,380
he proposed that there was another water
added to give the hydrate of glucose,

28
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:53,250
which is just fine. That would still
be a carbohydrate. And he was right,

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,230
right?

30
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,910
So you can have owl doses
like glucose where you hit,

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,650
where you take hydrogens,

32
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,230
two hydrogens from the top
carbon put them on either end.

33
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,980
So you have an Aldehyde or
you can do the next car,

34
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:11,790
but or the next carbon and get ketones.
So you can have ketosis, for example,

35
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:16,290
fructose as a kito. Some
glucose is an Aldehyde. Uh, now,

36
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,140
how do you know this? Uh, of course,

37
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:23,280
nowadays we know the structure of
things by spectroscopy. For example,

38
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,580
here's the IIR spectrum of glucose.
This Aldehyde,

39
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,570
what do you notice specially
about this spectrum? Anything?

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,310
What would you look for if you're
looking for the, for, for a sugar,

41
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,570
you'd look for Oah groups. Sure
enough, big goal. Each peak.

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,340
And you look for what other group?
Yeah.

43
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,170
And Tanya,

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,750
the Aldehyde. Carbondale. And where
would you look for, do you remember?

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,280
You look for it around 1700 and
it's not there or could do the Nmr.

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,530
So here's the Proton Nmr of crystal and
glucose. You dissolve it in d two o.

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,430
So now you don't have the
Oah protons there. Uh, uh,

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,290
and there's the Proton Nmr spectrum. And
again, there's no way down field peak,

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,630
no Aldehyde,
or if you look at the carbon NMR spectrum,

50
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,740
no downfield peak for Aldehyde
or ketone either. Right?

51
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,900
They would both come down
there and the carbon spectrum,

52
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:30,820
of course there wouldn't be a
hydrogen on the, on the ketone. Okay.

53
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,570
Now, um, so look,

54
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,050
let me draw it to try to explain this.
Draw it in a funny con formation,

55
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,870
which could be an equivalent
equilibrium with a Hemi key. Tau.

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,550
Remember with either acid or
base Qatar Alesis in water here.

57
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:53,410
Deuterated water. You could make a Hemi
key towel down here at the bottom, right?

58
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,780
Okay, so all the o's are ods,
right? But here you have ages.

59
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,430
Now let's blow up that part of the Nmr
spectrum that that you can see there.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,580
And what peak stands out,

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,020
the one far down field,
what's it do to

62
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,680
which of the hydrogens in this compound
should come the furthest down field?

63
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,123
Hi,

64
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,420
has national what?
They all have the note.

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,910
Uh, the one here you mean? Yeah.

66
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,060
Now that one is on a carbon that
has two carbons attached to it.

67
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,820
Add an oxygen right?
And oxygen's,

68
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,840
withdraw tend to shift things down field.
Can you do better than that?

69
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,570
There's one oxygen to withdraw
from that carbon, right,

70
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,913
Megan,

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,010
right? The equatorial one, the
one at the far right, right.

72
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,690
Has Two oxygens pulling on it. The
one that's on a Hemi Ke Tau, right?

73
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:20,460
So it's way down field. Now notice
that there's a little peak here.

74
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:25,350
A little doublet. What's that do to? Well,
it could be just impurity, but it's not,

75
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,200
because if you let it sit a day,
it grows and the other one shrinks.

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,870
Right. It's also down field. Right.

77
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,010
So it looks like it's got more oxygens on.
Anybody got an idea?

78
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,683
Wow.

79
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,680
What did you call this one,
Megan? Suppose it had been axial,

80
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,910
right?
Then if you had a ring current

81
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,060
as in benzene,

82
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,110
you don't hear this one would be downfield
and the one where it was axial would

83
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:07,280
be upfield more over the top of the
ring. Right? Can you get it there?

84
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,240
Yeah, you can go back here and attack
the carbon eel from the other side.

85
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,910
Right. And get that one. Now
how do you know which is which?

86
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,570
How do you know which one was axial
on which one was that tutorial? Well,

87
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,990
you might use this argument about
written currents. People talk about that.

88
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,670
I'm not sure whether it means anything.

89
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,640
There are other kinds of arguments you
could make that might have to do with

90
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,474
that too.

91
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,470
But one thing that's clear in the spectrum
is that there's a doublet splitting

92
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,500
here, which is about eight hertz
and a doublet splitting here,

93
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:38,120
which isn't even half as big.

94
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,750
So one is a big splitting and one is
a small splitting. Now, which one is,

95
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,750
what is it that splitting this hydrogen

96
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,100
Carl.
Um,

97
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,170
sometimes ideas are place with an age,

98
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,120
so there has to be another h on the
adjacent carbon. It's splitting that one,

99
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,120
right? So this a chair, and in this case,

100
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,760
this h here would be doing it.
Okay.

101
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,390
But one of them is a big splitting
and the other as a small splitting,

102
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,850
Sebastian,
you've got an idea.

103
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,440
I'm on there, right?

104
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,790
The top one is Auntie,

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,340
the other one is a ghost. So there's
much better overlap, Auntie then Gauche,

106
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,200
right? So this one is the
one that's Auntie, that's
the one with axial hydrogen.

107
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,680
And this is the one,
the one that came from the crystal.

108
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:34,100
So the crystal was all the same. You
dissolve it and it begins to equilibrate.

109
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,611
Right.

110
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:39,611
And ultimately has more of the more of
the Ecuadorian hoodie than of the axial

111
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,100
Odi. Right. And in fact,

112
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,740
if you look at the original
material just after you dissolve it,

113
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:49,670
it has a rotation of 112 degrees
optically accurate, right?

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,120
But after a day in d two O it's only 53
degrees because the other isomer is 19

115
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:56,721
degrees.

116
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:00,860
So people use that before there was
spectroscopy to try to figure out what the

117
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:04,640
ratio of the two was that equilibrium.
Okay.

118
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,850
Or if you really want to do it,
you do it by x Ray de Fraction.

119
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,790
And then you get Cartesian
coordinates for all the atoms.

120
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,800
That's what you do nowadays.

121
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,060
But the interesting thing and what
got a Nobel prize was not this,

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,770
it was how did they know?

123
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,820
How could they figure out what
the structure of glucose was?

124
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,430
Well,
a lot of sugars,

125
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:30,260
we're known in the last half of the
19th century when Vantiff road is, uh,

126
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,640
the German version of his book
in 1877 he mentioned a lot of,

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,320
of, uh, of sugars as
optically active. For example,

128
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,120
here he cites glucose.

129
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,930
He also cites love yellows and in
fact those both come from sucrose.

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,200
Sucrose is a more calm,
more complex sugar.

131
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:55,380
It's a key towel that has
two of them together, right?
But if you take them apart,

132
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,970
one of them is that one of them is
glucose and the other is Levia Los,

133
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,660
which is also called toast.
Do you know why it's called Levy lows?

134
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,860
What's Livo mean?

135
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,090
Actually the English word is
the same root left, right?

136
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Livo is left. Dextro is right
in Latin, right? So it rotates.

137
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,070
This rotates right light to the left.

138
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,280
This rotates light to the right and it's
called dextrose also or Dextrin down

139
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,150
here.
Okay.

140
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:32,130
He also mentioned lactose and it was
found in 1876 that lactose treated with

141
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:36,660
acid gives also glucose,
but another one called Gal actose,

142
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,160
which comes from the Greek word for milk.
So it's called milk sugar in German.

143
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,090
So the lactose obviously came from milk,
5% of milk.

144
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:48,300
I think my weight is lactose sugar.
Okay.

145
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,490
Or there's stuff called Mannitol, which
came from Manna. They, they would, uh,

146
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,650
uh, slash the bark of flowering
ash trees around the Mediterranean.

147
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:01,680
And this stuff would ooze out
in which they called Manna.

148
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
And from that they got mad at all and
mannitol turns out to have these kinds of

149
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,340
Cho age groups that fat off was interested
in cause they made things chiral.

150
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,330
But notice and Mannitol,
the two ends are both ohs,

151
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,800
the Aldehyde on the end has been
reduced in this case. Right.

152
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,970
Or both ends can be oxidized,
right.

153
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,670
As in what's called sugar acid.
Right.

154
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:31,671
So you could have both ends be an
acid or you can have a rabbit knows,

155
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,360
uh,

156
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,070
which comes from was isolated
at 1873 from gum Arabic.

157
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,880
Right. A gum that came from Arabia.
You know, if you're an actor,

158
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,390
you've put your mustache on with gum
Arabic. I think he used to, anyhow,

159
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,300
I don't know. Uh, okay.

160
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,600
And in fact it was possible
to take mannitol and oxidize
it back to an Aldehyde.

161
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,390
That must've been a tough thing to do
because aldehydes or very hard to stop at

162
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,730
an Aldehyde.
But somehow in 1888,

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,720
they were able to get mannose or
maybe even maybe just a teeny,

164
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:11,100
teeny bit of man who's doing
that. Okay. So, so, uh, Aldehyde.

165
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,911
Okay.

166
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,420
So there were lots and lots of these
known and people fiddled around with them

167
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,660
and found out what you'd
get if you oxidize to what
you'd get, a free or reduced.

168
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,460
And so on and on comes
Heinrich, Kelly, Yani,

169
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,150
the hydrogen cyanide man,
right?

170
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,930
Because in this paper in 1855,

171
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,220
which fortunately I've translated here,
he says,

172
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,420
while a large number of compounds are
very easily formed upon oxidation of

173
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:42,210
Dextrose,
remember Dextrose is glucose.

174
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:46,650
It rotates light to the right by
dilute nitric acid or by halogens.

175
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
These molecules are retained six carbons
bound together in a chain under the

176
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:56,770
same conditions. Levia lows. The
other one that came from, from uh,

177
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,230
the other one that came from sucrose,

178
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,790
yield substances containing chains
with smaller number of carbons,

179
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,060
like glycolic acid or
inactive tartaric acid here.

180
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,590
That's Misa tartaric acid, okay. Here,

181
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,800
oxidation causes immediate
splitting of the molecule.

182
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,140
It breaks the carbon chain of fact,

183
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:21,890
which means that Levia Lowe's is a ketone.
So that the the,

184
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,820
so that glucose or dextrose has the,

185
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:28,120
an Aldehyde at the end of the chain
and you oxidize that to an asset.

186
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,150
But if you have a ketone in the middle
of the chain and you oxidize it,

187
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,230
you break the chain, right? Uh,

188
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,610
so it must be a ketose of some sort.

189
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,950
Bearing in mind further
the fact that love you,

190
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,880
Lowe's is transformed into man
a tall by nascent hydrogen.

191
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,490
Nascent means at the
time that's being born.

192
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,790
They had this interesting
idea that those days,

193
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:52,590
that w that when they dissolved
sodium and alcohol, it, uh,

194
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,420
it generated hydrogen,
right?

195
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,160
But this hydrogen was more reactive than
most hydrogen and could reduce things

196
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,530
that normal hydrogen
glass gas couldn't do.

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,740
So they said it was nascent hydrogen
that could do things. In fact,

198
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,330
of course it was, it was the metal
actually transferring electrons to the,

199
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,460
to the compound to be reduced.
But anyhow, he said, well,

200
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,030
if you do that with Levy Los,
you get man a tall,

201
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,440
which remember was the thing that has
o h on both ends of the chain. Right?

202
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,300
So it was possible to reduce
the, the, if it was a Ketose,

203
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,020
a ketone in the middle channel
already had alcohols on the end.

204
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,920
But if you reduce the ketone
to an alcohol, then you
got alcohols all the way.

205
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,590
Let's like man a tall,
which they got from that.

206
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,840
So one comes to the conclusion that love
yellows must be a judge to have one of

207
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:41,630
the following two constitutional formula.
Either CEO,

208
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,780
they can't be the first carbon.
That's the Aldehyde.

209
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,690
That's the one where you reduce it.
It doesn't break or oxidize,

210
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,930
it doesn't break the chain. You
just get an acid here. Uh, if you,

211
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,120
if it's a ketone here,
you break the chain.

212
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,430
If it's a ketone here
or you break the chain,

213
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,920
what if it's a key tone
on the next carbon down?

214
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,010
Okay.

215
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,600
Why didn't he consider that?

216
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,110
So it's the same as the same as the one
above, right? There are only two. Okay.

217
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,950
Ah, okay. So was it
one or is it too, okay.

218
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,150
So he goes on in the paper to say one
could hope to distinguish definitively

219
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,800
between one and the other formula.

220
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,560
By succeeding at adding Hcn
to the ketone radical level,

221
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:31,490
that level you lose love you Lowe's and
transforming the Cyan hydrogen into the

222
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:35,840
corresponding carboxylic acid.
So you had CN hydrolyze it.

223
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:40,490
So at Coh it adds to the carbonyl carbon.
So it from compound one,

224
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:44,630
you would get this I had in CN here
and turn it into carboxylic acid from

225
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:48,710
compound to you from the ketone on the
next position down Uday ad here and get

226
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:53,510
that carboxylic acid. Okay. So, uh, then,

227
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,100
so the question is if you take,
if it has this structure,

228
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,320
then you add HTN Hcl,

229
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:05,321
you get this and it's very concentrated
Hcl we used incidentally or uh,

230
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,580
or if it's the next one down, you get
this. Okay. So you'd do it and decide,

231
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,900
all you have to know is which product
you get. Get it pure, see what it is.

232
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,410
The problem is these things as almost
all things are in sugar chemistry are

233
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:23,480
Syrup's, right? It's very, very,

234
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,670
very difficult to get crystals from them.

235
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,820
So it was really hard in
those days to purify things.

236
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,760
Nowadays you could do chromatography
maybe or something like that,

237
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,830
but then it was essentially impossible.

238
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,270
So they had to try to make things simpler
so that they could so that they had a

239
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,650
chance of crystallization.

240
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,490
He says it must on exhaustive reduction
by concentrated Hii yield methyl butyl,

241
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:50,930
a Siddique acid. So this
one, the one on the top,

242
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,990
we'd give methyl beautiful acetic
acid reduced with Hii and phosphorous.

243
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,790
And on the contrary,

244
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,791
the carboxylic acid from compound to
would give ethyl propyl a Siddique acid.

245
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,200
So all you have to do is know which
of these you've got a, and he said,

246
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,980
this is fine.
He said this does not.

247
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,330
But when he did the reaction
and got the product,

248
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,340
which should be either this or this,

249
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,640
he says it does not agree
with the description that
hex to gives of the calcium

250
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,150
salt of methyl butyl acidic acid.
So heck t said,

251
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,540
had done a lot of good work
on this compound, including
making the calcium salt.

252
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,650
He was able to crystallize the calcium
salt as a product he got and it didn't

253
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:38,570
degree with Hecht, right? So he says, uh,

254
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,250
which means that my hip to know AIC
acid is identical with ethyl propyl,

255
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,870
a Siddique acid.
So this is the one he's got,

256
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,920
but that compound wasn't known so he
couldn't be sure about it. Right? Uh,

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,840
but anyhow, he concluded that it must
be this since it's not hex compound.

258
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,490
Uh,
now the next year he,

259
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,000
in 1886,
he reacted

260
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,600
Ethel as Ceto acetate.

261
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,430
So this is a acid group
on a CD, Esther, right.

262
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,230
What's special about those hydrogens?

263
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,480
Active methylene adjacent
to two carbon goes,

264
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,910
you make the anti and you
can put an art group on,

265
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,960
you can make the anti and again,
put another art group on.

266
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,910
So we put on methyl, he put on
beauty or put on Ethel, pardon me?

267
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,960
Put on propyl. Right. And then what we,

268
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,930
what I told you last time is
that when you hydrolyze this,

269
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,090
you get the acid and
then it decarboxylated.

270
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,270
So from the a cdot, a cdot,
acetic ester synthesis,

271
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,900
you Lucio too and get a ketone.
But he did it differently in those days.

272
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,210
He used really,
really strong Koh,

273
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,550
which doesn't give a ketone,
it gives assets,

274
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,560
it gives acetate that is you at
the hydroxide attacks here. Uh,

275
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,440
CDEC acid comes off
generating that an eye on,

276
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,530
which then picks up a
proton from the SCT Casad.

277
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:14,100
So you say you have acetate and the,

278
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,650
and a and an acid at ion,
right?

279
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:20,580
Which you then put a proton
on and you got this right.

280
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,060
So he made authentic stuff,
but it wasn't,

281
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,540
didn't agree with what
he got from love yellows.

282
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,520
So now from Hackney knows it wasn't this,
and from his own work,

283
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,720
he knows it's not that.

284
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,310
So now he began to wonder about
Hecht and just how good Hecht was.

285
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,023
Right?

286
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,670
So he went on and did the same thing,

287
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:48,480
putting on methyl and
butyl to make this right.

288
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,120
And he compared it with the product from
this and found that the calcium, barium,

289
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:58,980
strontium and lead salts all agreed in
their properties. So Hecht was wrong.

290
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,030
He said at the end of the paper that
Hector's going to go back and look at this

291
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:07,850
a little more, but at any rate, he was
then able to prove that, that, that, uh,

292
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,740
love yellows or fructose
has that structure.

293
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:13,530
The carbon eel is in the second position,
so he's,

294
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,260
he now knows the constitution
of fructose. Okay. Uh,

295
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,290
then he talks this paper from 1887 is
on the composition and constitution of

296
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:28,020
Arab Barrick acid and Arabah knows,

297
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,110
so now he's going to look
at a different sugar, right?

298
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,400
And what he says is in a report
dated 27, November, 1886,

299
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,290
I showed on the one hand that Arrow,

300
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,610
Barrick acid formed by oxidation
of Arabah knows, has the,

301
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:46,440
the formula show in there. But on the
other hand described several derivatives,

302
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,700
Urbanova's carboxylic acid
with the formula c seven.

303
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,150
So it was uncertain whether Arabah knows,
had a rabid knows,

304
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,020
was uh, was uh, uh,

305
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,290
a five carbon sugar or a six carbon sugar
if a five carbon sugar and he oxidized

306
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,120
that he'd get five carbons.

307
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,330
If it was a six carbon sugar and he
added a HCN to add another carbon,

308
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,820
he would get c seven.
So here he says,

309
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,460
he admits that he had
said contradictory things.

310
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:21,840
One that implied that it was [inaudible]
another that implied it was the six.

311
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,820
Since at that time I had no basis in
truth to dispute the generally accepted

312
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,620
formula for revenues,
which is that it c six,

313
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,240
the analyses are very similar
to one another, whether it's,

314
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,620
whether it's one or the other.

315
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,140
And my analytical results did
not contradict either assumption,

316
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:42,570
so he couldn't be sure whether Arabah
knows the stuff that came from gum Arabic,

317
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,710
uh, was c five or c six, right?

318
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,180
So we took Arabah knows he added HCN.
Uh,

319
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,760
he made the Arabah knows carboxylic acid.

320
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:57,760
This stuff that you've
talked about up there. Uh,

321
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,170
but he said then it was c seven here. He
made it with one, two, three, four, five,

322
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:06,760
six. Here he made the six assuming
that it starts with five. Right.

323
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,330
And he was able to reduce that with sodium
and Merck sodium with mercury to get

324
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,870
Mannitol, which was
known to be c six. Right?

325
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,180
So it was clear that [inaudible] wasn't
a c six sugar, it was a c five sugar.

326
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,970
So he had resolved this.
Okay.

327
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,860
But it was pointed out that it was one
of the reasons it was difficult to work

328
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:32,800
with this,
with this original compound was a mixture.

329
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,320
Why would it be a mixture?

330
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Because the cyanide could add to either
face of this carbon right to make,

331
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,830
right. Or left handed carbon. Right.

332
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,800
And these other carbons
are of course chiral too.

333
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,090
So you get diastema reimbursed
depending on which side you add from.

334
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,410
This was pointed out by someone who
was very sensitive to not just the

335
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:58,900
constitution,
the sequence of bonds,

336
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,050
but to configuration of of these sugars,

337
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:05,290
which is going to make a lot of
difference with so many chiral centers,

338
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,790
they're going to be lots of isomers.

339
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,940
So the person who pointed
that out was Emile Fisher,

340
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,390
who was three years older than Kili Yani
and died much sooner for reasons you'll

341
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:19,510
see. Uh, so what he was,

342
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,650
one thing he did with Kelly on his acid,
right?

343
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:28,651
This is the acid you get by adding
CN to the five carbon sugar and then

344
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,310
hydrolyzing it.

345
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,070
So Kelly Yani treats treated with
sodium and mercury and got a man at all.

346
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,750
But Fischer did something different.
No, bear in mind, this is a reduction.

347
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,780
So you'd take the acid all
the way to the alcohol.

348
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,000
It's very difficult to
stop at the Aldehyde.

349
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,060
But Fisher found a way
to stop at the Aldehyde,

350
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,400
which was the first heat it to
make this lactone a cyclic Esther,

351
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,680
and then reduce that with sodium and
mercury. And now he got the Aldehyde here.

352
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,840
Now why was that handy?

353
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,210
Because it gave away to convert
one sugar into another sugar.

354
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,450
Now you could make new
sugars synthetically because
it was possible to stop at

355
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,380
the Aldehyde,
right?

356
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,760
So Achille Yani Fisher
synthesis on a rabbit knows,

357
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,330
gave this compound.
So he,

358
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,160
so Kilimani Fisher synthesis elongates
and Al Dose makes it one carbon longer.

359
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,930
Okay. Now that wasn't the reason
Fisher got the Nobel prize.

360
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,723
Uh,

361
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,080
a contributing factor was fennel
hydrazine when he was a graduate student,

362
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,470
he synthesized fennel hydrazine and
he loved to make derivatives with it.

363
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,500
Remember we talked about how you make
derivatives of carbonyl compounds with n n

364
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,690
things to make, uh, uh,

365
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,380
to make him mean bonds and they're very
strong if you have two ends together

366
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:59,090
like that. So, uh, he, he
could do it with sugars,

367
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,950
right? So you could, you could react
with the sugar and make an Emmy.

368
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,990
It's called a hydra zone.

369
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,850
Right now this hydrogen here is al.

370
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,090
So it could shift up to here
and make the double bond here.

371
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,810
But now this hydrogen is Al Lilly
and it could shift to there.

372
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,030
So you can get this. Now
you've got another key tone.
So what's going to happen?

373
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,920
So you can take an,
make another hydro zone,

374
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,560
right?
So now you've used the second mole of,

375
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,240
of a fennel hydrazine, right?
So now that one's out, Lilly,

376
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,190
you can shift it over here. And I
think I did too. Oh No, no, sorry.

377
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,580
Uh,
this here we do a sick lick rearrangement.

378
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,170
This hydrogen goes to that nitrogen.
This bond breaks this.

379
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:55,850
These electrons go here to make a double
bond, becomes a single double right?

380
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,980
So it breaks apart into two
molecules, one of which leaves, right?

381
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,360
And now we have a c n double bond,
which is very like a CEO double bond.

382
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,830
So you can get a third molecule of fennel
hydrazine to react and make a CN new

383
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:13,010
CN double bond,
losing ammonia.

384
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,630
And you get this compound that has two
of his favorite molecules stitched in

385
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:21,110
there. It's called an Osa zone. It's a,

386
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:25,580
it's a hydro zone that's made
from a knows from a sugar. Okay.

387
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,710
So unfortunately, so, so he could make,

388
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:33,470
by treating this with a,
with his favorite compound,

389
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:36,950
you could make this now it
was his favorite compound,

390
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,890
but it's also deadly poisonous.

391
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:42,830
And he poisoned himself very
badly for almost a decade.

392
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:46,760
He was in very bad health because of
poisoned himself with this. And in fact,

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,560
in 1919 he committed suicide.
He had cancer at the time.

394
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:55,550
And who knows whether it might've
been had to do with exposure to is his

395
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:57,260
favorite molecule.

396
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,710
But if it was so dangerous and
he knew he was being poisoned,

397
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,600
why did he like it so much?
It was because Osa zones are Crystalyn.

398
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,800
Remember these sugars are always syrup's
and you can't do anything with them.

399
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,540
But with crystals you could,

400
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,230
you could purify and tell what things
were tell with one thing is the same as

401
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:18,770
something else or different.
So that was the beauty for him of,

402
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,830
of fennel hydrazine that you could make
an ozone and identify things and in a,

403
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,740
in sugar chemistry. Okay. Now,

404
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,270
so he was interested in the,
uh,

405
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,080
in identifying the
structures of these things.

406
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,440
So let's try to be systematic about
seeing what the configurations could be.

407
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,460
Different sugars. Okay, let's
look at the hexoses. We, oh,

408
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,540
we already have a wreath.

409
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,570
Rose Arabah nose and Zilo
Serranos came from gum.

410
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:57,980
Arabic.
Zillow's came from wood era.

411
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,440
Throws comes from a,
comes from a lichen.

412
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,290
A riff means red in Greek.

413
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:08,730
So arithe rose came was because
it came from this red plant. Okay.

414
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,000
But there are also hexoses glucose,
mannose,

415
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,460
galactose and ghouls.

416
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,500
And all these were identified by
killing Yonnie as being aldoses,

417
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,450
right? Aldehydes, not ketones. We showed
how he could tell the difference there.

418
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,830
So these must differ in their
configuration right now.

419
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,450
How many should there be if you
have six carbons in the chain,

420
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:40,920
that ends in a hell to hide.
How many should there be? Well,

421
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:45,750
for this purpose we could write them all
out like this. This is a particular one.

422
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,360
Using what projection?

423
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,230
The Fischer projection.
And the,

424
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:56,550
one of the most amazing things about
Fisher is that he figured this all out

425
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,950
without having the Fischer projection.

426
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,900
It's easy for us to trace his thought
now using the Fischer projection.

427
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,630
But he used van Hoff's notation, which
was very, very complicated. And I, I,

428
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,010
I have never figured it out.
Right?

429
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,580
So that's one of the real triumphs of
Fisher was to be able to think through

430
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:18,960
this stuff without Fisher projections,
which he published the next year.

431
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,011
Okay.

432
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:23,780
But instead of what we could abbreviate
that Fischer projection by writing it

433
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,750
that way.
Oops,

434
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:29,370
I wrote at the wrong here it's these
lines show which way the OAH point.

435
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:33,600
So it's always the bottom. You don't care.
It's not chiral. The next one, the Ooh,

436
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,120
the right, Ooh, to the right. That
would should be Ooh to the left. Ooh,

437
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,390
to the right.
So the code is clear.

438
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,680
Now we can just write out all the,
all the possibilities.

439
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,360
So we have, there are three
chiral carbons. All right?

440
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,520
Uh, uh, no. Pardon me? Uh,
yeah, there, there are no
there, therefore chiral carbons.

441
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,720
So they're going to be 16
possible isomers. Right?

442
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,690
But if we're looking only at the d sugars,

443
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,860
those are the ones that are all
to the right on the bottom right.

444
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,470
We could draw that mirror
image to the El sugars.

445
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,520
But let's keep it simple just by showing
the d sugars. Because as Fisher, well, no,

446
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,600
well knew he had no way of
telling Dee from Al Right?

447
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,720
You could measure the rotation,
but not the absolute configuration.

448
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,990
So let's just assume that that a given
compound is deep in the d series.

449
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,250
Okay? Now how can you draw them all out?
You can draw, right? Right, right, right.

450
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:33,900
Left, left, left, left. Then
you can go right, right, left,

451
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,910
left, right, right, left, left,
and finally right, left, right,

452
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,220
left, right, left, right, left.

453
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,380
You've got eight isomers and four
of them most w busbee glucose,

454
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:50,300
mannose,
galactose on Boulos but not [inaudible].

455
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,070
Zilo is because as we just saw a kill,

456
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,220
Yani showed that her revenues was a five
carbon sugar, not a six carbon sugar.

457
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:01,840
It's a pentose and arithe rose
is a Tetros, a four carbon sugar.

458
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,720
And finally at the top you
have glycerin Aldehyde,

459
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:09,490
the one that Fisher chose as the
reference for what's d? Okay,

460
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,540
so the question only is which is which?

461
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,950
And at first dance glanced,

462
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,960
that looks impossible until you come along
with ex-ray or Nmr maybe or something

463
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:23,800
to figure out.
But fish figured it out.

464
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,360
So here was the evidence he used.

465
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:33,370
And you can look online on the website
and see the translation of his paper,

466
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,580
how he actually did it.
Almost all textbooks,

467
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,560
a nod and uh, and cover
this a little bit. Uh,

468
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,730
uh, because that's realized what a
great contribution. It wasn't, man,

469
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:49,030
it's like Shakespeare or something
like that, but they all mess it up.

470
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,660
They use modern reagents. They say it
should have worked this way or something.

471
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:56,410
This is what Fisher actually did. So
you could read about it. But anyhow,

472
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,910
this is the evidence he used.

473
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,300
He found that glucose could be oxidized
by nitric acid to make the compound that

474
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:08,410
is an asset on both ends of the chain.
So it's symmetrical with respect to asset.

475
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,870
Okay.
Not just the Aldehyde,

476
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:15,871
but also the primary alcohol got oxidized
to an acid and then he did his heating

477
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:19,450
to make a lactone and
reduce it with sodium,

478
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:24,090
which made it back into a sugar again.
Okay.

479
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,930
And the sugar,
he got what he called Boulos.

480
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,740
It's different from what he started with.
You'd think if you,

481
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,470
if you oxidize and then reduce back again,

482
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:37,300
you've got the same
thing you started with,

483
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,150
but he could get a different
sugar this way. Why?

484
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,970
How could it be different?

485
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,490
Could be. The aldehyde was
on the top, made two acids

486
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,740
reduce the top to an alcohol
and the bottom two an Aldehyde.

487
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,960
So now it's upside down so
you'd have to rotate it. Okay.

488
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,630
So it could be a different one of these
sugars that we drew on the last slide.

489
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,010
Okay. And he decided to
call it Google Lowe's. Why?

490
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:20,300
It's a sort of an anagram. It reverses
the you and the l glucose school lows.

491
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,200
Right, because he wanted an
for end. So he, you know,

492
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,200
chemists sometimes have sort of
geeky senses of humor, right?

493
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,560
So Boulos.
Okay,

494
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,480
so that was the first evidence and
then subsidiary evidence to that.

495
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,040
Is that the acid,

496
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,290
the dye acid he got on the way is chiral
and both enantiomers of it were known.

497
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,180
Okay.
That's the first line of evidence.

498
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,250
The second line of evidence is that
glucose and mannose give the same ozone.

499
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,710
Remember he made Osa
zones to make crystals,

500
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,870
but glucose mannose gave the same one.

501
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:05,270
Also are rabid knows if you
do a [inaudible] reaction
gives two different acids.

502
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:08,570
Gluconic and [inaudible] acid.
We talked about that before,

503
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:13,571
that it can add either side and fructose
when it's reduced to give alcohols all

504
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,840
along the chain gives two different
alcohols. Calusa tall and man a tall,

505
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,400
and notice all of these are glucose
related and mannose related.

506
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,700
So there's some special relationship
between glucose and mannose that all three

507
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:31,670
of these things do that. And the
second line of evidence is man at all.

508
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,460
And monodic acid acid are chiral.

509
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,110
So if you have o h is on both
ends or acids on both ends,

510
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:44,450
it's chiral. Okay. Bear in
mind that this, you know,

511
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:47,180
people were just fiddling around and
seeing what they could make from what,

512
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,450
but fish collected the key items of
evidence that could be used to make a real

513
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,460
logical argument.
Okay,

514
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,040
so third Arabah knows when he did Akil,
Yani Fisher Synthesis gave glucose,

515
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,710
but also it gave mannose,
right? That we've seen.

516
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,690
This relationship became
Glucan man and Zilo goes,

517
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,670
which was all, which came from
wood. That's the Xylophone, right?

518
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Zilo would sugar by the [inaudible]
fissure synthesis added a carbon and made

519
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:25,400
Boulos. Remember this one up
here? And also another compound,

520
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:27,740
which I think is one
called [inaudible] now,

521
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,640
but that turns that these aren't
really relevant. Okay. But then three,

522
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:38,641
a Arabah knows if you make two [inaudible]
or two carboxylic acids on each end

523
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,300
is optically active,

524
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,630
but Zilo skiffs inactive compounds with
Oah on both ends are acid on both ends.

525
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,560
In fact, that was tough because
a rabbit tall has no rotation.

526
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,410
You put it in and you think it's not
chiral, right? But if you add, uh,

527
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,830
if you add a boric acid,
then it rotates light.

528
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,610
Remember, it's hard to know what causes
rotation. And it just happens that,

529
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,520
that our rabbit tall has no rotation
on measurably small rotation.

530
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,410
Right?
But if you make a derivative of it,

531
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,750
then you can see that
and the acid is rotate.

532
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,450
So it required a lot of work
to know these things for sure.

533
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,960
So that's the evidence and therefore he
knows what glucose is and what all the

534
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:27,560
others are. That's pretty much
of an accomplishment, right?

535
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,170
Just just to conceive that on
the basis of this evidence,

536
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,290
you could figure it out is amazing.
And this is only 10 years,

537
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,530
15 years after van Hoff
proposed the tetrahedral carbon.

538
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,240
A lot of people still
didn't believe in it.

539
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,603
Okay,

540
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,610
so here are the, here are the hexoses
and Penn Todos pentose is said,

541
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:53,600
we're going to go through his lines of
evidence and see how his logic worked.

542
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,531
Okay,

543
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:59,531
so evidence one was that glucose gives a
dye acid and on heating and reducing it

544
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:05,060
gives Boulos.
So when you turn it end for end,

545
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,500
right?
Then you've got a different compound.

546
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,460
Okay? So let's go across and
see, would that be true of this?

547
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,390
If you turned it end for end,
would it be a different compound?

548
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,930
You remember what the Fischer projection,
the ideas things turn out at you.

549
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,610
So you could, you can't rotate 90
degrees, but you can rotate 180 degrees.

550
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,080
So if we rotate that on this one, 180
degrees, do we get the same thing again?

551
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,370
That is if we made the dot on the bar.

552
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,780
What you do here with this is make a
dot on the bottom and not on the top.

553
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,380
So then you have to rotate it to bring
it back into this series that we've drawn

554
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:49,590
here. Right. Obviously those
would all point to the left.

555
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:54,170
It would be the mirror image and
the one we started with. So, uh,

556
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,920
that's, we'll put that on the back burner
for a second. Okay. How about, oops,

557
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,490
I went ahead too fast. How about the
next one? If you turn that in for end,

558
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:05,640
does it look the same? If you put
the dot on the bottom and rotate it?

559
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,370
Obviously different. Is everybody
with me on it's been different.

560
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:13,870
That would will be different. This
one, however, will be the same,

561
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,030
right? If you rotated the 180 degrees,
it's going to be left, left, right, right.

562
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,990
Again, if you change top
to bottom and rotate. Okay,

563
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,250
so that one is not, that one is not
glucose, nor is it Google close.

564
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,760
Okay. Because if you rotate in for
is different, how about the next one?

565
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:37,020
Will that be different? Should we
take it out? That'll be different.

566
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,060
That will that be different? Ah, that's
going to be the same. Not Different.

567
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,260
Right. So we can take that
one out. How about the next
one? Will that be different?

568
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,760
That's going to be like the first one
where everything that's right's going to

569
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:52,590
be left. Everything that's
left is going to be right.

570
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,730
So we'll put that in a bay ins for awhile.
And the last one also is different.

571
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,260
So from item one, we know for sure that
it's not that and not that glucose.

572
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,950
Now item one a and we're not so confident
about that because it changes the hand

573
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:12,150
in this only, but the, as
the dye acid is chiral.

574
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,890
Both enantiomers are known when
the two ends are the same. Okay.

575
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,060
So with this one, if you, if the two
ends were the same, would it be Kyrell?

576
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,570
No, it would have a horizontal plane
of symmetry through the middle.

577
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,490
So it can't be that one, right? This
one, would that have a plane of symmetry?

578
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,020
No. No. That one's out
already. How about that one?

579
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,190
No. How about that one?
Ah, that one's out.

580
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,270
That wouldn't be chiral. The last one
would be chiral. Okay. So from one a,

581
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:47,710
we know it's not, we confirmed that
it's not that and it's not that. Okay,

582
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:50,560
so we're down to four candidates
for what could be glucose.

583
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,410
Now we go to item two,
glucose and mannose give the same ozone.

584
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,500
Remember what the ozone did it,

585
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,750
it made a double bond at the top carbon
and a double bond at the next carbon.

586
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,850
So that means this next carbon
here isn't chiral anymore. Right.

587
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,240
And if you take a rabid knows,
start with,

588
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,290
with that being the carbon eel and ed CN,
it can add to either side.

589
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,830
One would give that,
one would give that if you had to,

590
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,030
depending on what our revenues is, one
would give this, this one would give that,

591
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,220
that one would give that that.
So again,

592
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:28,180
it says they differ only at
this second carbon and fructose,

593
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:33,820
which has a ketone at the second carbon
as Kilian he showed gives to alcohols.

594
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,590
So could give this alcohol and that
alcohol is alcohol, that hot call, so on.

595
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,180
So anyhow, what that means
is you disregard that. Okay.

596
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,810
So this item two shows that the,

597
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:50,620
that glucose and mannose
differ only in this carbon.

598
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,430
So now when we look at
that, uh, evidence too,

599
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,140
we know that if this is
glucose, this is mannose, right?

600
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:03,940
They differ only at that carbon, which
this shows is not relevant here, okay?

601
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,900
So if this is glucose, this is madness.
If this is glucose, what's mannose?

602
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,550
This one, right? If this is glucose,

603
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,960
this is mannose.
And if this is glucose,

604
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,940
this is mannose, okay? That's
what evidence to shows, okay?

605
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,620
Now, evidence to a, is that mannitol? Ooh,

606
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:30,880
on both ends or acid on both ends.
Those molecules are chiral.

607
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:36,670
So can this be mannose if the two
ends of the same as it handed?

608
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,170
No. So, so this can't be glucose.

609
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay? How about this? If
this, could this be mannose?

610
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,210
If the two ends of the same,
will it be chiral?

611
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,280
No, it doesn't have a
mirror in the middle, right?

612
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,620
That one doesn't have a mirror in
the middle, right? It's a propeller.

613
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,080
It's not a chiral.

614
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,340
The one that's right at the top and left
at the bottom is the mirror image of

615
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:10,630
this not identical to it. Right? So
it could, it could still be that,

616
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,350
uh, could this be mannose? Yes.

617
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,970
That means this could be glucose.
Could, could this be mannose?

618
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,280
No, because now it has a mirror in
the middle, so that can't be glucose.

619
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:30,250
Okay. So from two a then we can
exclude this and we can exclude that.

620
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,050
Okay.

621
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:37,050
So one of these must be glucose and the
other one is Google owes the one that's

622
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:41,210
turned in for end top to bottom.
Okay.

623
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,310
So how are we going to decide that?

624
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,760
Or how did fish decided
he went to evidence three,

625
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,090
which is Urbanova's and the kill Yani
Fits Fisher Synthesis gives glucose and

626
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:55,070
Zilo skiffs Boulos right.

627
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,650
So one of them gives one of these and
the other one gives the other one of

628
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,630
those.
Okay.

629
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,560
So we know something now about
a rabbit Rabideau in silos.

630
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,890
They can't be this and they can't be
this because that on Achille Ronni Fisher

631
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:11,421
said this is,

632
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:15,800
couldn't give either of these and this
couldn't give either of those. Right.

633
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,660
So those are out for, that one's out and
that one's out for revenues and silos.

634
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:21,560
Okay.

635
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,560
But what we know from evidence three is
that if this is glucose that was had to

636
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:29,630
be Arabah knows the thing,

637
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,350
that you add another carbon
here and make that right.

638
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,920
And if this was glucose,
that would be a knows.

639
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,490
Okay. And vice versa. If it's
a rabbit, no sense glucose.

640
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,760
Okay. Now how are we going to,
so if we know our [inaudible],

641
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,090
which is a rabid knows on which is silos,

642
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,840
then we know which is goop glucose
in which is Boulos because of those

643
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:55,780
connections.
Okay.

644
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,840
So evidence three a is a rabid knows,

645
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:03,280
gives optically active Arabah
tall and Arabic acid. Okay.

646
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:06,100
When the two ends of the same,
it's chiral.

647
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,960
Xylos is not chiral when the
two ends of the same. Okay.

648
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,000
Could this one be Arabah knows? Would it
be chiral if the two ends of the same,

649
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,530
how about that one? No. Okay,

650
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,120
so that one's got to be a rabid knows
by three and that one's got to be silos.

651
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,283
Okay?

652
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,330
So we know that glucose can't be this
because it comes from [inaudible].

653
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,060
So that one is glucose.

654
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,690
So he proved it.

655
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,520
Okay. Now, so all of these that
all of these known compounds,

656
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,360
all these known compounds where that
assigned, if you knew this was glucose,

657
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,670
then you knew that was Boulos.

658
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,890
You know the glucose mannose
differ only at this carbon.

659
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:58,300
So you know which man is his,
you know,

660
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:02,130
which are Rabideau says which is ilo
is you also can figure out which one or

661
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,100
with rose is by making
Arab Reno's from it. Right?

662
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,400
So all of these things now work,

663
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,860
it's like the end of a solitaire game
when everything begins to work. Right?

664
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,810
Okay. So you now you get all the other
sugars in fact of these 16 sugars,

665
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,030
the right and left handed
ones in the bottom row,

666
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:24,031
the exos of the 16 Fisher made 13 of
them himself and he made 50 artificial

667
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:30,751
sugars overall in the
1890s 1880s 1890s okay.

668
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,300
So we got others, like he also
got three Oh's. How did it,

669
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,490
so this was a new compound,
how did he name it?

670
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,190
Where did the name three Oh's come from?
It's a riff rose turn around, right?

671
00:44:44,191 --> 00:44:49,191
Sort of turned around or he got
ribos like ribonucleic acid.

672
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:53,820
DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC acid.
Where does the name Ribos come from?

673
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,340
From Miravich knows from gum
Arabic or he got licks. Sows.

674
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,960
That's pretty obvious.

675
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,700
Or he got Talos from galactose.

676
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:12,060
L. Okay. Or he got altros.
He was beginning to run out.

677
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,800
So this just means another one
alter. Right. Or he got out,

678
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,930
he got a dose.
That's idiom,

679
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,830
you know that the same as the
one above and a list. Is it m?

680
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,400
So it's another one, right. Or Allos,

681
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,930
which is the Greek version
of Altros. Right. Okay.

682
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,880
So he got all these and he got the
Nobel prize and he got the second Nobel

683
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:39,120
prize.
The first Nobel prize went to van Hoff.

684
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,340
Not for [inaudible],
but for his work in physical chemistry.

685
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,121
Right.

686
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:49,260
But the second Nobel Prize went to
[inaudible] via Fisher because everybody

687
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:54,150
realized what a great contribution.
You know, it's not just doing it but,

688
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,090
but doing it without Fischer
projections is a lot tougher.

689
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,840
It's to conceive that you can do it,
that the evidence is there,

690
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,990
that you apply this new theory that
Vantiff came up with not so long ago and

691
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:09,390
follow it through with,
with rigorous logic and you've got it.

692
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:13,080
Rather than just fiddling around
making this, making this, making this,

693
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:15,210
making this,
he puts it all together.

694
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:18,750
He finds the crucial bits of evidence
and puts them together to do this really

695
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:22,410
beautiful proof. So I thought you wanted
that, would want to know about that. Now,

696
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,380
uh, if you want to remember it,
the Guy who taught me organic,

697
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:32,730
I took organic chemistry the way you
are 50 years ago this year. Okay.

698
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:38,210
And the guy that I took it from
Louie are made up this all altruism.

699
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:41,400
It's gladly make gum in gallon tanks.

700
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,250
And I remember that for 50 years.
So I have no trouble doing aloes,

701
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:51,240
Altros Glucose, mannose school, Oci,
dose, collect, toasts, and Talos.

702
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,640
It's not a very fundamental
contribution to science,

703
00:46:56,641 --> 00:47:00,150
but it's very handy if you
want to teach about hexoses.

704
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,770
And if you want to do this
one, it's Raxel, Ra XL

705
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,430
and arithromycin three. Oh,
you just remember, okay.

706
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:16,410
So Hooray for a hooray for anal fissure.
Uh,

707
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:20,400
now, uh, we got two minutes just to
show you, I'm not going to show you how,

708
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,910
how this happened, but it's going to
be a stream of consciousness thing.

709
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:27,420
You're not responsible for it on the exam,
but I've got all the slides here.

710
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:30,460
So what the hell? Right?
And it, it is a neat thing.

711
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:37,120
Okay. So we talked about Cyclo Buda
dying. Is it anti aromatic? Right?

712
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,470
Make it and see what its properties are.
The problem is that one of it,

713
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,380
so you can make it by
this shine light on it.

714
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,440
It closes up in a dis rotatory process
and then with light it can it the co two

715
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,900
and you get to get it.
So study its properties.

716
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:59,800
The problem is that it
undergoes a really quick,

717
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,480
a reaction with itself, a deals
alder reaction, which gives this,

718
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,360
and then that opens up.
It's because it's very strained of course,

719
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,010
and give cyclopedia Buda Diane. So
you get, or just Cyclo Octa Tetra.

720
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:18,100
And so you get cycle octa
Tetra in, which is sort of, uh,

721
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,740
sort of evidence that
you had Cyclo Buda dying,

722
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,680
but it's not like knowing its properties.
Okay.

723
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,860
So the problem is that
it reacts with itself.

724
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,040
So it's presumptive evidence of existence.
Could you do spectroscopy?

725
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,690
So you have to make it somehow
under conditions that it
won't react with itself.

726
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,320
So if you've made it inside a cage,
like a big clam shell,

727
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:45,370
so only one molecule was in there,
then it couldn't react with itself.

728
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,370
So they made this compound
with the guest inside,

729
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:55,360
so it's too big like a clam shell
and holds the precursor inside.

730
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,780
So there's a mouth that you
can put things in and out from.

731
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:04,380
And it was done by Donald Cram who
got the Nobel prize and Martin Tanner,

732
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,640
the son of Dennis Tanner,

733
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,970
who burned his eyebrows out with
the 4th of July demonstration.

734
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,760
They grew back again.

735
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,210
He was not permanently barred Thomas,
I don't know.

736
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,560
So they made,
these are groups were big things for,

737
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,480
to make it soluble and it was that,

738
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,640
and you can make that by thinking
backwards with an Algal reaction,

739
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:28,870
right?

740
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:33,430
So first they make the bottom half of
the thing and how to form this big ring

741
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,280
with 16 carbons in it,
right?

742
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:41,730
You take resource and all and
Hydro Cinnamon Aldehyde, right?

743
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,300
And then, uh, this is a good,

744
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:49,150
very active for
electrophilic substitution.

745
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:54,370
So he protonate that you have an
electric file, forms a bond Ortho Para,

746
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,750
you've got the first bond made,
put that in deep dehydrate,

747
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,150
you can react with another one.

748
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:04,720
So you've got another one now you just
keep doing it to make all those all the

749
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:07,960
way around. But you could imagine lots
and lots of different ways of doing it.

750
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,550
And it turns out that the electrophilic
aromatic subsidies is reversible.

751
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,820
And ultimately this compound,
the one they wanted to make,

752
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:20,821
this precipitates from the
equilibrating mixture in a 69% yield.

753
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:25,390
That is luck. Okay, so they, so this,

754
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,820
the fish jumped into this particular boat,
right?

755
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,380
But now they need these bonds across the
top of that bottom to the teeth for the

756
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,020
clam. Right. So what they
did is they put roaming on,

757
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:43,460
they made it into a,
then they, they made uh,

758
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,810
and ions here with bass
and reacted with ch two,

759
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,480
with two leaving groups.
So one leaving group,

760
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,780
the other leaving group and
now do it on all the others.

761
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,320
And you've got those carbons put in right
now you have to join the top half to

762
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:04,480
the bottom half, right? Uh,
Oh, they got this incidentally,

763
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,530
they didn't get a 69% yield.

764
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:11,090
That was 5% from the tetramer and
they had isolated by chromatography.

765
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,650
Okay. So now, uh, they had
to join the two hemispheres,

766
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:19,160
which they've put a lithium on
in place of, of the bromine.

767
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,730
And then they'd put Boron on.

768
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,050
And then hydrogen peroxide,

769
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:31,160
which we've seen before to
make those into alcohol's,

770
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,560
we've seen that before.
So you see,

771
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:40,010
this was really to be review
of stuff we've done. Okay.

772
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:41,720
So now you've got alcohols all the way up.

773
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:45,980
So he got the ows that are going to do
the bridging and now you just do that

774
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:49,490
same thing you did before,
uh,

775
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:55,250
to put a carbon in this carbon the same
way you did that one by having a low,

776
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:00,170
uh, carbon, uh, with, with two
halogens, so to leaving groups.

777
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,650
And now again, when those two things
come together, if you have, uh,

778
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,250
three things that can react here in
three things that react here that can go

779
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:11,300
like that, which is what you want, it
could go like that. It could go like that.

780
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:15,410
It could go like that. There are
lots of different ways, right? Uh,

781
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,680
but it turned out that he got,
they got 40% of it,

782
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,740
40% of this stuff went into that overall
after from this stuff you started and

783
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,960
it's a 1% yield,
but they started with a lot of stuff.

784
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,730
So they had the clam shell, right?
And now it turned out they could,

785
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,430
they could get the guests out.
This is a crystal structure.

786
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,230
So this stuff at the top is,
is a chloroform, which is,

787
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,920
and this is solvent,
they're two different solvents in there,

788
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:46,400
but in the middle of the cage is DMF held.

789
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,170
This is that clam shell here.

790
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:52,040
And these things are just put on to
make it soluble so you can work with it.

791
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:57,770
Okay. So they could get that stuff out
and they could replace it with, with this.

792
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:03,490
So here's that stuff on the cover of
Andrea Vonda Comey inside that compound,

793
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,840
and this is the Nmr spectrum.

794
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,950
So most of the peaks come from these
hydrogens in the Co, in the shell, right?

795
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,160
But the ones marked in red and one that's
under here are these four hydrogens on

796
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:21,230
the starting material. And
then they focalized it and
they got the purple peaks.

797
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,690
It changed, right? And then they,

798
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:27,570
they fertilize again and
they got just one peak.

799
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,920
That's the peak of cycle of Buddha die.
Right?

800
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,710
And it can't react with any others
because there are no others around.

801
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,850
And then if you, if you get it out
again, that will react to your cycle.

802
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:42,090
Ought the tetra heat.
So this is way up field,

803
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,250
anti aromatic,
as we talked about before.

804
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,980
Now is that what causes the upfield shift?
Because you'll notice something else.

805
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,800
If you put benzene inside,

806
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,220
its normal position would be here,

807
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,910
but benzene inside that
clam shell is there.

808
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,120
It shifted way up field.
Why?

809
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,070
Because it's above all sorts
of other benzene rings.

810
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,300
Remember when, uh, when, when you
have something above a benzene ring,

811
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:19,830
it's shifted up field. If it's out in
decided that shifted downfield but this,

812
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,240
the one that's in the middle is above all.

813
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:25,710
So some of that shift must be due to this
same effect that makes benzene go up.

814
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,190
So most of the shift comes
from the other rings.

815
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:33,310
Still about still it's about one and a
half parts per million above benzene.

816
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,080
So it is shifted up field and
his auntie aromatic. So that's,

817
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:40,950
I think that's what I wanted to show
you. That's the end. Okay. But the big,

818
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,360
the big lesson is how Fisher did glucose.
Thanks.
