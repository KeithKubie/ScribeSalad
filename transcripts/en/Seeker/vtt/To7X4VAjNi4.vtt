Sorry, just looking for a place to lie down.

Anthony Carboni here for DNews. Dogs seemingly
need to spin before just about everything.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.900
Going to the bathroom, lying down, when they're
excited- dogs are weird. Why are dogs weird?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.770
In terms of spinning, I mean.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.789
Circling before going to sleep might seem
weird on your couch, but in the wild, dogs

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.199
would spin and trample to push down tall grasses
and underbrush, pack down snow, and drive

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.190
away snakes and insects. It kept them clean,
warm, and hidden. Flattening the ground in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.170
circles could also have been a sign to other
dogs wandering by that the territory had already

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.999
been claimed.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.429
Those hygiene and territorial instincts might
factor into why they spin before going to

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.819
the bathroom, too- patting down underbrush
keeps the dog's waste from sticking to it

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.510
and then rubbing on their own fur. Also, patting
down the area could allow for the scents in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.039
their urine and feces to spread farther, making
it clearer what territory they marked.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.159
But there's an even newer, weirder theory
about puppy poop spins that I am WAY more

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.420
into. We've talked before about magnetoception,
a sense that allow some animals to feel earth's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.920
magnetic field. Birds use it in migration,
some studies say cows use it to align themselves

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.140
in a north-south pattern when they graze and
now it seems like dogs use it to poop in exactly

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.170
the same direction.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.140
In a study published recently in Frontiers
in Zoology, researchers watched 70 dogs across

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.649
37 breeds for two years as they pulled off
a poop spin combo and they all prefered to

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.159
poop aligned north-to-south when the earth's
magnetic field is calm. That's about 20 percent

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.140
of the time during daylight hours. During
things like solar flares or geomagnetic storms

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.469
or other events, they were less picky about
it.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.049
The researchers aren't sure why they prefer
it- but they did note that not only do dogs

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.969
prefer north-south, they actively avoid a
straight-up east/west orientation.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.799
I wonder if its some remnant of a past, stronger
sense they had. We humans have proteins in

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.819
our eyes that make researchers think that
at some point in the past we could SEE earth's

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.649
magnetic field. It seems like a strong magnetic
sense would help pack animals move and hunt

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.080
in some way. But why the pooping, dogs? Why
is the poop direction important?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.840
Do you guys have any theories? Spin around
three times and let me know down below. Oh,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.410
and if you're into dogs, our friends at Animalist
News are going to the Westminster Dog Show

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.470
in NYC. They'll be there on the 10th and 11th,
so head over and subscribe now so you don't

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.120
miss it.
