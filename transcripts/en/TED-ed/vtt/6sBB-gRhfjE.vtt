00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:11.114
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia,

00:00:11.114 --> 00:00:15.424
home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage.

00:00:15.424 --> 00:00:17.294
Entering from the northwest,

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:20.484
you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:23.306
where you’re given a map and a brochure.

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:27.363
The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks,

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:30.345
formed by five streets that 
run west to east,

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:33.983
intersecting five more 
that run north to south.

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:37.864
You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east,

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:42.415
with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you.

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:46.405
The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner.

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:49.854
It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem.

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:51.674
As you learn from the brochure,

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:56.193
Duonia imposes a unique tax 
on all visitors,

00:00:56.193 --> 00:01:00.344
which must be paid when they arrive 
at their destination within the city.

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.334
The tax begins at zero,

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:06.594
increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east,

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:10.118
and doubles for every block 
you walk south.

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:13.579
However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.074
halves your total bill for
every block you walk north

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:21.803
and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west.

00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:24.375
Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:27.165
means you already owe four silver.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:31.455
As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any.

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:34.904
What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you

00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:39.616
from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey—

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.365
though you can cross your own path.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:47.094
Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:51.204
or walking the same block twice 
in any direction?

00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:54.430
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.883
Answer in: 3

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.198
Answer in: 2

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:58.825
Answer in: 1

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:01.214
You look at the map 
to consider your options.

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:04.457
Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax,

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.833
and walking away decreases it,

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:10.633
so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:14.019
But what happens when you walk 
around a single block?

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.865
If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east,

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:20.685
your tax bill becomes six,

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:21.958
then 12,

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.184
then 10,

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.854
then five.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:27.185
If you looped again, you’d owe seven,

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:28.176
14,

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:29.133
12,

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.485
and six.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:35.157
It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver.

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:38.174
What about a counterclockwise loop then?

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.415
Starting owing four again 
and going south first,

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:43.283
your bill changes to eight,

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:44.052
10,

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:44.902
five,

00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:46.232
and three.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.074
Looping again you’d owe six,

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:48.848
eight,

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:49.755
four,

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:50.714
and two.

00:02:50.714 --> 00:02:55.024
Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver.

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.114
That’s because any tax doubled,

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:58.176
plus two,

00:02:58.176 --> 00:02:59.025
halved,

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:00.373
and minus two,

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:03.373
always ends up one smaller 
than it started.

00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:07.275
The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:09.634
may seem to balance each other out,

00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:13.767
the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference.

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:15.754
You start off owing four silver,

00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:19.126
so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero.

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:24.582
Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice.

00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:27.223
But there’s another way
to reduce your bill:

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:30.954
walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city.

00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:34.184
From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south.

00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:37.544
You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch,

00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:40.926
so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east.

00:03:40.926 --> 00:03:46.873
Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver.

00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.545
But now you can start reducing your bill.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:53.975
Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:57.216
You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:01.554
So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west,

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:04.444
leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.974
And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number,

00:04:07.974 --> 00:04:13.225
walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight.

00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:15.515
Fortunately, that’s exactly enough

00:04:15.515 --> 00:04:18.245
to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:22.123
As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage:

00:04:22.123 --> 00:04:26.554
sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.
