1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,580
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,980
and I couldn't agree more.

3
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:07,550
My hope is that what you were saying and
what we were discussing earlier about

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:12,551
how the Internet has sort of eroded our
faith in many institutions as being the

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,960
only or the primary source of knowledge
that I hope that that takes place

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,460
globally in terms of the way we view
government. Yeah. And that we do that.

7
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,330
Your idea of like,

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,190
I love what America stands for and what
America stands for is kind of a nation.

9
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:31,940
That's where people go to,
you know,

10
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:36,941
this is one of the more insidious problems
with this idea of building walls and

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,070
keeping people out and making it
incredibly difficult to get here.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,170
The reason why I'm here is because
it was pretty easy to get here. Yeah.

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,350
That's why I'm here.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,290
That's not,
that's the essence of America.

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,690
A free and open society
come here and do better.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,051
Yes.

17
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:55,051
That's the whole idea behind it and I
would hope that this idea of being able to

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,040
just, if you want to do manner
that you can anywhere in the world,

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,900
this could eventually spread
out. Yes. This is my hope.

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,000
I believe it can spread out and, and um,
you know, I see many signs of hope, uh,

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,660
in, in, in America. America has
become a big part of my life,

22
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:15,520
not just because I wrote this book,

23
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,910
but because I have children
who are now living in America.

24
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:21,560
I have a son and daughter in law who,
who live in La.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,050
I have another son and daughter in law
who live in Boston. America. I'm British,

26
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:29,830
but America has become a very central
part of my life and it's a fascinating and

27
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:33,850
amazing country and it's been my privilege
to travel thousands of miles across

28
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:37,690
America, across many, many, many different
states. And I, I love this country. It's,

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,520
it's,
it's an amazing place.

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,270
Only in America could we see happening.

31
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:46,930
What has happened with cannabis, you
know, the, the, the fact that at a,

32
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:51,670
at a local level, individuals have
got together, mobilized petitions,

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,420
organized votes, and changed
the law, change the law. Diff,

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,250
literally stuck a finger up at
central government and said, fuck off.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,020
This is none of your business.

36
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,250
What I do with my consciousness in the
inner sanctum of my own life is not the

37
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,830
business of the state.
That's a very American feeling.

38
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,280
It's something that you don't find often
in other countries where the state is

39
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:16,150
granted much more power and much more
authority than it perhaps should be.

40
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:21,151
Americans are naturally questioning
of government authority and that has,

41
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,220
that is what has led to the legalization
increasing legalization of cannabis,

42
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,690
which is going to change
the world in lots of ways.

43
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,480
But then ironically at the same time,

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,060
see the thing about democracies
is that in order to,

45
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,150
um,
get things done in a democracy,

46
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,460
you need to persuade people
of your point of view.

47
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:44,980
So information becomes very important in,

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,320
in democracies and the
information can be abused,

49
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,330
people can be misled with information.

50
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:53,140
They can be told that what they're
receiving is the truth, whereas in fact,

51
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:53,974
it's not the truth.

52
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,030
And you can end up with a
kind of dictatorship that
the people have given their

53
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,100
ascent to on the of of false

54
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,950
information. And frankly, I'd rather
have a real dictatorship, which is,

55
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,150
which is out in the open and clear
rather than one that has been subtly

56
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:12,030
manipulated into position
through manipulating the, the,
the, the views of the, of,

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,030
of,
of the voters.

58
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,740
But I am and remain enormously
encouraged by America.

59
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,180
It may seem like a trivial issue,

60
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,650
but the fact that state by state
cannabis is being legalized and that is

61
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,180
resulting from a grassroots movement
that this enormous change has been made

62
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:30,970
either. It's ironic, it's strange
that at the federal level,

63
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,710
even though what eight states now
totally legal for recreational, uh, 23,

64
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:39,160
24 states legal for medical use,
that at the federal level,

65
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,230
it's still a schedule one controlled,
controlled drug.

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,100
This is a huge state of dissonance that
exists in America is going to have to

67
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,970
put it right. What it says to me
is that people can change things,

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,720
people can get together at the local
level and they can make a better world

69
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:56,110
because there's no doubt that the cannabis
laws were vicious and wrong and cruel

70
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,980
and evil and ruined people's
lives for, for, for decades.

71
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,070
And it's people who've changed that
it's not government has changed,

72
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,590
that it's the people at the grassroots
level in America is a country where that

73
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,770
can happen.
And I,

74
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,590
I remain encouraged about about the role
of the American people while often in

75
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,490
despair about the role of the American
state. Yeah. I'm encouraged as well.

76
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,310
And you know, it's interesting, Ben
and Jerry released something yesterday,

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,590
which was really are on
four 20 I should say,

78
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,140
which was talking about the
drug laws in this country. And,

79
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,500
and talking about how many,
it's real really opening this,

80
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,320
the,

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,720
the idea of like how unjust these laws
were and how many of these laws targeted

82
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,400
people of color and how many people who
are white people have profited off of

83
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,650
this and how many people
are still in jail. Yes.

84
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,310
For crimes that they committed,
you know,

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,130
air quote crimes that are no longer
cry that are no longer crimes. Yeah.

86
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,110
And this is ridiculous. These, these
records should be expunged. They should,

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,560
because I see that California has
made some steps in that direction.

88
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,440
There has been some expunging of course.
Well,

89
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,450
we can only hope that also what opens up
next is silicide Ben is now going to be

90
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,250
on the ballot. Absolutely.
And when that opens up,

91
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,710
I mean what you really think
marijuana is a gateway drug.

92
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:11,740
Well guess what it is if silicide gets in.
Yes.

93
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,970
Cause Psilocybin can legitimately change
the world yet so and can't really,

94
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:18,580
I mean I think marijuana can change
the world and I really do think that

95
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,930
cannabis is changing people's perceptions
and making people more calm and

96
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,890
friendly and yeah, and even the,
what they talk about with paranoia.

97
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,150
I welcome that.

98
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,990
And the reason why I welcome that as I
think people are entirely too cocky. Yeah.

99
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,210
The, the life we live as bizarre as you
could ever imagine book and we're just

100
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,390
accustomed to it because it's
our day to day for granted. Yeah.

101
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,370
Marijuana removes those blinders and it
really makes you understand that this is

102
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,130
a strange, strange life. And these,

103
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,200
a lot of these pitfalls and problems that
we have in our society are due to fear

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,500
and they're due to ignorance and their,
their due to this,

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,100
this lack of connection with

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,280
each other and cannabis and many
of these other psychedelic drugs,

107
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,480
they encourage this connection with each
other, which is I think what we need.

108
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,730
It's, it's certainly
what we need. And, and,

109
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:11,390
and it's an aberration in human culture
that we've created a society that

110
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,880
demonized the,
the substances and that made them illegal.

111
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:17,300
It's a relatively recent
thing. It's really just the
last, the last hundred years.

112
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,970
It's, uh, it's, it's a tiny
part of the human story.

113
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:24,860
And yet we were so arrogant as a society
that we could set aside thousands of

114
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,070
years of human tradition and experience
and wisdom working with the plant

115
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:32,390
medicines. We just set it aside, turn
them into criminal substances and say,

116
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:37,240
we know everything. What a, what a
huge and stupid mistake that is, um,

117
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,150
on cannabis as a quote
unquote gateway drug.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,010
It absolutely is in this sense that the
legalization of cannabis is going to

119
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,910
open the doors to, as, as you say, to
the legalization of, of psychedelics.

120
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,260
Because what's happening is that the
population is completely waking up to the

121
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:59,261
fact that they have been bullshitted
and lied to about cannabis for the best

122
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:03,350
part of a century.
And once that dawns on people,

123
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,400
the realization at a direct personal
level, here's this herb I love,

124
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,260
I have been lied to,

125
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,330
systematically misinformed by
central government, uh, about this,

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,410
about this herb that leads to questioning
of everything that central government

127
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:22,280
does. And so in that sense, it is
a gateway to a questioning society.

128
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,900
The psychedelics are different
in that, in that Psilocybin, um,

129
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,900
actually does lead you to question stuff.

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,920
It leads you to really ask
questions about, about everything,

131
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,260
about your role in the world,
about you as a person,

132
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:39,830
about how you relate to other people and
about the whole system on this planet

133
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:42,800
and the, the beautiful,
gorgeous planet that we,

134
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:46,910
that we have and what we're doing to
it. That also enters, enters awareness.

135
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,970
So it erodes confidence and authority.
And it also roads,

136
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:53,120
confidence and authority that doesn't
have experiences that you've experienced.

137
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,540
That's the part of the problem is that
these people that are holding people back

138
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,020
from these psychedelic experiences,
they've never had them. They've never had,

139
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,060
they don't even know
what they're rallying.

140
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,160
That coming to it from a place
of fear and prejudice, uh,

141
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,540
there simply accepting stuff that they'd
been told without really thinking it

142
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:12,170
through and, and, and examining
it. And again, it's a failure of,

143
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,320
of what human beings should,
should be doing. We have to get,

144
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,770
we have to get rid of this fear.
And ironically it's bad for them as well.

145
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,770
I've taught for the people that
are actually encouraging this,

146
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:24,680
these laws to be enforced.
Yes. Is it bad for,

147
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,210
it's bad for the whole of the whole of
society because it is healthy for a,

148
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,420
for a society where adults
become self realized,

149
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:37,310
individuals where they make their own
responsible choices about their own lives,

150
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,790
where they don't say, oh, government
met must make this choice for me.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,370
That's the next step for humanity.
We start,

152
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:48,371
we need to start becoming our own leaders
and making our own choices and that is

153
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,880
that is what's being revealed now that
we're getting to the skull beneath the

154
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,470
smile of the war on drugs.

155
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,250
We're realizing that it's part of a big
program of lying that has been about

156
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,150
keeping people's minds closed down,
not wanting free thinking.

157
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,740
I've made this point several times,

158
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,800
but our society is not against altered
states of consciousness. As such a,

159
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,110
our society will allow big Pharma to
make billions of dollars with drugs that

160
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:16,500
alter consciousness like Ciroc,
satin, Prozac, antidepressants,

161
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:20,010
which in my opinion having had some
experience of them are amongst the most

162
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:24,540
horrible drugs on the planet. They are
very harmful, very dangerous drugs,

163
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,660
but they're completely legal and they're
encouraged with our system. Likewise,

164
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:31,020
alcohol, very dangerous
drug causes, fights,

165
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,170
causes drunk driving accidents,
leads to cirrhosis of the liver,

166
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,730
completely legal and open.

167
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,120
Our society is not against altered
states of consciousness as such.

168
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,360
It's against particular kinds of altered
states of consciousness that lead to

169
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:46,860
questioning of the existing
control system. That's what's,

170
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,120
that's what's going on here, here,
here. Well said. And as you know,

171
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,730
I have my own story with, uh,
with, with cannabis and well,

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,750
you and I had a moment.
We had a moment which was,

173
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,300
which was quite a life changing
moment for me because I,

174
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:04,350
if I may just rehearse a little
bit of this for the audience. Um,

175
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,310
in 2011 I had a series
of Iowasca sessions, uh,

176
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,970
in which it was shown to me that I was
using cannabis completely wrong. Uh,

177
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,970
that did become a dominant force
in my life that it was making me,

178
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,910
you're speaking about paranoia and
I agree with your paranoia is a,

179
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,010
is a useful thing if only to overcome it.

180
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,650
That it was making me paranoid that
it was making me suspicious that I

181
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:30,180
approached everybody around me in a state
of suspicion and I was shown this by

182
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:34,890
Iowasca and then given a very strong
message, you need to quit cannabis.

183
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,960
What I didn't realize at the time is
that the problem was not cannabis.

184
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,240
The problem was me,
uh,

185
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,290
that I needed to fix those aspects of
myself before I could have a proper

186
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,110
relationship with cannabis.
So after that IOWASCA session,

187
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,880
having smoked cannabis for decades,
literally 16 hours a day,

188
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,910
seven days a week, I quit.
I quit for three years.

189
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,240
And then I'm on your
show and we're sitting,

190
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,990
we're setting up one another as we are
now. And you asked me a question, um,

191
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,660
are you still off the cannabis
and that? And I say, well,

192
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:08,550
I'm thinking of dipping
my toes back in the water,

193
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,480
at which point you produce a joint and,

194
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,470
and we smoke it together at first of all,
after three years,

195
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,130
your tolerance is way down on cannabis.
I got really stoned.

196
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,690
I did listen to that interview back in.

197
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,510
Somehow I held it together
together brilliantly.

198
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:28,470
You opened up and there was like a wave
of information came pouring out of you.

199
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,020
It was wonderful.
It wasn't liberation for me.

200
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:34,890
And what it said to me is it's
time to go back to cannabis. Uh,

201
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,110
but perhaps in a different
way. It doesn't, it,

202
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,260
I need a different relationship
with this amazing medicine. And,

203
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,860
and if I can forge that, if I can make
that different relationship happen,

204
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,800
then it can be a constructive
and positive part of my life.

205
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,130
And I can say definitely that that has
been the case. And that's excellent.

206
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,480
And so it's all thanks to you,
Joe.

207
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,850
I probably would still be off cannabis
if it hadn't been for that joint.
