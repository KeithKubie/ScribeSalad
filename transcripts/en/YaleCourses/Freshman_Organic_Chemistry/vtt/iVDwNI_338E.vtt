1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.031
Okay.

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:07.920
So we were talking last time about rotation in ethane and the fact that there

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.921
was a barrier and that you can measure the barrier and one way to measure the

4
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:13.740
barrier,

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.550
the first way that the barrier was measured was remarkably enough by the heat

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:22.551
capacity of FAA and how much heat it takes to warm it to a certain temperature.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
So that showed that the barrier was about three kilocalories per mole,

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.110
but it didn't say what the geometry of minimum energy was.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.850
Was it eclipsed as shown by the,
by the red line here,

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.680
so that the eclipse form is the lowest and energy or was the favored form

11
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:43.770
staggered and people differed in their interpretation of that.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.920
Uh,
ultimately there was some defractions study electron diffraction that showed

13
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:51.540
that it was staggered.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.950
But now the best word on this nowadays is probably familly high quality

15
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:59.100
calculations.

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.330
And you can see from this paper published in the Journal of Chemical Physics in

17
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.810
2003 that there's pretty good agreement.
These,

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080
all these various abbreviations or various really high quality computational

19
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:18.000
results.
You can see at the top our experimental results from heat capacity.

20
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.700
It's about a thousand wave numbers.

21
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:24.120
A wave number is 2.86 small calories,

22
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:26.820
not kilocalories per mole.

23
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
So there's heat capacity from infrared spectroscopy,
from microwave,

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.930
from Raman spectroscopy.

25
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.110
All these experiments give very close to 2.9 kilocalories per mole are about a

26
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.010
thousand wave numbers,
right?
Within a couple percent,
uh,

27
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.730
even less than that probably.

28
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.390
And then all these calculations give about 2.7 kilocalories per mole.

29
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.050
And it doesn't make very much difference.
The first one of these,

30
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:58.200
some of these aren't such very high quality calculations,

31
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.770
but some of them are very,
very high quality.
The best that can be done.

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.390
And they all agree pretty much.

33
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:08.391
So it's clear that the staggered form is favored over the eclipse despite what

34
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:13.500
everyone wrote in the 19th century when they always wrote them eclipse and what

35
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:17.100
whoever it was that drew the picture for the American Chemical Society of their

36
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:21.300
molecule the week last week.
Drew too.
He drew it eclipsed or she,

37
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.670
okay.
So anyhow,
but then there's the question why,

38
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.570
why is it that the staggered forum is lower in energy than the eclipsed?

39
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.910
Why is there a three kilo calorie barrier?
Well,

40
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.610
they're different points of view on that.

41
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.840
One is that the eclipsed form is unstable,

42
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.830
that for some reason having an eclipse makes it unstable.

43
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.740
The other one is the staggered form is unusually stable.
And w what?

44
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.180
What does this remind you of in terms of a question

45
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.700
compared to what?
What's unusual,
right?
This is what's unusual.

46
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.390
The eclipse for or the staggered form?
Well,

47
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.810
from the point of view of the eclipse for them,

48
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.590
why would it be unstable?
Well,

49
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:16.130
it could be that the hydrogens repel one another cause that just in space there,

50
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.100
there van der waals radio.
Okay.
But if you think about that,
then,

51
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.660
if you had a methyl in place of one of those hydrogens,

52
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.430
it's ever so much bigger.

53
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.560
Therefore you should have a much bigger barrier to rotation of a methyl group
in,

54
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.480
in propane.
But in fact,
the barrier is almost exactly the same.

55
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.780
3.4 not 10 or something like that.

56
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.190
So the size of hydrogen doesn't seem to be so very important.

57
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.090
Of course protons repel one another and the electrons that are in the bonds

58
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.670
repel one another.
There's electron repulsion.

59
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.880
So that might be why you don't want to have it,
uh,

60
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.910
eclipse that you want to rotate a little bit to make it staggered.

61
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.180
But that's not easy to do in your head because they're also attractions between

62
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:11.110
a proton on one side and the electron on the other and it's not clear which of

63
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:13.480
these is going to dominate.
So anyhow,

64
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.660
there's the possibility that it has to do with,
with,
uh,

65
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.880
with the eclipse form being unusually destabilized.

66
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.630
Right.
Because of repulsions.

67
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.850
That could be the other point of view is that the staggered forum is unusually

68
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.100
stable.
Now why could that be?

69
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
It's that you have a sigma on one side and a sigma star on the other side of the

70
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.380
ch bonds and vice versa as well.

71
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.330
And you can get overlap between this homo and Lumo in this way.

72
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:48.331
And it turns out surprisingly enough that the overlap is bigger when they're

73
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270
auntie.
Then when they're eclipsed,

74
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.470
you might think intuitively that there'd be more overlap when they're on the

75
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.300
same side,
that when they're on the opposite,

76
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.040
but it doesn't take too much work to convince yourself that the other is in fact

77
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.600
true and that this is the better overlap.

78
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:13.360
So you'll get better homo Lumo interaction from one side to the other and not

79
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:17.470
only for these two hydrogens,
but for the other two pairs of hydrogens as well.

80
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.720
If the thing is,
is,
uh,

81
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.370
is staggered so that the opposite ones are parallel to one another.

82
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.710
Uh,
so you can get this kind of mixing Homo Lumo mixing,

83
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.240
but among sigma bonds,

84
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.540
which is called hyper conjugation conjugation is when normal double bonds,

85
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.290
p orbitals overlap from one to the other and you get resonance structure.

86
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.630
The name hyper conjugation was created to talk about the same phenomenon when

87
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:50.770
it's sigma bonds rather than Pi Bonds that are doing the trick and it's usually

88
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:55.210
much,
much less important.
We'll talk about more examples of this later on.

89
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.440
But at any rate,
that's a,

90
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.510
that's a very different point of view from the first one,

91
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.520
which is it that the eclipse does these stabilized or the staggered is unusually

92
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.580
stable or maybe both.
And in fact,

93
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.790
this is a little bit scholastic argument analogous to how many angels can dance

94
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:17.420
on the head of a pin.
And you get people that debate about this,
right?

95
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:22.421
So the point is that fundamentally there is quantum mechanics that controls

96
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.540
this,
but it doesn't say which,
which one of these things,
this is what,

97
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.930
it doesn't divide it that way.
So some people say one,

98
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.320
some people save the other and we'll just say maybe a little of both.

99
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.590
Okay.
Now here's a digression on the question of what's called Piseti,

100
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.580
which turns out to be relevant and a lot of biochemical applications.

101
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:50.720
So it's worth mentioning at this point,
this aspect of Stereo Chemistry,

102
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.500
Topa city,
uh,
relates to,
for example,

103
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.330
the question are two protons equivalent.
Now at first glance,

104
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.540
that sort of a stupid question.
Obviously a proton is a proton,

105
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.770
so they're equivalent.

106
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.010
But suppose one is the h of n o h group in ethanol and the other is an age of

107
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.490
the methyl group.
Now,
are they equivalent?
Well,

108
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:17.030
protons clearly still are equivalent.
Protons are protons.

109
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.410
What's different about them?

110
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.020
What's different is their environment,
right?

111
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.410
So it could be that the place they are is different,

112
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.460
even though the protons intrinsically are the same and therefore they could have

113
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:32.510
different properties.

114
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.210
Now that happens to be the case in ethanol.
And Ooh,

115
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.930
group has a pka of about 16 it's not very acidic,

116
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:45.770
but it's possible to dissociate h blessing Leibow minus,
right?

117
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.500
But an h it's on a methyl group,
doesn't do that.

118
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:53.501
It has a pka of about 50 so it's 10 to the 34th weaker as an acid than an

119
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.530
[inaudible].
Then the Oah group.

120
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.880
So there's clearly a difference between these two hydrogens because of the place

121
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.450
they're Ed,
right?
Uh,
so that the,

122
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.860
Ooh on the alcohol group exchanges readily with acidic water.

123
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.610
So you can put deuterium in and out of that,
wash it in,
wash it out.

124
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.310
And you can't do that in the case of methane.

125
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.100
So if deep plus can come in low Lumo attacked by the High Homo,

126
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.740
you get that and then unzip it the other way,

127
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.670
the electrons go back on h plus comes off.
So you can do this exchange.

128
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.050
That doesn't happen over on the other case because it's so hard to get the

129
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:38.030
proton off and the carbon has no unshared pair to pick up the new proton.

130
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.630
So these two protons,
the red one and the blue one,

131
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:45.920
the Oah and the methyl h are called Hetero topic.

132
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.840
Hetero means different.
And the Greek top means place.

133
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.540
So they're in a different place there.

134
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.830
They have different properties because they're in a different,

135
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.650
so tow piseti comes from the same root obviously.

136
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.420
And it means the placeness of the,
of a group.
It could be a hydrogen,

137
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.350
it could be another group,

138
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:07.890
two groups that appear to be the same but are in different places.

139
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.510
So this is a pretty obvious case,
but there are cases that are less obvious.

140
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.960
So protons within the Blue Group are homo topic and the green protons are homo

141
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.500
topic with one another right there in the same kind of place.

142
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.990
Uh,
at least they're in the same kind of place if we're discussing constitution,

143
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.090
what they're bonded to and what those things are bonded to and so on.
Right?

144
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.680
The nature and sequence of bonds are obviously the same between the two green or

145
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:43.170
among the three blue hydrogens.

146
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:47.880
And both of those are different from one another and from the red hydrogen.

147
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.740
Okay?
So the point of constitution,
the blue ones are home of topic.

148
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.210
The green ones are home with topic.
The redwood is its own right,

149
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.980
but the green is heterotopic with respect to the red or the blue and so on.

150
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.590
So that isn't telling you much that you wouldn't already have realized easily.

151
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.750
But if you get into stereo chemical to opacity,
it gets more subtle.

152
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.420
So let's look at Stereo topic relationships among these protons.

153
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.230
First,
we said that the blue ones were homo topic,

154
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.090
but are they really homo topic?
Let's consider those two hydrogens.

155
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:29.280
Do they have the same environment?

156
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.320
They're clearly the same with respect to constitution,
what they're linked to,

157
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.190
right?
But are they the same stereo chemically?

158
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.030
Are there environments super imposable exactly on one another?

159
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.393
Yes or no.

160
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.070
So are they stereo chemically homo topic?

161
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.560
Cory,
what do you say?

162
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.730
You say they are?
Can you,
if you take,
took the,
the,

163
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:08.731
the top hydrogen away and looked at everything else and then made another model

164
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:13.620
where you took the bottom on a way and looked at everything else.

165
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.650
Are those everything elses the places superimposable no,

166
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:22.140
they're not because one has,

167
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.640
one has a hydrogen down here missing and the other one has a hydrogen up.

168
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:30.690
They're missing.
You can't superimpose those unless you do a rotation.

169
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.720
Right.
So that's a question of con formation of rotation.

170
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:39.180
Right.
Okay.

171
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:44.210
So those are Daya Stereo topic from the point of that is different places from

172
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:52.320
the point of view of Khan formation,
but not from the point of view of,

173
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.160
of a constitution.
Right.
Sorry,
I'm getting right.

174
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.720
Sees confused.

175
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.180
It's a long run from the beginning of September.
We'll thanksgiving,

176
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.460
you'll find that this is this,

177
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:11.050
this will have been the longest period of unrelieved period of your time at

178
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:15.190
Yale.
It gets easier after this.
Okay.
So anyhow,

179
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.640
their dietary a topic from the point of view of confirmation,

180
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.970
but Hobo topic from the point of view of constitution.

181
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.100
How about those two?

182
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.590
Are they,
do they have the same environment,
those two hydrogens?

183
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.880
Kathy,
what do you say?
They're this.
They're Super Bozel.

184
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.160
That is if you took the h in front away,
you'd have a certain amount,

185
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.270
a bunch of stuff left.
That's its environment.

186
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.550
And if you took the ancient back away and looked at the rest of the stuff,

187
00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.530
are those two remainders?
Absolutely identical.

188
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.330
Super imposable.
What is the,

189
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:06.890
what is the relationship between them?

190
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.810
Obviously I was sort of a leading question.

191
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.600
There are mirror images.
So what would you call those?
Two protons.

192
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.810
Not even anti omers.
It's,
they're places that are different.

193
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.620
He antio what in Antio topic.

194
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.350
So the ones at the top are in Antioch topic and the first ones we looked at were

195
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:34.130
Diastat area topic.
Right now,
do you care?

196
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.560
Is that gonna make a difference in chemistry?

197
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

198
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.120
<v 0>I say no.</v>

199
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.760
And the reason I say no is that it rotates so fast around the single bond.

200
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:52.050
We talked about that last time,
10 to the 10th per second.
And when you rotate,

201
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:56.490
you exchange one,
one,
one takes the place of another.
Right.

202
00:13:56.491 --> 00:14:00.420
So they exchange places among themselves faster than almost anything could

203
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:05.250
happen.
10 to the 10th per second.
So who cares?
Right.

204
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.110
So in truth there conformationally a stereo topic,

205
00:14:10.111 --> 00:14:13.950
but you don't care about confirmation in this case because they would rotate so

206
00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:14.311
quickly.

207
00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:18.900
So they're going to have experimentally distinguishable properties probably,

208
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.500
unless you can look pretty quick
now.

209
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:28.550
So these distinctions are only confirmation on erased by rotation in 10 to the

210
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:32.270
minus 12 seconds.
I say here.
Okay.
Yeah,
that's more like it.
Okay.

211
00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:36.020
Now how about the two green ones?
What's the relationship between them?

212
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.670
Pat,
what do you say?
What's the relationship

213
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.570
there in Antioch Topic Now?

214
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:51.310
Are they he Nancy or topic with respect to formation,

215
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.520
can you rotate one and give it exactly the same place as the other one?

216
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.470
Why not?
What would happen if you tried to rotate to put the blocks,

217
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.040
the back green one in the place of the front breed one,
change the location.

218
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.680
It would change the location of the,
Ooh,
right.

219
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.820
So how could you exchange their environments?

220
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.140
The only way you would have to break a bond and put the other hydrogen someplace

221
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:19.880
else.
So what's,
what kind of in Antioch topic are these,
is that

222
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.120
configuration

223
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.640
con formation or constitution that you have to change?

224
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.500
Can you do it just by rotation?
Is it just confirmation?
No.

225
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.340
Do you have to change what's bonded to what?
Didn't make one note.

226
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.800
So it's not con.
So it's configuration,
right?

227
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.390
But the important thing is you have to break a bond to change them,
right?

228
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.260
So that's not going to happen easily.
So the difference between those two,

229
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.210
those are also eat Antia topic,

230
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.630
but configurational Lee in Anthea topic.

231
00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.290
So that will last last that distinction in principle,

232
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.580
as long as the bonds and Dior.
So there's quite a difference.

233
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.990
Those two could be different.

234
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:08.090
Now let's see if we could see a case where there are different,

235
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.550
now that carbon is not a stereo genic center.

236
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.960
Why is it not as theory?
How do you recognize the Stereo Genic Center?
Nate,

237
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.410
you guys shouldn't sit next to each other.
I was talking to the other

238
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.520
candidate.
It's got 200 test has for different things.
Right.

239
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.870
And this has two are the same,

240
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.070
but it's called for this purpose of topicality city stuff,

241
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.740
Perot chiral that is,

242
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.770
it will become chiral if two of the things that are the same become different.

243
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.250
For example,
if one of them instead of an age where a deuterium,

244
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.110
then it would be a chiral center.
So that thing is called pro Kyle.

245
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.040
It would be chiral if the eaneandhea topic atoms or groups.

246
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:01.010
It could be chlorine or it could be methyl groups or whatever.

247
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.180
If they were made different somehow,
then it would be Tyrell.
Now,

248
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.300
so in ethanol that those two green groups are in Antia topic and

249
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.120
configurational.
So now tow pond in me,

250
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.370
that's names of places.
How do we name them?

251
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.110
So we have things,

252
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.130
we have groups that are constitutionally homo topic.

253
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.260
They have the same constitution that connected to the same things.
Okay,

254
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.760
so consider those,
the green hydrogen there,
the light green one in front.

255
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.550
And I'd draw the Newman projection also to show it.

256
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.020
We have to be able to give it a name so people will know what we're talking

257
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:49.190
about when we're,
if this turns out to be important for some reason.

258
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.670
Okay.
So the way we do it is to assign priority.

259
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.820
If the hydrogens were different,
right?

260
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.760
Then we'll be able to call it r or s,
right?

261
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.680
Cause we already have a scheme for that.

262
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.970
But the two hydrogens would have to be different.
So let's look at the,
at the uh,

263
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.850
the priority Oah at that carbon.

264
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:12.210
The pro Tyrell carbon is obviously top and the methyl,

265
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:14.580
the carbon group attached to it as second,

266
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.890
but the two hydrogens come third and fourth.

267
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.570
But which one should be third in which one should be fourth?
Now here's the rule.

268
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.460
You give higher priority to the one that you're naming,

269
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.570
right?
So if we want to name this one,

270
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.960
we give it higher priority than this one.

271
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.980
So this one will be three and this one will be for,
so here's the,

272
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.540
here's the lowest priority.
You could run one to four in either direction,

273
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:45.660
high to low or low to high.
You get the same sense of hand is,

274
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.180
so let's think about this.
Here we have,

275
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.150
so if I put my left thumb coming out where this hydrogen is the bottom,

276
00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:59.160
the number four and curl my fingers,
I go one,
two,
three.
Okay,

277
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:04.200
so this one would be lefthanded if it were higher priority.

278
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.970
Everybody with me on that.

279
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.600
So we'll call that not s we'll call that hydrogen pro ass because it will become

280
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.790
ass.
Okay?
If we,
if we make this for purposes of naming,

281
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.060
when we give it a higher priority,
okay,

282
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.560
now suppose we look at the other hydrogen that I've shown in the darker Arrow

283
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:26.640
here,
right?

284
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:30.120
It obviously is going to be pro our cause the same thing would run the opposite

285
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:31.980
direction.
Okay.

286
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:36.981
So Pearl are and pro s are the name that you can give to distinguished groups

287
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.060
that are eaten Antia topic.

288
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.730
Now is there a reactivity difference that we would care about between these

289
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:45.330
groups?

290
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.190
Suppose you bring up a chlorine atom and it can attack one or it can attack the

291
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:52.980
other.
So as suppose to the tax,
the one on the left,
right?

292
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:57.981
It's so mo mixes with one of the electrons of the h and the other electron on

293
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:02.991
the h goes on the carbon and we break the bond and a and get an hcl.

294
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.640
This is the first step.
Remember in free radical substitution,
uh,

295
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.290
or we could do it with the other one.

296
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.700
What's the relationship between those two pathways?

297
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.220
Can you see the pathway that happens on the left and a pathway that happens on

298
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:28.020
the right?
Are they the same?
Well,

299
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:32.970
they're not super imposable.
Okay,
so they're not precisely the same.

300
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.330
But what are the Sophie,

301
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.010
they're mirror images of one another.
Therefore they have the same energy.

302
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.870
So one will be just as remember we talked last time about how fast the reaction

303
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:50.380
goes.
Ha has to do with high and energy.
You have to go to along that path,

304
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.110
right?
And these are going to be the same.

305
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.180
So they'll have precisely the same rates.
So who cares?
Okay,

306
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.620
so attacked by a reagent like chlorine,
Adam,

307
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.890
those two versions of the attack are mirror images.

308
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.600
Thus they're identical in their rate.

309
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.830
So who cares?
But suppose

310
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.230
that you use something that's handed like a right hand to pull it off.

311
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.630
Okay.

312
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.630
Now suppose you use the same right hand to pull the other one off it.

313
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.590
Those aren't mirror images one another anymore,
right?

314
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.790
What do you call them?
What's the relationship between these two reactions?

315
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.540
What would you call the relationship between them?
Angela,

316
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.713
get here,

317
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.670
right there.
Dietary,
dietary,
married pads.
So there are different in energy.

318
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:59.590
So one will be faster than the other.

319
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.750
What does that tell you about the metabolism of ethanol?

320
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.530
If you got ethanol inside you,

321
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.830
there are things that pull the hydrogen off and make Aldehyde out of it.

322
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.520
In fact,
that's where the name Aldehyde comes from.

323
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.120
Aldehyde is an alcohol that's been d hydrogenated Aldehyde.

324
00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:31.030
It's interesting,
isn't it?
But anyhow,
this can be,
uh,

325
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.100
would you,
would your body,
if your body was trying to metabolize ethanol,

326
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.800
could it distinguish between those two hydrogens?
Yes.

327
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.330
What would it be?
Why?
Who said yes I am?

328
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.920
Because whatever,
and assignments doing that,

329
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:52.210
it's going to be a 10 because the enzyme that does it as a hand,
a single hand,

330
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.650
right?
So it will be able to distinguish between those.
Now can we prove that?

331
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.320
Okay,
so a tax by a resolved chiral reagent like an enzyme.

332
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.320
Our dietary American should have different rates.

333
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.230
So horse liver,

334
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:13.231
alcohol dehydrogenase removes only the pro are hydrogen from ethanol.

335
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.550
It,
uh,
if,
pardon me,

336
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.720
if it removes only the pro our hydrogen in this Deutero ethanol,

337
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.150
it should remove the hydrogen and never deuterium in the case that it's

338
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:31.530
deuterated like this.
I messed that up saying it,

339
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.100
but you can read it better than I can.
Okay.
Now,

340
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:37.570
so that would be a great experiment.

341
00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:42.571
If you had this compound s one Deutero ethanol and you reacted it with this

342
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:44.404
enzyme,

343
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.970
if you always pulled off the h and left Deutero acid Aldehyde,

344
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.800
that would show up with specific.

345
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.170
But if it works specific than you'd sometimes get one.

346
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:57.350
And sometimes the other companies often do you get different acid aldehyde

347
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:01.820
somewhat have deuterium and some wouldn't left behind.
Okay.

348
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.250
Now what's the problem in doing this experiment,
Zack?

349
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.140
How do you know that there's good tears right there?

350
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.980
How do you get the compound with the deuterium on only one side in the first

351
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:15.170
place.
So even do the experiment.

352
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.800
And this is where there's a clever way of doing it,
right?

353
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:21.290
That would be the reaction than you'd get.
Only the,

354
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.400
the deterioration left and never hydrogen laughed if it were specific.

355
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.710
So that's a good task.
But where do you get the starting material?
Now?
Actually,

356
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.180
the alcohol dehydrogenase is a catalyst,

357
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.033
right?

358
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.510
And a catalyst lowers the energy of the barrier you have to go through to go

359
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:43.670
across,
lowers the barrier.

360
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.950
But that means it lowers the barrier in either direction because you can go

361
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:53.150
either direction across this,
right?
So,
uh,

362
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.800
that means that you can,

363
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.370
this is an oxidation removing hydrogen as an oxidation,

364
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.780
but you could also do the reverse reaction or reduction.
That is,

365
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:05.240
you could start with this.

366
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.290
So what really does the oxidation lad is a catalyst.

367
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.990
What does is this Nad plus becoming Nadh,

368
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.470
taking h minus away,
right?

369
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:20.600
So if you ran this reaction backwards and started with a deuterium there,

370
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.120
then if the thing were specific,

371
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:26.480
you'd put hydrogen only there when you run it backwards.

372
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.680
If it's specific taking it off,
it'll be specific putting it on

373
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.173
<v 1>right</v>

374
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.100
<v 0>now.
How would you know if it's specific putting it on?</v>

375
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.300
How would you know if it did that?

376
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

377
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.650
<v 0>How would you know whether when it does this reaction it's scrambles and puts it</v>

378
00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:53.640
in both positions and then when you run it backwards it scrambles and takes it

379
00:25:53.641 --> 00:25:55.980
off both positions.
Sometimes one,

380
00:25:55.981 --> 00:26:00.981
sometimes the owner or whether it's specific going on in specific coming off,

381
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.480
Lucas,
you gotta pull it all begins Jace optical activity.
Ah,

382
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.220
if you could measure the optical activity of this stuff,

383
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.140
that would be a good way of doing it.

384
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.720
But it doesn't have very much optical activity.

385
00:26:15.721 --> 00:26:19.110
If the only differences between deuterium and hydrogen,
not very much.

386
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.100
This is just kind of a gas,
but I mean if they did it to both things,

387
00:26:23.101 --> 00:26:27.810
when you get one with both and then one with only one and then if you,

388
00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:31.410
if it only went to one side,
you only do one with one second.

389
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.260
I think you said it,
probably not,

390
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.660
but I don't know that everyone understood what you said.

391
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.590
The idea is do both put on and then that product and take it off.

392
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:49.740
Again,
if it's specific going on and specific going off,

393
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.160
when you go through the whole cycle,
you'll get back where you started from.

394
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.700
But if it mixes up going on and coming off,

395
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.250
then sometimes it will put it on the wrong place.

396
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:02.520
Sometimes it will take it off the wrong place and when you come back,

397
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:06.840
sometimes you'll have h and sometimes you'll have d in that starting material,

398
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.270
right?
So you go both ways and see and that works right by starting with the same

399
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:17.190
catalyst,
an excess deuteride you do that to go that way.
Okay.

400
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.630
So if you do a full cycle like that,
then you come back,
pardon me,

401
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.370
come back exactly where you started.
But this proves the specificity.

402
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:28.140
It should,
but it doesn't say which one.

403
00:27:28.141 --> 00:27:32.040
It doesn't say whether it was pro our progress for that you need to do other

404
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:35.310
kinds of experiments that we don't have time to talk about.
Okay.

405
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.630
So that's really a neat experiment that shows the Topa city makes a difference

406
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.900
and that enzymes descript discriminate between Stereo topic in Antioch topic

407
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.160
groups or Adams.
Okay.

408
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.590
Next subject is buyer strain theory,

409
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.860
which was proposed in 1885 so that's 10 years after van Tall.

410
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.393
Okay.

411
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.610
So here's the group in Munich in 1893 and here in the front and center is the

412
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:08.640
boss of the group od all fuck buyer.

413
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.660
And this picture hangs in the hallway out there.
The original picture,

414
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:17.100
you can look at it.
And the reason it does is that this guy here,
uh,

415
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.760
is Henry Lord Wheeler.
Did you ever see his name?

416
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.900
See how observant you are?

417
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.410
<v 1>Lexi [inaudible] Pat?</v>

418
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.080
<v 0>Yeah.
When you come in,
there are these names carved on the walls,</v>

419
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.580
which were the people who were in the 19th early 20th century professors.

420
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.570
So he was the first organic chemistry at Yay chemist at Yale.

421
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.980
And he went to Munich where a lot of people went to learn organic chemistry from

422
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:55.070
buyer by,

423
00:28:55.071 --> 00:28:59.250
or remember was the guy who fiddled with the bread rolls together with a Fisher

424
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:02.970
to,
to make these models.
He was also the guy that did the,

425
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.990
did experiments on our snick and calculates kitchen when he was a student.

426
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.050
And so buyer was the leading organic chemist at the time.
Now in 1885,

427
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.970
he wrote that,
that's earlier than this picture.

428
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:19.560
That picture was 1893 when Henry Lord Wheeler was there,

429
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.780
he noticed that he died at,
uh,

430
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.580
at a 37,
the age of 37.

431
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.780
I don't know what he died of in 1911.

432
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:35.580
So he wasn't a professor very long.
Okay.
Uh,
so,
uh,

433
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.080
this paper,
uh,

434
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.110
eight years earlier was about Polyacetal lead compounds.

435
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.990
So a bunch of triple bonds arranged in a row.

436
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.220
We've talked about double bonds in a row.
You can have triple bonds in a row too,

437
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:53.260
but you don't have them for very long because as buyer reported in this paper,

438
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:54.220
they explode.

439
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.720
He had a collaborator named Doctor Homolka who he,

440
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.420
thanks for doing some of the experiments in this paper.

441
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.950
Dr Homolka does not appear in the 1893 picture.

442
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.910
I suspect that he just graduated and got his degree and went to be gainfully

443
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.910
employed someplace.
But who knows.
Anyhow,

444
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:17.020
Polyacetal things are explosive and this got buyer thinking,

445
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.410
why should I just a regular old hydrocarbon be explosive?

446
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:26.190
So he branched out in this paper and the very first topic was the theory of ring

447
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.990
closure and double and the double bond.

448
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.530
Now that seems a funny thing to talk about when you're talking about triple

449
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:39.190
bonds to talk about making rings and talk about double bonds.

450
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:41.890
But what he says is written closure,

451
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:47.070
which was a popular synthetic goal at that time to make new kinds of compounds

452
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:51.010
was to try to make rings.
They could make six membered rings,

453
00:30:51.011 --> 00:30:54.070
they could make five membered rings in buyer's lab.

454
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:58.600
They actually made four membered rings and and three membered rings.
Right.

455
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:02.380
Although that was quite a chore.
Okay.

456
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:07.381
So written closure is apparently the only phenomenon that can supply information

457
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:11.610
about the arrangement of atoms in space.
This is 10 years after Vat off,

458
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.160
since a chain of five or six members could be closed easily while one of more or

459
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:20.530
fewer members is difficult or impossible.

460
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.460
Spacial factors are apparently involved.
And you know,

461
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:28.600
we already talked about a case like this where you tell something about

462
00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:32.680
arrangement in space from the ability to form a ring.
You remember what that is?

463
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.933
Anybody

464
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:40.290
can hear routes and dismissive of the synthesis of Miss Siddeley formed a ring,

465
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.883
but that doesn't,

466
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.300
so he used that to say that where the methyl groups are on the ring and that

467
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.570
that,
that's actually a good example,
but it's not the one I was thinking about.

468
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.560
<v 0>Die Chloro probate,
is that what you said?</v>

470
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.720
Uh,
it's not cycle appropriate that I had in mind,

471
00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:06.020
although that was one of the compounds that we synthesize that buyer's lab for

472
00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:10.580
the first time and found to be reactive.
But there was another occasion,

473
00:32:10.581 --> 00:32:13.010
remember Malik and fumaric acid?

474
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:18.220
One was sis and one was trans and the one that was CIS could lose water to form

475
00:32:18.351 --> 00:32:22.820
a rig.
Right?
So that was,
that was what he's referring to here.

476
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.290
Okay.
So then he goes on to say the previously,

477
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.960
so there's a website you can click on the,
see this,

478
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.920
the previously proposed general rules on the nature of carbon atoms are the

479
00:32:33.921 --> 00:32:37.310
following one carbon is Tetra Vaillant who did that?

480
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

481
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:45.320
<v 0>Right.
The four valence is or equivalent.</v>

482
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.840
So shown by the fact that there's only one mono substitution product,
a methane.

483
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:52.370
We've talked about that three,

484
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:56.570
the valence is or equivalently arranged in space to the corners of a regular

485
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:57.470
tetrahedron.

486
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:02.030
And who says that carbon is tetrahedral van toff also,

487
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:05.660
incidentally,
there was a Frenchman who did it simultaneously called labelle.

488
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.190
Okay.

489
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:12.170
For the atoms or groups attached to the four valence says cannot exchange

490
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:16.790
places.
So you can't,
you have to break bonds to make new isomers.
Right.

491
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:18.680
So that if you get a one way they'll stay.

492
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:22.830
The evidence is that there are two tetra substitution products,
a,
B,
c,

493
00:33:22.831 --> 00:33:27.530
d of methane,
so the van Hoffen labelle's rule.
Okay.

494
00:33:27.531 --> 00:33:32.450
That you can have eat configurational enantiomers.
We would say

495
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.830
five carbon atoms can bond to one another with one,

496
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:39.800
two or three valence is that is you have single double,
triple bonds

497
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.163
six.

498
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.730
The compounds can form either open chains or rings.

499
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.110
That's what he's talking about here.

500
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.810
I should like to add the following to these generally accepted rules,

501
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.230
so these adding a new property to the models.

502
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.440
The same way van Hoff did van Hoff added arrangement in space to the models that

503
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:03.890
people already drew.

504
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:09.490
What buyer is adding is seven the four balances of the carbon atom point to the

505
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:13.460
directions connecting the center of the sphere to the corners of a tetrahedron.

506
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.390
That's what van Hoff also say already said,

507
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.670
but forming an angle of 109 degrees in 28 minutes with one another.

508
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.220
That's very quantitative and precise.

509
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:30.221
That's the angle between the center and two vertices in a geometric regular

510
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:35.090
tetrahedron.
Okay,
but then this is what's interesting.

511
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:38.600
The direction of attachment can undergo alteration.

512
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.760
It doesn't have to be exactly that angle,

513
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:46.060
but a strain is generated increasing with the size of the deflection.

514
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.170
So if you have an angle other than 109 degrees in 28 minutes,

515
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.190
then there's going to be higher energy associated with strain.

516
00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.220
Or what he's actually talking about is not higher energy but reactivity.

517
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:01.761
Okay.

518
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:06.761
So he drew this picture showing how much the angles are distorted from 109 and a

519
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:08.420
half degrees.

520
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.660
So if you consider ethylene to be a two membered ring with two Ben Bonds,

521
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:20.050
the angle the bonds are going at is where it should be tetrahedral and in fact,

522
00:35:20.241 --> 00:35:21.380
they're colinear.

523
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.400
That distortion of each bond is 54 and 54 degrees,

524
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:29.900
44 minutes and so on for three.
Four five is perfect,
right?

525
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.910
Only deviates by 44 minutes.
But uh,

526
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.980
the six member drink is stretched a little bit the other way it has to go out

527
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.300
rather than sharper.
Okay,
so he says dye methylene.

528
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.100
That's ethylene,
right?
The first one is indeed the weakest string,

529
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:51.670
which can be opened by Hbr,
bromine,
or even I had,

530
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.260
we talked about bromine or chlorine attacking the ethylene already.

531
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.830
Okay.
Uh,
tribe,

532
00:36:00.831 --> 00:36:05.250
methylene cyclo propane is broken only by hydrogen bromide,

533
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:09.540
but not by bromine.
So it's not as reactive as the two membered ring.
Finally,

534
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:13.500
Tetra methylene and heck,
some ethylene are difficult or impossible to break.

535
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:15.180
They're pretty stable.

536
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:20.070
So this strain is causes reactivity if the bond angles aren't right.

537
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.350
So he's becoming more quantitative,

538
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.700
unusually quantitative for an organic chemist at this period,

539
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:28.560
remember the physical chemist,

540
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:31.860
this is just that the period when physical chemistry is coming into its own,

541
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.700
and they were the ones who did heat and energy and so on.

542
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:38.760
All buyers talking about is whether the things will react or not,

543
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.230
but he's using geometric precision.
Okay.

544
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.380
Now xoxo so the question is,

545
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.090
are a six membered rings?
I like this.

546
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:56.010
Cyclohexane they should be according to buyer.
A little bit strange,

547
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.090
right?
Because the angles should be the,

548
00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.190
you'd think the angles would be 120 degrees instead of 109.

549
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.050
So they're opened up a little bit too much,
but Zoc see a young,
uh,

550
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.240
[inaudible] set that is essentially between a graduate student and a,

551
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.760
an a an a professor in 1890,
uh,

552
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.270
published a paper that had this very funny picture,
a,
B,
c,
d,
e,

553
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.240
f up on the top there.
And people didn't understand what it was.

554
00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:25.350
But what it is,

555
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.790
is a thing that if you trace it on cardboard and fold along the diagonals,

556
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:32.940
you'd get this blue thing,
right?

557
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:36.510
If you folded along the diagonals of paste the ends together,
right?

558
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.950
And then if you,

559
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.690
if you paste Vantiff tetrahedral on it,

560
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:48.020
you get this thing and you'll see that this is just like this.

561
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.390
Everybody see that
it's using tech.

562
00:37:54.391 --> 00:37:55.560
But this is a,

563
00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.640
a base on which to build such a tetra heat set tetrahedral carbon so as to make

564
00:38:00.721 --> 00:38:01.554
this structure.

565
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.770
And what's interesting about it is that these angles are the normal tetrahedral

566
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:10.980
angles,
right?
They're not strained,
right?

567
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:15.960
Why are they not 120 degrees?
Because the ring isn't flat.

568
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.200
It's puckered.
Okay,

569
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.080
so that's what Zoc see said.
And he,

570
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.700
he gave people this thing so they could make their own models and see it right.

571
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.820
And he gave,
he gave,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

572
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.170
the directions for building this more complicated base where you put it on and

573
00:38:35.171 --> 00:38:40.120
have a different form of cyclohexane.
Okay.
And that one,

574
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.490
as you see it looks like this.

575
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.040
<v 1>Okay.
So hold on.</v>

576
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.320
<v 0>So he,
in 1890,</v>

577
00:38:56.321 --> 00:39:00.880
he knew exactly the score that we would know that we would get with our own

578
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:03.850
models nowadays.
Now,

579
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.880
when this was abstracted in the journal that published abstracts of all chemical

580
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:12.850
literature so people could go there and find out what was going on in chemistry,

581
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.030
Yulia savago owner who abstracted it said,

582
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.360
it is not possible to write an abstract of this paper,

583
00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.800
especially since the author's explanations are hardly understandable without

584
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:26.470
models.
Now,
one conclusion from that,

585
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.740
it should be therefore go and build his models and look at them and you'll see

586
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:30.730
what he's talking about.

587
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:34.270
But that's not what Wagner said and it's not what people did.
He said,

588
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:39.160
forget that it's nonsense,
right?
You can't understand it.
Okay.

589
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.230
So buyer wasn't happy with this disputing his,

590
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:49.160
his theory.
So he wrote in the same year 80,
90,
uh,

591
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.910
Xoxo wasn't too smart about this because he published that paper just as they

592
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:59.470
were having a big celebration of buyers,
uh,

593
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.310
contributions to aromatic chemistry in Berlin.

594
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.540
And there was this big fabulous dinner with,
you know,

595
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:06.520
18 courses or something like that.

596
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.180
All everybody comes from all over Germany gathered and Xoxo this.

597
00:40:10.181 --> 00:40:13.720
Nobody publishes a paper and says buyers theory is wrong,

598
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:18.940
bad timing.
So by,
or published a response quickly,

599
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:21.940
he said a further proposal is that the Adams in Hexham,

600
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.970
methylene six ch two groups cyclohexane are arranged as in calculators model.

601
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.440
Now calculate his model,

602
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:33.190
remember by this time was in fact a tetrahedron,

603
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.120
which is what socksy showed how you could do it,
right?

604
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.480
But he says,
uh,

605
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.100
as in Calculus model and that the arrangement of the atoms in space is one with

606
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:48.940
minimum distortion to the valence directions.
That sounds like Xoxo.

607
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:49.930
But what he says is,

608
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:54.820
thus the six carbon atoms must lie on one plane.

609
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.830
It's gotta be plainer and six hydrogen atoms light in equidistant parallel
plane,

610
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:04.570
six above six below all the CHDS,
or just like this around the ring,
right?

611
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.311
Further,

612
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:09.820
each of the 12 hydrogen atoms supposed to have the same position relative to the

613
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:14.680
other 17 that is their homework topic.
You can rotate it if the plane is flat.

614
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.090
Now how can he say this?
It's not really like calculators model.

615
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:20.710
Okay.

616
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:25.710
The experimental test of the correctness of this assumption is relatively easy.

617
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.661
For example,

618
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:33.661
sufficient evidence is that there is a single isomer of hydro benzoic acid that

619
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:39.290
is only one cyclohexane carboxylic acid.
That is,

620
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:44.291
if you had this and put a coh group here or a coh group here,

621
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.630
what would be the relationship between those,

622
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.190
this place and this place?
What would you call the well,

623
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:59.210
are they homo topic?
Are they in Antio topic,

624
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:04.370
this place and this place?
[inaudible] Antique Mirror images.

625
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.830
No,
they're just different.
They're Daya Steria topic right now,

626
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.770
but you could do a neat trick.
So,
so that's what he says.

627
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.450
If it were like [inaudible],

628
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:19.160
then you'd have two isomers of Amano substituted.
Cyclohexane.

629
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:24.260
But what he didn't take into account was this,
this one is sticking up like that.

630
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.390
Watch this.

631
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.020
No notice the black one is sticking out down at an angle and the white one is

632
00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:32.180
sticking straight up.
But watch this.

633
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.200
Now this one's down at an angle.
The black ones straight up.

634
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.810
Did I break any bonds?
What did I do?

635
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.960
I just rotated a bonds.
They're con formational,

636
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:56.450
conformationally Diastat area topic,
not configuration Lee.

637
00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.290
So they,
they're different but they can inter convert easily.
Right?

638
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:04.370
So that's so buyer says he's right because there's only one ice mercy.

639
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:09.170
You have to regard it as flat even if it isn't.
Although he didn't say that.

640
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.940
Meanwhile,
as long as our knowledge in the field is so incomplete,

641
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:18.941
we must be satisfied that the above assumption is the most likely and no known

642
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:23.480
fact contradicts it.
Okay.

643
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.690
Now Zachs he didn't take this lying down either.

644
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:32.050
So he publishes a 41 page paper in the [inaudible] for Fizzy College.

645
00:43:32.651 --> 00:43:33.141
It could be,

646
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:37.880
which is published by Austin Ball who hates buyer and vice versa.

647
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.640
The physical chemists of the organic chemists didn't get along.

648
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.530
So he publishes a paper and this other one where he gives all this trigonometry

649
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.170
to explain what he means by this structure.

650
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.520
Is this something calculated to appeal to organic chemists?

651
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.230
Not very likely.
Okay,

652
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.400
so this edited by Oswald,
who didn't even believe it,
Adams,

653
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:06.260
remember and wrote disparagingly of his successor in Riga,
who was,

654
00:44:06.261 --> 00:44:08.450
had been an organic chemists scientifically.

655
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:12.410
He had been brought up in the narrow circle of contemporary organic chemistry.

656
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:13.244
And to him,

657
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:17.390
the arrangement in space of the atoms of organic compounds was the foremost of

658
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:21.950
all conceivable problems.
That wasn't what Oswald thought was the best problem.

659
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.120
So xoxo published again,
third,
nobody responded to that first one.

660
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:27.890
So we've published as a good in the next year,

661
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.580
34 pages again and here he gives more formulas.
Again,

662
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.660
things that didn't appeal at all to anybody who is actually interested in the

663
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:41.340
arrangement of atoms in space.
And then he died at the age of 31 in that year.

664
00:44:41.341 --> 00:44:44.970
And that was the end of Xoxo and the end of his theory.

665
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.290
<v 1>All right.</v>

666
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.500
<v 0>And buyer roads in 19 five so 12 years later,</v>

667
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.520
xoxo disagreed with my opinion that larger rings are plainer.

668
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:00.240
He has certainly right from a mathematical point of view,

669
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.990
although I sort of doubt that by or went through every line to this to check it

670
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.620
right.
Yet in reality,
strangely enough,

671
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.820
my theory appears to be correct.
The reason is not clear.

672
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.070
Okay.
So that was,

673
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.100
remember Zachs it was 1890 so what important lessons should we take from the

674
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:21.160
tale of poor Xoxo?

675
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:28.210
Want me to give you that as a problem to think about over thanksgiving?
Fine.

676
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.330
Okay.
So this,
remember it's what Zoc see wrote and EAD role models like this.

677
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.690
And I just conclude the punchline here.

678
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:42.990
In 1913 brag and brag determined the diamond structure by x Ray de fraction of a

679
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:48.550
crystal and diamond,
right.
And in five years later,

680
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.780
Aaron's Tibor

681
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.520
published a diagram he drew of from that diamond structure.

682
00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.400
Brags didn't draw the structure,
but more did five years later,

683
00:46:00.401 --> 00:46:05.320
and here's what he drew.
And that is exactly what Xoxo men,

684
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.071
right?

685
00:46:06.071 --> 00:46:10.270
So the arrangement of the carbons in a six membered ring in diamond is exactly

686
00:46:10.271 --> 00:46:13.630
what Xoxo said,
but he got nothing for it.

687
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.300
Okay.
Have a good thanksgiving.
