00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.379
The Fascinating Origin of the Word “Abracadabra”

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.799
These days you might hear Abracadabra before
some stage magician pulls a rabbit out of

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.250
his hat, but hundreds of years ago people
actually believed that “abracadabra” was

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.740
a magical spell.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.260
The exact origin of the word is up for debate,
but perhaps one of the oldest records we have

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.110
of “Abracadabra” being used is a snippet
from a Roman sage named Serenus Sammonicus

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.010
in the 2nd century AD from his Liber Medicinalis:
“The malady the Greeks call hemitritaeos

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.200
is more deadly.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.260
None of our ancestors could name this disease
in our own language, nor did they feel the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.260
need to.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.239
On a piece of parchment, write the so-called
‘abracadabra’ several times, repeating

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.149
it on the line below; but take off the end,
so that gradually individual letters, which

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.820
you will take away each time, are missing
from the word.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.989
Continue until the (last) letter makes the
apex of a cone.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.289
Remember to wind this with linen and hang
it around the neck.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.829
Many people say that the lard of a lion is
effective . . .”

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.540
It’s unlikely that Sammonicus came up with
the word on his own and it is thought to have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.100
been in use before then.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.390
There are a couple of theories as to where
it might have ultimately come from.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.510
First, it could have been derived from the
equally magical word “abraxas” whose letters,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.030
in Greek numerology, add up to 365—the number
of days in the year.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.840
It could be that early sages thought this
was a powerful word and somehow created “abracadabra”

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.480
out of it and turned it into a “cure.”

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.060
Alternatively, the word might be derived from
the Hebrew words for “father, son, and holy

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.140
spirit”: “ab, ben, and ruach hakodesh”
respectively.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.530
Perhaps more intuitively, it could be derived
from and Aramaic phrase “avra kadavra.”

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.250
Harry Potter fans will likely know that this
is what JK Rowling used when she was coming

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.200
up with the killing curse “avada kedavra.”

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.190
In an interview, she stated that the original
phrase meant “let the thing be destroyed,”

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.140
though there is some debate on whether she
is correct on this.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.880
Nonetheless, this would suit the cure-theory
well; abracadabra was written to “destroy”

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.880
the sickness.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.320
As strange as it may seem today, people did
wear talismans of sorts with the “abracadabra”

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530
cone as Sammonicus described.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.480
It was thought to cure diseases, fever, and
other problems by siphoning it out of the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.140
person and expelling it through that bottom
“A”.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.140
Obviously it would have no more than a placebo
effect on the user, but people seem to put

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.329
a lot of stock in it.

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:18.099
For example, in the 1500s Eva Rimmington Taylor
wrote The Troublesome Voyage of Capt. Edward

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.470
Fenton, in which she claimed:
“Banester sayth yt he healed 200 in one

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.719
yer of an ague by hanging abracadabra about
their necks.”

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.480
Abracadabra was still used as a “cure”
well into the 18th century, as evidenced by

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.709
a 1722 book by Daniel Defoe titled Journal
of Plague Year, which lamented the use of

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.400
such charms:
“People deceiv’d; and this was in wearing

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.109
Charms, Philters, Exorcisms, Amulets, and
I know not what Preparations, to fortify the

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.639
Body with them against the Plague; as if the
Plague was but a kind of a Possession of an

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.650
evil Spirit; and that it was to be kept off
with Crossings, Signs of the Zodiac, Papers

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.950
tied up with so many Knots; and certain Words,
or Figures written on them, as particularly

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.130
the Word Abracadabra, form’d in Triangle,
or Pyramid…

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.139
How the poor People found the Insufficiency
of those things, and how many of them were

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.590
afterwards carried away in the Dead-Carts.”

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.170
Eventually, people let go of the abracadabra
superstition and by the 19th century the practice

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.159
of hanging an abracadabra charm around your
neck to cure disease had died down.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.180
At this point, the word started to take on
the meaning of “fake magic” which is what

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.749
we know today—after all, magicians don’t
actually make rabbits appear out of thin air…

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.669
or do they?!?

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.500
Bonus Facts:
• “Kadavra” in Turkish means “cadaver”

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.859
or “corpse.”

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.900
• Many other Harry Potter spells have a
Latin origin: Expelliarmus, the disarming

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.870
charm, combines expellere, to drive or force
out, with arma, or weapon, making it “to

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.200
force out a weapon.”

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.610
Lumos, the wand-lighting spell, derives from
lumen, meaning light.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.599
Crucio, or the Cruciatus Curse, is a torturing
spell that translates to “I torture.”

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.299
• Hocus Pocus, another common phrase used
for fake magic, didn’t come about until

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.359
the 17th century when a conjurer came up with
the phrase for part of his act: “Hocus pocus,

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.249
tontus talontus, vade celeriter jubeo.”

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:18.239
It’s entirely possible that this was derived
from the phrase spoken at Catholic Mass: “hoc

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.390
est enim corpus meum,” or “for this is
my body.”

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.680
Another theory is that it derives from the
Norse demon Ochus Bochus, and calling his

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.360
name would make him help with whatever magic
was meant to be done.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.819
It’s possible that “hocus pocus” later
evolved into the word “hoax.”

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.919
• “Presto” simply means “quickly”
in Italian.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.819
It was used by magicians who were attempting
to call up demons and apparently wanted them

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:56.469
to hurry up.
