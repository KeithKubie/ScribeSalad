Now, getting sounds into grits was a bit of an interesting process. You see we

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:06.568
really didn't have funds to actually get a sound designer to make anything for

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:10.909
us. So we had to act like a scrappy little start up. This actually started at

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.476
the beginning. Where do we get our sounds? Well, thanks to the indie gaming

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:17.308
boom of 2009, there's actually tons and tons of resources out there for

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:22.232
independent game developers to go get sounds for free. So we employed that

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:26.730
strategy. Now when you do this, be very clear of what you're actually getting.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.980
Most sounds on the Internet actually follow with some sort of weird licensing

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.330
restriction, either Creative Commons or attribution or something along those

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.396
lines. So when you grab your sound, make sure you understand how you have to

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:41.530
credit it. Usually it comes with something. The second thing you have to worry

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.970
about is when you grab a lot of sounds from the internet that were made from

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.490
different designers on different sound boards, they probably aren't very

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.250
unified, which means they're not going to sound cohesive inside of your game.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.220
For this, you actually need to take your sounds through a post-processing tool.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.470
Personal favorite of mine is one called Goldwave, I've been using it probably

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.817
since about 1998, it's free and easy to grab on Windows. Inside of these tools,

00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:04.483
you basically want to cut your sounds, trim your sounds and make it sound as

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:08.265
though everything is in the same environment. Case in point, there's a lot of

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:11.420
little gotchas out there when you're trying to get good content into a game.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.146
And sounds are really tricky to do. So do your due diligence, post process your

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:16.780
sounds, make awesome. [SOUND]
