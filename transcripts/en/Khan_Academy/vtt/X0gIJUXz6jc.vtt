00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.690
- [Instructor] The Olympic
running team of Freedonia

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.083
has always used Zeppo's running shoes,

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:08.600
but their manager suspects
Harpo's shoes can produce

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:11.030
better results, which
would be lower times.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.810
The manager has six
runners each run two laps.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.330
One lap wearing Zeppo's and
another lap wearing Harpo's.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.530
Each runner flips a coin to determine

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.800
which shoes they wear first.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.350
The manager wants to test
if their times when wearing

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.400
Harpo's are significantly
lower than their times

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.180
when they wear Zeppo's.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.040
Assume that all conditions
for inference were met.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.810
Which of these is the
most appropriate test

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.470
and alternative hypothesis?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.000
So they're just asking
this about the alternative

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.840
not even the null but
we can talk about that.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.690
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.920
So before I even go into
this particular example

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.640
let's just make sure we
understand the difference

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.090
between a two-sample T
test and a paired T test.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.790
So when were talking about
either a two-sample T test

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.180
or a two-sample T,
interval for the difference

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.930
between the mean, what we're doing

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.907
is we're considering two populations.

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:11.030
You take two independent
samples from those populations.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.680
And what you're trying to do is,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.580
is you get statistics off of these samples

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.490
and you're trying to estimate
the difference between

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.300
the means of these populations.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.360
So it might be the difference
of Mue one minus Mue two.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.450
That's what you're trying to figure out,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.280
Mue one minus Mue two.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.920
A paired situation is quite different.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.360
Even though they might
sound the same at first.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.970
Here we're looking at just one population

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.940
and that's exactly what's happening

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.190
in this situation right over here.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.350
We're trying to figure out
what is the mean difference

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.710
between using Zeppo's and Harpo's shoes.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.300
So this is what we're trying
to get at, the mean difference.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.300
So we could just call that
Mue sub Zeppo's minus Harpo's.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.470
And the way that we go about doing that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.440
is we take a sample and then
for each subject in the sample

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.060
we perform two measurements.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.540
One where they run with the Zeppo's

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.200
and one where they run with the Harpo's.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.200
And then for that sample you
can calculate a mean difference

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.250
between the Zeppo's and the Harpo's.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.740
You're going to calculate
this difference for each

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.990
member of your sample and
then you're going to take

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.790
the mean of all of those.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.260
So hopefully you notice that
this is quite different.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.240
And so as you can imagine,
here in this example

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.060
we are dealing with a paired T test.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.730
We aren't looking at
two independent groups

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.020
or two independent samples like you would

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.890
with the two-sample T test.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.350
And so we run a paired T test

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.360
and the manager wants to test
if their times when wearing

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.560
Harpo's are significantly lower than

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.350
their times when wearing Zeppo's.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.200
So our null hypothesis, even
though that their not asking

00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:57.680
that, our null hypothesis would be

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.100
that there's no difference.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.747
That the mean time, that
the mean difference between

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.440
wearing Zeppo's, Zeppo's
and Harpo's, and Harpo's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.350
would be equal to zero.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.353
And the alternative hypothesis.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.030
So if they were just saying,
"Hey, is there a difference?"

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.770
Then we would say that this
would not be equal to zero,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.830
the alternative.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.800
But the manager explicitly
want's to see if Harpo's times

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.290
are lower than Zeppo's times.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.690
So what we would want to see
is if the mean difference,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.690
so the mean difference of
Zeppo's, Zeppo's minus Harpo's.

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:41.190
We're trying to find if
we can see if we can have

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.863
evidence to suggest that this
is actually greater than zero.

00:03:45.807 --> 00:03:48.433
And so that would be this
choice right over there.
