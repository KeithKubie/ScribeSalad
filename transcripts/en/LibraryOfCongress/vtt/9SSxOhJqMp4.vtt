00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.020
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.440
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: This next session
is a bit of a treat for me.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.940
It gives me a chance to highlight
some Library of Congress staff

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.790
and partners, whose work I
think you'll find interesting

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.090
and relevant.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.930
I'll start us off, and
then we'll have Matt Weber,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.230 position:56%
an assistant professor in the school
of communication and information

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.790
and co-director of Rutgers NetSci,
Network Science Research Lab.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.290
Matt and his colleagues
Ian Milligan and Jimmy Lin

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880
of Archives Unleashed
Incorporated led a datathon here

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.550
at the Library quite recently.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.050
Matt is going to talk about
Archives Unleashed and its impact

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.880
on the web archiving community.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.660
And last up we'll have
Deborah Thomas,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.960
the library's program manager

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.980
for the National Digital
Newspaper program.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.350
And Leah Weinryb Grohsgal,
a senior program officer

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.090
at the National Endowments of
Humanities, and coordinator

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.490
of the National Digital
Newspaper program.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.700
Deb and Leah will talk about NEH's
recent chronicling America data

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.220
challenge, in which members

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.240
of the public submitted projects
using historic newspaper data

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000
in a national competition.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
But first, I'll start us off
by talking a bit about my team,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.160
National Digital Initiatives,
who put this on today.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.510 position:56%
Who we are, what we've done and what
we're going to do in the future.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:31.550
[ Background Noise ]

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.600
That's us, National
Digital Initiatives.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.100
I'm going to wander
around, is [inaudible].

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.580
Great. So hello.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.880
Hello? Great.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.150
Hello, and welcome from
National Digital Initiatives.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.090
Let me introduce you to my team.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.650
There's me, I'm Kate, you know,
that's my picture and me, my face.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.390
And Jamie Mirrors,
Jamie are you nearby?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.690
There's Jamie.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.990
Everybody, say hi to Jamie.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.290
And Mike Ashenfelder.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.480
Mike, do you mind standing
up and waving?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.470
And Avy Potter.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.720
Also, I think, you guys met Jane a
little bit earlier and also I think

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.990
in the crowd are Eugene
Flanagan and Colleen Showgun

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.840
from our executive management team.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.770 position:56%
They provide the support and
structure to make all this possible,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.450
so if you like what we're doing,
please see them and thank them.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.230
So as I mentioned,
and I'll talk a little

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.690
about National Digital Initiatives,
our team here, but first I want

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.740
to tell a quick story, that I
think illustrates what the Library

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.330 position:56%
of Congress's long and exciting
history of technological innovation,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.480
and that's the story of
Henriette Avram, whose work here

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.150
at LC replaced ink
on paper cataloging

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.310
with distributed electronic
cataloging records.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.100
Henriette Avram was born in New
York in 1919, she did two years

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.780
of pre-med at Hunter College
and then left to start a family.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.240
She was in her 30s when she
started learning how to program.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.810
And I really like this story
because there are people

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.330
who will still tell you that if you
haven't been coding since you were

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.710
in diapers, you'll
never be able to do it.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.180
And I'm here to tell
you that they're wrong.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.490
She did it and she
changed the world.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.540
Henriette and her team here
at the library created MARC,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.290
which is a structure to hold
bibliographic information

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.260
for materials of all formats.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.070
Does anybody in the room
remember card catalogs?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.330
There are people like
that Colleen's age

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.190
that do not remember it
so don't laugh at me.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.580
I really do miss the beauty
of them and the smell.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.670
Like do you remember
how they used to smell?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.380
But that's about all I miss.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.630
They were kind of hard
to use, right?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.450
And what Henriette and her team
gave us is the power to share

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.750
that information across oceans
and search it at a keystroke.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.010
So right now I can sit at my
desk and search the holdings

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.690
of the British Library
to decide whether I want

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.260
to take a plane flight over there.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.000
In the past, that would
have been impossible.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.200
It also gave us the ability to
do really good precision recall,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.540
you know, like searching with
a search string is much easier

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.390
than looking up beagle
and then realizing,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.050
well that's not how someone
intended to catalog it,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.100
you have to look up
a different name.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.170
It, it also gave us shareability.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.740
So it's the kind of work that
I find really interesting.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.520
An application of effort here
made everybody's life a little

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.820
bit better.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.400
So we could swap cataloging
records, we could have joint teams

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.550
where we could do the
copy cataloging.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.100
You know, it really
improved all of our lives.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.380
I think of Henriette Avram as sort

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.290
of a hidden hero of
computer science.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.380
She's a personal hero of mine.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.190
She came to libraries
from software like I did,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.120
and really took her adopted home
as a place of her heart like I do.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.590
But she did all of this before
computers were networked,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.090
before relational databases
were a thing,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.450
before character encoding
was really mature.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.460
And I really like to just take
a moment and reflect on like,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.910
what she was able to give
us at a time that you know,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.100
this kind of sharing of information
was really, very limited.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.060
And I think also when I think about
her story, it shows me the power

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.010
of combining disciplines,
which she did in her own self,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.210
and I think that, knowing
many of you, that you do, too.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.840
Right? You know, you have a data
science background and you work

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.660
in libraries, or you're a software
developer who's also a journalist.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.960
And she did that herself.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.180
But also we do that by
having rooms like this

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.980
where we share our knowledge
and get to know each other.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.140
And I think that that's where
we see really cool seat changes,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.910
where we can provide,
like cross disciplines.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.520
Her work really started the digital
revolution in information science

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.120
and it's something we
carry forward today.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.540
Here at the Library of Congress
but also broadly in the field.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.580
I think about her as the person

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.610
who really started libraries'
commitment to open source.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.190
So for those of you who work
in software in the libraries,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.540 position:56%
we're avid users and contributors to
open source but also standards work.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.850
You know, we're famous for
getting committees together

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.610
and all working together, right?

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.930
And I think it really does lift the
tide, and that's the kind of work

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.510
that I'm really excited about.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.140
It also shows, to me, how
innovation can look like a dot

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.310
in the timeline, but
it's really not.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.980
So people say things like MARC was
released to the public in 1968.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.310
But really it was ten years
of iterative releases,

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.410
and it only looks like a dot
in a timeline in hindsight.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.870
And you can, and it still
continues to improve today.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.410
You know, we have teams
of people working

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.800
on the standard here
and internationally.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.520
It's an international standard
that now contains character support

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.090
for all current used languages.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.930
You know? So it's this thing
that continues to blossom.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.130
And I think about that in
relation to other work here

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.100
at the library, like LOC.gov.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.350
It's also another dot
in the timeline

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.210 position:56%
but is also a continuous improvement

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.150
and we add new collections
all the time.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.210
My colleagues and OCIO
and library services,

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.680
put forward an enormous
amount of work

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.740
to release these new
treasures to the public.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.040
Just this year we released a lot

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.150
of new collections including
George Patton's diaries,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.180
the Chicago Ethnic Arts Projects,
and Walt Whitman's papers.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.970
And I want to zoom down one more
level and just take a close look

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.990
at one collection that
we've released.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.190
And we could just as easily
be looking at another,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.980
at any of the other collections

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.180
like the ballroom dancing
instruction manuals

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.460
which are a hoot, you should
really check them out.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.760
Or the 2014 election web archives.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.810
But I picked this one because it's
really special to me and I find it,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.380
I think it's really exciting.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.030
Rosa Parks' personal papers and on
loan to the library for ten years

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.130 position:56%
from the Howard G Buffet foundation.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.500
They contain 7,500 pieces of
personal correspondence and papers

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.860
and 2,500 Princeton photographs
documenting her private life

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.110
and public activism on behalf of
civil rights for African Americans.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.380
The materials came here, they
were assessed and stabilized

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.320
by the LC conservation division.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.000
They were cataloged and described
by librarians and archivists.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.010
Files were moved by
people and software.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.760
They were assessed,
validated, prepared for access.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.380
Meta-data was transformed.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.870
Websites were created.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.640
Search index were populated
and rights were assessed.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.010
That's a few years worth of work
in less than 140 characters.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.590
And those of you that are
librarians in the room,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.380
you know that this is
just the job, right?

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.230
A bunch of invisible work to make
information find-able and usable.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.590
But I kind of want to
make a big deal out of it

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.210
because we make a big
splash for cool new websites

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.280
and exciting new visualizations
but the sustained and careful

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.850 position:56%
that it takes to get new information

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.760
out is something I think
we should really celebrate.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.110
And I think it also
speaks to something

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.080
that I've been thinking a lot
about, which is this tension

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.970
between innovation
and sustainability.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.910
And I think about this
in terms of LOC.gov

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.470
and the sustained effort takes
in getting new collections ready,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.480
and the enduring power of MARC
and other bibliographic standards

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.980
like big frame, and I think of
Henriette Avram as my shiny beacon.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.910
Because her, you know, level
of software in libraries,

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.110 position:56%
but also because she really believed
in the power of infrastructure.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.410
Which is something that I
can get really excited about,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.390
like I think infrastructure's
really cool.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.430 position:56%
You know? It's the roads that we
all drive to get cool places, right?

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.540
And I think that groups like ours,
like National Digital Initiatives,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.380
can either become or be perceived
as like, the cool new things group.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.120
And I really don't want to do that.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.750
I want to do things that lift the
tide and have a view to the future.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.290
So with that all in mind as
we were doing our planning

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.770
for National Digital Initiatives,
we came up with a couple of goals

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.040
that I'd like to share
with you today.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.220
The first one is to maximize
the digital collection,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.600
the benefit of the
digital collection

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.640
to the American public
and to the world.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.460
We have a lot of stuff here
at LC, we have a lot of it,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.370
and a lot of it's publicly
available in digital.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.810
We have 10 million historic
digital newspaper pages,

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.350
we have 1.2 million
prints and photographs,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.190
we have the personal papers of
George Washington, Lincoln, Carlsig

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.770
and Jackie Robinson
and many other maps,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.410
books and archived websites
and other treasures.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.450
We have this really awesome team
here called educational outreach,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.670
I don't know how many of you have
heard of it, but they focus on K

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.860
through 12 educators and students
and they prepare resources

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.960
and programs that help teachers
get material out to their students

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.600
from the library, teaching
with primary sources.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.240
And I'd like to think about
how we can extend the benefit

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.110
that they give to advanced
scholars and to the public

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.210
and to the curious, and how
do we teach a new generation

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.080
of journalists to come to
the Library of Congress

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.730
for reference help
and for resources?

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.030
I think that's the kind of thing

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.660
that would be really
exciting to work on.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.940
We'd also like to enable more
creative reuse of the collection.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.790
The great mustaches of LOC, I tried
to grow one today for an example,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.540
but it didn't really work out.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.860
And people use these like for mugs
and t-shirts, and it's really neat

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.900
to see that kind of economic
benefit from things that are

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.080
in the public collective, but it
also, in its fun and exciting,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.680
and it brings people to the
collection, too, which is great,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.610
but it also services a more
important scholarly purpose, too.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.500
Back to the Rosa Parks
collection for a second,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.220
which contains this amazing
and powerful handwritten note

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.200
in which she says I have been
pushed around all my life and felt

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.170
at that moment that I
couldn't take it anymore.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.360
This note gives us
insight into Parks

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.380
as an American hero in that moment.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.020
But other pieces give us a more
fuller picture of her as a human.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.310
And that's why I love her
pancake recipe, which was picked

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.360
up by the popular press
and food bloggers.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.180
From what I hear, it
makes great pancakes.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.480
Has anybody tried it?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.780
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.080
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Yeah?

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.380
How is it?

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.680
&gt;&gt; It's very good.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.980
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Oh yeah?

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.280
Okay. Peanut butter is her
secret ingredient apparently.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.090
But it really, the
pancake recipe I think,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.230
helps us paint a fuller picture of
her as a person who had a family,

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.900
who had friends, you know,
who wasn't an icon frozen

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.200
in time, was a real person.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.840
And really inspires us to think

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.500
about the power we could have
just being ourselves and thinking

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.850
about you know, what we could do.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.610
And I think also it brings
people into the collection.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.010
So people read on their
favorite food blog, this thing,

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.190
and I hope that inspires them to
think about what they could learn

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.870 position:56%
about Rosa Parks from Rosa Parks
and brings them into the collection.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:53.840
The second goal we have at
NDI is to incubate, encourage

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.940
and promote digital innovation.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.590
We have a really small staff as
you just, as I just demonstrated.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.220
Which I like actually, it helps us
keep focused, it makes us agile,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.500
and it lets us try new things
without there being an impact

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.990
on the critical production
work of the library.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.000
I think of us as sort of an
interface to the outside world.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.560
I used to say a semipermeable
membrane, but I got a lot

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.120
of weird looks on that one,
so people told me to stop.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.540
And in terms of an interface,
I think of us as being

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.820 position:56%
out in the community, thinking about
standards, thinking about projects,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.810
that would be really
interesting and relevant

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.020
to people inside the library, but
also being involved very closely

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.970
with our library colleagues
and what they're working on,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.270
what they're interested in,

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:39.560
and helping the communication
path between those two.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.560
How many of you remember
chemistry class?

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.760 position:56%
So this is one of my favorite energy
diagrams, exothermic reactions

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.350
as you know from chemistry an
exothermic reaction happens

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.450
spontaneously, but sometimes
they need activation energy.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.220
And I think that's true of many
of our projects here, right?

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.650
Like, we've got great ideas, we've
got tools, but we need a little bit

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.110
of help getting over the hurdle.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.180
And I think in that case NDI
can provide a catalytic affect.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.910
Right? We can be the catalyst
and we're not enzymes, right?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.210
We don't have the power
of an enzyme.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.780
But what we do have the power
of is we do have the power

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.620
of is knowing people,
knowing technology,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.950
being able to connect folks.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.610
So sometimes a little bit
of application of effort

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.580 position:56%
from an outside team at just the
right time can get the ball rolling,

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.970
and I think that we
can help provide that.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.470
I like to say that
libraries are poor, right?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.400
We're not Silicon Valley.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.980
But we're scrappy and
we like each other.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.150
And that's our power, right?

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.460
We're like a stream over a boulder.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.450
Our problems may be immovable,
but we are many, we are focused,

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.400
and we have a very long memory.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.830
One of our focuses will be
building on relationships,

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.760 position:56%
will be building relationships that
can lead to successful partnerships.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.120
So we co-hosted DIPLA
fest a little while ago,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.780
which was an exciting event
that brought many librarians

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.080
from across different libraries to
here into the national archives,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.370
and we also co-hosted Archives
Unleashed a few months ago.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.360
In the interest of no
spoilers, I won't talk much

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.600
about that because Matt's up next.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.180
But I do wonder if I could tell
you just a quick story about that?

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.250
So we had, the teams were made
up of scholars, programmers

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.620
and librarians, which
is kind of unusual,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.060
it differs from a classic hackathon
which is mostly programmers,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.110
and that collaboration ended

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.500
up being really exciting
and awesome to watch.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.560
And we had one team
that was looking at some

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.300
of the Supreme Court
web archive data,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.850 position:56%
and they were getting some
results, that, from a text analysis,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.370
that they weren't expecting.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.980
They looked a little wacky.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.940
And, but luckily there as a
law librarian on the team,

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.950
and he said okay, well I know
a little bit about the contours

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.590
of the data, and the reason
you're getting this is

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.890
because blah, blah, blah.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.190
Like he explained that like,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.990
there's some weird artifacts
that you might expect.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.830
So he helped them construct a query
that, that made the results work

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.050
out the way that they
could have expected.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.130
And I think that really
illustrates the power

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.570 position:56%
that libraries have in data science.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.190 position:56%
Right? Where else can you get, where
else can you go to get the data?

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.430
But also to talk with somebody who
really understands it intimately

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.830 position:56%
and can help you with your research.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.660
We're also working
on a proof of concept

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.560
for our digital scholars lab.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.860
At the Library of Congress we
have the John W. Kluge Center,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.410 position:56%
which hosts scholars from all around
the world to be in residence here

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.630
at the library, to work
with our collections,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.510 position:56%
and also to create a community
together, and then share the results

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.130
of their work with policy
makers and the public.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.950
And we're thinking about
how we can help support them

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.480
with advanced digital
scholarship research in partnership

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.240
with the Kluge Center staff.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.790
To that end, we've engaged with
two outside experts, Dan Chudnov

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.550
and Michelle Gallinger, to do a
proof of concept implementation.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.780
We're thinking about something very
lightweight that we can iterate

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.510
over time, and we will have a
report out after that's completed

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.210
and we hope that we'll have
something to share with you soon.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.310
I'd like to introduce you
Ton Wong and Chris Adams,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:16.130
our inaugural digital
innovation fellows at NDI.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.140
They're doing a fellowship
that's focused

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.330
on demonstrating an innovative
use of the digital collections,

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.000
and we hope to broaden the
applicant pool for in future years,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.410
so keep a look out for it.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.100
Biking will not be a requirement,
that's just a coincidence.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.590
So if you don't like
biking, don't worry.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:40.860
And lastly, this meeting today, as
you could probably tell our theme

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.580
for this year was collections
as data.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.860
And this is the capstone of
this event where we invite all

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.690
of you fine folks here
to chat together.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.190
This is a particular love of mine
so I'm really excited about it.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.000
But we're also exploring
other avenues,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.510
like how can we encourage
more contributions

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.610
to open source and shared tooling?

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.860
How do we evaluate and
help with skill building,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.760
technical skill building
in libraries?

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.220
And how do we improve on
shared infrastructure?

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.970
Things like that, where
we can apply a little bit

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.730
of effort to get a large result.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.560
So contact us, we're
small, we're new,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.590
but I'm proud of what we've
been able to accomplish already.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.810
I hope today that you'll
enjoy our, this selection

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.200 position:56%
of speakers that we've put together.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.880
I'm really excited
to hear from them.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.190
But I hope you'll also take
the opportunity to make friends

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.920
with each other, get
to know each other,

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.720
and think about Henriette
Avram and the power

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.420
that a determined individual
can have

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.240
over the course of human events.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.580
Because I look around the room
and I see hundreds of you,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.140
and more importantly I see
a network of professionals

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.720
that can really help
actualize those ideas.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.510
So think big in a sense.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.310
Thank you.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:19:00.510
[ Applause ]

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:16.080
[ Background Noise ]

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.310
&gt;&gt; Matthew Weber: Good morning.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.880
I'm Matt Weber, I'm an assistant
professor at Rutger's University.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.370
I'm in the department of
communication in the school

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.680
of communication and information,

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.250
and it's really an
honor to be here today.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.420
Thank you to Kate and to her
team for organizing this.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.380
Thank you for inviting me back
after that chaos that we created

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.860
when we were here in June.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.900 position:56%
I had the privelege of being here in
June with my colleagues Ian Milligan

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.390
and Jimmy Lin, both of whom are
faculty at University of Waterloo,

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.730
outside of Toronto up in Canada, to
host the Archives Unleashed event.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.630
It was the second iteration of
Archives Unleashed and I want

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.330
to tell you a little bit about
the Archives Unleashed journey,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.270
what we aim to accomplish,
and why I see this as being

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.840
such an important movement and
important initiative for engaging

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.750
with collections as data.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:20.190
So Archives Unleashed is an agenda
that Ian, Jimmy and I put together

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.150
to address what we see
as a central problem

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.420
of web archives being a tremendous
untapped resource for scholars,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.650
something that has incredible
potential for research and yet,

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.270
scholars are relatively unaware
of how archives can be utilized,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.040
what we can do with them.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.570
We came up with this idea, a little
more than a year ago, when Jimmy,

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.310
Ian and I were at a
conference together.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.610
We were at a reception
afterwards and as we do

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.110 position:56%
at these receptions we were standing

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.390
around a bar table drinking a
few beers, and we were talking

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.390
about the different data sets
that we had, and we were talking

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.710
about under-utilized
these data sets are.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.750
And we jokingly said, we've
got to do something about this,

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.580
we have to figure out how
we can better educate people

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.350
and how we can unleash the power
of the archives that we have,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.860
and Jimmy jokingly said, we
have to unleash the archives,

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.480
come on guys, we've got to do this.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.880 position:56%
And I should have run away
screaming at that point, because low

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.190
and behold we actually came up with
a way to start educating people

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.920
about how to utilize
archives as a research tool.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.040
And so we saw this opportunity to
develop a forum for researchers

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.610
to engage with archives
and to learn about the ways

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.770
in which these can be utilized
in their research agendas.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:41.040
Web archives are an amazing
resource, but access and tools

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.810 position:56%
for utilization are often a problem.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.770
We're seeking to address that.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.780
We're seeking to keep calm and
hacked and to engage with the data.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.240
Our vision behind this
is interdisciplinary,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.910
and our goal in this
as Kate highlighted,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.730
is to bring together researchers
from different backgrounds

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.570
because in part, we've
realized that in order

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.860 position:56%
to create an active research agenda,
to bring researchers in to the fold

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.160
to work with web archive data,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.240
we need to bring together
different disciplines.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.340
Point in case, I'm a communications
scholar, Ian's a historian,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.550
and Jimmy's a computer scientist.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.250
We come from entirely different
disciplinary backgrounds,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.710
we speak entirely different
languages as academics, and yet,

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.760
together in the same room,
we're able to work with data,

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.470
and create meaning out of
that data as we collaborate.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.360
I'm going to borrow a story
that Ian likes to tell

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.430
because I think it's particularly
salient to the conversation

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:44.910
that we're starting to have here
today, which is that Ian comes

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.640
from the world of history,
I come from the world

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.010
of communication research and
we often in those disciplines,

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.050
look at data, look at the data
that we're given, as a black box.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.620
Look at the way that that data
is collected is a black box.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.570
It sits in this box,
and we go to it,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.430 position:56%
and we say look, here's what I need.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.560
I need some data on newspapers

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.920
in the United States,
give me what you've got.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.970
And that data's spat out to me
and I use it and I create research

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.950
and I never really ask
how that data came to be.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.580 position:56%
And what we've started to realize is
that we need to open that black box.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.880
And why it's so important

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.350 position:56%
to have these different
disciplines represented and engaging

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.540
with one another is that by
opening up that black box,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.300
we can start to ask some important
questions about what the data are,

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.460
how the data came to be, what some
of the underlying assumptions are,

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.360
and then how that data can better
be utilized in research to,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.370
I was actually very excited to see
JR's slide on hotels and the map

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.200
of hotels in the United
Stated, in the world,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.940
because I think it underscores
that problem of needing

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.610
to better understand exactly what
the data are and how they came

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.880 position:56%
to be, what they mean, so that we
can better utilize them in research.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.220 position:56%
Okay. So let's put this into action.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.620 position:56%
We came up with this idea that in
order to better educate researchers,

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.290
better educate scholars
about the ways

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.520
that web archives can
be utilized in research,

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.830
we needed to create a venue for
scholars to come together to be,

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.750
to learn, to exchange ideas,
to educate one another

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.250
about the tools that are available.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.770
And we quickly realized
it takes an army.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.130
We've been very fortunate
to have a lot

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.350 position:56%
of collaborators in this initiative.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.210
We've had support from
our universities,

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.950
from Rutger's University, from
the University of Waterloo.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.290
We've had support from
the Library of Congress,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.120
from the National Science
Foundation, from the Institute

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.120
for Museum and Library
Services, the Internet Archive,

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.160
University of Toronto, and
I could go on with this,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.490
but our list of collaborators
has really been never ending

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.430
and we're always amazed at
the people who are willing

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:50.730
to support us in this endeavor.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.050
The format that we came up with was
to host a two to three day event

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.750
where we brought together an
invited group of academics,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.180
largely graduate students,
faculty, librarians,

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.740
we start with introductions, we
start by getting people networked,

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.850
engaged with one another, we
break everyone out into teams,

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.800
into work sessions and
then we have people come

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.750
up with these presentations
based on what they did.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.220
So let me show you a little bit
more about what that is and what

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.920
that looks like, and I'm going
to highlight the last two events

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.470
that we've hosted, the first
two events that we've hosted.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.790
The first was Archives Unleashed
one, which we hosted in Toronto

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.760
in March, and the second
was Archives Unleashed 2.0

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.260
which we hosted in June here
at the Library of Congress.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.050
And so what this plan
looks like in action,

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.300
is academics in the room
together are starting to engage

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.850
with one another, starting
to mingle.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.740
And what we do is we bring these
people together, we bring our 40

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.320
to 50 scholars together into a
room, we've assembled for each

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.460
of these Archives Unleashed events,
a set of donated curated data sets.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.170
In the case of the event that we
hosted at the Library of Congress,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.970
we had a data set of supreme
court hearings, web archived pages

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.790
around supreme court hearings.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.110
We had archived web pages
around the US elections.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.650
We had archived web
pages and Twitter data

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:20.450
around terrorist activity, archived
known terrorist's Twitter accounts.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.450
We had donated collections
from the Canadian government.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.770
We put these collections
out there, we put the team,

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.300
the individuals together in a room,

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.030
and we start to ask people
what they're interested in.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.050
And as moderators, Jimmy, Ian
and I take on this role of trying

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.260
to assemble groups into teams,
assemble individuals into teams

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.940
that are focused on
particular questions,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.540
whether that be sentiment analysis,
event detection, and we were able,

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.000
at both of these events, to
formulate these groups of four

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.510
to five individuals that would then
spend the next two days working

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.180
together on an emergent
research questions.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.490
In order to help to
lubricate this process,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.490
we believe in the importance
of socialization,

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.130
and it really is critical
for these events

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.760 position:56%
that it's not just everyone together
in a room, that we're getting people

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.540
out and engaged with one
another, socializing,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.550
so absolutely the first day,
we get everyone out to a bar

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.520
in the evening, we get people
engaged with one another,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.710
we do our fun getting to know you
games, and really break down some

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.510 position:56%
of the barriers that might exist
between these individuals otherwise.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:27.430
And then we come back day two, day
three, and we put everyone to work.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:32.000
We spin up virtual machines using
donated competing resources,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.250 position:56%
we allow the teams to have access
to high performance computing needs,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.610 position:56%
that they would need in order to
quickly analyze and crunch the data.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.790
But we also bring social
scientists in the fold.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.420
We bring communication scholars,
we bring historians to the table,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.060
so that we can also be
asking critical questions

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.740
about what the data mean.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.520 position:56%
We have a lot of applicants who will
come to us when we put the calls

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.240
out for these events, who say look,
I don't have any technical skills

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.180
but I have a lot of interesting
questions I want to ask

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.330
about web archives, these are
exactly the people we want

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.850
in the room, because we want to
be asking those critical questions

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:10.400
of the data that are being
extracted from web archives.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.390
We have lightning talks where
we offer scholars an opportunity

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.080 position:56%
to share the work that they're
doing, again, to build the community

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.390
and to help each other to
engage with one another.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.540
And then ultimately, at the end,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.810
we share the work that
we've been doing.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:30.640
We come back together at the
end and present on the research

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.450
that we were able to generate and
spin up over two to three days.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.910
This is a photo of the group
that came together for Library

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.510
of Congress, in just a couple
months since we hosted this event,

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.610
we have been following up with
everyone who participated,

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.280
and it's been amazing to
see how these teams coalesce

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.910
and how they've continued to
stay in touch with each other,

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.180
and carry on the event, the
research agendas that they started

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.620
at this two to three day workshop.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.720
So we share, we engage, and we
ask questions of each other based

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.600
on the research that we generated.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.230
We also form connections.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.280 position:56%
I'm an academic, I'm a researcher,
so I can't help but study the people

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.280
that we bring together, and I
have a graduate student who's very

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.890
interested in the way that
people form collaborations,

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.260
and he mapped out socio-grams,
a socio-matrix,

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.540
of the way that people connected
at the Archives Unleashed event.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.390
This is actually based
on the Toronto event,

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.160
think back out to JR's image
of the seventh grade classroom,

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.110
this is our scholars
engaging with each other

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.170
and forming connections
just over two to three days,

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.900
and this was asking people who you
would talk to and exchanged ideas

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.770
with before the event versus
who you had exchanged ideas

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.140
with after the event, and we saw

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.620
that we formed some very
close knit groups out of this,

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.310
and close knit clusters
of researchers,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.870
over the duration of this event.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:55.020 position:56%
We also of course polled individuals
to see if they were satisfied

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.790
with their experience, if they
were satisfied with the engagement,

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.350
and not that we're patting
ourselves on the back here,

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.580
but people walked away
generally happy and feeling

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.960
that they had engaged
across barriers.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.180
We also some really cool
research coming out of this.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.450
And it's only two to
three days, but we're able

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.000
to generate some pretty
interesting insights into the data

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
that we granted teams access to.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.310
So Kate mentioned the
supreme court data,

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:25.350
this is a word cloud
visualization of the URLs that were

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.040
in the supreme court data,

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.740 position:56%
and you start to have some
interesting head scratching moments,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.240
for instance here seeing
doubleclick.net popping up is one

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.690
of the most prominent websites
in the supreme court data.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.100
This is where you have
that head scratch moment,

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.690
you're like well I'm looking
at supreme court data,

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.660
why am I seeing double
click in here?

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.270
And this is where it's so helpful

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.560
to have not only the computer
scientists but humanitarians

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.030
and the people who created the
collections because we start

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.620
to realize there's some quirks
in the data, clean this out,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.010
pull out double click,
which is an advertising hub,

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.680
an advertising website,
and we're able

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.220
to extract some more valuable
meaning around the way

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.980
that these websites are connected.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.580
We're able to generate word clouds
around the confirmation votes

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:16.270
to see, to see a little bit
as to how people were voting,

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:20.390 position:56%
whether the confirmation candidates
were being supported, not supported,

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.140
but also to see some of the
key words that were emerging

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.360
and the themes that were
emerging in the discussion

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.030
around these candidates
based on the text that was

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.330
in the archived web pages.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:30.630
And again, only two to three days.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.480
So this is an initial
snap shot here.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.730 position:56%
We're also able to move a little bit
further, I mentioned team looking

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.700
at terror risk networks
and ISIS Twitter data,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.430
and they were actually able to take
this a little bit further and find

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.950
that there were particular types
of Twitter accounts that served

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:54.500
as amplifiers in, on Twitter,
to amplify certain messages

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.390
and certain themes in the
conversation, and they were able

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.410
to identify the characteristics
of those Twitter accounts based

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.880
on the data they had available.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.010
We're moving this forward now

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.230
and we have a third event that's
tentatively planned for February

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.150
of 2017 at the Internet
Archive in San Francisco,

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.450
and we have a fourth event planned

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.750
at the British Library
in June of 2017.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.050
And after that, we're focused now

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.350
on building a sustainable
model for this.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.650 position:56%
The work to date on Archives
Unleashed has been driven by myself,

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.070 position:56%
Ian and Jimmy, and our collaborators
and that network that I mentioned

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.660
at the beginning, but we recognize
that going forward we need

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.980
to create a broader
educational model for working

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.750 position:56%
with web archive data and for
educating researchers and librarians

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.050
about ways to open up
access to these data sets.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.350
And so Kate referenced
Archives Unleashed, LLC,

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.650
we're looking to build
and we've applied

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.950
to create a nonprofit
organization around this idea

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.290
of Archives Unleashed, to built a
more sustainable educational model

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.730
for bringing together
interdisciplinary teams to engage

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.050
with web archives and to
learn the skills necessary

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.350
to create research out
of these data sets.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.960 position:56%
And so we have this long term vision
of creating a sustainable model

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.340
that will move us beyond these
Archives Unleashed events,

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.780
and build on the momentum
that we've created thus far.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.080
If you have questions
about any of these events,

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.450
if you'd like to learn more,
I'm happy to serve as a point

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.750
of contact, so please
shoot me an e-mail.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.180
The ArchivesUnleashed.com
website has all of the information

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.680
about the event that we
hosted at Library of Congress.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.420
If you replace the .com with
.ca, you will find a variation

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.720
about the first event
that we hosted.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.020
You can also access the
Archives Unleashed 1.0

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.320
and I believe the 2.0
projects are now

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.620
up as well, via that bitley link.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.920
It's also linked via
ArchivesUnleashed.com.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.220
And thank you again for
having me here today,

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.520
thank you again for listening.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.320
We really appreciate your time.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.510
[ Applause ]

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:15.040
[ Background Noise ]

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.840
&gt;&gt; Hi, can you hear me?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.640
Great.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:27.440
[ Background Noise ]

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.340
&gt;&gt; Do you have slides for us?

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.640
Oh.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.940
&gt;&gt; Leah Weinryb Grohsgal: Cool.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.240
Thank you.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.540
Thank you partner.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.840
Good morning, yes,
a round of applause.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.140
Good morning, I'm Leah
Weinryb Grohsgal,

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:43.030
I'm a senior program officer in the
division of preservation and access

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.720
at the National Endowment
for the Humanities,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.170
and I'm also the program
coordinator for NEH

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.580
for the National Digital
Newspaper program.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.020
This is Deb Thomas, Deborah
Thomas, she is the program manager

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:31.580
for the National Digital Newspaper
program at the Library of Congress.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:43.230 position:56%
So the NDNP is a partnership between
NEH and the Library of Congress,

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:49.960
that represents a long term
effort between these two agencies

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.870
to develop Chronicling America,
an open access searchable database

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.550
of historic US newspapers.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:10.960
And Kate talked about
sustained efforts,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.780
this is really the culmination
sort of, of a sustained effort.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.520
This program's been going on for
10 plus years, and it also builds

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.020
on the US newspaper
program, which was the effort

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.460
to microfilm all those historic
newspapers before they fell away

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.760
to dust.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.160
At this point, we have millions
of pages of digitized newspapers

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.780
and descriptive information
contributed by states

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.970
and territories across the country.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.700
One of the best things
about NDNP is that Library

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.430
of Congress has made
all of the data open.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:45.690
And they've developed a well
documented API to explore it

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.330
in a number of different ways.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:51.050 position:56%
It's an incredible collection of
data, that's just waiting to be used

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.180
for scholarship, research,
education and public programming.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.160
I'm here to tell you about a
successful contest I ran at NEH

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.410
to encourage creative

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.900
and substantial use of
Chronicling America.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.530
First, Deb is going to
go over the goals of NDNP

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.620
and explain the data she and her
colleagues have made available,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.820
and after that, I'll
describe the data challenge

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.250
and the excellent results.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.690
Deb.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.430
&gt;&gt; Deborah Thomas: Thank you Leah.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:21.510
So I made the magic happen, but
now I don't know what I'm doing.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:28.060
[ Background Noise ]

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.110
Ah ha. Alright, well, so this is
newspapers, historic newspapers

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.720
in particular, and I'm just going

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.750
to show you a few,
oops, that was accident.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:44.780
I'm going to show you a few
of examples of newspapers.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.850
That may or may not
show up on the screen.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:52.860
Anyway, newspapers have something
in them for any kind of discipline

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.450
or humanities studies
or social sciences.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.170
As you can see from the images

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.070
in the background there
are advertisements,

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.520
there are news articles
on scientific events,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.520
there's economic articles, there's
genealogy, there's literature,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.970 position:56%
any kind of thing you want to study
can be found in historic newspapers.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:19.810
The goals of the National
Digital Newspaper Program

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.040
in particular were primarily

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.490
to enhance access to
American newspapers.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.870
We are, our whole goal
with the program was

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.790
to create a national
level collection

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.270
of what is currently
today, a distributed level,

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.550
a distributed collection
across the United States.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.620
The Library of Congress
has a very large collection

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.860
of American historic
newspapers, but is not,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.030
is has a particular collection
focus, it is not the collection

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.640
of American history newspapers.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.160
The collection of American historic
newspapers is actually stored

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.680
in state libraries and
archives around the country.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.720
And so using digital technologies,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.580
we're able to bring this
material back together again

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.240
through the partnerships
with the National Endowment

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.450
for the Humanities and
individual state institutions,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.040
representing their
state in the program.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.240
We have developed a permanent
digital resource including selected

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.370
historical content from
each, from the states

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.670
that are currently participating.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.060
Eventually we hope to cover all 50
states, as well as many territories

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.180
as are able to participate.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.050
The structure of the program is
focused around shared resources.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.480
We share the cost of the program
with the National Endowment

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.010
for thr Humanities,
the National Endowment

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.950
for the Humanities provides
funding to each state to select

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.610
and digitize materials from
their state collections,

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.450
their newspaper collections,
based on some basic criteria

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.860
that we provide, and they
digitize their collections

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.360
to specifications established
by the Library of Congress,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.420 position:56%
the Library of Congress receives the
data, aggregates it, and sustains it

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.480
for the long term and makes
it available to the public.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.340
One of the key elements of the
program over the past 10 years

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.870
and into the future is
focusing on paste scalability,

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.170
so that the Library of Congress
and the National Endowment

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:59.410
for the Humanities can make this
program last into the long term,

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.850
essentially so and to ensure that
the data that we get at the end

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.940
of the program is similar to the
data, is usable with the data

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.770
that we get in the
beginning of the program.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.150
So we have gradually increased
the size of the program.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.950
We started in 2005
with six awardees,

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.960
which seemed like a moderate amount
of people to start working with,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.780
and now we're up to working with
more than 40 states and territories

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.200
and we have many, many,
many millions of newspapers.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.320
In addition to all those aspects
of actually creating the content

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.860
and bringing the content
together, we focus the structure

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.680
of the program and the resources on
planning ahead for technical change

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.700
and sustainability in the
fact that we have ensured,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.950
and through various mechanisms,

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.460
that the data that we receive
is all fairly consistent.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.800
We have a very detailed
technical specification,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.790
which while has been described
as richly detailed, we're,

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:56.750
we have a fair level of confidence
that this material is in fact going

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.440
to last into the future,
and whatever the next form

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.660
that this digital data needs to
take, to be usable in the systems

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.840
of the future, we can move it in
that direction as a whole data set

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.740
and we won't be dealing
with individual pieces

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.040
from 50 different producers.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.600
So this is a screen shot of the
Chronicling America website,

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:23.400
it's LOC.gov/chroniclingamerica,
it's chroniclingamerica.loc.gov

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.440
or the historic newspapers'
badge from the Library

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.670
of Congress home page, it provides
access to searching the newspapers

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.140
and browsing them as well.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.740
And this is the user
interface available.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.360 position:56%
This is a map of the states
participating in the program so far.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.730
As you can see, it's
happily very green.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:55.160
We're still working on filling
in all those other little spots,

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.060
but this year we just, NEH just
announced grants to Alaska,

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.290
Colorado, Maine and New Jersey.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.500
We're very happy to have
them join the program

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.720
and join the other
40 states including

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.480
and territories including Puerto
Rico and the District of Columbia

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.630
which the Library of Congress
represents, which is all available

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.890
in the Chronicling America website.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.740
So currently the status
of the website,

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.720
is today we have 11.3
million pages online, we have,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.870
that's approximately 75
terabytes of live storage,

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.770
and we also have 750
terabytes of archival storage,

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.880
the master archival files are
kept offline for safe keeping.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.250
We have 44 states and
territories participating

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.490
in the program actively, we
have representation content

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.070
from 40 states and territories.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.520
We also have, in addition to the
actual digitized newspaper pages,

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.720
one of the tasks of the awardees,
when they select the digitized,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.770
the newspapers they
want to digitize,

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.140
is to create a 500 word essay

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.670
about the significant historical
context of that newspaper.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.380
Why was this one particularly
important enough to make available?

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.270
To digitize and make available?

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:08.350 position:56%
And so we have 1,100 of these essays
that have been written by scholars

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.200
and knowledgeable researchers
around, and librarians

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.130
from the country, that really
put the newspapers in those,

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.670 position:56%
in their place in time, and
explain why these were significantly

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.370
important content.

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:24.150
In addition, just the 11
million pages represent 2,100

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.570
different titles.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.720
But that, I talked a little
bit about, we, one of the goals

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.370 position:56%
of the program is to create a
selected amount of content available

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.270
through this program and through
the Library of Congress website.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.430 position:56%
That's a selected amount of
content because at 11 million pages,

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.550
we're only working with
2,100 titles so far?

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:46.170 position:56%
Out of the 153,000 titles that have
been published in the United States.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.170
That gives you a little bit of a
sense of the scale of newspapers

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.290
that have been published
in the United States.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.340
This is always ever going
to be a slice off the top,

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.640
and hopefully it's a very rich

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.830
and valuable slice to
researching scholars.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:05.270
And in addition, for reasons
of sustainability in archiving,

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.760
we have 10,000 reels of microfilm

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.530
that were created during
the digitization process.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:16.590
So just a glimpse into what
the site allows you to do.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.570
The search has, the site
has two main features.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.630
One is the digitized newspapers,

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.180
which are full text
search-able at the page level.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.800
You can search by place,
time and key word,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.100
which are the really
the important things

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.880
when you're looking at newspapers.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.370
You have a certain a mount of
information about every issue

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.890
and page, you can navigate
within them,

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.540
you have visual search
highlights that are in red.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.050
I don't know if you can see
it on this screen or not,

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.480
that indicate where your
key words occur in the page,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.750
and that gives you the chance
to zero in visually on articles

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:50.940
of interest and where your
results may be, you may be willing

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.530
to spend the time zooming and
panning into the materials.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.540
In addition, there's the ability to
manipulate the image on the screen

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.690
and to make it full screen.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.500
The other kind of data,
which is also part

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.720
of the Chronicling America website,
is the US newspaper directory.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.210
This sort of forms the backbone
of all of the newspapers

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.730
that we might want to digitize,
and actually represents the program

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.310
that Leah mentioned,
the USNP program,

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:21.310 position:56%
the United States Newspaper Program,
which was structured to identify,

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:26.540
catalog and selectively
microfilm the nation's newspapers.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.220
All the records that were
cataloged under that program,

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.840
the 150,000 titles that we
know that have been published

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.300
in the United States, if they
have digitized content elsewhere,

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.210
it's the records and they provide
more information for resources

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.120
that enhances access to the
newspaper, more information

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.440
for researchers and enhances access
to newspapers across the country.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.880
So the US newspaper directory
is also search-able by place,

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.120
time and key word, and
it includes website links

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.880
to individual locations where
these materials may be found,

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.480
as well as holdings records.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:09.840
And finally, well not
quite finally, but close,

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.010
what's available and
how is it available?

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.220
Leah mentioned open access to
this data, well what that means is

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.070
that the data is available for
harvesting for reuse outside

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:24.100
of the individual interfaces that
we provide through the website.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.300
So we have digitized page images,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.060
we have objectable
character recognition

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.610
which is machine readable text for
all the pages, we have meta-data

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:33.460 position:56%
that surrounds every page and issue,

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.350
which is in a standardized
METS format

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:41.470
in MODS descriptive characters,
descriptive characteristics,

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.640
which describes the place and time
of that particular issue as well

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.960
as the newspaper directory records.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.380
All of these pieces can be taken
out of the site and analyzed

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.540
in different ways by
researchers or individuals,

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.740
that don't involve the
actual web, website.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.960
So the way that we make the data
available is through the open API

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.950
as well through the public website.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:11.590
We provide stable URLs that
are helpful for many reasons,

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.590
in particular, they are
machine, human readable,

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.620
so that you can project and predict
what the next URL you might be

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.230
accessing could be.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:24.430
There are machine readable
views like JASON [assumed],

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.620
which makes it a bit easier
to play with the stuff.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:33.000
And there are prefab data sets
that we have created specifically

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.400
for the, on the request of
researchers who really just wanted

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.120
to access the OCR for example, so
we have created batched downloads

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.680 position:56%
that people can access and take
away for use and manipulation later.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.150
And now I will turn it
over to Leah to to tell you

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.430
about the specific uses
that have been made of late.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:50.730
&gt;&gt; Leah Weinryb Grohsgal: Alright.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.610
Cool. Thanks Deb.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:58.810
So you just heard about the
incredible amount of data

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:01.700
that we have available
and the number of ways

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.890
that researchers can access it.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.160
Chronicling America is
an exceptionally valuable

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.910
and public spacing product.

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.850
It's one of the best known and most
used resources that's ever been

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.250
produced by both NEH and
the Library of Congress.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:18.640
As a historian myself, I used
the site well before I came

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.770
to NEH for my own research.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.120
The site's used heavily
through the user interface

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.610
and there have been a few large
scale digital humanities projects

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.150
done with the open data that
are really cool to look at.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:33.430
But we at NEH wanted to see even
more people using the open data.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.880
And NEH we decided to try hosting
a contest to get people thinking

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.920 position:56%
about creating interesting projects.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.690
So we used challenge.gov, which
is a platform for agencies

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.340
across the federal government
to host competitions.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.300 position:56%
It's been around since 2010 and it's
a response to the White House office

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:51.200
of science and technology policy's
call for government agencies

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.520
to promote innovation using
prizes and challenges.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.260
Our challenge encouraged members
of the public to ask the question,

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.280
how can you use open
data to explore history?

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.450
We purposely left the
challenges parameters broad,

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:05.660
and we encouraged entrants
to be creative in thinking

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.760
about what humanities themes
really interested them,

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.250
and how they would get at
that through the open data.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:13.570
So projects could create
maps, visualizations or tools,

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.750
and entrants also were
allowed to mash up the data

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.770
in Chronicling America
with other data sets

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.790
in order to get their results.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.490
Because the Chronicling
America database covers so much

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.900
in these millions of pages from
north to south, east to west,

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.060
across the country,
various political, religious

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.170
and cultural standpoints, we really
think that the sky is the limit.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.410
And we had prizes!

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.220
We got many interesting entries.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.940
I don't have too much time to
go too deeply into any of them,

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.330
but I think a short look at each

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.190
of the six winners
will give you a taste

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.370
of the variety of projects we got.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:46.770
You can find links and more
information about the winners

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.270
and their projects on the NEH
website if you're interested.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:53.260
Our first prize winner
was Lincoln Mullin,

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.730
for a site entitled
America's Public Bible,

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.440
bible quotations in US Newspapers.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.300
The site tracks biblical
quotations in American newspapers,

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.900
to see how the bible was
used for cultural, social,

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.990
religious or political purposes.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.170
It shows how the bible was
a contested yet common text,

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:11.210
so you'll find quotations
in things like sermons

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.710
in Sunday School lessons, which
were reprinted in newspapers

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:17.650 position:56%
across the country, but you can also
find the bible used in every side

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.940
of almost every issue
including slavery,

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.500
women's suffrage and capitalism.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.150
Next we had a tie for second place.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:30.470 position:56%
One second prize winner is by Andrew
Bales, entitled American Lynching,

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:32.670
uncovering a cultural narrative.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:36.670
This site explores America's long
and dark history with lynching,

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.570
in which newspapers acted as both
a catalyst for public killings

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.890
and a platform for
advocating reform.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:46.630
Bales integrated the Chronicling
America data with data sets

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:50.350
on lynching for Tuskegee
University as well as project HAL

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.590
which is based on the bectonay
[assumed] confirmed inventory.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.350
The site is intended to tell
the story of lynching in America

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.450
through maps and other
visualizations as we often do

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:02.830
with data but Bales also
wants to connect that data

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.090
with the stories of the victims.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.580
Oops. Sorry, I didn't
advance the slide.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.310
That's a quick look.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.050
The other second prize went
to Amy Glroux, Marcy Galbreth

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:18.320
and Nathan Glroux for
Historical Agricultural news.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.620
This is a search tool
for exploring information

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.650
on the farming organizations,
technologies

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.860
and practices of America's past.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.390
The group sees farming as
window into all kinds of things

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.630
about American history
including social,

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:32.340
economic, political and cultural.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.680 position:56%
Additionally, they see their project
focusing on one subject area as sort

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.310
of a statement about big data.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.640
So by narrowing it down
into this one subject area,

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.510
they've created a useful data
set that can be kind of extracted

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.570
from this massive data in case
people maybe don't know what to do

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.920
with it because there's
so much of it.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.390
So the challenge's third
prize was also a tie.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:57.140
One third prize went to another
team, Kristi Palmer, Kaitlin Polick

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.650
and Ted Polly, for
Chronicling Hoosier.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.580
This site tracks the
origins of the word Hoosier,

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.130
it's geographic distribution,
and its positive

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.360 position:56%
and negative connotations over time.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.860
The project uses visualizations
that are all connected

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:11.980
with Chronicling America to
tell the story of the word,

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.390
which is not what you might expect.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.240
Additionally, they have documented
and made all of their code open,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.970
so that anyone inclined to do
so can apply it to another word

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.330
that they're interested in.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.770
The other third prize award went
to another team, Claudio Saunt

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.810
and Trevor Goodyear
for Usnewsmap.com.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.330
Saunt and Goodyear made a
really interesting point

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:33.740
when they're explaining
the origins of the project.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.920
So many people use Google
engrams viewer in order

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.010
to track public discourse
across the United States.

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:43.160
But books take time to write and
publish, and many times they come

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.460
out in multiple editions,
years apart,

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.200
potentially skewing the
results if you're looking

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.770
at what people were talking
about at any given time.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.030
Because of their quick
publication schedule,

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:54.060
newspapers capture the
public discourse better

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.700
than almost anything else.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:00.590
So this site is built on
the Chronicling America data

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.040
and allows users to
discover patterns

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.550 position:56%
and watch news go viral so to speak.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:09.280
For example, you can track terms
like miscegenation and scalawag

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.260
which quickly gained currency
in the 1860s in response

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.050
to the political situation.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:18.390
And finally, we awarded a K
through 12 educational prize,

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:22.070 position:56%
which this year went to teacher Ray
Palin and the AP US History students

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:25.460
at Sunapee High school in Sunapee
New Hampshire, for Digital APUSH,

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.130
revealing history with
Chronicling America.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.420
So this group of 15 students
used word frequency analysis,

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.520
which is a kind of distant
reading, according to them,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.010
to discover patterns
in news coverage.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.410 position:56%
They broke into teams and researched
issues that caught their interest.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:43.190
For example, the case Plessy
vs Ferguson, the words secede

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:47.130
and secession, Uncle Tom's
Cabin, the KKK, and labor unions.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.180
According to Palin, the project
was similar to the usual assignment

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.050
of writing a paper
in that students had

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.640
to identify an important
historical question and think

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.800
about ways to research the answer.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.180
Using data, however, allowed them
to learn a whole different set

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.210
of skills than writing
a research paper.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.680
So I realize I didn't have
much time to go into much depth

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.390
about these projects, but
only to provide teasers,

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:12.010
just to indicate the vast
array of subjects represented.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:15.100
I do think that this contest
holds several lessons for those

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.030
of us interested in
collections as data.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.030
First, know your collections.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.020
I've been interested in the
kinds of projects that could come

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.820
out of Chronicling America
since before working at NEH,

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.460
when as a historian, I used
the site for my own research

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.490
on civil liberties, religious
groups and free speech.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:33.040
Additionally, as a librarian, the
site is also important to me as one

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.420
of the only freely accessible
sources for historic news.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.790
The collection holds so many
possibilities as a data set

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:42.200
that it was good to see the
field respond to this challenge.

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.880
Many of the winners sheepishly
told us that they were happy

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.250
about the contest because it
gave them a deadline to a project

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.660
that they had been intending
to do for a long time.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.610
It may not be possible always
to hold a contest like this,

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.560
but it might be something
to think about if you want

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.400
to gather a critical mass of
people working on your collection

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.830
and stir up excitement about it.

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:02.930 position:56%
I want to call attention to how many
team projects we had here as well.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:06.550
And I think that it's
important to remember that a lot

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.640
of times we have people
working together outside

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.760
of traditional academic department
and crossing departmental lines

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.720
and we should encourage
this in any way that we can.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.070
I think that the high school
teacher Mr. Palin pointed

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.770 position:56%
out that academic value of these
projects extends well beyond second,

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.960
what he pointed out extends
well beyond the lessons

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.710
in secondary school
that he is teaching.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:29.020
This intellectual work really
involves, as he pointed out,

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.420
similar question identifying
to any sort of research

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.630
and should be valued in the
academic community no matter what

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:36.930
you're doing.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.030
And finally, I think this
contest points to the importance

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:41.990
with any collection
of maintaining contact

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:43.570
with the communities
using the product.

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.720
Not just putting the data
out there, but really trying

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.740
to understand how people are
inclined to use the collection,

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.090
and learning from them
at the same time

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:55.310 position:56%
that they learn from the collection.

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:59.560 position:56%
Thank you very much, and we're happy
to answer any questions, you know,

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.510
during the course of the meeting.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:14.560
[ Applause ]

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
