00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.401
(pages turning)

00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.404
(somber piano music)

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.957
(woman groans)

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:24.791
- My bad.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.594
- Here, you take--

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.428
- Yeah.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.997
(men grunting)

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.135
(woman wails)

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.469
- Let me cut to the meat here.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.104
I think you know
why we came over.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.940
There seems to be a
little discrepancy

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.942
in the way we've been
interpreting the books.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.144
- Listen, it's okay.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.678 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, I've been
reading books for years,

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.081
and sometimes I still
read a book wrong.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.582 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Well I think it's
clear that When Love Dies

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.117
is a nonfiction self-help book.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.852
- I think it's clear that
you have brain problems!

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.722 align:start size:88% position:13%
- As a group, we're just
trying to figure out

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.324
what the mystery of
books is, you know?

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:02.429 align:start size:97% position:3%
What they all mean, learning
the patterns and stuff.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start size:88% position:13%
(woman cries)
(foreboding drum beats)

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.769 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh my god, you're
so depressed.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.673
I, for one, am not gonna let
this minor tragedy ruin my day.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:15.208
I'm just not.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.544
Cuz I'm too strong for that.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.747
- I know how to fix you.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.649
Turn on the car lights.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.022
How's everyone doing tonight?

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.557 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He's doing shtick.
- Classic!

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.760
- What do you call it when
Sabrina the Teenage Witch

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.861
makes a stink?

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:35.695
- I don't know, what?

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:36.963
What?

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.631
- Melissa Joan Fart.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.335 align:start size:72% position:28%
(laughter)
(woman crying)

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:46.439
What do you call it when
Mel Gibson makes a stink

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.041
at the Jew Oscars?

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.276
- But uh, but, Gib, Gibson.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.612
Mel Gibson, um...

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.848
- Brave Fart.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.082
(laughter)

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.283
- That's so much better!

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.585
- Thank you very much.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.819
- No way!

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.287 align:start size:81% position:19%
(raucous laughter)
(woman crying)

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.090
- I mean ching chong bing
bong but take a break.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.492
- Oh, that was good.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.326
That's good.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.594
- I want you to scream.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.862
- Why?

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.163
- Personally, I was
a little taken aback

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.031
by you storming off
in a cloud of anger

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.366
from our book club.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.300
- I'm not angry.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.869
- (chuckles) Yes, you are.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:16.703
- No I'm not.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:17.537
- Scream.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.371
- Uh-Uh.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.205
(laughter)

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.039
I'm not angry.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.874
- Sure you are.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:21.975
- No I'm not!

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.411
- How do you feel?

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.312
- A little bit better.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.648
(screaming)

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.653
- Who do we got in the
backseat tonight, huh?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:34.821
- Uh oh.
- It's you!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh no, oh no!
- It's you, it's you!

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.691
- Hey buddy friend, where'd you
get your hair gel from, huh?

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.427
The fry basket out
of the french fries?

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.530
(laughter)

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.031
But seriously,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.866 align:start size:94% position:6%
who's this fat piece of
shit in the backseat, huh?

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.268
- Me, he's doing
me, he's doing me!

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.703 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Lose some weight
and be a human.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.805
(laughter)

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.007
- More, more!

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.842
- You are clinically retarded.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.878 align:start size:94% position:6%
You need to wear a helmet
and shut the fuck up.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.014
(laughter)

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.682
Paul Fart Mall Fart.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.685
(screaming)

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.488
(ominous drum beats)

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.322
- Sweetie.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.457
- Sweetie.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.592
- Is everything okay?

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.827
- I'm sorry, I think so, baby.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.729
- Well could you
just keep it down?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
Cuz I'm actually Skyping
with Hillary Clinton.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.066
- So are we.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.467 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well if you wouldn't
mind taking a break

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.403
from that boring ass shit,

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.371
I'd like to invite the
two of you to a funeral

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.773
for my child-dog.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.476
- I'd kinda like
to get in on that.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.411
Tremendous?

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.747
- We should get going.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.617
Don't want to miss out
on that funeral fun.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.086
(people cheering)

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.689
(tribal music)
