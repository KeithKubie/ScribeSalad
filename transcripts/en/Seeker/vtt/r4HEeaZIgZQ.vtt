00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.169
There are billions upon billions of stars
in our galaxy, but they’re all so far away.

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.690
Because of that, we’ve had to extrapolate
pretty much everything we know about stars

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.530
from our nearest star, the sun.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.260
At just about 93 million miles from Earth,
the sun is a stone’s throw away compared

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.620
to the next closest star.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.750
But despite our relative proximity, we still
have some burning questions about the object

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.560
that’s holding this whole 8 ring solar circus
together.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.850
So NASA decided we’re going to walk right
up to the sun and rub our nose in it.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.410
In 2018, NASA will launch a solar probe that
will travel closer to the sun than any spacecraft

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.410
before it.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.430
At it’s closest point, the probe will be
within just 3.9 million miles of the sun,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.550
almost seven times closer than the next closest
mission, Helios 2 from 1976.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.180
The probe will swoop through the sun’s corona,
which is the aura of plasma around the sun

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.120
visible during a solar eclipse, not the adult
beverage.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.050
It’s able to get within sniffing distance
because of advances in material technology.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.450
The probe’s carbon composite heat shield
will keep the instruments behind it operating

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.100
at almost room temperature, even though it’s
taking a beating from the sun’s heat and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
radiation.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.030
It’ll withstand temperatures of 2,500 degrees
fahrenheit and light 570 times more intense

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.490
than what we see on Earth.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.640
The goal is to solve some baffling questions
about the sun, like why does the solar wind

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390
accelerate, and how can the corona be so hot?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.880
Yes I know, the corona is hot because it’s
near the sun, but it can reach up to over

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.600
3 million degrees F, while the sun’s surface
peaks at “only” about eleven thousand.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.159
That weird quirk has stumped astronomers,
but after this seven year mission, they may

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.450
finally have an answer.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.939
The knowledge gained on this trip could also
improve our ability to predict solar weather

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.189
which would help us better protect satellites,
power grids and future space missions from

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.000
destructive solar events.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.820
This probe is not only hot, but a little heartwarming.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.730
NASA announced at their press conference that
the probe has been named the Parker Solar

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.020
Probe, after astrophysicist Eugene Parker.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.479
There have been a handful of spacecraft named
after important figures in the past, but at

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.000
just shy of 90 years old, Parker is the only
one who has lived to see a mission bear his

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
name.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.689
Parker’s 1958 paper on solar wind challenged
the conventional wisdom of the time and was

00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.920
initially rejected.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.240
But it turned out his predictions for the
solar wind’s speed and temperature were

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.810
almost exactly right.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.369
NASA’s saying that thanks to Parker’s
influence in the field of heliophysics we’re

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.849
finally going to touch the sun.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.480
Funny, you’d think for all the clever people
at NASA like Parker, they would have realized

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.370
they could save themselves a lot of trouble
and just launch a probe to the sun at night.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.529
If you like our NASA updates, don’t miss
this one where they announced Saturn’s moon

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.550
Enceladus might have everything necessary
for extraterrestrial life!

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.069
Are you hyped for the Parker Space Probe or
are you looking forward to another mission?
