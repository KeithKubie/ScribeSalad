00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.010
<v 1>You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio,</v>

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.070
W Y C o n n p.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.913
R.

10
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.763
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.390
<v 1>This is Radiolab on Jab and Rod. Today we're in a Dr Frankston sorta mood,</v>

12
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.070
so we figure we're better to start dusk tests at the museum.

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.100
American Museum of Natural History where they have on it kind of frankensteining

14
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.150
exit. Okay. I'm Laurel Candle.

15
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:05.290
I curate the American Museum of Natural History as exhibit mythic creatures

16
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.870
where we lit and when you look more closely you realize that they're all mashups

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.700
from the natural world. For example,

18
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.240
she takes us over to one corner points at a class case we're inside.

19
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.020
What you're seeing is this creepy little hybrid skeleton thing.

20
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:24.100
Look at this space and see how it really is a composite.

21
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.160
Half of it is a monkey, the upper half monkey skull,

22
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.090
and the lower half is a fish tail, like some kind of trout with some scales,

23
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.630
places full of stuff like this. A lion with an eagle head.

24
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:39.130
Humans with snake tails. Just about anything you can imagine. Very operatic. Oh,

25
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.780
and I forgot to mention the most important part.

26
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.610
<v 1>Tons and tons of kids completely in awe. Oh my God. Uniform.</v>

28
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.280
Oh, why are we standing under here?

29
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.730
The Pegasus? Can you describe what we're seeing here? It's a horse.

30
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.690
The body's like a horse. It has these really big wings, wings like birds,

31
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.510
like an eagle. Maybe. Somehow his parents were a horse and a bird in there.

32
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.080
Their jeans for him together too, might make the Pegasus.

33
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.700
What I see, like what I see,

34
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.720
it just looks like exciting that it just looks really cool.

35
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.870
And when you ask these kids, is there a producer? Literally Miller did.

36
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:24.950
Why is it cool? Like why is it fun to see two animals mashed together?

37
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.690
Will they just look at you like you're dumb? So ours will ring.

38
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.510
Birds have wings. Yes. Um, birds.

39
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.270
They're not mythical.

40
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.600
They're like the regular every day you see them,

41
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.440
every time you just see a pigeon you let go, whatever. Maybe it's that simple.

42
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.150
Yeah. Any case, the kids,

43
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.680
their sick of us and our dumb questions ran off to this kiosk at the museum.

44
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.860
It's set up around the corner over right here where they could actually build

45
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.890
their own creatures. Okay. Now can you describe your guy here?

46
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.880
He has seven heads and yes,

47
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.240
tail with fire on it for a leg and he has a long body and the thing is kind of

48
00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:07.184
like

49
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.170
<v 3>you can't help but wonder if these same kids in about 30 or 40 years might</v>

50
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.990
actually be able to do this for real.

51
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.950
<v 4>When that grown up,</v>

52
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.190
those kids will be at home in the new world of biotechnology.

53
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.280
They won't be ready to put their skills to use.

54
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.290
That will be do it yourself kits to breed new varieties of pigeons and parrots

55
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.520
and lizards and snakes and buy like a snake and then like a bird.

56
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.260
Oh can I do it? Cause I never got to do that.

57
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.240
Genetic engineering once it gets into the hands of housewives and children will

58
00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:41.390
give us an explosion of diversity of new living creatures.

59
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.450
<v 3>That is physicists, Freeman Dyson. We'll hear more from him later now,</v>

60
00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:46.910
whether it's true or not, what he's saying,

61
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.570
it does seem to be the case that we are at this pivotal point now where the

62
00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:55.540
stuff that we used to only have imagine might actually turn into reality,

63
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.020
which is why maybe you get an exhibit of fantasy creatures at the Museum of

64
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.620
natural history. This is

65
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.390
<v 5>abrasion of the human imagination. Human, yes.</v>

66
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.160
<v 3>Living creatures. That is physicists, Freeman Dyson.</v>

67
00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:13.700
We'll hear more from him later now, whether it's true or not, what he's saying,

68
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.420
it does seem to be the case that we are at this pivotal point now where the

69
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:22.390
stuff that we used to only have imagine might actually turn into reality,

70
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
which is why maybe you get an exhibit of fantasy creatures at the Museum of

71
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.660
natural history. This is syllabus

72
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.630
<v 5>abrasion of the human imagination, human ingenuity, human art.</v>

73
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.920
<v 2>[inaudible] I know what it been like to be gone.</v>

74
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.013
[inaudible]

75
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.150
<v 1>that word you, you mentioned, um, natural. Yeah. That one natural.</v>

76
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.810
What does it mean exactly? Let's just take, usually means what it means,

77
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:06.930
what's familiar, but we know what we know. Let's say,

78
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.720
let's just muck that up a bit because it turns out when you look in nature,

79
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:14.670
you will find things that are frankly very strange and not familiar. Like,

80
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.080
well, let me tell you a story.

81
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:19.890
It's an amazing story about a woman heard about it from a reporter,

82
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.600
Soren Wheeler. Hi Soren. Right. Hey, it's a Soren. Tell me about Karen. Well,

83
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.090
Karen is a mother of three,

84
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:31.970
a middle aged woman living outside of Boston and the suburbs of Boston. And uh,

85
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.350
she lives there with her husband, Pete. The kids are out of the house now.

86
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.090
Tell me what you were thinking when you walked up to her door. Well, I,

87
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.270
I was nervous. I was kind of strangely nervous about meeting her.

88
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.460
Hi Karen. Hi. But I got there and she was friendly as can be,

89
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.780
bring in a couple cups of tea. She made me tea,

90
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:56.700
we sat in the living room and talk and uh, she was just normal,

91
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.100
which it's

92
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.590
<v 6>kind of weird given the story that she was about to tell me.</v>

93
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.870
So let's start at the very beginning. Oh,

94
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.740
well in 1995,

95
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.690
I was told that I needed a kidney transplant immediately.

96
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.190
What's that like? Like what are you going through? It was frightening.

97
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.250
The doctors told Karen they needed to act fast.

98
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.300
They asked me who in my family might be willing to donate a kidney.

99
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.540
The two older boys, that's Matt and Jess and Karen's husband Pete,

100
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.340
you all went in to get what should have been a pretty routine DNA test. Yep.

101
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.690
They had the blood work done and they waited.

102
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.780
A couple of weeks later I got a phone call from the hospital and they said,

103
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.470
Mrs Keegan, um,

104
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.020
this is a very unusual situation that we're going to explain to you.

105
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.700
Uh, it's something that we've never seen before.

106
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.400
But uh,

107
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.000
when the DNA testing was done on your sons,

108
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.190
we found that they didn't match your DNA.

109
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.200
Is that how they said it? They said they match the father,

110
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.940
but they're not a match for you. What does that mean? They didn't match her DNA.

111
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.170
She's not their mother. Oh, ready?

112
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:25.040
Much hearing this was crazy. Yeah. She told them, well, I was there.

113
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:29.120
This could not possibly be these kids. I felt the pain. You know,

114
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.120
you better do the test again because you're obviously wrong.

115
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.750
And so they did do the test again. Same result. The Reid was correct.

116
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.270
There was not a laboratory error. This is one of her doctors. When you, we,

117
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.080
we felt particularly after the second time that it was real.

118
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:46.700
And then they said,

119
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.880
now we have had situations where the husband's DNA didn't match,

120
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.200
but we've never had a mother whose DNA didn't match their children.

121
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.590
So wait, if the DNA is saying she's not the mom,

122
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.520
then what would explain that first thought was that there was some kind of mix

123
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:06.960
up,

124
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.960
some sweatshirt babies or something like a baby switch right after birth kind of

125
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.640
thing. Yeah. But the problem with that is that the dad is the dad.

126
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.840
Those are the father's, right.

127
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.980
So you have to figure it like how could they have gotten the wrong kid,

128
00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:23.860
but the right dad says, then what if, if that's the case,

129
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.730
here's the thing at this, at this point, further involved with this.

130
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.420
People are thinking maybe Karen's done something kind of fishing.

131
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.630
There must be something that you're not being told.

132
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:39.631
Like maybe she implanted her womb with another woman's baby and then she just

133
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:44.140
kind of lied about it. Yeah. That she lied about it. They said, well,

134
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.550
could you tell us what hospital you had these children in? How exactly, how,

135
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:49.300
what, what would,

136
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.930
I'm still confused as being accused of being some kind of monster.

137
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.790
Maybe wish they had children or stolen a child or something.

138
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:05.530
Had to be, because obviously DNA is never it wrong. It's never wrong.

139
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.610
Wow.

140
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.640
So how does she talk to her family about this and what are those conversations

141
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:10.180
like?

142
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.180
I do remember some very sort of sad moments with my sons.

143
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.480
Yeah. You know, I told them,

144
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.840
I don't think they maybe even completely realized what I was saying when Karen's

145
00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:33.880
doctor couldn't get this out of her head. Something wasn't adding up.

146
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.990
Didn't make sense.

147
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.350
So she thought about the fact that they'd done all of the tests on Karen's

148
00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:39.760
blood, only in our blood cells.

149
00:09:39.761 --> 00:09:43.060
So Lynn started thinking maybe the next step they ought to look at some other

150
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:47.840
parts. And to do that we would need to test other tissues,

151
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.260
scraped the inside of your mouth and get a little saliva and maybe a hair or to

152
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.740
thyroid ladder and a skin biopsy with you're getting all sorts of parts.

153
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.530
You're getting along all parts and all kinds of parts from me.

154
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.160
That's when things started to get strange.

155
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:08.630
When we got the results of the tissue studies, we identified two,

156
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.760
two to two sets of DNA to people to to what?

157
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.290
Another person in Karen,

158
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.580
she had another person inside her. Well sort of.

159
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.470
She did have a separate set of DNA.

160
00:10:23.471 --> 00:10:27.850
So it was like she had another person with its own genetic identity in her body.

161
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.453
Oh,

162
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.060
and the thing is that that other person that was the mother of the boys,

163
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.010
well how did we get there? That, I mean that's what the doctors were wondering.

164
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.090
So they all sit down,

165
00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:43.120
put their heads together and try to figure it out and then it hit them.

166
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.230
You were a twin, you are a twin. She,

167
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.470
I mean she had a twin. No, she's both twins.

168
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.560
Here's what happened in Karen's mother's womb.

169
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.790
Originally there were two eggs, two fertilized eggs,

170
00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:02.791
twin girls side by side developing in their own separate sacks.

171
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.220
Then after a couple of days, something strange happens.

172
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.980
Somehow the two embryos bumped into each other

173
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.890
and they fused into one unit and that one became Karen.

174
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.410
Like a mixture of the two of them. Well, no, they,

175
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.570
they didn't blend according to Lynn.

176
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:22.300
What happened is they kind of claimed different parts of,

177
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.350
they still had their own, I want to say boundaries.

178
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.300
One twin claimed her blood and the other twin claimed her thyroid and her

179
00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:36.020
bladder and took Karen is a plural. Okay.

180
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:39.300
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

181
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.150
<v 6>hey is this, has this, has this happened before? Well,</v>

182
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.420
supposedly it's pretty rare, but it does happen. In fact, there's,

183
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.640
there's a scientific word for this condition.

184
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.970
Karen first heard that word from her doctor, Margot Cresco.

185
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.780
Margo [inaudible] came to my,

186
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.190
<v 8>explained that I was a Chi Kemira a term which I had never heard of.</v>

187
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.200
Did she? Did she come and say you're Kymera did? Yeah.

188
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.140
<v 6>Yes.</v>

189
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.140
Now that was interesting because I called my son the English major and said,

190
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:15.410
Matt, I've found out I was a Chi Mirah, and he said, oh, well,

191
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.010
you know what a Chi Mira is, don't you? And I said, no. And he said,

192
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.270
well,

193
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.020
<v 2>in the ancient Greek myths, I,</v>

194
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.140
Thai Mira is an animal that has like a lion,

195
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.240
has a donkey's cool a goat, Kale, you know,

196
00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:37.740
it's a mixture. A Greek missed the Camaro was a monster,

197
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.800
but the heroes opposed to slay.

198
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.690
That didn't make me feel very good.

199
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.310
<v 8>Then Karen learned more about what Kymera meant medically and what could've</v>

200
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.240
happened to her.

201
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.990
<v 6>If the eggs hadn't fused. Within four days,</v>

202
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.730
I would have become a Siamese twin.

203
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.040
When you hear that,

204
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:12.100
you immediately have a more concrete vision of two selves.

205
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.900
It brought home the reality that I really was a twin.

206
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.470
She is a twin. One doctor said, do you think you have two souls?

207
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.620
I think of myself as the onion,

208
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.830
but there is almost a sort of subtle sadness to think that I would have had a

209
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.280
sister. Yeah.

210
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.590
And so there is sort of a shadow feeling of loss.

211
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.930
There could have been more

212
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.060
<v 9>thanks to reporter sewer and wheeler for that.</v>

213
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.370
Let's make things a little more disturbing now because human beings,

214
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.760
scientists are now capable of creating kindnesses purposefully.

215
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.840
Can we talk to Lee silver who was a scientist at Princeton elite. Okay. Lee,

216
00:14:17.841 --> 00:14:18.674
you have to say something.

217
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.120
<v 8>Okay. You know my left ear is receiving more than my right. Is there a,</v>

218
00:14:23.121 --> 00:14:26.400
when he told us about an intentional Kymera,

219
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.890
a creature created by a Danish embryologist named steam will ITSM,

220
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.200
he took a goat embryo and a sheep embryo and he pushed them together in his

221
00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:40.310
petri dish.

222
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.570
But that mixture of embryo back into a female,

223
00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:45.830
I don't remember which species.

224
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.030
And then what was born was an animal that was part goat, part sheep,

225
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.520
and he called that a jeep.

226
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.590
Was it visibly kind of Godi and kind of sheepy? Well it was actually, yes,

227
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:01.520
it was very visible. And what happened because of the way development occurs,

228
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.010
parts of its body looks, sheep like and parts of its body look goat.

229
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.970
Like which parts? Well,

230
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.930
and he did this multiple times and so he actually got multiple gifts and

231
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.720
sometimes the animal would have a goat head,

232
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.720
but then parts of its body would be sheep, like with wool.

233
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.290
Other Times would have a sheet pan. How confusing it would be at the wipe dance.

234
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.080
You would know like who was supposed of dance with home could,

235
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.190
could keeps relate with one another in that way.

236
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.840
I don't remember the father.

237
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.880
You may look for that little beard and everything in the hooves

238
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.921
<v 3>mean just to give you a visual.</v>

239
00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:41.760
We've got a picture here of three jeeps hanging out near a tree.

240
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.060
Do you want to describe it? Well, the Geek,

241
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.360
one of them looks like a naked animal wearing the coat of shaggy hair does.

242
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.840
It's got this streak of sheep wool running on its back,

243
00:15:54.841 --> 00:15:58.680
but the rest of it looks kind of Godi. Which deal do you find a cute?

244
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.160
I kind of do find it cute. Well, but now let's uncurated a bit.

245
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.270
Suppose instead of talking about mixing sheep with goats, okay,

246
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:11.190
since you're not a sheep or a goat, let's make it more personal.

247
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:12.860
Um,

248
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.860
<v 8>people are most worried about combining human embryonic cells and monkey or</v>

249
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:21.410
chimp embryonic cells.

250
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.120
And so the idea is if you took a chimp embryo in a human embryo and you push

251
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:29.090
them together based on the Geek results,

252
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:32.270
based on lots of other data that scientists have accumulated,

253
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.160
it's very likely that you'd have an organism born that was part chimp,

254
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.950
part human will there once was a creature like that.

255
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:41.780
Because if you believe in evolution,

256
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.970
<v 10>you believe that chimps eventually became humans.</v>

257
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.300
So somewhere in history there is someone who is 10% chimp and 90% [inaudible].

258
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.980
<v 8>And that common ancestor evolved continuously and slowly from a chimp like,</v>

259
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.240
um, individual to human. And in every point along the 100,000 generations,

260
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.420
the children didn't look very different from their parents.

261
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.100
<v 10>The, here's the, here's the very sad Hollywood movie.</v>

262
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.450
I go and I go and I create a creature,

263
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.350
a deep like, you know, amalgamation,

264
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.040
which is 50% chimpanzee ape.

265
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:27.070
And 50% human homosapians and he's the only one that's like creating a tragedy.

266
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:34.550
It seems like because you'd be creating someone who is isolated in his

267
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.350
physiology.

268
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.590
<v 8>Yes. I mean this could breed with him or maybe they could, but, well,</v>

269
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:44.340
I'm going to this cost. You're taping this opening something.

270
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.930
I'm opening something. This is actually a play here. Look,

271
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.180
<v 10>look at this. It's going to be performed next week. Sweet. Sweet Motherhood,</v>

272
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:55.110
isn't it? That's it.

273
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.090
So this is a play at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.

274
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.280
Shelly McGahn wants a baby, a human chimpanzee baby.

275
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.880
Oh.

276
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.260
Shelly's been spending too much time partying to build up a respectable grade

277
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:13.830
point average. So she proposes the following senior thesis,

278
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:18.780
fertilize one of her eggs with the sperm from a chimpanzee in her womb.

279
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.390
It's an interesting term paper.

280
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.590
So professor Harry Stein must do everything he can to stop her.

281
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.050
The play is inspired by a true event.

282
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.600
<v 8>Really? This is your play. Yes.</v>

283
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.470
Jeremy character is the main playwright and I had collaborated with him.

284
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.370
What is the true of, I want to, this is base. The true event is that a,

285
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.370
about 10, 12 years ago now,

286
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.730
I was talking to my usual flippant way to a bunch of students and a sequence

287
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:53.560
information had just come out showing that chimps and humans were almost 90% the

288
00:18:53.561 --> 00:18:58.150
same at the DNA level. And so I just threw out the idea, well,

289
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.750
based on what we know about goats and sheep and everything else,

290
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.120
you probably could have a hybrid developed between a chimpanzee and human being.

291
00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:10.270
It was a thought experiment. What would it be? How would it developed?

292
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.480
Which of its characteristics would be human, which would be chimpanzee?

293
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.150
The next day a student,

294
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.300
a junior came to my office and said she wanted to do the experiment inside her

295
00:19:22.001 --> 00:19:26.980
own womb. Ah, and uh, so then yes, uh,

296
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.290
in real life, what did you do?

297
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.140
He hit her on the head with a baseball bat or why? No, I had a long,

298
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.970
I was flabbergasted.

299
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.830
She was absolutely serious because it's actually true. She, she was,

300
00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:41.620
this student partied a lot and she needed,

301
00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:46.030
and the senior thesis at Princeton counts enormous amount in towards your final

302
00:19:46.031 --> 00:19:49.930
GPA. So, uh, she wanted to do this unique experiment,

303
00:19:49.931 --> 00:19:54.310
hoping she'd get an a plus in her senior thesis. She was very naive obviously.

304
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.750
That was the last time I saw this little chimpanzee up for adoption as soon as

305
00:19:58.751 --> 00:20:02.620
it was born. Well, no, no where she, she, I asked her,

306
00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:06.550
what would you do with this individual? I said, well, if it's a human being,

307
00:20:06.551 --> 00:20:09.100
you have to raise it like a human being and as rights, like human being.

308
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.470
If it's a chimpanzee, you put her in a zoo or you use it,

309
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.890
use it for experiments and what's it going to be?

310
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.020
And her answer to that question was she would have bought right before,

311
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.170
um, it came time to go into labor sheet, a board.

312
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.200
And so the whole idea of the senior thesis was to study the development of this

313
00:20:28.451 --> 00:20:33.220
hybrid inside of her womb. She really wanted to do this for real,

314
00:20:33.221 --> 00:20:37.000
not just on paper for a project, but actually she herself. Yes.

315
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.790
Now there are many, many, many,

316
00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:44.410
many problems to do, meaning liberal arts education,

317
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.930
liberal here. And we talked for an hour. Um, I dissuaded her.

318
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.880
I never saw her again,

319
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.200
<v 10>except in a way in his play, the, when he coat road.</v>

320
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:59.860
This is the play about the teacher at the fancy university happens just to be

321
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.050
teaching theology class.

322
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.570
The human ovary within the masters body happens to have this notion about what

323
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:08.280
would it be like if chimps and humans had babies together. Actually in a number,

324
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.100
I am more similar to a MailChimp than I am to my sister,

325
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:17.110
happens to have in the play a student who comes up after class and says,

326
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.890
combine one of my eggs with chimpanzees want you to donate except by the way in

327
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:25.414
the play

328
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.050
<v 8>she actually goes through with it.</v>

329
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.740
<v 10>Hi Craig, this.</v>

330
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.561
<v 8>But you know, he,</v>

331
00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:33.430
he wrote the play to keep a conversation going that wouldn't get out of his

332
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.850
hand. And the question is what is a human being? Um,

333
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:38.590
if you look at a developmentally,

334
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:41.170
evolutionarily through these hybrids and tiny areas,

335
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.000
where's the boundary between human being and non human being?

336
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.020
And at the end of my, uh, quest,

337
00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.250
I personally concluded that there is no boundary. No, no, no, no.

338
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.640
It's fuzzy. So in other words, if you look at,

339
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.670
the analogy I like to give is look at the color spectrum between green and blue.

340
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.180
When you go from green to blue along the color spectrum,

341
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.690
it's a continuous gradual change from one to the other.

342
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.140
There's no point in which you say, here's the boundary between green and blue,

343
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.680
and if you take that analogy, which I did, two human beings,

344
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:21.370
you say during development or in evolution in the,

345
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.370
in terms of a Kemira, there's no boundary,

346
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:29.490
but the social effect of having staked out that position is that you aren't

347
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:36.121
going to defend our species against all kinds of amendments.

348
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.090
There is a consequence to this kind of thinking, right? I mean,

349
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.170
you can't do it cold porter, anything goes, can you know? No,

350
00:22:44.171 --> 00:22:47.620
I don't believe you can do anything goes. My purpose is to say,

351
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:48.820
not that anything goes,

352
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.860
but that in theory all these outrageous things could happen and actually are

353
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:55.600
happening. Here's an example.

354
00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.070
Since 1980 scientists have been taking human genes,

355
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.190
genetic information, putting it into mice.

356
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:08.191
I mean this is sort of a routine procedure and for people who do mouse molecular

357
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:08.830
genetics,

358
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.010
and in fact the really exciting thing that people are doing now is they're

359
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:17.011
making cows that are engineered to produce human blood.

360
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.710
And the idea is that you want to change all the genes in the cow that normally

361
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.910
produced the proteins in cow blood.

362
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:28.930
You want to make them all human so you'd have a cow making human blood.

363
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.640
I don't think most people would mind that.

364
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.520
And then you could use it for blood transfusions. Wow.

365
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.840
Could you make a cow with human blood and a human kidney so that you could use

366
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:40.030
that too? Well, actually a met, they've uh,

367
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.060
Israeli scientists have already created a mouse that has a tiny little

368
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:48.830
functioning human kidney get out. Yeah,

369
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.920
I can show you the picture. Yeah. So I mean,

370
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:54.410
and you know when there are other people who are working with sheep and trying

371
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:56.370
to make human livers and side sheep and,

372
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.210
and the whole ideas is regenerative medicine.

373
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.200
You sacrifice the animals to get a new kidney for you. Now.

374
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:07.670
I actually think that as long as you don't play with the external features,

375
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.310
I think society will accept it. I mean, you know,

376
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:12.890
people eat pigs and if you can eat a pig,

377
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:16.100
why not grow a pig to have a human liver or kidney or heart?

378
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.350
As long as it still looks like a pig. He said, that's right.

379
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.550
As long as it still looks like a pig and it still behaves like a pig. You know,

380
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:25.550
if you put a human arm onto a pig, I don't think people would like that.

381
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.430
But you acknowledged that the distinctions you're drawing are emotional

382
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:31.370
distinctions and not rational. Absolutely. There are emotional,

383
00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:35.840
and I'm saying that sometimes emotional distinctions matter. I mean,

384
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:38.240
I have no solutions. I mean, I don't know where to draw lines.

385
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:39.620
Society has the draw lines.
