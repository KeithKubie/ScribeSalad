the ability to do remote diagnostics but
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340
the ability to do remote diagnostics but
also critically I think in terms of the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
also critically I think in terms of the
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959
also critically I think in terms of the
digital enablement of people and whether

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
digital enablement of people and whether
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760
digital enablement of people and whether
that young people here today are very

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
that young people here today are very
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090
that young people here today are very
good with apparent pcs and Internet but

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
good with apparent pcs and Internet but
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039
good with apparent pcs and Internet but
also increasingly with aging populations

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
also increasingly with aging populations
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.080
also increasingly with aging populations
particularly the West the importance of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
particularly the West the importance of
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820
particularly the West the importance of
being able to make them more digitally

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
being able to make them more digitally
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.950
being able to make them more digitally
literate enables them to be able to work

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
literate enables them to be able to work
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070
literate enables them to be able to work
longer and be able to have I think more

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
longer and be able to have I think more
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560
longer and be able to have I think more
productive life so for me technology is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
productive life so for me technology is
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870
productive life so for me technology is
just a fundamentally neighbor he creates

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
just a fundamentally neighbor he creates
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330
just a fundamentally neighbor he creates
great opportunities for us and again you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
great opportunities for us and again you
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.530
great opportunities for us and again you
just have to look at everything from

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
just have to look at everything from
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899
just have to look at everything from
things like rural banking where we no

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
things like rural banking where we no
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.140
things like rural banking where we no
longer need I'm actually banks in the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
longer need I'm actually banks in the
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760
longer need I'm actually banks in the
physical locations but the chickens are

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
physical locations but the chickens are
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.830
physical locations but the chickens are
all transactions through the internet

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
all transactions through the internet
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020
all transactions through the internet
these are just huge new opportunities

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
these are just huge new opportunities
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.190
these are just huge new opportunities
which will create massive job

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
which will create massive job
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530
which will create massive job
opportunities I think both in the west

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
opportunities I think both in the west
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.390
opportunities I think both in the west
where a lot of the technologies are

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
where a lot of the technologies are
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310
where a lot of the technologies are
developed but also critically in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
developed but also critically in
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380
developed but also critically in
emerging markets where these new

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
emerging markets where these new
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.819
emerging markets where these new
technologies will create new business

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
technologies will create new business
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.410
technologies will create new business
models so I'm very bullish and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
models so I'm very bullish and
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510
models so I'm very bullish and
optimistic about technology I hope that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
optimistic about technology I hope that
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.679
optimistic about technology I hope that
gives you a little bit more confidence

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
gives you a little bit more confidence
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270
gives you a little bit more confidence
that technology can be your friend and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
that technology can be your friend and
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.300
that technology can be your friend and
not necessarily your enemy and above all

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
not necessarily your enemy and above all
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.509
not necessarily your enemy and above all
thanks very much for listening
