whole city and it's freakish it takes

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
whole city and it's freakish it takes
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.370

of nay tens of thousands of street names
and they can do it by like dead

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
and they can do it by like dead
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.950
and they can do it by like dead
reckoning they scan this was a paper

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960
reckoning they scan this was a paper
 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.480
reckoning they scan this was a paper
about ten years ago they brain scan

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490
about ten years ago they brain scan
 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.700
about ten years ago they brain scan
these guys and they had I forgot which

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710
these guys and they had I forgot which
 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.830
these guys and they had I forgot which
region of the brain but they had through

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840
region of the brain but they had through
 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.950
region of the brain but they had through
learning it has felt modify that region

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960
learning it has felt modify that region
 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.390
learning it has felt modify that region
of their brain mmm so it's possible

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400
of their brain mmm so it's possible
 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.480

to be this way that his amygdala isn't
 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.500
to be this way that his amygdala isn't
firing because he trained himself but I
