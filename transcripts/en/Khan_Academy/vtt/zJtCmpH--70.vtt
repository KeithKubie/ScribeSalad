00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.930
- [Instructor] What I have drawn here,

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.570
is a mass sitting on
a frictionless surface

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.350
that is attached to a spring
that is attached to the wall,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.650
and what we're going to do is

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.960
we're going to compress the spring.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.310
We're going to get the mass to position A.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.030
Right now it's at position zero.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.180
We're going to get it to position A.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.100
And then at time equals
zero, we are going to let go.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.040
And so you can imagine
what's going to happen,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.420
especially with this mass
on a frictionless surface.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.570
It's going to oscillate between position A

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.270
and position negative A,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.530
and we have that depicted right here

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.290
on this position versus time graph.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.250
It'll start at position A,
and then it will oscillate

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.130
to the left to position negative A

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.940
and then oscillate to the
right to position A again,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.690
on and on and on forever,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.580
if we're dealing with a
world that is frictionless.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.560
Like I said, frictionless surface,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.700
and let's also assume no air resistance.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.800
So that is all very interesting,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.390
but what we want to think
about in this video is

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.430
how that might relate to energy.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.240
So given the information
that I've just given you,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.820
let's start thinking about
elastic potential energy.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.030
Remember, at time equals zero,
the box is at position A,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.580
so our spring is compressed.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.490
And we're dealing with
a box-spring system,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.660
so the combined system of
the box and the spring.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.890
And we're going to assume
that there is no added energy

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.910
that's added to or taken
away from this system.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.050
So right at time zero, when
we have the spring compressed,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.020
that box-spring system is gonna have

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.620
some elastic potential energy.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.640
And so let's put that right over there.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.810
And then what's going to
happen when we let go?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.890
Well, the box is going to be pushed

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010
by the spring towards the left.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.800
Actually, is going to be
accelerated to the left.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.460
And right when the box crosses
the x position of zero,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.380
which we see happens at
time equals one second,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.290
all of our potential energy

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.960
is going to be converted
to kinetic energy.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.460
And so our potential energy is
going to be right over here.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.430
And then what happens is the box

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.550
starts getting decelerated by the spring,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.180
and it gets to position negative A.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.470
Well, at position negative A,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.260
which we see happens at
time equals two seconds,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.810
well, then we are back to having

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.090
our maximum potential energy again.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.770
So we're back to having our
maximum potential energy

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.880
at time equals two seconds,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.240
with is associated with
being at position negative A.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.210
And so you can see where this is going.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.100
At three seconds, all of that
potential energy is back,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.320
converted to kinetic energy.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.850
At four seconds, we
are back at position A.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.700
It's back into potential energy again.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.820
And so the graph of our
elastic potential energy

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.900
is going to look something like this.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.210
It's going to look something like,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.100
this is a hand-drawn version
of it, but you, I think,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.800
get the general idea of
what's going on here.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.133
Notice it is not getting negative,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.170
and so it would look something like that.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.680
Now what about kinetic energy?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.710
Well, I've already made
some reference to it,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.640
but let's think about how
that would trend over time.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.880
At time equal zero, when
the box is at position A,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.160
right at that moment,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.840
we aren't going to have any
kinetic energy just yet.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.850
But then the box is
going to be accelerated

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.790
as that potential energy is
turned into kinetic energy,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.100
and we are our maximum kinetic energy

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.180
when the box crosses position zero.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.630
Well, the first time it
crosses position zero

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.780
is at time equals one second.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.460
So we have our maximum kinetic
energy right over there.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.320
And then when we get to time equals two,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.400
our box is at position negative A.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.380
We no longer, for a moment,
we won't have any velocity,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.020
and our kinetic energy is gone.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.120
And so you can see how this is going.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.450
We keep switching between
potential and kinetic energy

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.450
as the box keeps oscillating
between position A and

00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.200
position negative A.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.460
Once again, this is my
hand-drawn depiction of it.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.280
So that is our kinetic energy.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.670
Now, when we first introduced
ourselves to energy

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.040
and the law of conservation of energy,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.960
we saw that, hey, look if
we are in a closed system

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.940
and there are no dissipative forces

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.300
and we're not adding energy

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.820
or taking away energy
from that closed system

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.550
and if we're just dealing with
mechanical energy and this,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.130
and non-dissipative forces,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.180
well, then mechanical
energy should be conserved.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.880
If we say that the total
mechanical energy of the system E

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.760
is equal to our potential energy,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.720
which, in this case, is all
elastic potential energy,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.710
plus our kinetic energy,
this should be constant.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.420
And it is indeed the case.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.730
If, at any point in time,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.950
you were to add these two curves up,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.000
you would get something
that looks like this.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.800
It would just be a constant line,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800
and that would be the graph

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.610
of our mechanical potential energy.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.860
Now, an interesting question is,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.030
what if we did have dissipative forces?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.760
What would things look like then?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.690
Well, if we had dissipative forces,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.020
say friction or air resistance,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.990
well, then the box might
start at position A,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.000
but then it wouldn't get
all the way to negative A.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.550
It might look something like this.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.940
It might start here,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.290
but it might not get all
the way to negative A.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.320
And then it would get
even not as far this time,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.920
and then it would get,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.780
and I'm trying to draw
it as best as I can,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.290
and then it would get
even not as far that time.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.020
And if we think about
it in terms of energy,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.230
the total mechanical
energy would decrease.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.500
Where is it going?

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.470
Well, it is being transformed
into thermal energy

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.980
by the dissipative forces of
friction and air resistance.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.460
So the total energy would decrease,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.320
and then this would define the
envelope for the oscillations

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.720
for the potential energy
and the kinetic energy.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.440
So, for example, the kinetic
energy in that situation

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.200
would look like this.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.580
It would look like,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.460
it would look like this,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.000
where the peaks are going
to be bounded by this total,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.490
by this total mechanical energy.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.840
So I will leave you there.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.270
Hopefully this gives you a sense

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.420
of how potential energy, kinetic energy,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.910
especially when you're dealing
with a spring-block system,

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.520
how they relate to each other,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.520
especially in relation to the
law of conservation of energy.
