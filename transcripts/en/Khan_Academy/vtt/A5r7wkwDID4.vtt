00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
I mentioned in the last video
that 99% of the aromatic

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.330
compounds that you'll see in a
chemistry or organic chemistry

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.240
class is either going to be
benzene or a molecule derived

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.490
from benzene.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.370
So what I want to do in this
video is just familiarize you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.350
with some of these molecules
and how to name them.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.810
So you know what you're
looking at.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.730
Or I guess so you could name
what you're looking at.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.440
So you've seen this
multiple times.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.850
Benzene just looks like this.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.300
It's a six carbon ring with
three double bonds.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.900
These three double
bonds like that.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.260
And that's not it's only
configuration.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.000
Sometimes it's shown to
be in resonance with

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.060
this form right here.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.030
So the double bonds all flip
around the circle, like that.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.960
Or sometimes it's simply
drawn like this.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.870
And I talked about this
in the last video.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.290
Just to show that really
neither of these

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
configurations is
exactly right.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.690
That these pi electrons, they're
just moving around the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.670
entire ring.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.930
So and sometimes you'll just
have the hexagon with a circle

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.720
on the inside to show that the
pi electrons are just floating

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.710
around the entire ring.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.360
Now if I were to add something
to the benzene ring, it's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.810
pretty straightforward
to name it.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.000
So say I have this molecule
right here.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.880
So let's see I have that.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.120
That's benzene.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.250
But let's say this carbon
over here, it has

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.810
one, two, three bonds.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.810
If I didn't draw anything else,
you'd just assume that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.340
there's also a hydrogen here.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.380
But maybe there's no
hydrogen there.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.340
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.550
Maybe you have a
chlorine there.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.630
Well this is just
chlorobenzene.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.410
If that was a bromine, it
would be bromobenzene.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.320
So pretty straightforward.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.230
Let me draw it.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.340
Let me actually change
it a little bit.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950
Let's say you had
a chloro there.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.980
And let's say you had,
oh I don't know.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.140
Let's say you had a
bromo over here.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.610
Let's say you have a
bromo over there.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.860
Draw the bromo.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.000
So you can just start
numbering.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090
You can actually start numbering
in either place.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.750
Let's start with the bromine.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.400
It's alphabetically in front.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.170
So this would be 1-bromo,
2-chlorobenzene.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.200
Pretty straightforward.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.640
Now it gets a little
bit more involved.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.950
The IUPAC, which we know is kind
of the group that named

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.200
most things.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.710
Everything else we've seen so
far, they came up with a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.090
separate naming mechanism
from the common names.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.930
But benzene, it's so ingrained
in the organic chemistry

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.190
community, that all of the
benzene or benzene derivative

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160
molecules, they just kind of
said, well you know what,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.630
we're just going to use the
names that everyone uses.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.170
So here's a couple of common
benzene derivatives.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.470
So if you have this molecule
right here.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.120
Let me-- if you have this
molecule right here-- I'll

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.510
actually draw the pi electrons
as a circle.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.550
Actually I'll draw it with
the double bonds.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.530
So let's say you have this
molecule right here.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.470
And over here you have an OH.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.300
You have an OH right there.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.550
This is called a phenol.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.980
So it's not called a
benzene anymore.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.700
And if you had a molecule
that looked like this,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.010
so just like a phenol.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.130
So essentially it is a phenol.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.140
But let's say you have a
bromine right there.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.670
What you do is you start
numbering at the group that's

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.940
making this is a phenol.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.050
So you start numbering there.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.380
One and then you
get to the two.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.140
So this is 2-bromo.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.390
This is 2-bromophenol.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.970
And unfortunately this is one of
those things that you just

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.810
kind of have to memorize.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.180
That a phenol is really just a
benzene ring with an OH group.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.570
Another one that is probably
a good idea to memorize.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.130
I mean at least for me in
organic chemistry, the most

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.019
confusing thing is when someone
says the name of a

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.490
molecule that sounds like they
expect you to understand.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.459
But you don't understand it.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.420
So it's, I guess, a good
idea to understand as

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.270
many names as possible.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.140
So if you just have a benzene
ring, and you just have a

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.190
methyl group attached to
that benzene ring,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.780
this is called toluene.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.550
And once again let's
say you had a

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.070
fluorine right over there.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.240
This would be one, two,
three fluorotulene.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.500
I always have trouble
saying that.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.560
So it's one, two, three.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.940
You start at the group
that's kind of

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.170
making this the toluene.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.610
So let me make it a little
bit clearer.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.805
So this would be
3-fluorotoluene.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.560
This would all be in one word.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.560
I just wrote it up here
to save some space.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.910
Now a couple of other ones
that you'll see.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.640
And once again, as you know, if
you watched many, many Khan

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.040
Academy videos, I hate
memorizing things.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.300
But these are just names.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.330
And these aren't systematically
derived.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.540
The chemistry community just
uses them, because that's the

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.340
way they've heard them.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.750
So it is one of those things you
kind of have to memorize.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:37.560
So if you have a benzene ring,
where the functional group

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.060
that is kind of defining the
benzene ring, it's essentially

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.070
becoming an amine.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.850
We haven't actually covered
videos on amines yet.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.130
And I'll do that in
a future video.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.410
But it's essentially, it's
replaced one of the hydrogens

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.660
in ammonia.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.690
Let me draw ammonia.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.630
Ammonia has three hydrogens
and one lone pair.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.250
Here we've replaced one
of the hydrogens.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.640
Actually there's two
hydrogens here.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.090
We've replaced one of the
hydrogens with a benzene ring.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.700
This type of thing you
call an aniline.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.950
Right there.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.860
And the same idea.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.400
If I put a fluoro here, this
would be 2-fluoroaniline.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.970
So you use whatever the base
molecule is, and then you just

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.020
name it, really the way we've
named a lot of things before.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.530
And I'll just introduce you to
two more, just so that you

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.560
have them under your belt.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.290
So that you'll have seen them
before if anyone introduces

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.210
them to you.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.160
And they're really introducing
groups that we'll study in

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.310
more detail in the future.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.650
But if you have a benzene
ring once again.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.180
So we have a benzene ring.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.730
And then you have a
carboxyl group.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.900
And we'll talk more about
carboxyl groups in the future.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.010
But it creates carboxylic
acid.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.490
This thing right here, this
hydrogen, it can actually be

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.560
released quite easily.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.480
And we'll talk about
that in the future.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.305
This right here is called
benzoic acid.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.380
And this name, actually
there is a little bit

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.430
more logic to this.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.330
You have the benz part
for the benzene.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.880
So let me make this in
different colors.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.400
The benzene part, that gives
us the benz right there.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.130
And then in general, whenever
you have a carboxyl group like

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.680
this, it becomes a
carboxylic acid.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.600
And you tend to add the
-oic acid to the end.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.750
So this actually has some
logical naming to it.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.620
Now the last one I'll introduce
you to is very

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.120
similar to this.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.100
Instead of having an OH right
here, we just have a hydrogen.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.590
It would be an aldehyde.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.590
So let me draw that.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.930
And you could almost
imagine what

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.600
that's going to be called.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.920
It's benzaldehyde.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.150
So let me draw it.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.650
So you have your benzene ring.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.400
And then instead of this
carboxyl group, you have an

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.990
aldehyde group.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.810
You have your carbon.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.200
There's implicitly
a carbon here.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.230
Let me make that, just in
case it's the first time

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.090
you're seeing it.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.930
You have a carbon there.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.030
Instead of an OH group, you
have just a hydrogen.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.240
And so once again you
have a benzene.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.780
So it actually makes sense to
put the benz over there.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.900
And then you have the
aldehyde group.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.730
Then you have an aldehyde
group right over here.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.205
So this is called a
benzaldehyde, or this molecule

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:21.470
is called benzaldehyde.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:27.940
And we'll study amines and
aldehydes and carboxylic acids

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.540
in much more detail in future
videos, and actually see

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.710
reactions that involve them.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.770
But I just wanted to
expose you to this.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.929
And so when you see these kinds
of names, you don't

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.179
become intimidated.
