00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.020
So the truth is that the class movie

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.574
can contain whatever we want it to contain. And

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:08.390
in this case, I will pick the movie's

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.494
title, its youtube_trailer, its reviews, the storyline and its

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:16.880
poster_image. Now that decision will mean, that if

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.920
I said something like toy_story.storyline. The program will print

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.475
this. A story of a boy and his toys that come to life, and if I said,

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:29.170
avatar.show_trailer, the program would play avatar's YouTube

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.980
trailer. So, in summation, when designing the class

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.390
Movie, we probably want to remember data like

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
the movie's title, its storyline, its poster image,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.410
and the link to its YouTube trailer. And one thing we may want to do

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.740
with this data, is to have a show

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.840
trailer function which opens the movie's YouTube trailer.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.170
Okay, let's turn this design, into code.
