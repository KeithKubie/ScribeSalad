DANNY HERMES: I'm Danny Hermes,
a member of developer

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.680
relations here at Google.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.620
I work on commerce, as
many of you know.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.030
And we're here to talk
today about the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.720
content API for Shopping.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.320
And, in particular, we have two
guests to talk about the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.250
Google Affiliate Network and
product listing ads.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.790
So right next to me
is Claire Hugo.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.360
She works on PLAs here in
Mountain View with me.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.370
And in the pink shirt, I'll let
him introduce himself, is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.880
Mark Coppin from Chicago,
to talk about GAN.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.430
So to start us off, Mark
has a few words to say.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.950
And then we'll be fielding
questions from you guys.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.770
So, Mark?

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.670
MARK COPPIN: Sure,
thanks Danny.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.100
I'm Mark Coppin.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.560
I'm a manager on the Google
Affiliate Network.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.030
We are a cost-per-acquisition,
or

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.580
cost-per-sale, advertising network.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.110
It's a little different pricing
model than CPC or CPM.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.950
And the relevant piece here is
that we also use content, or

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.890
products, that advertisers are
submitting to Merchant Center,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.400
and make those available to our
publishers through publish

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.450
fees and the content API.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.750
So I thought I'd join and see
if anyone had any questions

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.000
about our product.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.610
DANNY HERMES: So if you guys
can't think of anything right

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.170
now, I can get Mark to come
back another time.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260
I know you guys have some other
concerns about some of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.360
the announcements.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.540
But if you have questions right
now, then Mark is a

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.320
great resource.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.090
So anybody have anything they're
curious about with

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.010
Google Affiliate Network?

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.660
JOHN: Yeah, sorry
it's John here.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.500
Mark, could you just spend two
minutes just walking through

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.960
what the process is and how ads
get tied up with content

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.270
feed, if you don't mind
please, Mark.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.820
MARK COPPIN: Sure, so our
publishers join our network.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.399
They actually have to have an
AdSense account because we pay

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.740
through AdSense.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.290
But once a publisher has joined
our network they can

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.060
apply to work with specific
advertisers.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.620
So one thing that's a little
unique about the affiliate

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:30.410
advertising space compared to,
say, display networks, is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.900
that-- sorry there's
some construction

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.040
going on around here--

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.590
is that publishers choose what
advertisers they want to work

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.210
with and what ads they would
like to run on their site.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.770
In a lot of cases, the content
on a publisher's site is the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.000
actual ads.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.080
You can think of like a loyalty
model or a coupon site

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.760
that's aggregating
coupon content or

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.620
products on their site.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.490
That is more the typical
affiliate business model than,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.750
say, I just want to put an ad
tag on my site and let a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.230
network fill it and do yield
optimization for me.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.960
A lot of affiliate publishers
are doing their own yield

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.280
optimization and content
aggregation.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.570
So specific to the content
API, you can think of

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.760
publishers that are creating
virtual shopping experiences.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.500
They're comparing products, are
letting consumers compare

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.160
products on their site, and then
sending those consumers

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.400
off to the advertiser's site
for, hopefully, a conversion.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.360
So compare prices, and colors,
and descriptions,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.860
and stuff like that.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.800
And then send that traffic to a
Kohl's to actually purchase

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.800
a product and then earn a
commission on that purchase.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.530
So that's sort of the more
typical business model for an

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.780
affiliate publisher.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.190
DANNY HERMES: Thanks.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.646
Does anybody have any
other questions?

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.150
All right, thanks Mark.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.750
We do have some questions for
me Andrew Lamonica in his

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.990
absence today.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.130
But he sent them to me when he
heard we were going to be

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.430
talking a bit about ads and
the Affiliate Network.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.420
So Mark, if you want to
head out, feel free.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.360
Otherwise, if you want to stick
around, we would love to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.090
have you for further input.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.140
So the first question from
Andrew, how, if at all, does

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.890
including AdWords PLAs affect
normal Google Product Search

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.020
visibility?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.530
For example, if he Googles
"funny yellow mechanical

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.020
pencil" and the PLA for his
oddly-specific product shows

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.050
up, will that prevent his
product from also showing up

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.310
in Shopping results module
in Natural Search?

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.480
So, Claire?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.640
CLAIRE HUGO: So PLAs do not
affect an item showing up in

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.260
Google Product Search.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.300
And so if you're promoting
a product through product

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.910
listing ads and then also
through Product Search, then

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.650
you have the opportunity to
show in both channels.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.410
DANNY HERMES: Thank you.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.660
As a follow up--

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.755
actually, do you want to
restate this question?

00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:25.570
CLAIRE HUGO: The second one?

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.476
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:29.250
CLAIRE HUGO: OK, so the second
question was about the seller

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.190
reviews that show alongside
Product Search results.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.620
So, in some cases, some
companies have that available,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.960
and some do not.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.810
And so this question is more
specific to Product Search.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.530
And if you go to the Google
Merchant Help Center and

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.480
search on seller ratings,
there's a full article about

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.310
how we will automatically crawl
third-party review sites

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.230
and then match those ratings
for our results.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.760
And if they're not appearing
for a particular merchant,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.310
there is some information there
on how to research that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.560
and how to escalate sale.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.900
And those can be reviewed
as well.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.470
DANNY HERMES: OK, so it's sort
of a third party combined with

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.650
also some other input from
the merchants themselves.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.590
So another question from Andrew
was about errors.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.080
So if there are products that
are disapproved for Product

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.365
Ads, but not disapproved
for Product Search,

00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:33.910
how can they tell?

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.680
Will this show up in the
data quality section?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.500
Or is there some other place
that they should be going to

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.330
find out about these errors?

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.090
CLAIRE HUGO: So if there are
items that are disapproved for

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.100
our Product Listing Ads, that
should typically be listed in

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.750
the Data Quality tab.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.610
For example, if an item has a
trademarked term in the title,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.810
and it's disapproved for the
trademark, then that would be

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.220
apparent on that Data
Quality tab.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.940
There's also information on the
Products tab where we have

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.130
two columns, one for
Product Search and

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.920
one for Product Ads.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.980
So you're able to see a green
check mark if it's approved

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.940
for Product Search.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.020
And then, say, the item was
disapproved for a trademark,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.730
then you would see the red
circle for Product Ads.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.150
And on the Data Quality
tab is a good

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.725
place to see the summaries.

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:23.140
You can see 5%, or the number
of items disapproved for a

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.640
particular reason.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.050
But on the Products tab is
where you can see for

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.042
individual products.

00:07:29.042 --> 00:07:32.200
DANNY HERMES: Great, and Andrew
also says that this is

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.600
a feature that he's interested
in, and some of

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.810
you might be as well.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.280
Since a product initially starts
out as disapproved for

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.310
Product Ads and then has to be
matched with a campaign, he

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.550
says it would be nice to have
a way where he could filter

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.930
out and find out which
ones had been

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.420
matched and which hadn't.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.900
And that's something we're
certainly going to take as

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.900
good feedback and pass
along to the team.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.140
And a final question he has,
which is, again, sort of

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.190
speculative or a future request,
is, are there any

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.360
plans to add a performance
table for PLAs?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.230
Or is there another place
where we can see

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.220
that existing data?

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.610
CLAIRE HUGO: So right now for
Product Listing Ads, the best

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.410
way to see performance
data is to look

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.280
in the AdWords interface.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.790
And there you can see
impressions, clicks,

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.760
clickthrough rates, spend,
conversion data if you have

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.690
Conversion Tracking
implemented.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.380
And we are making a lot
of improvements to the

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.580
Performance tab in Merchant
Center as well.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.840
Hopefully you've noticed that
over the past couple months.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.280
And I would expect to see
more improvements in the

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.209
short term as well.

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:37.390
DANNY HERMES: Great.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.860
Great answers, and in absentia,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.870
great questions, Andrew.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.790
So now for the people actually
on the call, do you guys have

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.790
any questions for Claire or
Mark, PLA questions for

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.200
Claire, or [? organic ?]

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.980
questions for Mark?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.346
Or questions for me?

00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:56.380
LUKE: Is it OK if I ask, could
you just explain in a nutshell

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.520
again what I was reading in the
announcement about how--

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.180
my understanding about, are all
product listings now for

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.740
Google Product Search going to
be part of the AdWords system?

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.260
You're saying you have to be
submitted through Content API,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.510
but then they have to match
something in AdWords in order

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.350
to be able to be listed
in Product Search?

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.890
Could you explain how that's
going to work?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.000
CLAIRE HUGO: Sure, so with the
new shopping experience that

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.270
we'll be launching in October,
it will require that the

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.770
Merchant Center have a linked
AdWords account and have a

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.030
campaign live with product
listing ads in order to show

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.130
in our Shopping property.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.720
So that means you can continue
on with it, the feed, or using

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.480
the API as normal on the
Merchant Center side.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.910
But then each account will
need to have that AdWords

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.060
account linked, and a bid for
each of the products to be

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.832
promoting it.

00:09:45.832 --> 00:09:48.560
LUKE: So does that mean that
once the Content API uploads a

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.650
product-- let's just
say it's a new

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.690
product you've just posted--

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.020
it's going to show up in the
AdWords interface under PLA?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.000
CLAIRE HUGO: So there's a
few ways you can do it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.590
On the AdWords side, you can
create an ad group, or

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.840
campaign, to promote
all products from

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.240
your Merchant Center.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.900
So that means anytime you add a
new product on the Merchant

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.750
Center side, it will
automatically be matched to

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.900
that All Products target
in the AdWords account.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.720
You can also get more granular
with the PLA campaign.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.460
So if you want to bid
differently for different set

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.040
of products, then you can
have a target just for

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.300
your payroll products.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.900
And then you can also have
that All Products target.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.230
So in that case, you have
apparel where you want bid $1,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.810
and then you have the
All Products where

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.070
you want to bid $0.50.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.280
And that way you still have full
coverage for everything

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.690
that's being submitted through
Merchant Center.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.990
LUKE: Is there going to
be minimum bidding

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.940
required for those ads?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.530
Because I'm just imagining a
situation where if you haven't

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.880
met the minimum bid for a given
product, it wouldn't

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.650
show up at all, right?

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.590
CLAIRE HUGO: Right, so every
time you have a Product

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.830
Listing Ad, it will
enter an auction.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:58.910
And the minimum bid is
going to be $0.01.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.820
With that said, if you're
bidding that low, it's

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.520
possible that the traffic
will be really low.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.800
So it's a matter of
understanding the products

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.170
that are being promoted, the
competition, and finding that

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.500
sweet spot where it's profitable
for the advertiser,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.140
and you're getting the traffic
that you're interested in.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.510
LUKE: So you can set up an Ad
Group that has, say, some

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.460
spending limit, like is
it per month, I guess?

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.155
CLAIRE HUGO: You
can do per day.

00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:26.760
LUKE: OK, per day.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.100
Right, per day.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.780
And then they could put in some
upper bid amount as a

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.530
Product Group?

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.360
And then as the Content API
submits these products, as

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.023
long as they come in under that
daily spend, it will keep

00:11:40.023 --> 00:11:41.800
showing those ads, wherever
they land

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.140
based on the auction?

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.540
CLAIRE HUGO: Yes, exactly.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.430
DANNY HERMES: So Dani in the
chat is asking for a

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.160
clarification.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.350
She asks, even if an advertiser
is the only

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.880
advertiser, is it possible that
the products won't show

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.780
up if the bid's too low?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.930
CLAIRE HUGO: If the product had
a bid associated with it,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.580
and it's the only item that's
eligible for the query, then

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.470
it should show in that case.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.390
So that's why we're encouraging
advertisers to

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.480
promote all of their products,
even with a low bid.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.800
And then we also have an
incentive program that can be

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.850
found through the Commerce Blog,
or the Inside AdWords

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:25.700
Blog, where you can get a $100
coupon for AdWords for new PLA

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.100
advertisers.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.280
And if you promote all products,
then you can get 10%

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.940
of your PLA spend credited to
your account every month

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.600
through the end of the year.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.180
DANNY HERMES: OK, great,
super helpful.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.890
So John is asking-- and John,
Dani is asking Chet because

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.150
she doesn't have mic.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.190
But if you want to ask with
your microphone, you can.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.970
Or I can read it, either one.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.580
JOHN: Yeah, it's just
a quick question.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.660
How does this tie in with
multi-client accounts.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.880
DANNY HERMES: So I've actually
been looking at some internal

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.240
conversations about this.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.640
This isn't 100% clear yet.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.800
I don't know if Claire has
any insights on it.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.460
If not, then we'll certainly
update you as we know more

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:12.980
internally.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.650
Do you?

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.464
CLAIRE HUGO: Yeah, that's
something I would want to

00:13:15.464 --> 00:13:16.190
follow up on to make
sure [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.910
DANNY HERMES: Right, from what
I understand, you can,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.630
programmatically, using API's,
connect each sub-account with

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.790
a different campaign.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.790
But I don't have a really good
understanding from a technical

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.460
standpoint, or from a sort of
account rules, and things like

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.400
that, standpoint.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.940
So I don't want to give you
any false information yet.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.500
But the conversations are
being had internally.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.850
And that is one of the main
workflows that needs to be

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.700
ironed out.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.230
So thanks for the question,
and we'll try to

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.480
get a better answer.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.100
LUKE: So Danny, what you're
saying is that, in terms of

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.640
linking the Content API
products, as we submit them

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.960
through this AdWords link,
that's going to be

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.225
to-be-determined right now.

00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:04.700
Because you said earlier the
AdWords account was going to

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.990
be connected to the MCA account
some kind of way, in

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.220
an automated way, [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.820
DANNY HERMES: So there's some
other details there, like you

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.090
may want each of your individual
sellers to have

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.560
their own individual AdWords
account that they manage or

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.970
that they give you some
settings through your

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.970
interface that you send through
to manage, rather than

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.080
having a single account
associated with MCA that is a

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.360
catch all for everybody.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.160
For large marketplaces, that
model probably doesn't make a

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.140
whole lot of sense because you
have, all across the spectrum,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.330
different kinds of sellers.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.810
You have big sellers
and small sellers.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.970
You have sellers that have big
marketing budgets and have

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.950
small marketing budgets.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.410
And then you just have sellers
that are probably selling

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.880
different kinds of products with
different bid levels that

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.570
are found out in the actual
auctioning on a regular basis.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:04.340
So there are a lot of details
there and a lot of tiny pieces

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.990
in the big machine
to figure out.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.660
So, like I said, there is a
conversation being had.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.750
And it's not 100% decided or
determined what the way to go

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.720
about it is.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.605
But, certainly, in the simple
case, you can still associate

00:15:18.605 --> 00:15:21.050
an AdWords account with
the parent MCA.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:26.430
And that will propagate across
to everyone, but there's a lot

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.566
more involved.

00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:32.070
LUKE: Is that documented
somewhere?

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.680
DANNY HERMES: Not
that I know of.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.180
Is it in the Merchant
Center docs?

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.490
In our docs, we certainly don't
get into any of that.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.960
CLAIRE HUGO: I don't think we
have it right now, as far as

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.150
the MCA structure
and the linkage.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.403
But that's something I can
[? work list ?] and share with

00:15:48.403 --> 00:15:48.850
the content team.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.030
DANNY HERMES: Certainly, and
feedback from guys like you,

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.030
top contributors to our forums
and things like that,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.530
important members of our
community, they're

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.450
things we listen to.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.120
And work that we put out for
ourselves to make documents if

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.840
there is something that there's
a resounding voice

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.950
saying it's not clear, then
we want it to be clear.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.600
And we want to clear it up.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.080
So keep giving that feedback if
you see something you think

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.810
should be documented
and isn't.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.310
LUKE: There is an AdWords
API, right?

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.460
DANNY HERMES: Yeah, I don't
know a whole lot about it.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.150
But certainly there are APIs for
many different pieces of

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:30.340
the AdWords, DoubleClick,
et cetera.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.770
And very similar, if not better
support, with client

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.120
libraries, and things like,
and documentation for the

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.390
client libraries.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.310
They're relatively similar.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.590
But I'm not sure if they're
API or GData APIs.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.070
There is a little bit difference
in the client

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.590
libraries when you go from
one to the other.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:55.400
But in either case .NET will
be supported 100%, Luke.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.380
LUKE: OK, cool.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.270
Is there somebody like you in
their division we can talk to?

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.820
DANNY HERMES: There are much
bigger teams in Dev Rel.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.450
They have many more than me.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.930
They have three, four, five,
for each particular aspect

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.579
that you would consider.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:14.369
So yeah, there is
AdWords Dev Rel.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:18.190
There is a DoubleClick
Dev Rel.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.280
There's all kinds of things.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.049
There are even Dev Rels specific
to Androids, specific

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:24.300
to iOS, et cetera.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.660
AdMob, there we go.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.000
That's the thing I couldn't
think of.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.860
But yeah, they are a part of
Dev Rel, and they are a

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.750
relatively big team.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.210
If you go to
developers.google.com/events,

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.150
you can actually see when
they're doing their office

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.740
hours because it will
be on the schedule.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.340
And if you want to post a
question on the forum about

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.690
what their forums are, I can
reach out to some of those

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.885
team members and find the
best places for you to--

00:17:49.885 --> 00:17:51.820
LUKE: Can you give me
that address again?

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.360
What was that URL?

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.590
DANNY HERMES:
developers.google.com/events.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.660
LUKE: Slash events.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.060
Gotcha.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.130
DANNY HERMES: Yeah,
that's where we

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.380
post all of our events.

00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:06.510
So does anybody have any
other questions?

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.870
Or did we sort of run out of
questions about PLAs, and the

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.125
integration, and the
announcement,

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:14.450
and things like that?

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.005
Looks like Dani is typing
a question.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.875
Or maybe she's typing to
say no more questions.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.130
She says that she's
trying to set up a

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.560
new PLA ad from scratch.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.070
She made an AdGroup.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.210
And I bet there's a question
coming after.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.498
And on the new ad she sees--

00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:53.485
I'm going to wait until she's
done and then just summarize.

00:18:53.485 --> 00:18:55.520
CLAIRE HUGO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.770
DANNY HERMES: OK.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.140
OK, so she says she's
trying to set up a

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.790
new PLA from scratch.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.410
She made a new AdGroup.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.830
And on the new ad, she sees
some text, an image, an

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.600
AdBuilder, and a WAP.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.940
Not sure what that it.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.960
And she wants to know which
one she should choose to

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.700
actually make a PLA.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.140
CLAIRE HUGO: So when you're
setting up a PLA, you want to

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.580
first extend the campaign
settings to promote products

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.100
for Merchant Center.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.860
So--

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.980
DANNY HERMES: We can actually
share our screen, if you want.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.780
And you can do this.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.010
And they can watch what
you're doing.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.520
Would you want to do that?

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.740
CLAIRE HUGO: Do you have an
AdWords test account?

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.860
DANNY HERMES: I don't, but we
can open an incognito window,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.040
and you can sign
in with yours.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.100
I don't know if it would be--

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.000
CLAIRE HUGO: No, I can't.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
DANNY HERMES: How about this,
I'll invite you to the

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.380
Hangout, and you do it
from your machine.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.540
OK?

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.040
All right, technical
issue here.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.570
We're going to add one
more participant.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.020
We're going to actually
add Claire's account.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.770
I think she's already been
invited, but I will make sure.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.310
Great question, Dani, and
there's nothing better than a

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.970
live demo during a Hangout.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.338
CLAIRE HUGO: I don't actually
have the login.

00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:35.588
DANNY HERMES: Gotcha.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.525
So, Luke, have you had a chance
to check out the new

00:20:52.525 --> 00:20:54.470
docs that I published
since we last spoke?

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.300
LUKE: Yeah I did.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.890
They're excellent.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.710
DANNY HERMES: What do
you think of the

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.500
new API for the library?

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.870
In this case, the interface for
the library, rather than

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.350
the actual online API.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.640
Much more intuitive, right?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.850
LUKE: Yeah, I think you
did a great job.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.330
It's excellent.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.200
DANNY HERMES: Thank you.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.450
And I'm a Python developer.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.800
I pretty much tried to make
it as Pythonic as I could.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.520
And it's nice--

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.890
you know, Python, you can't have
different signatures for

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.640
the same function.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.800
But I kind of like that
in .NET and then

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800
other compiler languages.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.680
It's a cute little language,
though I don't like compiling

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.380
all the time.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.080
So I'll going to stick with
my dynamic languages

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.140
on a regular basis.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.210
But we're trying--

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.080
we don't have a writer on
our team right now.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.420
But we're trying to do to
improve on those a bit more,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.530
and combine them into a single
document, and just sort of

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.230
have a choice where you
pick what language,

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.580
and things like that.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.580
But there's also some MCA and
data feeds functionality in

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.460
those libraries that is
there but just not

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.430
documented as well.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:09.140
So we're trying to sort of
balance that workload with I/O

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:15.590
preparation, which is quite
intense right now.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.470
So I don't know that we'll
see that before July.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.400
But it's something that's
certainly on our horizon.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.965
Do you want to just do that all
of this in the Hangout?

00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:31.160
CLAIRE HUGO: Let me see if
this will work, actually.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.880
DANNY HERMES: OK, we want to
make sure it works before we

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.560
actually show it.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.560
John, I looked into getting
a Raspberry Pi.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.775
And it is on my "that's
interesting" list. I don't

00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:46.650
know if it's quite on my
to-do list just yet.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.960
But it's something I've looked
into since you suggested it

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.320
about a month ago, or whenever
you brought that up.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.570
Python for Education, yeah.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.950
Claire is an AdWords wiz.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.030
I can't believe it.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:14.710
CLAIRE HUGO: It's just I have
the account set up, so I can't

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.655
look at my test account unless
I access ICS, which

00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:19.230
I can't just by--

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.480
DANNY HERMES: Right.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.360
CLAIRE HUGO: Can I just
talk through this?

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.280
DANNY HERMES: Sure.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.380
CLAIRE HUGO: OK, because I can't
show a portion of this

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.595
window, right?

00:23:32.595 --> 00:23:35.660
DANNY HERMES: No, you cannot.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.910
CLAIRE HUGO: OK.

00:23:39.305 --> 00:23:40.200
Sorry about that.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.160
DANNY HERMES: OK, so Claire
doesn't think she can get a

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.520
demo with enough information
redacted

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.260
for it to be showable.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.670
So she's just going to talk
through some of the settings.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.440
CLAIRE HUGO: Yeah, so once
you're in the AdWords

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.850
interface, when you're creating
a new campaign, or

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.310
editing an existing
campaign, if you

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.720
click into that campaign--

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.582
so click on the name either
in the left nav or on the

00:24:05.582 --> 00:24:07.920
Campaigns tab in the center.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.570
And then click on the
Settings tab.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.950
And if you scroll down, you
should see an option to extend

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.290
the campaign with items from
Google Merchant Center.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.390
And this will only happen after
you have linked your

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.300
Merchant Center account with
your AdWords account.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.270
So if I can just back up one
step, within the Merchant

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.480
Center account, if you click on
the Settings tab, and then

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.630
it will expand, and you can
click on the AdWords link.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.210
And then add your 10-digit
customer ID

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.520
from the AdWords account.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.240
And once you've done this, then
in the AdWords account,

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.530
you'll see on that Campaign
Settings tab the option to

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.350
extend with products from your
Merchant Center account.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.560
So once you've selected that
box, when you are in the new

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.200
AdGroup, or the existing
AdGroup, and you click on

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.940
Create a New Ad, among the
options that Danny already

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.010
listed, you'll see the
option to create a

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.746
Product Listing Ad.

00:25:11.746 --> 00:25:13.260
DANNY HERMES: Awesome.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.760
CLAIRE HUGO: And there's also
actually a video that goes

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.150
through all of these steps.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.370
And that's at--

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:26.650
DANNY HERMES: I can link to the
video in my G+ stream, in

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.610
the forum summary of this
video, as well as in the

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.480
YouTube comments, or excuse me,
the YouTube description of

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.690
this video.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.630
So we will get that you
guys after the fact.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.870
But I don't think reading it
aloud will be that helpful,

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.980
though putting in chat
that might be.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.420
But thanks for the
question, Dani.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.250
I think that was a
good question.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.470
And the demo I saw was pretty
cool over here.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.630
Sorry you guys couldn't
see it.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.470
If there are no more questions,
we'll wrap up

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.870
before 11:00, like
we usually do.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:05.940
But I will allow the floor to be
open for questions one last

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.431
time, going once.

00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:11.090
LUKE: Let me ask just one more
thing about impressions data.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.790
Was impressions data still
on the list for--

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.770
DANNY HERMES: It is.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:20.420
It's, as I found out, something
that is easy to do,

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.160
though it's not something that
is necessarily something we

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.040
want to do.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.280
So it's not a yes or no.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.870
It's in discussion.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.890
Well, easy-- that's probably not
the right way to put it.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.910
But it is still on
our radar, and it

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.495
is still being discussed.

00:26:38.495 --> 00:26:42.520
And I'll update that bug if it
does get added and certainly

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.880
update the documentation.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.040
LUKE: OK.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.345
DANNY HERMES: So Dani
is typing something.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.850
OK so it's another PLA AdWords
interface question.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.410
This is for Merchant
Center, or?

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:17.580
CLAIRE HUGO: That's AdWords,
the Product Extension tab.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.100
So within AdWords there is
an Ad Extensions tab.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.400
But where you want to set up
the Product Listing Ads is

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.420
actually on the Auto
Targets tab.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.870
So on the Merchant Center
option, it looks like she's

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.810
seeing her ID and
company name.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.690
And so that would display when
you're linking the campaign to

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.450
the Merchant Center account.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:51.370
And so it sounds like she may
be seeing different Merchant

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.750
Center accounts listed there,
which may be the case if

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.600
there's a multi-client
account involved.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.360
So--

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.610
she still typing.

00:28:04.032 --> 00:28:06.870
DANNY HERMES: The power
of microphones.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.460
LUKE: So Danny, as far as we
know, we can't, through the

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.130
content API, add the
AdWords customer ID

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.810
under MCA yet, right?

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.880
DANNY HERMES: I'm not
sure about that.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.640
I don't know in either
direction.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.590
LUKE: OK, I mean, eventually
we'll want that, right?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.150
DANNY HERMUS: Yeah, there have
been talks for some more

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.170
features in the content API
that give a tighter

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.450
integration between the two.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.210
LUKE: Yeah, because I'm trying
to automate it, right?

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.942
So I don't want it to manually
do it, so OK.

00:28:40.942 --> 00:28:43.620
DANNY HERMES: Right.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.510
So Dani is asking--

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.140
she sees multiple extensions
from a single account.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.480
But there are already
extensions, and they

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.940
have the same name.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.470
And she's curious which one
is the correct one.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.450
But I think without actually
seeing the account it would be

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.240
a bit unclear as to what
she's looking at.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.020
Is that correct?

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.520
CLAIRE HUGO: Yeah, if they're
all the same account ID, than

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.564
you should just be able to
choose one of those.

00:29:11.564 --> 00:29:13.610
But it would probably
be easier to look at

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.350
the specific account.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.030
DANNY HERMES: Dani, if you're
comfortable sharing your

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.230
screen, we may be
able to help.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.730
I don't know that that's
something you want to do.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.210
Actually, you know, let's
hold off on that.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.880
But are there any particular
forums that you recommend

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.170
asking questions like this or
any particular things that

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.240
people should be searching
for or looking for?

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.440
CLAIRE HUGO: Yeah, if there are
PLA-secific questions, I

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.990
would ask a question to
the AdWords forum.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.455
And then if it's on the Merchant
Center side, there's

00:29:48.455 --> 00:29:49.480
the merchant forum.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.260
So in either case, we'll be able
to field and point users

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.330
in the right direction.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.580
DANNY HERMES: Cool.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.620
All right, Dani says thanks.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:08.770
So that looks like it's going
to be it for us today.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.360
Thanks a ton to Claire.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.260
And thanks to Mark for the
introduction you gave. I'm

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.660
sorry, Mark, we couldn't feed
more questions your way.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.220
But our guests were phenomenal
today, and it was

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.990
great to have them.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.650
It certainly makes my morning
a bit easier.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.400
Everybody be well.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.390
Our next time we meet will
not be in two weeks.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.420
It will be in four weeks because
two weeks is Google

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.010
I/O, and I will be
super-duper busy.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:40.620
So four weeks, well, I don't
know the exact date.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.080
So I'm not going to
say a wrong one.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.150
I actually said an incorrect
one for our last Hangout.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.720
And also, I found we're
being moved again.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.450
Last time, it was from
Wednesdays to Tuesdays.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.850
Next one will be on a Thursday,
but I will certainly

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.870
give ample time and may have
another guess then, as well,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.230
maybe a PM or the tech lead
on the engineering team.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.750
But maybe it'll be just me.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.160
But thanks, everybody.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.170
Have a nice day, or night,
in John's case.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.000
Dani, I'm not sure what time
zone you're coming from.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
But Mark, have a
nice afternoon.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.010
I know it's already afternoon
in Chicago.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.370
See everybody later, and
thanks, everybody, for

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.650
watching on YouTube as well.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.020
CLAIRE HUGO: Thanks guys.
