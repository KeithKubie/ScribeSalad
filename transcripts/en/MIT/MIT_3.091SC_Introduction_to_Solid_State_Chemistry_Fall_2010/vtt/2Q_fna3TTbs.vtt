00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.755
Let's go to the lesson.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:27.380
So the last day we studied
VSEPR, which allowed us to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.410
infer the shapes of molecules,
covalent molecules.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.640
Today I want to talk about
the state of aggregation.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.710
What do I mean by state
of aggregation?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.680
Is something a solid, a liquid
or a gas at a particular

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.240
temperature?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.500
So 3.091 is introduction to
solid state chemistry.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010
One of the things we need to
know is, under what conditions

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.680
is the solid state stable?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.950
And the state of aggregation,
when it applies to covalent

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.750
molecules, is going to lead
us to a discussion

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.760
of secondary bonding.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.730
So today's lecture is
state of aggregation

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.270
or secondary bonding.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.630
Now let's just reflect
upon what we've

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.520
learned up until now.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.660
We studied ironic bonding and
we knew that ionic bonding

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.930
necessarily leads to crystal
formation because we have

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.750
unsaturated bonds.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.620
And that leads to an ion array
of unlimited size until you

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.860
run out of reagent.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.210
And something honking big made
of ions is going to be a solid

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.450
at room temperature.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.190
Last day we appreciated
with covalent

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.590
bonding we have two options.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.970
We can either make discrete
molecules such as HCl.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.860
And HCl as a discrete molecule,
depending on a

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.010
number of factors that I'm going
to show you today, could

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.390
be a solid, liquid or gas.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.790
And we're going to understand
more deeply how to sort out

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.060
between the three of them.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.630
Or, I showed you at the end of
the last lecture, you can make

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
a three-dimensional network and
diamond was one example.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.200
If it's a three-dimensional
network that is a large array

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.920
of solid then that means that
you're going to end up with a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.670
formation of a crystal, which is
going to give you a solid.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.040
Diamond is solid at room
temperature, graphite is solid

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.730
at room temperature.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.190
So let's now go to the one case
that we haven't dealt

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.570
with, and that's the formation
of discrete molecules.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.920
So let's look at discrete
molecules.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.270
And what we want to understand
is whether they're going to be

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.000
solid, liquid or gas at room
temperature and what's the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.280
relevant physics here in order
to make that determination?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.220
The relevant physics
is the following.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.980
We're going to compare
two forces.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.420
We're going to compare the
cohesive force between

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.920
molecules versus the
disruptive force.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.120
And the disruptive
force in 3.091 is

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.360
always going to be thermal.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.530
It's thermal energy.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.060
We know this.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.190
As we heat things they go from
solid to liquid to vapor as

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.500
temperature increases.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.650
So thermal energy plays the role
of the destructive force

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.800
whereas the bonding is
something that is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.230
the cohesive force.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.010
So let's go back to HCL.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.510
Last day we looked at HCl.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.840
So here's one HCl molecule.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.230
We have a covalent bond.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.690
It's a covalent bond within
the molecule.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.510
We know this is a polar covalent
molecule, with the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.690
chlorine having greater
electronegativity and pulling

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.250
the electrons towards its end.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.460
And furthermore, this bond I
want to categorize as within

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.290
the molecule so I'm going to
call it intramolecular.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.510
Intramolecular.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.610
Now if I want to answer the
question, is hydrogen chloride

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.290
going to be a solid, liquid or
gas at room temperature, I

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.720
don't have the information
on the board.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.890
The only way I can answer that
question is to put another

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.380
hydrogen chloride.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.470
This simply forms the bond
between hydrogen and chlorine.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.760
To determine whether hydrogen
chloride is a solid, liquid or

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.290
gas, I need to look at how one
hydrogen chloride molecule

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.970
bonds to another hydrogen
chloride molecule.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.260
So now this end is the delta
plus this end is delta minus.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.300
And we have again an
intramolecular bond.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.580
So the question is, how does one
hydrogen chloride bond to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.970
another hydrogen chloride?

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.080
This is the intermolecular
bond.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.330
Intermolecular bond.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.210
So intermolecular bonds govern
the state of aggregation.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.880
And I'm going to show you
the different types of

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.310
intermolecular bonds.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.680
This intermolecular bond
isn't the primary bond.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.740
The primary bond is here
inside the molecule.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.840
So the intermolecular bond is
known as a secondary bond.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.900
And there three types
of secondary bonds.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.750
We're going to look
at them in turn.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.340
So the first one is depicted
here on the board.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.120
And it's called dipole-dipole
interactions.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.370
And these obviously occur only
between polar molecules.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.400
Operative and polar molecules.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.160
Not in.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.220
Between.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.700
Take out in.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.760
Operative between
polar molecules.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.430
So we've made something covalent
and now how does one

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.920
stick to the other?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.990
Alright and I think I've got a
cartoon here that shows this.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.460
There we go.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.260
That's taken from an old
book that I had.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.280
So you see the H and the Cl and
we have a dipole moment

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.490
and the negative end of one
dipole attracted to the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.480
positive end of another
dipole.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.990
So we have a net dipole moment
here and we can measure the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.375
distance between the center
of the dipole--

00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:01.190
center to center spacing
and call it r.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.450
Center to center
dipole spacing.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.250
And say that the energy in
dipole-dipole interaction--

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.690
I don't expect you to know this
by heart and do anything

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.550
with it, but I just want
you to realize

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.460
that it's a weak force.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.680
This is very weak.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.270
It's proportional
to the magnitude

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.430
of the dipole moment.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.390
You'd expect that.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.460
Weak dipole moment,
weak energy.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.350
Strong dipole moment,
strong energy.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.800
Turns out it goes as
the fourth order

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.060
of the dipole moment.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.740
And it's inversely proportional
to the

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.990
separation.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.470
Only it's not coulombic, it
goes as 1 over r cubed.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.770
And there's a temperature
factor.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.850
1 over t.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.100
As temperature goes up,
this energy goes down.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.780
And these are very weak forces
on the order of about 5

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.190
kilojoules per mole.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.130
You remember what the
crystallization energy of

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.700
sodium chloride was?

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.310
787 kilojoules per mole.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.030
So this is very, very weak.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.140
It's operative at, between,
at low temperatures.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.380
At very low temperatures.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.550
So for example, hydrogen
chloride, in the case of

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.170
hydrogen chloride, the melting
point of hydrogen chloride is

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.370
minus 115 degrees C and
the boiling point is

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.840
minus 85 degrees C.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.260
You can see at very low
temperatures we already have

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.880
enough thermal energy
to disrupt.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.370
So if we have solid hydrogen
chloride, the forces between

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.480
the hydrogen chloride molecules
in the solid are

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.810
these very weak dipole-dipole
interactions.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.180
And I think there's a couple
more cartoons here.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.160
This is taken from your text.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.350
So there we go.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.770
There it is.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.380
That's the soup that might
be HCl liquid.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.340
OK so that's the first type
of secondary bond.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.910
Dipole-dipole interaction.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.050
Let's look at the second one.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.200
The second one is called induced
dipole-induced dipole.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.850
And it's operative in
non-polar species.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:18.170
Dominant in non-polar species.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.820
Why am I using the
word, species?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.040
I'm trying to be a pedant
and use fancy words?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.180
No.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.460
Because I'm going to
make it generic.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.275
I'm going to show it works in
atoms and in compounds.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.040
So as examples, what are
some non-polar species?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.500
Well how about something
like argon?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.450
Argon if you look on the
periodic table it'll show you

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:46.960
that it has a melting point of
84 kelvin and a boiling point

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.600
of 87 kelvin.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.890
So if I cool argon to below 84
kelvin, I get argon ice.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.790
So what are the bonds between
one argon atom and another

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.430
argon atom?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.900
It can't be this.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.970
There's no net charge.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.460
It can't be ionic.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.590
It doesn't form a covalent
network the way diamond does.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.150
How do you justify the existence
of solid argon?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.590
It's just so cold that it just
sits there and freezes?

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.190
I mean, how does it bond?

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.150
There needs to be some
kind of bonding.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.700
And other non-polar species.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.540
So for example, the
molecule iodine.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.320
Iodine melting point is above
room temperature.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.330
It's a solid crystal at
room temperature.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.700
Well there's a strong covalent
bond inside iodine.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.635
But how does one iodine bond to
another and to another and

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:33.330
to another?

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.040
And we can even go
to polyatomic

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.930
species, such as methane.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.610
You know there was data from
the Cassini Probe.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.710
Look at this.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.110
This is an image from
the Cassini Probe.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.270
This is an island group.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.770
The yellow is an island group.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.270
The blue is a methane sea.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:56.530
A sea of liquid methane on the
moon of Saturn, Titan.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.700
So there's liquid methane.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.730
How does liquid methane form?

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.830
What causes one methane to bond
with another methane?

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.630
That's the question that
we're wrestling with.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.580
So let's look at it first
in a simpler context.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.950
Let's look at it with argon.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.900
So I put argon here.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.480
It's a spherical atom.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.180
And the question we had before
says, how does one argon bond

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.300
to another argon, as has to be
the case in the solid or

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.680
liquid argon.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.490
So we know that this has a lot
of electrons and the atom is

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.380
net neutral.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.410
But the electrons
are in motion.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.460
If I had an attosecond camera
and I went in here and I went,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.760
snap, I could catch a freeze
frame where the electrons

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.100
aren't symmetrically

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.010
distributed around the nucleus.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.220
This nucleus, the atom is
in constant fluctuation.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.060
But net neutral.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.960
Time average it's symmetrical.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.500
So at some moment I might have
a preponderance of electrons

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.630
over here at around
three o'clock.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.050
So this end of the argon is
a little bit delta minus.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.240
Which means the other
end is delta plus.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.060
Now what happens if this
is delta minus,

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.290
this is delta plus?

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.000
Can you see that the positive
end of this argon atom will

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.730
then pull on the electron
distribution of the adjacent

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.280
argon atom rendering it delta
minus at three o'clock and

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.730
delta plus?

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:34.350
So this is the dipole in one,
induces a dipole in another.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.460
And why does it occur
in the first place?

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.080
It occurs because the electrons
are in motion.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.100
Electrons in motion lead to
time fluctuating dipoles.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.350
They're time fluctuating.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.800
Time average, there's no
net dipole moment.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.700
I'm not going back on
what I said before.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.000
There's no net dipole moment
here, but this is time

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.090
fluctuating dipole.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.340
Time fluctuating dipole.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.850
So who was the first
to explain this?

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:16.366
The first to explain this was
Fritz London in 1930.

00:12:16.366 --> 00:12:20.530
In 1930 Fritz London gave us the
explanation because this

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.630
troubled people for
a long time.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.350
And he did so in a quantitative
manner.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.730
And the mathematics of the
treatment are identical to the

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.140
mathematics for the dispersion
of light under certain

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.170
conditions.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.660
This has nothing to do with
the dispersion of light.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.240
The mathematical formulation
imitates the formulation of

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.450
the dispersion of light and
hence the force here is known

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.200
as the London Dispersion
Force.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.540
So people will say that solid
argon is held together by

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.560
London Dispersion Forces.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.160
Or the bond is known by the
name van der Waals.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.290
We either call them van der
Waals bonds or London

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.640
Dispersion Forces.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.110
Van der Waals was Dutch.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.490
I know how to spell
the word wall.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.690
This is the dutch spelling.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.191
W A A L S.

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.900
Van der Waals.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:21.100
So in this system here, the
London Dispersion Force or the

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.270
van der Waals bond is in fact
not the secondary bond.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.270
It's the primary
bond, isn't it?

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.340
It's the only bond.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.480
So by definition it must
be the primary bond.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.110
But can you see that in every
compound, including diamond,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.900
we have time fluctuating dipoles
in all of the atoms?

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.770
It's not just argon that has
time fluctuating dipoles.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.390
Every atom in you and me has
time fluctuating dipoles.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.110
But we're held together by
much greater forces.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.730
So that's why I say that
in this case this is

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.540
the dominant force.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.590
But it's operative
in everything.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.240
Because wherever we have
electrons, they're in motion.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.840
So this is the dominant one.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.360
Alright so we can look at it
in a few other instances.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.260
So for example we can look at
it in the case of iodine.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.200
We can look at it in the
case of methane.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.080
All the same.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.680
Time fluctuating dipoles.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.860
And this is a very,
very weak force.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.450
So the energy in London
Dispersion Forces, or van der

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:32.660
Waals bonds, is proportional
to a quantity called the

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.910
polarizability.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.620
The polarizability is--

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.950
and this was defined
by London--

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.440
polarizability is the measure
of how easy it is to induce

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.440
this dipole.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.130
A measure of the ease
of electron

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.470
displacement within an atom.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:15.660
And it depends on, it's
influenced by the size and

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:21.620
it's influenced by the number
of electrons in the atom.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.070
So what do I mean by that?

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:30.310
Well let's take two systems.
Suppose I've got argon and

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.490
I'll go up two members
in the same series

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.740
and I've got helium.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.270
So what are the forces that
hold helium together?

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.480
Same thing.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.100
But the boiling point
here is 87 kelvin.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.190
The boiling point here
is 4.2 kelvin.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.590
Why does this have such
a low boiling point?

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.660
Well, polarizability.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.040
Size--

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.240
helium is smaller.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.490
So the degree, the corral in
which the electrons can roam

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.810
is smaller.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.960
So the extent of electron
displacement is smaller.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.830
And secondly there are
only two electrons.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.490
And they're in 1s, so they're
tightly held.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:16.150
And so the delta minus delta
plus capable of being created

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.150
in helium is tiny compared to
the delta minus delta plus

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.570
that can be created in argon.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:28.120
So the energy goes as
polarizability squared and

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.140
divided by r to the sixth, where
this is the separation.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.300
Not the radius but this
is separation.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.430
Dipole separation.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.440
And this is a font issue.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.510
This is proportional to alpha.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.400
So you can tell the
difference.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.870
This is a proportional
that's to alpha.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.940
Of course you can't tell
the difference.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.790
This is contextual.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.880
If I just wrote this by
itself, you don't

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.310
know what it is.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.150
My goodness you're nervous.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.590
So nervous.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.590
All right let's take
a look at--

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.680
here's the cartoons.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.640
Induced dipole.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.160
And here's London's paper.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.710
Here's London's paper as it
first appeared in 1930.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.190
Theory and System of
Molecular Forces.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.930
And here's some cartoons
from your book.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.630
This is helium, showing
helium.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.680
It's kind of funny how
the artist shows.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.150
Like there's these two helium
atoms and they're absolutely

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.160
immobile and all of a sudden one
of the helium atom starts

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.700
jiggling and then it induces
a dipole moment

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.750
in the other one.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.740
That's not how it happens,
but anyway.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.560
Alright this is hydrogen.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.150
Same thing as iodine.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.000
All right so there's delta
plus, delta minus.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Because the electrons are moving
even though there's a

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.210
strong covalent bond inside.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.310
So let me just make the point, I
want to make sure people are

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.950
very clear about primary versus
secondary bonding.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.610
So if I look at iodine.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.660
I2.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.080
This is a covalent bond.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.360
It's homonuclear.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.480
This covalent bond, there's
no net dipole moment.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.840
Here's another iodine.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.000
But then we have time
fluctuating dipoles.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.690
So this delta minus isn't
because this is the bond here.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.020
This is the primary bond.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.660
This is the primary bond
and it's covalent.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.110
And this is the secondary
bond.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.073
And the secondary bond is London
Dispersion Force or van

00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:17.360
der Waals bond because this
is induced dipole.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.500
So now let's look at-- oh
here's another one.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.970
This one gets on my nerves.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.460
Oh actually this is good.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.140
This is this the bad one.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.300
All right so I'm going to
show you polarizability.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.510
So here's a series of sp3
hybridized chains.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.580
Propane, octane, icosane.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.630
They're all the same.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.330
They look like this.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.000
Ch is sp3 hybridized.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.650
And so you just have--

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.240
so what is that, C 3 H H.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.650
So it's just--

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.320
so you have 1, 2, 3 4. so
there's hydrogen, hydrogen,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.780
hydrogen, and on the fourth one
I'm going to make it flat

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.130
instead of trying to
make a tetrahedron.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.980
So 1, 2, 3 hydrogens.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.420
The fourth one is carbon.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.610
1, 2 hydrogens, carbon carbon.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.220
1, 2 3 hydrogens.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.740
So this is C3H8.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.620
And compare that to
the longer one.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.170
Which is octane,
which is C8H18.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:21.790
So it's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.970
And all you have got to do is,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.930
You put four sticks off
of every carbon.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:29.900
You can't go wrong.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.540
You count them up.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.510
You got C8H18.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.500
Look at the structures.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.570
They are the same.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:41.220
So how come propane is a gas
at room temperature?

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.940
Whereas octane, which is the
principal constituent of

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.780
gasoline, is a liquid
at room temperature?

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.310
It all comes down to
polarizability.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.060
This one's got a
longer corral.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.320
So if you like the delta minus
versus the delta plus, it's

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.540
basically the same here except
that separation is bigger.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.590
All right, so that's
pretty good.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.380
This is the one that
gets on my nerves.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.110
You see this?

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.150
It's exactly what I
just showed you.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.010
So here's methane.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.460
And there's the propane.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.120
Here's butane and somewhere
between butane and pentane we

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.250
cross the the line at
room temperature.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.960
So pentane is liquid,
butane is gas.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.220
And you keep going up, up, up,
and finally if you get to C20

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.420
you go from liquid to solid
because now the van der Waals

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.180
forces are strong enough that
even at room temperature you

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.810
make a solid.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.710
It looks like paraffin.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.450
That's why you can melt
paraffin, because it's got

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.280
weak van der Waals forces.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.420
So temperature disrupts and it
reforms. If you try to break a

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.980
covalent bond, you pyrolyze
the thing and you

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.320
don't get it back.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.540
Secondary bonds allow for
ready processing.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.400
Here's what bothers
me about this.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.310
Instead of talking about
polarizability, which is a

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.426
physical quantity that
means something.

00:20:54.426 --> 00:20:55.480
They say molecular weight.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.340
Well it's true that these
scales, these are heavier and

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.460
it's monotonic.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.340
But to me what's the relevant
physics between the ability to

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.120
form van der Waals bonds
and the mass.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.350
It's just a dumb thing.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.030
It's not a gravitational
effect.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.760
So that's why this
thing is stupid.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.800
And you see it all over
in chemistry books.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.630
And it's just dumb.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.040
And if you put that on my
exam you're not going to

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.770
get points for it.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.020
Because that's dumb.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.810
OK let's go to the next one.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.270
There's a third type
of bonding.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.950
There are certain things I feel
strongly about and that's

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.170
one of them.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.680
OK so let's look at the third
type of secondary bonding.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.600
The third type of secondary
bonding is

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.120
called hydrogen bonding.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.010
Hydrogen bonding.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.560
It's a type of secondary
bonding.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:54.300
And it occurs between hydrogen
and the most electronegative

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.760
elements, fluorine,
oxygen, nitrogen.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.410
Why these?

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.700
Because they have very,
very high average

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.000
valance electron energy.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.960
So the average valance electron
energy I'm quoting in

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.530
that second column, not
megajoules per mole, but in

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.190
sensible units like
electron volts.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.440
And so you can see, when you get
up around 18, 19 electron

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.560
volts you cross a threshold.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.320
And that's the electronegativity
as

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.320
represented by average valance
electron energy.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.660
So you can see that as the
electronegativity gets beyond

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.330
some threshold value, roughly
3, then you can

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.160
form hydrogen bonds.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:44.280
So this is owing to high average
valance electron

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.600
energy, or if you like
electronegativity.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:55.110
Which means very strong polarity
in the covalent bond.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.420
So you say, well there's polar
and there's even more polar.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.960
So let's see what happens.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.380
So I'm going to use a
prototypical value here.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.860
I'm going to look at HF.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.250
So if I look at HF let's go
through the Lewis structure.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.180
There's H with it's
1 electron.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.620
And F with the 7.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.570
And so we have a covalent
bond here.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.440
We know fluorine is the most
electronegative so we have a

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.120
dipole moment here.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.060
Now the dipole moment
is very strong here.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.450
This is an accounting procedure
to put the two

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.510
electrons, but it no way
represents the physical

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.810
position of these electrons.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.360
They're brought in very
close to the fluorine.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.840
So it's not some symmetrically
disposed between H and the F.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.500
So I can't tell anything
about whether HF is a

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.720
solid, liquid or gas.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.570
Why?

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.890
Because there's only
one sitting here.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.410
I have got to put at
least one more.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.440
Because this is a
primary bond.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.500
And it tells me how
H bonds to F.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.570
It doesn't tell me how one
HF bonds to another HF.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.980
So I'm going to put another
HF over here.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.360
So here's another HF.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.380
And it's also dipole.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.910
But there's something
special about that.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.640
Already there's a dipole-dipole
interaction.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.090
But the hydrogen bond
is much stronger.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.290
It's much stronger.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.390
And why is it stronger?

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.960
The electron in this hydrogen on
the right is pulled towards

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.140
the fluorine to such an extent
that this hydrogen is so

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.950
denuded of its electrons that
it's acting as proton-like.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:32.800
It's proton-like.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.890
Now don't tell people that
Professor Sadoway said that

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.370
hydrogen inside an
HF is a proton.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.600
It's not a proton but it's
starting to get more nearly

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.435
like a proton.

00:24:42.435 --> 00:24:44.680
Now what do we know
about a proton?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.030
Positive charge.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.100
Tiny high-charge density.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:54.820
So this hydrogen's looking
forlornly over at its electron

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.220
that's being hogged by the
fluorine to a right.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.720
And what do we know
about these?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.990
Oh it's time for
colored chalk.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.100
It's time for colored chalk!

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.790
What color are those?

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.730
They're red because they're
non-bonding.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.270
And the bonding are the
blue in-between.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.040
And what do we know about
the volume occupied by a

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.010
non-bonding pair versus
a bonding pair?

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.090
It's larger.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.630
Because they're not
constrained.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.990
So not only do we have
a non-bonding pair,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.160
they're not just here.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.200
They're sort of flopping
around.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.840
Hanging way out and there's this
thing here that's almost

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.830
denuded of its electrons, so
it starts looking over here

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.910
saying, if I can't get
any action over

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.160
here, what about here?

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.645
So that proton starts
establishing contact with the

00:25:41.645 --> 00:25:47.100
non-bonding pair of electrons
on the adjacent fluorine And

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.560
this is the hydrogen bond.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.320
The hydrogen bond is here.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.220
The hydrogen bond is not here.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.590
If you write this I
will give you a 0.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.880
I'll give you a 0 with
a circle around it.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.260
It's called the doughnut.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.860
That's what you get when you
write something so stupid.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.200
This is not the hydrogen bond.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.870
This is the hydrogen bond.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.350
OK?

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.620
So it works.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.390
It works.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.180
Now let's see the
effect of it.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.320
Let's see the effect.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:22.190
Alright so here's a cartoon
showing that in water the

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.970
hydrogen-oxygen spacing
is about 1 angstrom.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.360
And the hydrogen-oxygen spacing
in adjacent water

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.600
molecules can be less than
2 angstroms. So there's

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.660
certainly a difference.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.610
I mean it can't be the same.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.120
If it were the same it would
be a covalent primary bond.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.870
You'd have a network.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:44.530
Now this is interesting here
because this shows the values

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.890
that are given on your periodic
table, which were

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.730
obtained without the
use the average

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.250
valance electron energies.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.830
These trends are correct.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.560
But look at this one.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.920
They've got chlorine
up at 3.16.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.660
And all of these have
been revised.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.880
Now on a test, just use what
you've been given on the

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.740
periodic table.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.790
But I want you to understand how
this is rationalized with

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.400
better data coming from
photoelectron spectroscopy.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.620
So now I want to show you the

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.050
implications of hydrogen bonding.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.230
The implications.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.580
So I've got 4 homologous
series.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.130
So they're all element
plus hydrogen.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.930
So let's start with
the group 14.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.180
That's shown here in purple.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.120
And what do we have?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.870
All of these, we'll start
with methane.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.440
CH4, so that's a central atom.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.480
1, 2, 3 4.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.910
They're all tetrahedral.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.500
Hydrogens at the corners.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.160
Non-polar.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.440
And no hydrogen bonding
capability.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.190
So one methane bonds to another
methane by weak van

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.890
der Waals forces.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:50.770
That's how it does it.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.910
It doesn't matter if I
substitute the carbon with

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.580
silicon or germanium or tin.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.840
I can put SnH4.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.020
And how does SnH4 bond
to another SnH4?

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.350
It's just by London
Dispersion Forces.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.120
That's all that's
operative here.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.250
And so we have, what makes
sense here, is that the

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.170
heavier, more massive--

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.040
no, the ones that have greater
polarizability have a higher

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.130
boiling point.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.660
Because their van der Waals
forces are stronger.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.350
That means you have to go to a
higher temperature to achieve

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.600
disruption.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.540
Same temperature, weak van
der Waals force: gas.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.540
Same temperature, strong
van der Waals

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.210
force: liquid or solid.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.870
And you see the boiling
point here.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.080
Monotonic from the lightest to
the heaviest. Now let's go to

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.550
the next one.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.820
Let's go to the green
line, group 15.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.540
Well group 15, what's
that look like?

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.690
Let's look at the structure
of group 15.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.250
Group 15 is--

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.920
ammonia is one of them.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.230
So we can look at the structure
of ammonia.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.690
And if we use VSEPR we'll
end up with something

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.370
that looks like this.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.350
I'll go through the
whole thing.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.110
You're going to end up with
three bonds like this.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.350
It's a tetrahedral skeleton
with a lone pair.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.420
Ah, colored chalk.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.610
So now, what happens?

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.180
I can't say anything
about this.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.470
Why can't I say anything about
whether this is a solid,

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.730
liquid or a gas?

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.030
It's the only one there.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.860
I have got to put another one.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.220
So put another one up here.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.470
N.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:16.120
H.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.690
H.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.210
H.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.990
Same gambit with the
hydrogen fluoride.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.520
This hydrogen sees this lone
pair and establishes a

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.720
hydrogen bond.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.500
And that adds to what otherwise
would have been a

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.390
dipole-dipole.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.500
This has a net dipole along
moment, agreed?

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.320
There's a dipole-dipole
moment here.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.230
But this bond is
even stronger.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.750
The hydrogen bond is even
stronger than dipole-dipole

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.990
interactions.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.330
So now let's look at
the graph up here.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:47.110
So what about in
phosphene, PH3?

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.410
No phosphorous isn't
electronegative enough.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:54.760
So in phosphene, in arsine and
in stibine we don't have

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.000
hydrogen bonding.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.760
So you see this series
in the group 4 here?

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.740
It goes monotonic from the
heaviest element down to the

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.540
lightest element.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.800
But here, heaviest, less heavy,
less heavy, and the

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.900
lightest element that should
be down here is up here.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.710
Why is the lightest compound
not down here?

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.070
Because of the addition
of hydrogen bond.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.980
So ammonia is off the line.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.050
This line shows the trend
based on dipole-dipole

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.210
interactions only.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.280
And you can see the
difference.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.260
See if you have van der Waals
forces alone, versus

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.470
dipole-dipole, dipole-dipole
are stronger.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.760
So SnH4 has a lower boiling
point than SbH3.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.420
I can't predict this but I could
ask you, if I gave you

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.430
this data, I'd say, can you
explain this to me?

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:46.390
Let's keep going.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.420
Let's go to group 16.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.720
So, telluride, selenide,
suphide,

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.890
the oxide, H2O, water.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.580
It should have a boiling point
of minus 100 centigrade were

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.970
it not for hydrogen bonding.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.470
How does water work?

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.340
Again, SP3 hybridization.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:11.000
Oxygen, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.570
Two lone pairs.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.440
1, 2, H, H.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.300
And now what happens?

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.710
I bring another water
molecule over here

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.080
and hydrogen bonding.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.380
And that hydrogen bond raises
the temperature, raises the

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.920
requirement for thermal
disruption and moves the

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.250
boiling point of water up
to 100 degrees celsius.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.090
It it weren't for this
we wouldn't have this

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.020
conversation.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.580
Because we wouldn't have evolved
as a species capable

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:48.010
of conducting business at room
temperature if water boiled at

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.750
minus 100 celsius.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.166
Hydrogen bonding is critical.

00:31:52.166 --> 00:31:56.040
It's absolutely critical.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.150
So now you know.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.990
And this isn't just
some little bit of

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.730
pedantry for a professor.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.080
This is very important.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.830
Because we're going to learn
later that, when it comes to

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:14.010
biochemistry, we will
appreciate that most

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.920
biochemicals are made
of carbon, oxygen,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.670
nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.400
And that means you can have
hydrogen bonds here.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.990
And you can have hydrogen
bonds here.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.160
Hydrogen bonding is
critical to life.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.060
So this is a very important
thing to know about.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.210
OK we have a minute or two.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.120
So you can see polarizability
increases here but hydrogen

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.690
bonding operative here.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.810
That's explains the mystery.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.390
All right we're going to
jump over this because

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.950
we are out of time.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.030
And so I will simply show
you a few pictures.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.490
Pictures!

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.770
So this is a conference in
Copenhagen in June of 1936.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.160
And there's Fritz London.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.490
But look at who else is
at the conference.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:05.810
Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli,
Werner Heisenberg, Max Born.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.430
Remember the Born Exponent?

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.140
You better remember
it for Wednesday.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.620
This is Lise Meitner, you
haven't met her yet.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.880
We'll get to her.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.050
This is Walter Stern.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:15.510
Stern-Gerlach.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.470
And this is James Franck.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.440
That's just the first
two rows!

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.930
That's quite a conference.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.750
Here's a picture of Fritz London
sitting on a bench in

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.640
Berlin with Erwin Schrodinger.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.850
Schrodinger is brooding;
he's thinking.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.270
Fritz London is smiling.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:34.980
You know why?

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.330
Because he's figured it out.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.370
He's figured out.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.780
It's time-fluctuating dipole,
but he's not going to tell

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.570
Schrodinger.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.810
He's going to say, you have
to read about it.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.340
But you have to go
to the library.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.670
Because if you don't read the
primary sources, if you go to

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.560
Wikipedia, you won't
find this.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.520
Because this is not going to
be in Wikipedia in 1913.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.570
OK, last thing-- hold on, hold
on, hey wait a minute!

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.990
Where are you going?

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.250
We're not done yet.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.710
Did the professor say
class is dismissed?

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.360
No.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.720
So here's a biography of Fritz
London, which I would

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.940
recommend if you have
a few minutes and

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.020
you'd like to unwind.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.060
Go out, sit in the sun and
read something like this.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.130
It tells the story of how he
came up with these ideas.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.480
The rise of fascism
in the '30s.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.180
He comes to the United States,
takes a teaching position at

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.510
Duke University.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.020
All of the people that
he met along the way.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.450
All these people that we study,
all this stuff, it's

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:27.360
all there from his
perspective.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.480
And the perspective
of his biographer.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.670
Plus the pictures.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.460
So anyway, primary sources.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.970
Go read the primary sources.

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:38.010
All right, class dismissed.
