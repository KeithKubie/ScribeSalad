00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:23.050
[ Silence ]

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.590
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon
and welcome to the African

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.940
and Middle East Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.670
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, chief of
the division, and I'm delighted

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.240
to see you all here today for
this very special presentation

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.240
with Dr. Yoel Finkelman,
the Judaic curator

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.470
at the National Library
of Israel in Jerusalem.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.260
As most of you already know,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.470
our division is made
up of three sections.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.330
The African, the Middle East,
and the Hebraic sections.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.070
We're responsible for materials
from 78 different countries

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.330
in the Near East, Central
Asia, the Caucuses,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.120 position:56%
as well as from the entire continent
of Africa, North and Sub-Saharan.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.150 position:56%
And, we are very active in acquiring
and developing our collections,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.250
briefing our visitors coming from
all the countries of the region,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.400
organizing programs,
symposia, workshops.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.400
We also invite scholars and experts
who have researched and done work

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.450
in our areas of responsibility
to share with us their insights

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.250
and their findings, so that all
of us attending and participating

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.110
in the programs leave
enriched with new information

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.590
and a better understanding
of what the cultures

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.290
and the societies are about.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.050
We are particularly happy to
welcome Dr. Finkelman today,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.510
because he's a librarian
and shares similar interests

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.840 position:56%
with members of our Hebraic section.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.190
His presentation today,
entitled from "Bomberg

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.500
to Beit Midrash" discusses
Hebrew printing in Venice,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.530
a topic that complements one
that was discussed last month

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.950 position:56%
at the Low Library Symposium, and we
have members of the Low Library here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.330
to commemorate 500
years since the founding

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.990
of the Jewish ghetto Venice.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.130
But, to tell you more our
very own Sharon Horowitz,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.260
a senior reference librarian here,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.390
in the Hebraic section we introduce
Dr. Finkelman and the program

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.470
after which you will be invited
to see a wonderful display

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.780
of rare book related
to the presentation.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.380
So, Sharon, and thank you.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mary Jane,
good afternoon.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.740
On behalf of the Hebraic section
let me add my welcome to you all

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.010
to the African and Middle
Eastern Division meeting room.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.210
Thank you for joining us.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.790
As you heard I'm Sharon Horowitz,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.940
a reference librarian
in the Hebraic section.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.130 position:56%
The Hebraic section marks its
beginnings in 1912, with the receipt

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.410 position:56%
of 10,000 Hebrew books and pamphlets
whose purchase was made possible

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.740
by a gift from New York
philanthropist Jacob Schiff.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.930
From those humble beginnings,
our collections have grown

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.180
to around 250,000 items in Hebrew,
Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Persian,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.570
and other Hebraic script languages,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.220 position:56%
and also includes an important
collection of books in the languages

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.280
of Ethiopia, Amharic to
Grenya Angez [phonetic].

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.020
The section's holdings are
particularly strong in the areas

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.330
of Bible and rabbinic, Hebrew
language and literature,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.920
responsa and Jewish history.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.650 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.860
and to bring people
into the library.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.530
One way we do that is by holding
lectures and having programs

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.810
such as this one that we
are hosting here today.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.880
I'd like to call your attention
to the beautiful display of books

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.490
from the Hebraic section,
printed in 16th century Venice.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.430
The display and informative
checklist were prepared

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.020
by my colleague Dr. Ann
Brenner [assumed spelling].

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.510
Please allot time to look at
these books before you leave.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.940
Each book is numbered, and the
numbers correspond to a number

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.980
in the checklist, and so you
can follow along by yourselves

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.500
and see these beautiful things.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.070
The number one book is closest to
the entrance of the reading room.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.720
Today we are very fortunate to have
as our speaker Dr. Yoel Finkelman.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.030
Dr. Finkelman is the curator
of the Judaic collection

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.760
at the National Library of
Israel where he is responsible

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.450
for the acquisition of new and
rare items, digitization projects,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.320
and collection development.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.800
One item of business before
I turn the podium over.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.430
This event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.010
There will be a formal question
and answer period after the lecture

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.170
at which the audience is encouraged
to ask questions and give comments.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.710
Please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.880
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.510 position:56%
By participating in the question
and answer period you are consenting

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.380
to the library's possible
reproduction

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.190
and transmission of your remarks.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.510
And, now please join me in
welcoming Dr. Yoel Finkelmann.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:28.240
[ Applause ]

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.540
Is this clear?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, first, I want to
begin with thanks of my own,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.770
in particular to Dr. Ann Brenner,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.020
who's work in making this
event possible is important.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.110 position:56%
And, in particular for her work on
the exhibit in the back of the hall.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.210 position:56%
The Talmud has rather unpleasant
things to say about people who stand

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.100
in the presence of their teachers

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.540
and issue determinant
conclusions on matters of law.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.200
And, fortunately, our topic is
not actually about matters of law,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.100
otherwise it would be very
uncomfortable speaking

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.160
about 16th century Italian-Hebrew
printing in Dr. Brenner's presence,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.570
because I feel like an amateur
in the presence of an expert.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.860
In addition, I wanted
to thank Sharon Horowitz

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.660
and Gale Shirazi [assumed spelling]
who really put an enormous amount

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.160
of effort to make my visit
here, both for this lecture

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.900
and for some professional
meetings, possible.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.530
Finally, I want to say that I
remember visiting the Library

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.970
of Congress as a little kid on
a family vacation to Washington,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.330
and coming from a family
of bookworms and --

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.120
and nerds it was naturally
on our agenda.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.570
And, speaking here as an adult

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.350
in a much more official capacity
is really genuinely an honor.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.160
It's -- it's really
a trip to be here,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.610
if I can be a little less formal.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.640
I want to talk about a topic that's
really very close to my heart

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.180
and comes from the fact that deep

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.980
down I think I'm basically the
Yeshiva boy and that my attachment

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.970
to Jewish texts and my attachment

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.850
to rabbinic learning was
founded in the Beit Midrash.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.910
And, like many people who
spent time in the Beit Midrash,

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.320
you get used to these big tomes of
the Talmud, of the Shulchan Aruch,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.580
the code of Jewish law, of the tour

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.510
and another important
code of Jewish law.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.470
[Inaudible] a Jewish law, and
you can kind of take these things

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.360
for granted, and in
practice, if we think --

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.920
well, also as a kind of
naïve Yeshiva student,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.100
you take this for granted,
you get used to it.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.000
You also are not aware,
at least I wasn't,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.360
of the way in which the physical
materials, what we might call

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.880
in more broad terms the
technology of printing,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.290
affects directly what it is that
students do with one another.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.900
What is the encounter of
the learner, of the student,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.210
of the participant in
this learning process?

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.310 position:56%
What is the encounter of that person
with the text, with the knowledge

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.450
that is embodied in that
text, with fellow students?

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.990
And, as we'll see later on,
with longer arcs of history

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.550
and transnational groups
whose identity

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.260
and religious practice
has formed by these texts.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.780 position:56%
And, as I've gotten older, I've
gotten a little prospective on that,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.540
and I'm hoping that what we can
work on in the next few minutes is

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.290
to talk about how early 16th
century, particularly in Venice,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.740
was a major stopping
point for the development

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.410
of how rabbinic learning has
happened through the ages.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.180
Not that it doesn't have
a prehistory and not

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.610
that there weren't
developments afterwards.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.090
Finally, I should talk about --

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.970
mention that I'm talking about a
certain subset of rabbinic texts.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.020
The overwhelming majority of
Hebrew printings do not follow some

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.460
of the patterns we're
going to talk about.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:08.110
But, some of the most critical,
seminal, concrete works

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.640
that cemented rabbinic
self-understanding do fit into some

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.480
of the patterns we're
going to talk about.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.900
I'm going to start with
something a little bit inter --

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.660
actually anachronistic.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:32.200
And, this was a -- New York's Time
put up a really fascinating article

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.680
on -- on noise -- sound and its
relationship to architecture,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.220
and we're going to hope
that this cooperates.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.430
Right now, it's not cooperating.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.630
So, while we're at it
we'll skip over to a video

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.380
of a contemporary Beit Midrash.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.850
Do we have any sound here?

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.930
Here we go.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.270
Contemporary Beit Midrash,
a small Beit Midrash,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:14.180
and it is a noisy and loud place.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.860
We don't have to watch the entire
seven minutes of this video.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:24.370 position:56%
This is a small suburban environment
-- a small suburban environment,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.790
the North Miami Beach Kollel.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.320 position:56%
In Florida you get a sense of noise,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.200
books piled up on one another,
people in conversation.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.340
The learning occurs through
this kind of conversation.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.790
Now, if we go back --
let me see if I can get

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.290
that New York Times
thing to appear again.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.590
Here we go.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:53.270
This is a kind of sound
scape of the reading room

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.340 position:56%
in the New York Public Library, and
what the New York Times wants to get

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.050
across is that despite the fact

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.690
that librarians are famous
for their "Be quiet."

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.440
In fact, there's a great deal of
noise, conveniently the cart is

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.210
from the Jewish division, so it
ties right into what we're doing.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.250
And, there's actually an
enormous amount of ambient noise

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.370
in what is supposed to
be a quiet environment.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:19.740
These are two entirely different
conceptions of what the look

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.530
and feel of a study hall
is supposed to be like.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:28.440
In the New York Times case,
silence is punctuated by noise

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.170
that you would hardly notice,
unless you were sensitive to it,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.310
which the New York Times article
gives us the ability to do.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.290
And, the Beit Midrash -- and
this is a small Beit Midrash.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.580
If you go into the Beit Midrash,
let's say in the Near Yeshiva Shiva

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.030
in Jerusalem or the Lakewood
Yeshiva in New Jersey,

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.820
probably the two largest
Yeshiva's in the world today.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.900
The Lakewood Yeshiva at the moment
has between 7000 and 8000 students,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.130 position:56%
the size of a small university and
probably has more students than were

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.260
in Eastern European yeshivas in all

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.890
of Eastern Europe at
any given moment.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.940
You just -- it's just
cacophony it's just noise,

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.780
and without being overtly
anachronistic,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.310
although just being a little bit
anachronistic, I want to claim

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.910
that this is linked to some of
the decisions that were made

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.370
in the 16th century in terms
of printing of rabbinic texts.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.980
I've shown these pictures.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.880
Most of the items that we're going
to talk about are going to come

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.460
from the collection of
the National Library.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.000
We don't have a great collection
of glossed Christian sources.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.850
So, these are kind of -- had I
been a little more put together I

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.530
could've taken them from the
Library of Congress collection,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.510
but these are basically
items that I've kind

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.900
of picked up from the internet.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.600
These are early glossed
Christian Bibles and manuscript

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.780
in early printing, and
if you would show this

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.330
to any traditional yeshiva
boy, the first they'd say is,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.830
"Why is there a page of Talmud
written in Latin characters?"

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.920
And, in fact, this is kind of the
core of what I want to try to talk

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.190
about is this notion of a central
text in the middle surrounded

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.600
by apparatus or surrounded
by commentary

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.730
or what has become more
popular term is peritext.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.270
But, I don't like peritext
in this context as a term,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.590
because sometimes it's
really difficult to figure

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.400
out what's the text and
what's the peritext,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.650
what's central and what's not.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.540
And, in fact, this has become --

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.820
what's unique in these rabbinic
printings is not necessarily the

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.190
layout per se.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:43.180
What's unique is that this layout
became central and was maintained

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.100
for centuries well after these
kinds of glossed Christian bibles

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.940
and polyglot bibles and
works of canon law kind

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.240
of dropped out of fashion.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.280
A lawyer friend of mine, when
I was discussing this with him,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.800
told me that there are some basic
works of contemporary law that work

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.070
with similar kinds of apparatuses
-- apparati [phonetic] in --

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.790
in law school, but he
didn't send me any example,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.050
so I don't have them here.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.100
Now, in fact, if we start
looking at the Jewish sources

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:20.400
where I feel much more comfortable
talking, the kind of standard form

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.340
in manuscript versions, even
of glosses, of commentaries,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.590 position:56%
is going to be in manuscript form --

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.560
a manuscript of the
commentary itself.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.020
Let me take a step back and -- and
introduce what we're talking about.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.900
In traditional rabbinic
study, whether we're talking

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.140
about the Bible or whether
we're talking about the Talmud

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:45.420
or whether we're talking about
codes, you have a central text.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.250
The text is canonical.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.840
It's canonical not only in
the sense that it is part

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.970
of this larger collection of
works that are deemed holy,

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.850
but it is canonical
in that it had --

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:00.160
has a particular sacred status that
can often be defined in very clear

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.290
and unambiguous, sometimes
legal terms.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.230
So, the Bible is authoritative
in the Jewish tradition

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.440
as the literal word of
god, and while, in fact,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.610 position:56%
Jewish practices often quite removed
from what the bible describes based

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.290
on layers and layers of
rabbinic interpretation,

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.880
its status as canonical is
defined as the almost --

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.410 position:56%
the constitutional -- as the deepest
layer of the authoritative text.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.280
The Talmud is -- even the
Talmud itself is layered.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.750
The previous early stratum called
the Mishnah and the later stratum,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.140
also in two versions the Jerusalem
Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud,

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.230
which is itself a commentary
on the Mishnah.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.720
But, both of these have
very formal status.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.620
The Mishnah, is authoritative.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.220
The later Rabbis --
the Rabbis identified

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.710 position:56%
as Amu Raheem [phonetic] the authors
of the later Talmud, Babylonian

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.090
and Palestinian Talmud,
do not as a matter

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.620
of formal rule argue
with the Mishnah.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.920
They interpret the Mishnah.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.140
They often interpret the
Mishnah so creatively as to be

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.440
in practice legislating anew,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.070 position:56%
but formally a leader authority does
not argue with an earlier authority.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.890
After the closing of the
Babylonian Talmud, for all intents

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.050
and purposes later authorities
do not argue with the Talmud.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.690
They interpret the Talmud,
and they interpret the Talmud,

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.370
and therefore determine
matters of law.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:31.060
At some point, we'll talk a
little bit later about this,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.030
[inaudible] which he quite
explicitly states he wants

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:38.080
to be the final word -- he wants
this to be the authoritative voice

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.340
of what everybody has to follow.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.780
And, the collective Jewish
community with the exception

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.090
of a certain subgroup

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.720
of the Ammonite Jewish community
essentially ignores him,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:53.000
while the Shulchan Aruch, the
16th century code of Jewish law,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.820
gains for itself this status
-- formal status of authority.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.180
Now, what happens with these works

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.760
of canon is naturally
they are ambiguous,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.090
because all texts are ambiguous,
but in particular the Talmud --

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.110
the Bible is ambiguous,
because isn't terribly concise.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.530
And, the Talmud is ambiguous,
because it telegraphs all kinds

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.250
of information and is virtually
incomprehensible on its own

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.830
without some kind of commentary.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:23.730
And, later codes by virtue of
shrinking much larger material --

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.750
much more expansive material
into a bottom line leave

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.050
out all kinds of details.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.170
So, here we have ambiguous texts
that are formerly authoritative

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.220
and part of the canon, and
they give rise to commentary.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.540
Now, what do you do
with these commentaries?

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.440
How do you visualize them?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.740
How does the student see them?

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.040 position:56%
How do you lay them out on the page?

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.220
How do you present
them to the student?

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.730
Now, like all printing
endeavors it's some combination

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.940
of finances, technology,
and culture.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.660
How much can we afford?

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.450
What are we capable to do?

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.390
What does the technology enable
us to do, and culturally,

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.500
what matters to us, and
how does it matter to us?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.850
Chicken and egg problems here
are going to become complicated,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.030
but let's look at this,
essentially a random example.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.940 position:56%
Fifteenth century Italian manuscript
of [inaudible] the Pentateuch,

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.230
Rashi [assumed spelling] the most
important mediaeval commentator,

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.110
probably the most important
Jewish commentator ever --

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.240
his commentary both on the Bible

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.400
and on the Talmud are
absolutely indispensable.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.940 position:56%
And, for all intents and purposes,
certainly in the case of the Talmud,

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.110
less so in the case of the Bible,
but for all intents and purposes,

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.870
if the Talmud is ever printed,

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.240
it is certainly printed
with Rashi's commentary.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.830 position:56%
If the Bible is printed, it is also.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.850
If it's printed with
any apparatus at all,

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.230
it's with Rashi's commentary,

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.850
but here we have simply
Rashi's commentary

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.460
without the text upon
which it is commenting.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.210
Why? Because, manuscripts are too
expensive to waste time and space

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.170
on anything else, and a patron
who is ordering a manuscript copy

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.830
of Rashi's commentary on something
presumably already owns a --

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.290
a copy of the text upon
which Rashi is commenting.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.220
Or, at the very least knows
that text by heart or assumes

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.700
that the scholar is going
to know that text by heart.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.710
So, let's save a lot of
money and a lot of resources

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.780
by simply treating the commentary
as if it is a separate volume.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.430
But, of course, Rashi's commentary

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.810
on the bible cannot be
read cover to cover.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:36.430
It can't be done, because it's
really a series of short paragraphs

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.250 position:56%
that are comments on a particular
word or a particular biblical verse,

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.360
and there is no obvious connection
between one line and the other.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.890
It can only be read as a line
by line commentary on the Bible.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.290
And, therefore, this book on
its own is virtually useless

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.840
without either knowing
the biblical text by heart

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.100
or having a manuscript copy of it.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.420
Even more dramatically is
Rashi's commentary on the Talmud.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.060
Here, also a 15th century
manuscript.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.330
Rashi's commentary
after its publication

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.960
or after its appearance became
absolutely indispensable.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.560
And -- and [inaudible] has
argued completely convincingly

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.650
that Rashi's commentary
made it possible for people

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.220
to study Talmud independently
by filling in all kinds of gaps

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.520
and understanding what's going on.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.830
Here, too, we have
simply the commentary.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.500
It is useless without the Talmud,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.010
but the Talmud is not
presented here.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.140
Again, let's save some money.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:44.410
If we move to the incunable period,
here we have psalms with Radak,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.400
Rabbi David Kimchi's commentary,

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.150
an extremely important
commentary here from 1477.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.850
And, here we get to
play a little bit.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.700
Notice the page layout.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.700
We have the text of the Psalms
themselves in block square letters,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.770
and we have the commentary in,

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.450
what we would call
today, a different font.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.930
What's the text and what's
the power text, right?

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.520
The Psalms here are not the text.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:19.110 position:56%
The text is Kimchi's commentary, and
the psalms are there to enable you

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.590
to study Kimhi's commentary,
because this is a lousy way

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.410
to present the text of the psalms
themselves, because if I wanted

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.710
to recite psalms as a ritual
kind of prayer or if I wanted

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.400
to study psalms as part of biblical
poetry, this is a terrible way

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.770
to do it, because one psalm
of seven or eight verses

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.440
or 15 verses is going to be
laid out on three or four pages.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.740
And, I have to skip
stuff in the middle

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.790
to read the text of the psalm.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.000
The -- the text of the
verse is there to enable me

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.610
to study the commentary of Kimchi.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.950
Now, we move forward to
something that starts

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.860
to look a little bit
more like the page layout

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.480
of a standard Talmudic text today.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.820
Here, a Spanish -- Pentateuch --

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.310
commentaries of Rashi and the
ancient Aramaic translation

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.400
of Onkelos beginning
to lay out in columns.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:17.180
Looks a little bit more like
a polyglot Bible as well,

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.440
with the text of the
Bible in the middle

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.120
with -- with the vowel markings.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:30.440
And, here, we start to see
a more interesting interplay

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.070 position:56%
between the texts that are laid out.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:40.410
So, that's a kind of transition.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.510
Now, we move forward into
Venice in the sixteenth century,

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.880
and we start to see things
that are more complicated.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.030
Now, part of what's going on here,
as we start to see these kinds

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.380
of texts, is that printing
enables lowering of prices.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.780
Printing enables much
more of an ability to plan

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.300
in advance how you want to lay out
these texts, so that you can fit

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.570
on a page something
quite this complicated.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.410
There were attempts to do
things like this in manuscript,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.760
but they weren't able to include
quite as much as what's going

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.850
to be included here, and you
have a market that is interested.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:26.610
Here, we're looking at the
second edition of Bomberg's --

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.630
Daniel Bomberg's "Mikraot
Gedolot" a rabbinic Bible.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.840
Certainly will be celebrating
next year the --

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:38.070
the 500th anniversary of the
first rabbinic Bible in 1517,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:43.740
and a copy of the first rabbinic
Bible, the first Mikraot Gedolot is

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.690
in the exhibit space in the back.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:52.060
And, it's in the top five of the
most important printing events

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.670
in the history of the Hebrew book.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.970
We're using the second edition,

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.840
because the second edition is the
one focused more on Jewish readers

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.120
than the first edition,
which was more focused --

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.810
again, this is a matter of
degree, not a matter of kind,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.090
but more focused on
Christian readership.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:15.450
And, here what we have -- I don't
know, can you see my -- the arrow?

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.980 position:56%
Okay, we have the text of the Bible.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.340
We have the Aramaic --
ancient Aramaic translation,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.250
the commentary of Rashi,
indispensable.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:31.620
The commentary of the Spanish
mediaeval exergy Eben Ezra,

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.630
and as well the Masoretic notes.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:42.810
The Masoretic notes which had
outside of a small circle of kind

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.320
of OCD people who were really
concerned with the exact spelling

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.260
of every last word in
the Masoretic edition

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.400
of the bible had largely
fallen into day

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.060
to day disuse by a typical reader.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.330
But, in the Mikraot Gedolot

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.370
in Bomberg's rabbinic bible
they were absolutely critical,

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.710
because one of the most important
influences of this publication is

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:10.090
that it really set the fixed
Masoretic text from then on.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.280
But, I'm less interested in
the history of the text --

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.020
the Masoretic text of the bible
itself and more interested

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.130
in what we've got going on here,
which is a primary text laid

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:24.620
out in the middle, multiple
commentaries laid out around,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.180 position:56%
and what is also going to become
critical -- we'll see more examples.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.190
The commentaries are
aware of each other.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:36.370
That is to say Rashi on this side
of the page comments on the Bible.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:41.460
Eben Ezra comments on the Bible,
but also explicitly makes reference

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.030
to Rashi's previous commentary.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.470
So, we have on the
page a conversation,

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.240
a three-way conversation
that's going on.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.190
Another example -- we can kind
of multiply these examples,

00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:00.500
and we see the way -- Alfasi,
the great north African -- the --

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.350
who's -- who's [inaudible] --
who's work kind of summarizing

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:10.130
and condensing the Talmud
into its bottom line,

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.860
was often studied as the primary.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.640
There was a while when people were
not quite sure whether the Talmud

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.360
was going to become the most
important Jewish rabbinic text

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.810
or Alfasi's was going to
become the major core of study.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:30.030
And, here, too, we get -- we get
the central text in the middle,

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:38.030
[inaudible] Eben Habib commentary
on Alfasi, also from Bomberg.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:43.330
Now, we're going to talk a little
bit about Talmud, because Talmud is

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:52.580
in many ways the core -- observant
Jews today are certainly much more

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.280
Jews of the Talmud than
they are of the Bible.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.430
So, here we have a
1482 incunable edition

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.390
from Spain, [inaudible] Kiddushin.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.690
Nope -- spelling error there.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.230
It should say Kiddushin,
not Kiddush.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.530
And, here, again, you see this
kind of multiple text on the page.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.020
It's clear that the
Talmud is the core text.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.420
Rashi's commentary on the outside,
but the standard page of Talmud,

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.330
which we'll get to later
on, had not yet formed.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.450
But, as we move forward,
some [inaudible] Talmud,

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.280
we also have a volume
of that in the exhibit.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.820
Fifteen -- this is a 1510 edition.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:38.010
He begins including not only the
Talmud in the middle of the page,

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.060
but Rashi and the commentary
of the Tosephists,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:46.200
the Ashkenazi commentaries
on the Talmud.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.380
Now, let's just skip ahead

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.380
to one more page before we talk
a little bit about what's going

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.670
on here in these Talmuds.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.710
Another typo, it should say 1520.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.280
This is a Bomberg edition.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.740
Bomberg -- Daniel Bomberg,
the printer --

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.690
Venice printer is particularly
important,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.820
probably the most important
printing of the Talmud

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.760
because he was the first to
print the complete edition

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.060
of the Babylonian Talmud.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.190
And, in addition to
that, he also made --

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.100
well, he did two things that
became absolutely critical

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.400
in the future of the Talmud.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.720
The first is that he
paginated all the pages.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.880
Not simply paginated them
for his particular edition,

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.460
but he was very conscious

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.490
about setting a fixed
pagination for the entire Talmud.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.500
Only he could do it
because he's the first one

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.250
to ever print the entire thing.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.440
And, he was conscious of this,
and instead of simply being able

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.880
to reference a page of
Talmud, the third chapter of --

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.310
of [inaudible] Kiddushin,
he would be able

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.720
to identify a much
smaller body of text.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.340
And, you could enable cross
referencing much more easily.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.220
He was very conscious of this,
and in fact, in further printings

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.670
of commentaries and codes he
would insert page numbers,

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:19.530 position:56%
references to his own edition of the
Talmud, creating a kind of monopoly.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.560
It's like, you know, buying Windows
and getting it packaged with --

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.740
with Internet Explorer, except
-- this little bit, I guess,

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.650
also anachronistic now, that
unlike your web browser,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.950
you can pick whatever
web browser you want.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:40.000
But, he essentially was able
to create a kind of dependence

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.920
on his edition of the Talmud
by printing later editions

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.360
with references to his own edition.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.960
So -- so that was one
thing that he did.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.290
The other thing that he did was
that he chose a particular edition

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.790
of the commentary of the
Tosephists to put together

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.050
with the commentary of Rashi.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.130
And, he had to edit a little
bit, and he had to cut things

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.800
down to get it to fit on the page.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.930
And, whether he made a good
decision about which manuscript

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.780
of the Tosephists to use
is a matter of some debate.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.660
But, it hardly mattered because
once he included that edition

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.040
of the Tosephists commentary on
the page it became the edition

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.410
of the Tosephists commentary.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.490
Now, we can start talking a little
bit about the content and talk

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:30.990
about what's going on in
his choice of commentaries.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.620
First of all, Rashi and the
Tosephists, despite the fact

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:40.160 position:56%
that they're both Ashkenazi, they're
both French-German world of thought

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.290
as opposed to the Spanish
and north African traditions

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:49.230 position:56%
of interpretation, they actually in
kind represent polar extremes of how

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.130
to go about commenting
on the Talmud.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:56.940
The Talmud is a complicated,
dense, obtuse, telegraphic text.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.600
It is virtually incomprehensible,
certainly today,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.740
without the commentary of Rashi,
who fills in gaps, explains what --

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.340
questions what cryptic lines means,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.240
fills in background
information, and the like.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.630
His goal is simply to
enable you to read the page.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.540
Well, simply -- that's not really
fair because he was such a master

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.640
of commentary that in the
process of teaching you how

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.580
to simply read the page and
make sense of the conversation,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:28.090
he's actually solving all kinds of
problems you weren't even aware of.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.100
And, one of the things that
good rabbinic scholars have

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.700 position:56%
to train themselves to do is to then
go back to the text of the Talmud

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.230
and pretend they hadn't read Rashi,

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.690
because how would another
commentary read this

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:43.880
without already having superimposed
upon me Rashi's assumptions.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:49.200
Now, the Tosephists
are worlds apart.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:55.710
They did something remarkable,
and they said the Mishnah,

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.780
the earlier stratum of the Talmud,
is a fairly straightforward text.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.630
The Talmud comes along and
complicates it by assuming, rightly

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.230
or wrongly, that the Mishnah
is a coherent and unified text

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.980
that doesn't contradict itself.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.770
And, the Talmud comes
along and says --

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.340
a later stratum and says the
earlier stratum of the Mishnah --

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.200
let's search -- hunt high and
low for contradictions and try

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.010
to solve those contradictions.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:25.570
The Tosephists do the
same thing to the Talmud.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.270
They assume that the Talmud itself,

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.960
and here at least historically
speaking,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.420
they're almost certainly
wrong, the Tosephists assume,

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.010
let's do to the Talmud what
the Talmud did to the Mishnah.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.500
Let's assume that the
Talmud itself --

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.360
the Babylonian Talmud is
itself incoherent text devoid

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.660
of any contradictions.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:48.210
Let's look high and low for
any imaginable contradiction

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.060
between any passage in the
Talmud and do all kinds

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.000
of creative interpretation
to solve that.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.930
The result is a reworking
of the Talmud,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:01.380
sometimes a reinterpretation,
sometimes an interpretation

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.970
that is radically different than
what appears to be on the page.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:06.730
The rule appears to
apply across the board.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.030
This is the law.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.820
It turns out it's only on
Tuesday afternoon double headers

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.120
with a lefty pitcher.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.400
Those are the kinds of things
that the Tosephists will do.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.900
And, so what you get on the
page are not only the text

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.300 position:56%
of the Talmud itself, the simple
straightforward commentary of Rashi,

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:29.020 position:56%
but the Tosephists that open up this
world of analysis and hyperlink --

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.750
I'm not the first one to notice
this parallel -- the hyperlink --

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.950
the Talmud to itself
and create this dialog.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.390
Now, so look what happens
in kind of an image

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:46.350
on the page is we get the
Talmud, which itself branches out

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.280
and create conversations
of the two commentators.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.380
And, again we get to two
commentators talking,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.070
not quite with each other,
because the standard opening line

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.570
of a paragraph of commentary

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:04.190
by the Tosephists is
perush akuntras [phonetic],

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.590 position:56%
which to oversimplify a little bit,
means this is Rashi's interpretation

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.360
of the Talmudic passage,
that is inevitably followed

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.800
up with vikasha [phonetic].

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.100
That's a problem.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.690
It doesn't work, because if
you interpret this passage

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.340
in the Talmud the way
Rashi wants you to,

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.870
you're going to create a
contradiction with another passage

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:28.350
in an entirely different volume
that you didn't even remember.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:34.250
Now, that's remarkable, probably
Rashi would have said in response.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.120
I'm not trying to solve
a problem over there.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.320
I'm just trying to tell you
how to read the page over here

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.560
in the simplest possible way.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.000
Again, this is setting it

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.460
up a little bit more
dichotomous than it actually is.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:52.320
But, you create this three-way
conversation on the page.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.670
Let's stop for second and
think about the experience

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.960
of the student who
opens up this page.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.850
What are -- we're going to put
on our teacher hats for a second.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.580
And, I'll skip ahead a little
bit to a contemporary work

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.840
of academic scholarship,
but let's make explicit --

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.220
the implicit assumptions
that are here on the page.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.210
The first is, that
there is a central text.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.840
The central text is the text of
the Talmud with the earlier stratum

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.120
of the Mishnah and the later
strata of the Talmud itself.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.430
That text is authoritative.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.260
It is in the center.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.490
It gets the nice woodcut
letters at the top.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.970
We're not exclusively
for holy texts,

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.860
but they certainly give it
a certain kind of weight.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.720
That text is central
and authoritative.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.270
Secondly, that text
is not transparent.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:46.630
You have to do some
work to understand it.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.330 position:56%
But, the work that you have to do to
understand it is going to be colored

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:54.380
by equally canonical commentaries.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.790
You are not alone in this endeavor
of interpreting the Talmud.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:03.920
You are working within an
established canon of commentaries.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.770
Third, the commentaries themselves
are in conversation with one other.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.230
They are explicitly in
conversation with one another.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:18.300
They are creating this
larger conversation.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.610
And, fourth, it is the job of
the student sitting with the book

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.220
to put all of this together.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.990
That, I think, is the single most
important educational philosophy

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.510
implication of this
type of page layout.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.960
It is -- is this my next slide?

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.440
It's not. But, let me go
ahead of myself a second.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.400
Here, is where Torskey's [assumed
spelling] introduction to the Code

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.840
of Maimonides [phonetic],
shows in largely random

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.260
because the previous slide,
which we haven't gotten

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.310
to yet, is of Maimonides Code.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.610
What is his assumption?

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:58.080
I mean, it doesn't have
to be Professor Torskey.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.100
It could be any other work

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.890 position:56%
of contemporary academic scholarship
laid out with the text on the top

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:07.810
and footnotes are peritext
on the bottom.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.450
The assumption is that there is
this older canon of literature,

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.850
that the Code of Maimonides
is a text worth understanding,

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.860
but that it is the
task of the scholar

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.240 position:56%
to do the interpretive work for you.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.130
Now, granted, he is not
an absolute authority,

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.850
despite what many professors
sometimes think.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:30.080 position:56%
He has a responsibility to you as
the reader to give you the footnotes

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.730
in the apparatus so that you can
go back to the original sources

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:37.700
and double check and see if you
find his interpretation compelling.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.830
But, ultimately, he is
doing the synthesis.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.820
It is the job of the author
of the academic monograph

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:50.760 position:56%
to do the synthesis for you, as
opposed to, if we go back previously

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.960
to our page here where the
assumption is that it is the job

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.420
of the student to do the
interpretive work him,

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.770
or increasingly, herself.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.170
Now, what happens in the just --

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:13.430
Justinian Talmud is in
addition to the Talmud, Rashi,

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:19.820
and the Tosephists, we
get two other tools.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.690
We get a set of explicit
hyperlinks of explicit footnotes

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:32.710
that cross reference to the
Talmud to a set of other works.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.460
First of all, it cross
references the Talmud to itself.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.980
Sometimes the Talmud has
passages that appear more or less

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.480
in identical, or at the
very least similar versions,

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.160
in several different places.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.700
So, if you're learning
the passage here,

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.970
if you're studying the passage
here, you want to know how

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.780
that same passage appears,
if it's in the same text

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.580
or what context it's embedded
in in another track date.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.690
It cross references the Talmud
to the Biblical verses so that

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.840
if you're studying and
there's a reference to a verse,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.420
you can go back to the
original verse and look it up.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.200
And, finally and most importantly,
and these are the two arrows

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.120
that are headed out,
the amishbat [phonetic],

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.950
which cross references the
Talmud to codes of Jewish law,

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.350
particularly for our
purposes, Maimonides Code

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:25.060
and the Tor [inaudible] Ruch,
the two other major code --

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.880
well, the two other -- there's
also [inaudible], the large book

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.140
of commandments, which
due to various reasons

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.090
of intellectual history
doesn't maintain its same status

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.250
over the course of the
-- of the centuries.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:44.300
And, then you not only have this
kind of triangle of primary text,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.230
commentaries, and conversation
with other -- in --

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.760
in conversation with the student.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.240 position:56%
You have all of that in conversation
with several other volumes,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.170
all of which can be laid out
in an almost identical fashion.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.050
And, then the whole thing
becomes incestuous and impossible,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:09.690
especially since you might have
a reference to Maimonides Code,

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:10.990
and you might have a reference

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.350
to Joseph Karo's [assumed
spelling] Shulchan Aruch.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.300
And, lo and behold, at least in
later editions of Maimonides Code,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.560
who is one of the major
commentators on Maimonides Code,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.040
the same Joseph Karo who
authored the Shulchan Aruch.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:28.290
In other words, the thing
explodes exponentially.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.370
You don't have a linear
growth in the amount

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.200
of possible commentaries
and super-commentaries.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.120
You have an exponential growth, and
you have this kind of intricate web

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.230
of possible connections
between different volumes,

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.000
each of which has its own
intricate rabbinic page layout.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.750
Just for the sake of the
curiosity, 1616 crack out edition

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:54.190
of the Talmud reappears with
only the Talmud and Rashi,

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.500
but that is the exception
that proves the rule.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:03.260
Since Bomberg, every single
edition with -- I know of three.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.280
No, I know of two exceptions.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.750
Every single edition --

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:10.560
printed edition of the
Talmud afterwards builds

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.740
on Bombergs adds perhaps.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:21.200
But, basically uses Bombergs
format and page layout.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:27.760
Similar kind of thing going on
in the two infamous editions

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:33.370
of Maimonides Mishnah Torah,
Maimonides Code of Law from 1551.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.010
Justinian and Bragadeen
[assumed spelling].

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:40.130
Not only are these
extremely beautiful volumes,

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.350
at least from my personal
subjective perspective.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.230
I think the Justinian Maimonides
Mishnah Torah is perhaps the

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.950
beautiful Hebrew printed book ever.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:54.110
But, that's just my personal
subjective reaction to it.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:57.940
And, the absolute tragedy
that was created

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.550
by these two competing
simultaneous Venice editions

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.250
of the Mishnah Torah --
basically the chief rabbi

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:08.170
of Paduah [phonetic] had written
a commentary on Maimonides Code

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.190
and wanted to get it published.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.170
Justinian refused.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.470
Bragadeen agreed.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.550 position:56%
It was one of the first publications
that his publishing house published.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.170
When Justinian heard that there
was a competer opening up,

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.620
he quickly grabbed
parts of that commentary

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.860
and quickly issued his own version.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.000
This got [inaudible] and
Bogen [assumed spelling]

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.810
of Paduah very upset.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:36.880
He created a hullabaloo [phonetic],
turned to Rabbi Moses Isserles

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.380
of Crackow, the most important
rabbinic decider of the day,

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.200
and said, "You have to issue a --

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.700
a decree that nobody can buy
the new competing edition,"

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.430
which Rabbi Isserles did.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:53.730
And, the two Christian printers
eventually turned to the Pope

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.200
and said, "You figure this out."

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.580
And, he said, "Well, let's
take a look at what's written

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.320
in all this rabbinic stuff."

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.140
And, that eventually led to
the burning of the Talmud

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.500
and other important
rabbinic books in 1553.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.290
So, you have a kind of sharp
contrast between the beauty

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.590
of these printed volumes
and the tragedy

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.400
that ensued as a result of them.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.370
But, also you see the
same kind of page layout,

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:18.610
in some ways even more
elaborate, as well as some

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:24.880
of the interpretive hyperlink
apparatus along the commentaries.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.100
Just, you know, the -- the
two other major editions,

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.400 position:56%
which I don't really have time to go

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.850
through the whole history
of their printing.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.600
But, the Fortureem [phonetic] and
the Shulchan Aruch, two major codes

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.890
of Jewish law that were originally
printed also in a single text

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:44.730
in one volume, gradually developed
much more elaborate apparatuses.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.370
As well, here we have two editions
before kind of the transition

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:54.410
between just the text of the core
and the surrounding commentary.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:44:00.450
So, we talk a little bit about how
the educational philosophy of --

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:05.240
of contemporary academic
scholarship is somewhat different.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.990
I want to talk about two
other interesting things

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.480
that are going on here.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.640
The first is that another
thing that the Bomberg edition

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.040
of the Talmud did was to include,
in addition to the page itself,

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.220
several commentaries printed
independently in the back.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.830
He included Maimonides
Commentary of the Mishnah.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.130
He included the commentary

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:36.120 position:56%
of the Rush Rabino Asher
[phonetic], the Spanish commentator.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.840
And, so he's kind of expanding --
it may not be on the page itself,

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.770
but they're still there
in the volume.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:49.010
But, I want to point to
one thing in his inclusion

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:52.560
of Maimonides Commentary
of the Mishnah,

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.770
that involved not publishing
Maimonides Commentary

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.070
of the Mishnah.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.990 position:56%
But, by publishing a translation
into Hebrew of Maimonides Commentary

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:05.080 position:56%
of the Mishnah, which was originally
published in Judeo -- or --

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.610
printed in a -- appeared in
manuscript in Judeo-Arabic,

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:13.270
which was the vernacular at the
time that Maimonides was writing,

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.950
or the place -- time and place
that Maimonides was writing.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.490
So, some of this just kind
of create this dialog,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.610
to create this conversation
on the page

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.390
and in the volume and
with the students.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:28.080
Part of that involves reworking --

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.900
doing some work with the original
texts in order to enable them

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.140
to be part of this conversation,
because in Venice there were --

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.240
or the publications were not meant
for sale exclusively in Venice.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.540
Far from it.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.920
But, the European student --

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.130
rabbinic student was no
longer fluent in Judeo-Arabic,

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.980 position:56%
and needed this edition in Hebrew in
order to bring Maimonides Commentary

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.810
on the Mishnah into
the conversation.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.300
And, what is perhaps even more
interesting if we go backwards

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.860
to the Mishnah Torah
is that this layout

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.730
of the Mishnah Torah is
explicitly and unquestionably

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:12.250
in absolute violation of
the author's intention.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.010
Maimonides said explicitly in
his introduction to the code,

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.510
"I want this to be the final word.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.380
People waste an enormous
amount of time

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.770
with this convoluted
text called the Talmud."

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:28.550
There is something enormously
subversive and pretty arrogant

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.870
about what Maimonides
thought he was doing.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:35.410
But, given his conception of
how information is organized,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.540
and the Talmud's conception of
how information is organized --

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.030
the Talmud, information is chaotic.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.490
It -- it's created in conversation.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:50.190
It's like having an argument over
Thanksgiving dinner about politics.

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.580
Beside that being a terrible idea

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.630
and studying the Talmud
is a good idea.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.610
But -- but the -- the --
you start on one thing,

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.490
and you think you're talking
about this that and the other.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:00.160
And, then it turns out you're
talking about something else,

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.870
because somebody --
you said, you know,

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.540
how much you appreciate
this candidate.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.840
And, somebody said that
makes you an idiot.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.070
And, then you're talking about gun
control, and then you're talking

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:11.380
about the economy, and then
you're talking about whatever.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.840
And -- and that's how the
Talmud organizes information.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.680
And, Maimonides organizes
information systematically.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.190
Point one, point two, point
three, definition of terms,

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.430
implications of those
definitions of terms.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.480
And, Maimonides was
trying to undercut.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.400
And, who wins in these editions?

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.870
In these editions that
we're looking at,

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:34.070
these 16th century
edition, the Talmud wins.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.480
I mean, Maimonides wins also,

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.140
because he becomes
part of the canon.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.430
But, his core conception of how
information is to be transmitted

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:45.130
and discussed and organizes
loses in the face of the Talmud.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.990
The Talmud emerges victorious.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.550
It's not organized.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.750
It's too complicated
to be organized.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.800
You can only understand this text
and this idea and this definition

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.710
of a term by echoing out all the
other definitions and bringing

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:00.090
in another text that's
tangentially related.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:05.100
And, you have to bring in all these
other people and make a big mess.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:10.560
It's explicitly against -- and
the -- against Maimonides wishes,

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:19.240 position:56%
and what these printers are doing
is forcing Maimonides to become part

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.570
of the Talmudic tradition
of how interpretation

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:27.340
and in how conversation
and how study occurs.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.600
I also want to look --
this is a lousy picture.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.640
And, we can go off on kind of
the history of printing any

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.890
of these books and see how
this page layout plays out.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.500
This is a 20th century
edition of the Mikraot Gedolot

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.850
of the rabbinic Bible, published
by Mossad Harafkok [phonetic].

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:50.880
The semi-academic printing
house in Jerusalem and the --

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.690
it's a lousy picture, but you have
the text of the Bible over here,

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.760
the text of the [inaudible]
translation into Aramaic,

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.640
which very few people
understand today.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.250
The text, various medieval
commentaries.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.400
We could talk a lot about
which commentaries get in

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.010
and which commentaries get out.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:10.030
For the 20th century,
late-20th century reader,

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.030
mystical interpretations are out.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.080
Shot-oriented, simple reading
interpretations are in.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.090
But, we also get -- you can barely
see them here on this bad --

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:24.350
but some of the academic
apparatus at the bottom.

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.660
They want to make sure they have
good manuscript -- I mean, every --

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.880
history of printing, they
also cared a great deal

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.030
about getting good manuscripts.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:32.900
But, here there's going
to be footnotes,

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.870
there's going to be
explicit conversation

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.550
about which manuscripts they used,

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:39.080
what the proper reading
is, and the like.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.380
So, you end up getting --

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.250
this tradition carries over
into the 20th and 21st century.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.850
We could talk about --
I'm running way over time.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:51.360
So, look what ends up happening.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.960
Two more final points.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:59.420
What you get is on a single
volume, blue are the time periods

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.930
of the people on the
page of the Talmud,

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:06.070
the Mishnah in the third
century, the second of 200,

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.300
and the Jerusalem Talmud,
the Babylonian Talmud,

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.400
Rashi's commentary over
the course of history.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.980
The history -- the conversation
is not only happening on the page,

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.440
it's happening across time.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:18.100
And, if you add the red boxes,
are the people to whom --

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:25.430
the books to whom -- which are
referenced by the Amishbat,

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:32.100
by the other -- by the hyperlinks,
by the footnotes in the margins.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:37.800
So, you end up getting
across time conversation.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:43.110
And, you also end up getting
a transnational conversation

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:47.350
because you can map where
are these people are from.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.380
And, where they're writing, and
you end up having a conversation

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:54.240
between numerous people who
are either present on the text

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.890
or immediately referenced
to -- to the text.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.990
So, I'm over time but I
want to summarize by saying,

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.360 position:56%
if we go back to our original video.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.080
The Beit Midrash is populated
by people in conversation, loud.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.560
And, part of that is this
notion of dialogic reading

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.210
in which the student is
responsible for putting together,

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:23.520
making synthesis out of this
chaotic conversation that is

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.110
across generations
and transnational.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:31.400
And, 16th century Venice
is a central location

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.830
for the creation of that.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.160
Chicken and egg questions,
did the print create this?

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.710
Yeah, sometimes Bomberg's choice of
this edition of the Tosephists made

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:44.090
that the authoritative
edition of the Tosephists.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.060 position:56%
But, he couldn't have published an
edition of the Talmud without Rashi,

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.600
because that was already
established as the text.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.650
So, chicken and egg
questions are interesting.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.510
Thank you.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:01.040
[ Applause ]

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.970
We have about three
minutes for questions.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.840
Yeah, go ahead.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.930
I sort of walked in to [inaudible].

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:19.230
It's like [inaudible].

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.850
&gt;&gt; Yes. Correct.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.170
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:24.470
Yes, correct.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.770
There's this whole-- .

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:27.070
&gt;&gt; -- [Inaudible] and
the remarkable fact

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:31.500
that so many of them
are [inaudible].

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:40.500
Do you have any sense of
where that knowledge comes

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:46.340
from and how that happened?

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:52.500
&gt;&gt; Other than -- I don't want
to say anything absolute,

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:58.950
but the Christian printer, Bomberg,
who hires and works with Jews

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:02.640 position:56%
or converts to Christianity who were
Jewish and were rabbinic scholars,

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.570
or in the course of their work
converted to Christianity.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:09.300
Since some of this is in the
air, some of it is, you know,

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.730
the fact that Venice is
such a central location

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.320
for the transmission of -- of --

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.820
of goods, but therefore
also information.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.980
And, he hired people who
really cared about this stuff.

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.300
It was really a very
small group of people.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.370
&gt;&gt; Where did they [inaudible]?

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:31.040
How did [inaudible]
who'd know [inaudible]?

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.230
&gt;&gt; Well, the Ashkenazi
Jewish culture

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:39.940
in the early Middle Ages per capita
was the most prolific rabbinic --

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.980
I mean, they were tiny
Jewish communities

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.660
that produced per capita enormous
amounts of rabbinic scholarship.

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.970
So, that -- then that
begs the question, but-- .

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.630
-- Yeah?

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:55.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:01.580
I -- I wanted to ask you a
question on two of the pictures

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.020
that show [inaudible] Aramaic text.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.380
What is the relevance
of this Aramaic text?

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.680
Why is it [inaudible]?

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, the Aramaic
commentary, the --

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.590
or the translation of [inaudible]
is an ancient Aramaic commentary

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:21.540
that was written and came into use
when Aramaic was the vernacular.

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.480
It already in the Talmud
it's referred

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.210
to as having a certain
canonical status.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.540
And, the -- there is even
a law that requires --

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.960
a law that is largely
kept in the breach,

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.250
of reading every week a portion
of the Bible twice and once

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.290
that particular translation.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.280
It's a really great way of learning
Aramaic if you don't know Aramaic,

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.580
to study the Bible that way.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.050
But, it largely feel into disuse
once Aramaic fell into disuse,

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.560
but it was -- it was
part of the canon.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.780
And, it's also in interesting
interpretation.

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.890
It's a trans -- it's -- it's
an important stage and move

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:05.490
in rabbinic Judaism away
from strict anthropomorphism.

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:07.360
The Bible the is very
anthropomorphic

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.910
and this translation tries to
limit the anthropomorphism.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.930
But, it's part of the canon.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.230
It's almost as if-- .

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:16.230
&gt;&gt; -- It's only [inaudible].

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.540
&gt;&gt; It's not -- I mean, every
translation is a commentary,

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.930
but it doesn't include
overt, extra commentary.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.800
Yeah?

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:33.280
&gt;&gt; The [inaudible] to hire
experts, he has to know who is

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.790
that [inaudible] Bomberg
to manage it.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:39.750 position:56%
He has to know how to make decisions

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.010
and [inaudible] Bomberg
is a Christian,

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:46.310
and I would assume
he's not [inaudible].

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:47.610
How does he manage?

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.090
&gt;&gt; He -- he's not a Talmudic
scholar, but he is a humanist.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:55.580
And, Renaissance Italy is a place
where, I mean, the first edition

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.190
of the rabbinic Bible is -- is --

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:01.470
is much, again, it's
not a matter of kind.

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.770
It's a matter of degree.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:06.520
But, as -- is -- is with
a very Christian spin.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.150
It's meant to appeal
to Christian readers.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.640
And, there is a group of --

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:18.270
increasingly growing group of
Christian people who read Hebrew

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:21.650
or are interested in the Talmud
who have certain basic knowledge.

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:26.480
I don't know what Daniel Bomberg's
own level of Hebrew reading

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.790
and -- somebody else knows.

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:29.090
&gt;&gt; He's supposed to be [inaudible].

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:30.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:32.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:39.480
Okay, so -- so, you know,
he knew enough to know

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.360
who to talk to, and he cared a lot.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.690
I mean, he was a business man.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:45.990
He wanted to make money.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:50.170
But, he understood that -- that
you have to create a good product

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.290
for a knowledgeable audience.

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:59.960 position:56%
You know, he wanted to brand himself
as the Harvard University Press

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:04.720
and not as, you know,
the fly by night Amazon,

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.290
you know, print on demand.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:08.060
And, he was a good business man.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.920
He -- he knew what he -- how
he wanted to brand himself.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.720
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very, very much.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.320
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.620
Thank you all.

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:20.920
&gt;&gt; I really appreciate it.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.410 position:56%
And, again, please do take a look at
the exhibit which Dr. Brenner has --

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:29.840
has put together, because it's
a really fantastic overview --

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.180
get a real sense of what
16th century Hebrew printing

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.480
in Venice looked like.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.590
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
