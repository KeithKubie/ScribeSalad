MANO MARKS: Hi.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.980
This is Mano Marks.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.740
This is the third episode in a
miniseries designed to show

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.140
you how to get started with the
Google Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.980
In this episode, we'll walk
through creating a map in your

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.970
default view controller.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.450
This builds on the first two
episodes, which showed you how

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.900
to set up your development
environment and add the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310
framework to your application.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.030
Let's take a look at the
ViewController.m file.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.460
First, you import Google Maps.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.040
Then you create a map view
in the Load View method.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.250
Create a GMSCameraPosition
object with the latitude,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.850
longitude, and zoom level.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.770
This is the initial position
that the map will view when it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.320
is created.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.540
Now, make the map view object
with the camera position

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.270
you've just created.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.880
Turn on the My Location, which
creates the blue dot that the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.430
application uses to show the
device's current location.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.120
And then finally,
create a marker.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.250
In this case, you're going to
create one at the same center

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.510
camera position that
you used earlier.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.350
Give it a try.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.520
Run the simulator.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.060
The first time it runs, it'll
ask if the application can use

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.420
your location.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.550
Then you should see a map
centered in Sydney, Australia,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.140
with a marker on it that, when
you click on it, it creates an

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.550
info window with Sydney
and Australia in it.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.920
All right.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.490
That's it.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.050
You've created your first map
in your application, and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.300
you're ready to go.
