Speaker 1:          00:00          Because if you don't get fed that you don't find out about Julian Assange getting kicked out of the embassy in London, you don't find out about a million different stories that are in the news.

Speaker 2:          00:10          It's a fun story. It's a cool story, but do I need to know it? Wow. It's a fun story. That's a quote for you from now on. Hey, what about Shalina such Tom Papa, hands up in quotes. It's a fun story. It's a cool story, but I don't need to know it. Holy Shit. Really? You just redefined white privilege. Well, you hit it. You hit it on the head. Let it off fire. No, it's seriously. What can I do about a lot of these? You know, look, I think it's good that the information is flowing and that moves everybody forward, but you know, for me, sitting in there trying to tell some jokes and feed my kids, it's like, do I need to know everything, every trouble spot going around the world. It's like, that is a very good question.

Speaker 1:          00:51          How much responsibility do you have to be tuned in to all the events of the world and to act? Or how much responsibility do you have outside of voting? And do you have the responsibility to vote? Cause there's some people that are very interesting people that don't vote. Yeah. You know, I don't agree with that. Yeah. I want to participate. I understand that. Um, but I don't think Michael Malice votes doesn't, he does it. Didn't he say he doesn't vote? I think he said he doesn't, I forget his reasoning, but it was very logical.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Uh Huh. No, I understand the argument, but I am, even if it seems kind of false and I just, I think it kind of like mentally engages you in the world. It's like you should be trying to participate. I think

Speaker 1:          01:35          his perspective is that as I'm a commentator on the world, that'd be better off if he didn't actually vote and just look at it how he really sees it on both sides. Right. If I'm just not sure arcial yeah, I'm sure I'm butchering the way he would phrase it. I think it's in the spirit of that. Yeah. If you vote, you don't have a right to complain.

Speaker 2:          02:01          All right. Does it make sense? That doesn't make any sense. That was deep. Well, but I think, uh, but look, it's, it's a lot. Look, I think it's trying to be a good person. I'm just a person level and try and take care of your family and work hard and be good with people and help your community. That's kind of the extent of what you can do and hopefully that spreads out. But you know, Julian Assange. Okay, Whoa, really? I mean, why is that? You know? Well, like all those people that we're talking about at that generation that only got news during that six o'clock hour, you know, were they less citizens of the world because they only got that little dose?

Speaker 1:          02:47          I don't know. They were less informed. And the idea is that more people can get away with things they shouldn't be able to get away with. Like what's happening right now with Juliana, sarge, Julian Assange in anybody's estimation. If look at what he did, he distributed information that was extremely interesting to most people in the world that didn't know about it. Right. Exposed a lot of scary shit. Yeah. I suppose a lot of corruption as opposed a lot of, um, I mean, what, what corruption did it expose? I know it exposed the, there was that, um, collateral murder video that was the, one of the first ones where they showed them shooting. They shot at um, these guys where they thought were soldiers and they were, they were reporters and it was sort of just the way they dealt with it. It was very scary for people watching that someone could just like dehumanize accidentally killing the wrong people.

Speaker 1:          03:40          I may get like knows the military, they were making it like, you know, hey, but you kind of have to be in that mindset to be able to gun people down from the sky in the first place. Oh look, you gotta put yourself in the perspective of someone who has to do that job and you take a regular person. And then you train them to do that job and then you asked them to go and pull the trigger people, they're going to develop a coldness to them will again, they have to, right. But to see it. So what Julian Assange did is he showed it to us and then he released all sorts of, I mean, I, I've, I haven't, I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't really studied all the files and what was released, what wasn't. Apparently when Ben Shapiro was here, he said that, uh, people's names got a put out. Apparently that was someone hacked into wikileaks and release that information before they could redact the names. This was the, this is what I've been told by multiple sources. But again, I didn't look into it. I don't know if that was correct. So

Speaker 2:          04:39          they're going to say that he was treasonous or that he was, I don't know what they're going to say. I think you're right.

Speaker 1:          04:44          The first thing was a sex charge. That's what they were trying to say. That he had sex with a woman, um, that where he wore a condom and then they had sex. And then they had sex in the morning with no condom and she didn't consent to that, that he just kinda did it or something. I think it was something along, I think they called it Soprise sex and if I'm butchering this, I'm sorry. Um, but the um, that didn't make sense like that there would be going after him that way.

Speaker 2:          05:11          Well, he goes obviously not about that. You go after if you want to get somebody to go after him and for whatever. But I'm like hacking charges now, right? Yeah. I don't know. I know he look crazy in the, in the embassy, right. He w he wouldn't clean up after his cat and he was riding a scooter around. Is that true? That's what I don't know why? Well, who knows what's driving? No, that's part of it. But that's just part of the little story that I caught the little delta was soccer was poetically describing what the embassy was smelled like with Julian Assange. Dirty cat shit wafting through the halls. Yeah. Crazy asshole. Do you have staying here? Don't leave. Pamela Anderson comes over every now and then they get their free con, the surveillance footage, footage

Speaker 1:          05:51          of Julian Assan skateboarding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London has been linked. Okay. Yeah. But here's the thing, man. Like what do you want the guy to do? Is there a problem? He's there for seven fucking years. He must have gotten crazy. I mean, that's like being, you know, under house arrest dude. I mean, it's amazing that he lasted that long and what they did, they waited them out and then when there were never going to wait him out and he was gonna stay in there forever and then I guess got sick of them, they just get sick of them. I think there was also of the Ecuadorian President, I think he took a photograph in front of a, like some lobsters and shit. And it was from a leaked email in that photo got out and it was very embarrassing to him because his country's in deep financial crisis and he's chilling in some four seasons somewhere. He loves Terrian lobster.
