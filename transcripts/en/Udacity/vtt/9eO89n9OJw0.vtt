00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.930
Let's make sure that you're comfortable with the

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.670
coefficient of determination and computing it. Write a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.240
function that, given two input numpy arrays, data,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.740
and predictions, that returns the coefficient of determination, r

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.670
squared, for the model that produced the predictions.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.530
Numpy has a couple of functions, numpy.mean and numpy.sum,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.270
that you might find useful here, but you

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.420
don't have to use them. Your code goes here.
