00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.490
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:06.491
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for a Monday.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.700
The isn't may sexist today,
May 6th.
I have no idea.
I'm here with Joe Bartnick.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.030
Joey B what's going on?

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.350
<v 1>Oh,
just children out in Israel,
man.
It's a,
it's insane dude.</v>

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.190
It's like we were in Europe for a week and it's like Europe's kind of like,

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.370
it's like,
it's like in America,
but it's different.
It's cool.

8
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:29.490
Everyone's really nice.
And then like as we were landing,

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.180
I see you guy watch your videos are like bombs going off an antiaircraft.

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.440
Then like we landed,
we're in Israel.
Where in Israel it's like,
dude,

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.820
I'll let you explain it.
We had the,

12
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.600
we just had the most boss airport experience ever.

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.530
<v 0>Oh yeah.
When we landed here,
first of all,</v>

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.140
thank God I don't watch the news because as always,

15
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.840
I guess things that are a little,
uh,
what do they call it?
It's,

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 1>I see little chippy.
Thanks again.</v>

17
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.340
A little chip in here or up or off sticks

18
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.290
<v 0>over here itself.
Yeah.
We got to the airport and uh,</v>

19
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.770
no,
well I'll do that.
I don't know why we're doing this.

20
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.270
We're doing this like backwards.

21
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:08.950
We were in fucking Amsterdam the night before and went to a bar and smoked a

22
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:11.200
joint where they also serve milkshakes.

23
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.460
So I,
I was sitting there like,
I don't like,
I'm not big on fucking smoking weed.

24
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.760
I don't even think I do it right or I don't even realize when I'm high or

25
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:23.560
whatever.
There's like this is a body high.

26
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:27.970
Like this just gets you fucking right side high.
I don't understand.
Like,

27
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.650
<v 1>dude,
you ain't got shit.
You were so high.</v>

28
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.640
You ordered a strawberry milkshake and then you thought it was vanilla and then

29
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.650
you'd debated it and then you thought it was vanilla until about halfway down.

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.230
You Go.
No,
it's really strawberries.
Well

31
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.010
<v 0>cause it was so subtle,
but the thing was white.
It was the color of vanilla.</v>

32
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.850
It's rubbery shake where I'm from is fucking red or pinkish.

33
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.120
And I got the thing and I was sipping it.
You know what it was?

34
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.510
It was like the frozen Glob of it was where all the strawberry ones.

35
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.700
So when I got to the end,
you know,
when you get to the sort of the,
uh,

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.920
the glacier part of the milkshake,
I was like,
oh,

37
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.390
this does have some strawberry in it.

38
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.350
It literally did have a flake of red in it though,
you know,
it was funny,

39
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.260
was fucking everybody and there was smoking and was high.

40
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.950
And then we all got up to the counter where like we say to the lady there like,

41
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
did you charge us yet?
And she's like,
oh no.
She's like,
figure it out.
I'm like,

42
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.520
this is no way to run a business.
But,
um,
the shows have been great.

43
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.090
And uh,
Joel,
I gotta I gotta give you like,

44
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.260
I've never seen anybody fucking go,
come over here.

45
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.720
I've seen in a lot of American comics,

46
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:37.590
I've talked to a lot of American comics are all like,
I think,
and again,
my stop,

47
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.010
what do I talk about or what are you any advice and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

48
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.900
I remember [inaudible] was like,
he was like going like,
dude,

49
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.920
I know I'm going to take a couple of bad ones but I'm going to figure this out.

50
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.870
And um,
you know,
he had to make adjustments to make adjustments.

51
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.630
You're the only game you just came over here and you were Joe Barton.

52
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.950
You walked on stage fucking murdered in Iceland,
Iceland,
Iceland,

53
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.460
Iceland and then a right to the top.
Just like this guy's,
yeah,

54
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.070
you're as confident at all.
We all were here.

55
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.740
It took me 10 years to get where the hell you're at right now.

56
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.390
So you've been fucking killing everywhere.

57
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.740
<v 1>Well thank you.
But uh,
basically wells,
Megan into bill</v>

58
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.360
cause I got,
I got to be confident with them.
I know,
but you don't need it

59
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.740
<v 0>that you didn't even doubt them.
That's amazing.
I think it's a great thing.</v>

60
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.280
<v 1>I think it's scarier to be,
and just like a,
you know,</v>

61
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.840
in a little club in Hollywood that are like,
you know,
or somewhere,
I don't know,

62
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.220
there's 3000 people.
Some of them are going to laugh,
hopefully.
Right.

63
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.020
Your family for your friends are the best dude.
How,
how great.
Where they really,

64
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.420
I mean they,
it was really great shows.

65
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.260
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
you've seen the,
you've seen,
you really loved Helsinki,
man.</v>

66
00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:46.040
That was useful,

67
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.800
<v 1>but,
huh?
Helsinki.
Yeah.
You know what's winning?
Oslo looks like Pittsburgh,</v>

68
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.050
but it's funny.
We were walking through and Bajrang the booker.

69
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:56.400
Great Dude with sue super cigars.
It was like the or,
or Shanti.

70
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.090
His buddy works with them.
Another great dude.
He's like,

71
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:02.400
this is the toughest part of Oslo.
It looked like,

72
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:07.020
it looked like it looked like a Beverly hills.
Yeah.

73
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.540
<v 0>Just seemed like there was a couple of drunks.
It's weird,</v>

74
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:14.980
you know that Scandinavian language update you when people do yell at it,

75
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.340
does all of that shit.
I'll sound like a Nazi guard to me.
I'm like,
AH,
fuck it.

76
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:20.200
Starting again.

77
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.990
<v 1>But Helsinki was,
Helsinki was awesome.
I went down to the dog,</v>

78
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.280
get up like five in the morning and walked in like a freezing rain.

79
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.890
It really was.
It really was awesome.
I had a meat pie.

80
00:04:30.891 --> 00:04:35.090
I felt like Anthony Bordain like the street talking to the dock workers.

81
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.800
That was fun.
Uh,

82
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.370
got to hang out late night in Stockholm with some friends drink til it closed

83
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.700
down Stockholm.
That was great.

84
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.860
Only rat I saw the whole time and sweet.
Literally,
literally a rat.

85
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.940
Marshawn knows Swedish women are tough.
What?
Right between her legs,

86
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.820
like not that this is the other things.
A radical.
I was,
I was gonna say like,

87
00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.470
yeah,
I'm just walking through a hotel,

88
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.170
walked between and I want to be able to handle that.
Yeah.

89
00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:04.280
It was pretty tough but fun.
I tell you,
I think Iceland was the craziest though.

90
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.600
Iceland was nuts.
There was no dogs.
It scared the shit out of me.
I'm like,

91
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:11.300
there's no dogs when they do with the dogs.
I'm a dog.

92
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.980
I've been painting like every dog in Europe in the last thing we were so cut to,

93
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.160
we went to leave.
I was on the Baltic Sea or the Adrian,
whatever.

94
00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:23.420
C was freezing in Helsinki last night.
Perfect.

95
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.270
Whether we're in Israel,
smoking,
smuggling,
the best steak ever.
What

96
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.950
<v 0>would fun?
I don't even know what that was.</v>

97
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.490
A Baltic seas between Sweden and Finland,

98
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.090
but I don't know what that body of water is.
Let me look this up here.

99
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:40.590
I think I got a map here.
I was trying to figure out all of this shit.
What?

100
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.460
See what the fuck did I just do?
What in God's name just happened?

101
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.460
Do you know somebody?
I got a duff mckagan is going to be doing my podcast,

102
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:53.940
which I can't believe so they send me a link to his new fucking hour when I

103
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.720
sweat.
It just never works.
It never fucking works.
I sweat.

104
00:05:57.721 --> 00:05:59.720
I think computers that they like,
they don't like me.

105
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.960
<v 1>Well like last night I always,
I always watched the hockey games.</v>

106
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.750
It's like okay we're gonna Watch the hockey game doing work.

107
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.390
They have to Redo your password 30 times.
The wifi goes nuts here at the y,

108
00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:15.690
you know,
is is amazing.
Wifi is every well that is all the Baltic Sea.

109
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.080
It is on the bumper.
We just circled the Baltic.

110
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.220
<v 0>Yeah,
we circled the Baltic.</v>

111
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.900
You know what I actually we've been looking up sees cause I was claiming the

112
00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:28.260
Mediterranean was the biggest and I feel the greatest

113
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.920
<v 1>of all the C's.
I like all the features of the season.
Okay.</v>

114
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.250
Duke haters.
I was like you haven't seen in Gaming Carolina.

115
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.670
It was,
you know it was neat though.
Like what?

116
00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:45.140
Like you know like if you land like,
so you find the Pittsburgh,

117
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.420
you you'll see like Cleveland,
New York,
Washington DC.

118
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.120
Literally when we landed in Tel Aviv,
Tel Aviv,

119
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:56.990
the cities where bay route Cairo and Alexandria,
I don't know.

120
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.650
I don't know if we were like high enough up.

121
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.560
I think we were seeing now when we were coming in though,

122
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.830
cause they see how there's bay route.
It was like,
dude look at that on the map,

123
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:08.980
you know,
fucking far away.
There's only so many cities they going to show.

124
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:10.960
You know,
if you're like far enough up,

125
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.470
you see like Dallas when you're in the middle of [inaudible] you're talking

126
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:18.010
about when I was taking the pictures when we were on final coming in.
Well yeah.

127
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.141
Well,

128
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:21.080
you know how like the computers they show you like on the screen on the odd,

129
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.140
yeah.
I,
let's say I saw Lebanon,
I thought you don't test what you were saying?
No,

130
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:27.430
I'm saying like they showed,
you know,

131
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:29.200
like approaching where you see like the screen.

132
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.520
<v 0>Yeah,
that was her job.</v>

133
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.250
You'd be coming in right over like the end of,

134
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:37.900
I don't know if the most eastern part,

135
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:42.640
obviously the Mediterranean Sea and then just seeing that coast and it's just

136
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.330
like Jesus Christ once we're in Israel.
So then we land right.

137
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.430
And uh,
through the only other person I ever saw get this fucking pocket.

138
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.450
I saw Ben Affleck was on my flight one time,
right.
I got on the plane,

139
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:59.630
he was already on the plane,
you know,

140
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.710
and then when they got off and I was sitting there going like,
wow,

141
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:05.530
this guy's just going to get off this case.
Like a huge,
huge,

142
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:09.340
huge star and he's going to get mobbed.
The yes,
no security person.

143
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.990
And when he got off the plane,

144
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.900
he just went right down with the bags where they bring like,
you know,
50.

145
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:16.230
You had to check your carry on cause there was no more overhead space.

146
00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:20.050
He went down that way and they just whisked him away to visit amazing life.

147
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.480
And uh,
when we got to uh,
Israel,
they did that.
They gave us the same treatment.

148
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.000
I felt like an asshole.
They walked her us around,

149
00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:30.880
all those people standing in line.
I thought somebody was going to say something,

150
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.850
I'd throw something at us.
And uh,
it was hilarious.

151
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:38.110
I saw this big fat Jewish dude who I swear to God look like Joe to Rosa.

152
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.190
Like there was something about his eyes and it was fucking hilarious.
Um,

153
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.670
<v 1>it was like Ellis island that we skipped.
Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.250
Even the security line,
it was like a massive humanity do we just skipped,

155
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.490
but they,
yeah,
they,
I thought we were going right to the hotel.

156
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.070
Like we to go back into the airport,

157
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 0>we used to give everybody by car.
Yeah.
We somehow went out onto the tarmac,</v>

158
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.590
got in a car and drove to the front of the line of immigration.

159
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.060
This guy just walked past,

160
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:11.061
everybody handed our fucking all three of our passports and they just stamp them

161
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.140
and we walked through.
It was just like,
what the fuck was,

162
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:15.720
that was the greatest thing ever.
And so,
um,
yeah.

163
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.270
And then we met the promoter and that's when I first learned that there was some

164
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.100
shit going down over here.
He goes,
yeah,
he goes,

165
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:24.180
I was gonna meet you here with a bulletproof vest and a,
uh,
a helmet on.

166
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.730
And I was like,
I was like,
oh yeah.
And then he just looked at me.
He goes,
yeah,

167
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.350
what's been going on over here?
I was like,
no,
cause he goes,

168
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:33.420
I'm sure you've got a bunch of texts.
I'm like,
no,

169
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.520
I don't want you to know this dude.
And he goes,
hey,
you know,
they,
she goes,

170
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.960
they shot a couple rockets,
you know,
whatever from the what,

171
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:44.040
I don't know how the fuck it works.

172
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.050
The guys in strip or something like that I read today was 700.
Um,
but,
uh,

173
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.440
it was big news.
Yeah.
So some of that stuff,

174
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.770
something happened in the Bruins game.
How many texts you get?
I,
yeah,

175
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.120
I know I did.
Yeah.
So he just kept saying that and I just joked,
we said,
dude,

176
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.520
I played Camden New Jersey.
I'd fucking survive that.

177
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:06.990
I think I'll be all right here.
So,
um,
anyways,
this place is fucking magical land.

178
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.940
Like I don't think I've,
uh,
this is just,
this is something about,
you know,

179
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.480
being along the Mediterranean Sea and all that and how old is polices and all

180
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.600
the history and all that type of stuff.
And I don't know,

181
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.080
I just hope I have a good show here tonight.
There's so much shit to talk about,

182
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.890
but let's talk about cs.
Joe.
I had to look them up because we would like,

183
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.150
is the Mediterranean the number of the biggest see out here and being sports

184
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:35.010
fans,
there always has to be a ranking here.
Um,
this is all body of water,

185
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:39.900
the biggest ocean Pacific than Atlantic,
then Indian than the Arctic.
We do.

186
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:43.890
We see the Arctic where we were,
we on art.
None on an Arctic was,

187
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.750
was on the other side.
Let's look.
We ran really high up there.
I realize how I,
oh,

188
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.290
hi means far up north.
Yeah.
Well that's bad.

189
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.340
Nobody lives higher than Santa Claus

190
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.140
is the Norwegian Sea does.
There's a Greenland.

191
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.450
See the Barents Sea beds,
the Arctic Ocean do.
We were no where near.
Okay.
I mean,

192
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.180
for American's we were pretty close to it.
Yeah.

193
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.870
I didn't realize how high up those people are though.
Even compared to Britain,

194
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:17.400
they're pretty high up.
Uh,
even with like Iceland.
Um,

195
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.130
all right.
So anyways,
here's,
here's the rankings on of seas and oceans,

196
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.360
Pacific Ocean,
Atlantic,
ocean,
Indian Ocean,

197
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.800
and then articulation coming in fourth,
like the Nhl against basketball,

198
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:33.510
football and baseball.
Soccer,
creeping up in the battles in the oceans.

199
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.561
Yeah.
I have no idea.

200
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:39.561
A coral sea is number one Arabian Sea as far as size.

201
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.720
The South China Sea,
China,
where the fuck that is?

202
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:46.380
The Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.

203
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.650
So it ranks fifth ranks fifth but number one in your hearts number,

204
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.860
you running your number six,
your program.

205
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.610
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean,
come on.
Do it.
I mean out of all the C's that you could live along,</v>

206
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.830
I mean,
you're talking what has the hottest women,
you got ego,
Italy,
Greece,

207
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.620
France,
France,
Spain.

208
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.210
Through how could look at where the people on the flight over yet he,
Israel,

209
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.010
there were,
there was there,
there wasn't like any tens,
but there was no twos.

210
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.390
It was just an auto Isabella check team.

211
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:20.160
It was all second round draft picks that wanted to prove themselves.
It was,

212
00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:24.810
it was,
it was a Vegas Golden Knights.
Exactly.
That's exactly what I want.

213
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.440
The budget you want to discard.
The women here are just reading all the cities.

214
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:33.100
Everyone's like,
you know,
Sweden had some oddities.
Love Sweden,
Finland.

215
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.890
Finland was amazing.
No Way.
These Israeli broads there,

216
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.560
they're like wonder woman.
Yeah.
And they know like that,

217
00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:44.920
that Israeli martial arts,
which makes it even harder,
you know?
Oh,
absolutely.

218
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.040
Shit.
A bar.
They can handle it.
Well,
it's like that chicken.
It's like,

219
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.890
it's like the waitress on the plane.
How hot was she?

220
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.680
And she was like 60 years old.
She loves you,
man.

221
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:55.810
I'll tell you something about you,
Joe.
Fucking women.

222
00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.060
Women love you the way they are repulsed by me.
I don't know about that.

223
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.580
I do know there's,
I don't know,

224
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.580
<v 0>come up to you that your energy man,
they just,
they just smile.</v>

225
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.120
You got him fucking smiling.
They look at me.
I fucking weird.

226
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.850
I everybody like I have a defensive,

227
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.880
standoffish vibe that I wish I didn't have it.
You know what?

228
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.250
I came into the world with orange hair so I'm always looking for the other

229
00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:26.570
fucking shoe to drop.
You came in Joey be looking like a fucking,
you know,

230
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.740
<v 1>I had sideburns when I was,
when I was like,
you know,
when I was,</v>

231
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.000
whatever like one day old,

232
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:35.700
I had sideburns in 1969 and all the nurses would always were laughing at me and

233
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:40.120
my dad would tell me like in the uh,
whatever the booth is,
they keep the babies.

234
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.613
I frequently,

235
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.970
<v 0>yeah,
it Joe,
I always forget the fucking comics name.</v>

236
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.590
It was my favorite jokes of all time or just like some guys have it with women,

237
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.510
I don't know what it is.
They never had it,

238
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.860
but whatever it is,
I have the Anti Dogs,
ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.760
Um,
anyway,
let's,
let's,
uh,
let's get into,
let's get,

240
00:14:01.761 --> 00:14:05.570
let's talk a little bit of hockey here.
Joe,
my Boston Bruins.

241
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.960
Um,
I've missed every second in the series being over here,

242
00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:12.080
traveling and my fucking NHL Network,

243
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.840
feed dot working there.
They're up there.

244
00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:18.410
One game away from closing out the great uh,

245
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.640
team that Columbus has put together.
Yeah.
With one of your,

246
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:22.220
your favorite cultures out there,
right?
Yeah.

247
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.360
<v 1>Dry and Twitter rather than they,</v>

248
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.920
this thing I can see about torts as he likes dogs.
I know.

249
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:29.530
You just can't stand that guy.
Yeah,
it's too much.

250
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.570
But he's doing a great job right now.

251
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.520
He's doing an absolutely fantastic job with,

252
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:37.340
with Columbus and you've got to give it to Barofsky that goaltender,
you know,

253
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:41.050
and he's always a regular season guy.
Play offs.
Couldn't stop a beach ball.

254
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.670
Now he's stopping everything.

255
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.140
<v 0>Yeah.
And I go to,
I don't want to game seven with them.
I want to,</v>

256
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.700
uh,
well I think this game sex,
I'm saying obvious shit here,
but I really want to,

257
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:54.050
I really want to fucking,

258
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.940
I just want to get past these guys cause I kind of feel like if they get past
us,

259
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:01.970
they might win the cup.
I,
they just got that and there that weird vibe.

260
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.020
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just,

261
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.060
I'm just still so stunned that they swept Tampa Bay who just had their fucking

262
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:11.990
way with us.
The last two games that I watched with tempo,
I don't know,

263
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.820
like I've said a zillion times at parties,

264
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.190
<v 1>Tampa Bay just collapsed.
So you're actually going to run into a bigger bus.</v>

265
00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:20.730
Solve teams that believe in each other as the Carolina hurricanes are next.

266
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.280
If you're worried about Columbus Karma,

267
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.610
the storm surge is calming.

268
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.140
<v 0>Let me ask you this dude.
Is it a changing of the guard?</v>

269
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.560
Cause all of a sudden it's like all these perennial,
you know,

270
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.070
the very least getting into the western conference that used in commerce finals,

271
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.680
everybody's gone.
Pittsburgh gone.
Your penguins gone.
Uh,

272
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.490
capital's had gone Tampa's gone.
Winnipeg Gone Vegas Nights.

273
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:50.390
I know they're not perennial,
but like what they did last year,
they're gone.
Uh,

274
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.410
the kings has done,
Blackhawks are out.
It's like,

275
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:56.090
it's like the lead turned upside down.

276
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.440
<v 1>Well,
a couple of things been a couple of,
some of the fat cats just got,</v>

277
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.710
had nothing to do from,
you know,
uh,

278
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.260
Saint Patrick's day on in lost their edge and teams that had been playing art.

279
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.740
Look,
it seems like the blues,
Ers,
Carolina,
Columbus,

280
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.400
they all had the win every game just to get in.
Are you going to call him?

281
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:17.790
The Blues is about doing a podcast or seven years in something fun to talk about

282
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.740
it cause they've never won the Duluth.

283
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.500
Here's my big gripe against the St Louis Blues actually is they've never won

284
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:28.910
anything.
And they have almost as many retired jerseys is the Montreal Canadians.

285
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.590
How many of these people can actually be heroes?
Some playgroup brothers.

286
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:35.150
I mean there's the guy who heads and they engage.

287
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.250
The guy gave him somebody to deal with like car.
Now all of a sudden he's,

288
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.080
his number's retired.
Come on,
I guess.
See Brett Hall.

289
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.040
I can see how Mcginnis I did that.
I mean really,
I mean,

290
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.570
right in my era.

291
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.950
<v 0>I understand,
I understand what you said,
but my thing is like,</v>

292
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.730
they never want a cup.
This not like they haven't won a cop since.

293
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.390
They've never want to come.
They've been in the league.
Uh,

294
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.390
basically they came in the league the year after.
Uh,

295
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.530
they take me the second one is 67 and the next year was

296
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.170
<v 1>the expansion there.
The next six they came in with us in Philly.</v>

297
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.420
<v 0>No,
but yeah,
so that was 67,
68.</v>

298
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:19.421
So may police one 66 67 and they never want to fucking cop.

299
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:22.350
I don't know.
I just,
I,
I,

300
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.800
<v 1>I don't,
I don't hate them.</v>

301
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.900
I just called him the blues or is this fun and they've never won.

302
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.200
So they are the blues and they kind of get a pass because American say three

303
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.080
like in Saint Louis where it's like nobody,
it'll have like that anger,

304
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.660
east coast anger and I don't really have that hockey anger,

305
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.730
that Patrick Division anger that Adam's division angrier than they were in the

306
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:45.280
north in the media,

307
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:49.090
like the through GM this year is having the,
has made some lucky moves.

308
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.980
He usually,
he's just

309
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.950
<v 2>like,
I don't know.</v>

310
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.360
I always think their GM is kind of a tool and they had an Hitchcock you,

311
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:56.940
I hate captain kangaroo.
I mean that guy.

312
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.270
I love the fact that it's Dallas and the blues two teams that fire Ken,

313
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.680
it's cock.
I call him captain kangaroo,
so I love the fact they're stolen.

314
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.650
They're now,
now everyone's like,
oh my God.
Bargains talking hockey click.
No,

315
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.853
<v 3>oh no.</v>

316
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.950
They're actually probably upset with me that I haven't fucking been talking to

317
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:17.290
for for the longest time.
You know,
once she had the,
well I do my brain.

318
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.200
I don't know what's going on my fucking brain.
I just had sun yet again.

319
00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:21.640
Something that I wanted to fucking say.

320
00:18:21.641 --> 00:18:25.270
You said something reminded me of something and it just goes away.
Joe,

321
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.800
where does it go?
Where does it go?

322
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.580
<v 2>The last couple of years?
There's things sometimes I just can't remember.
Like I,</v>

323
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.560
it takes me day,
I forget them every time.
Tracy Morgan,

324
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.890
I love the guy.
One of my favorite weeks ever worked with him.

325
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.910
There's like a sun spot in my head that I can never remember that I have to say.

326
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.780
Yeah.
Hilarious guy said live 30 rock to everyone.

327
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.980
It's like I'm playing $20,000 pyramid every time I say this

328
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.190
and I know it's tracing.
It's so funny.
Or like a hockey player's name,

329
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.250
<v 3>comics like that.
And I love,</v>

330
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.460
I'm not going to say the names cause I love both of them.

331
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.200
I cannot,

332
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.380
now I have both their names in my head right now.
I can say them,

333
00:19:06.381 --> 00:19:10.460
but I don't want to say I just for some fucking reason it just never,

334
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.040
it never sticks.
It's like a,

335
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.860
there's a couple of words my whole life I just can't spell.

336
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:19.510
Like for the longest time I just couldn't spell restaurant,
I guess.

337
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.100
Couldn't spell it.
I couldn't remember where,
uh,
that's another thing to do to,

338
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.330
is it the older I get,
I'm realizing how fucked up my,
uh,

339
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.280
my brain as far as the way I look at shit yet.

340
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:34.190
You know what always fucks me up in a hotel is when you get into a shower and

341
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.490
you know they have like the hot and cold and it's done with the,
uh,
you know,

342
00:19:37.491 --> 00:19:41.870
they'll have like a red dot on the left side and the,

343
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.910
and then a blue one on the right side.

344
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.380
So to me that means if you turn it to the right,
you get,

345
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.310
it's going to be cold.
But it isn't.
It's,
it's,

346
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.830
you gotta have the whatever.is on top.
It just never fucking,

347
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:56.840
so I'm sitting there,
you know,

348
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.910
I wanted to get hotter and it's getting colder and colder.
I'm standing there,

349
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.780
freeze my ass up going,
what the fuck?
So now whenever I go to a a shout,

350
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.850
cause I always guess wrong,
whenever I get to a shower in a hotel,

351
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.140
what I do is I just stick it in the middle for a minute and I just wait until it

352
00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:15.080
gets warm and then I just turn it a little bit one way or the other.

353
00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:18.920
So that's the only way they can tell.
When I stand at the stove,
to me,

354
00:20:18.921 --> 00:20:21.890
the front of the stove was what everybody else considers the back.

355
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:25.670
I always look at it like I'm standing at the back of a car.
I Dunno dude.

356
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.540
<v 2>You guys don't fucking work.</v>

357
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.720
<v 3>Well,
say his to stove,
right.
This table right here,
the closest part to me,</v>

358
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.100
that's the back to me.

359
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.160
<v 2>Oh Front.
The front is like,
that's the,
that's the front.</v>

360
00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:42.970
And then we'll move in towards the back.
You think you're looking at a map of a,

361
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.530
uh,
of a show?
Like you're buying tickets to see Metallica like yeah,
the front.

362
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.580
Not In the back.
Yeah.
That's how I,
I know.
I love you.

363
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.290
Like I'm standing behind a car,
right?
Yeah.
The thing about the showers.

364
00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.910
Why do the only,
I think the only thing that and the fact that every airplane,

365
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.950
they kept the windows up the whole time.

366
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.820
I think the only two things I don't like about Europe is that in the fact that

367
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:10.960
showers are all death traps,
Mi,
Mi,
Mi and comes to the candy.

368
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.380
I've almost died about four times cause you guys at your big guys,

369
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:18.070
I haven't had a problem with the size of the last doors that like,

370
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.580
and you have to climb over a wall and again it's taking to break into the
shower.

371
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.630
There's a glass door every may.
Hey,
I would do it if I was speeding up,
up,

372
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.220
up after ugly Americans.

373
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.750
Every shower is one of those showers is like you can either have the rainstorm

374
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.240
down or the analogs,
you know,
clean up all your crevices.

375
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.650
But they always put the crevice thing aimed directly where your face would be

376
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.020
when you turn on the lot.
I mean,

377
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:44.770
every time I laugh it gets me every time through that gotta be,

378
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:48.190
that's gotta be the fluffy from the major.
I guess I'm saying that's the best.

379
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:50.150
Like you don't even know to turn it on.
Yeah,
but I don't know.

380
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.400
<v 3>Honestly I am,
I,
I am no idea what that fucking handheld thing is for.</v>

381
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.250
<v 2>Oh I do.
But you know it's a family show.
Yeah.</v>

382
00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.770
This is for cleaning everything out.

383
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.430
<v 3>Yeah.
I Dunno,
I just put things,
but you gotta you shit.
You fucking hands.</v>

384
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.420
Got To be on a washcloth to do it.

385
00:22:07.421 --> 00:22:10.330
And then you got that hand and if you're taking your hand and you've got a hands

386
00:22:10.331 --> 00:22:14.560
free device where you could just stand there cleaning yourself.
I thought,

387
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:15.670
I always thought it was for women.

388
00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.870
<v 2>I think you'd say.
I feel like pleasure themselves in the shower.
It is,
you know,</v>

389
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.590
there's many,
many ways to skin a cat.
I'll tell you one thing though.

390
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.280
The other thing.
The other,

391
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.010
the only other thing I don't like about Europe is a lot of,

392
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.370
and it's funny cause I don't even drink soda anymore for three years,

393
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.210
but I'm offended as an American is lot of Pepsi countries.

394
00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.320
It was a lot of Pepsi Co's,
Blah,
blah,
blah.
A lot of Pepsi countries.
Not Good.

395
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.430
Come on Trump.
No,
wait.
Which ones were they?
Uh,

396
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.960
I assume was a Pepsi country?
Uh,

397
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.180
the first two were Pepsi countries and then we seem like we got back to then

398
00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:56.240
like the regular cities.
Copenhagen was a Pepsi country.

399
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.990
The Copenhagen was the first time I smelled urine in the street.
And I'm like,

400
00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:04.480
okay,
I'm feeling a city now.
Do filing and feeling of city.
And you know,

401
00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:08.470
I saw the,
saw the rat and Sweden was next.
A house.
Think he was the,

402
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.330
I was thinking also to me where they're most like American cities.

403
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.850
I'll tell you what though.
I love what makes you feel at home.

404
00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:17.370
The smell of urine and rats.
No,
but I love,

405
00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:21.320
I love the concrete to trains the train system.
I love the subways.
It was great.

406
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.980
Uh,
walking,
I just got up every morning and walked around.
Here's,

407
00:23:24.981 --> 00:23:28.550
here's this funny,
right?
We've seen millions of people in the streets,
big cities,

408
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.290
right?
Only one person that would be considered kind of a jerk.

409
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.940
That was an old guy in an airport that gave you a forum,
Shiver,
iron Mike Sharp.

410
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.750
And he bumped into candy and shooed me away.
Like,
get away.
Yeah.

411
00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:42.980
That was this fucking guy.
We

412
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.940
<v 3>were going through airport security and I saw the stain on what we are missing,</v>

413
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:47.840
my daughter and everything.

414
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:51.830
I just see this guy just like lit up this old guy with his granddaughter.

415
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:56.780
I'm like,
oh,
that guy totally gets it.
He gets life.
He spoils that kid.

416
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.460
And it was,
it was making me feel,

417
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:02.600
seeing the joy that he had with this kid made me feel a little less,
you know,

418
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.590
fucking said that.
I don't know why,
but uh,
you know,
just seeing like this scene,

419
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:07.340
I,
you know,

420
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.920
when you're missing your kid and you see somebody who looks like they suck at

421
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:11.960
being a parent and really just fucking ruined your day,

422
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:14.050
but you actually see somebody with their kid or grants,

423
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.680
can you see that they're enjoying it.
It makes you feel,
I dunno,
you know,

424
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.330
we'll use this guys appreciate it,
right?

425
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.680
So all of a sudden like I'm going through the fucking security and I just,

426
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.960
this fucking guy like right in my,

427
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:30.610
like a crosscheck right in my base and my back and he said something like,

428
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.680
get out of the way,
get all the way in his language.
And I'm looking at,
I'm like,

429
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:37.220
and I'm done.
I looked behind me,
there was nobody behind me and I'm like,

430
00:24:37.221 --> 00:24:38.750
what the fuck is,
what the fuck was that?

431
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:42.620
I'm looking at him and it was this sweet old guy with this kid and I'm thinking

432
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:44.870
like,
what the fuck was that about?

433
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.890
And then I just kind of laugh because he was old and I said to Joe,

434
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.400
I said to you,
I go,
I go,
that guy is fucking fucking old.

435
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.180
Gay just gave me a little mini forum,
shipper the back and then he,

436
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:01.090
and then you go,
oh yeah,
yeah,
he fucking shoot me awake.
He did the double hands,

437
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.760
like,
get out of here,
get out of the way.
And then we'd set,

438
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.630
tell it to club store to Kenny.
And Kenny goes,
yeah,
you pushed me to,

439
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.280
I think he didn't like Americans.

440
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:14.360
That's the only way I can think about it because there's one thing of being an

441
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:18.860
asshole.
But Dude,
you and club Soda Kenny or like you like the fucking,
uh,

442
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:22.010
I don't know you both like six,
three,
six,
four.
You fucking

443
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.680
<v 2>meatheads.
Yeah,
I didn't,
the meatheads sense of like,
uh,
we lived,</v>

444
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.500
we look like we're like,
we live waste,

445
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.880
but in the beat had said so we're just big enough in the way.

446
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.410
<v 3>No,
I would say meat heads.</v>

447
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.390
<v 2>Just,
I'm aware that we didn't live like the barbarians though.</v>

448
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.460
Remember that dude,
I'm fucking with you.
I don't fucking know.
I know,

449
00:25:43.461 --> 00:25:46.580
but you know,
we do stand in the way though.
Where are we are big to get around?

450
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.660
Well,
I've been doing so well with my anger and I gotta be honest with you,

451
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.060
that fucking you were almost triggered.
It almost triggered you.
Yes.

452
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.850
<v 3>Set me off where I was just like,</v>

453
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.630
I am I really gonna am I really looking for this guy right now?

454
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:03.960
The bump back into an old guys like let it go below.

455
00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.720
<v 2>They always see the retaliatory try to lead as well.</v>

456
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.800
I know two minutes he read mark shot you got in your head,

457
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.390
he got in your head at the airport.

458
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.280
But think of all the airports we've been in every life.

459
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.790
<v 3>I've never been a goal score my team,
my team can handle me in the box.</v>

460
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.510
You know that,
that me fighting old guide is not going to hurt

461
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.670
<v 2>the PM's in your career.
You're alone pimps.</v>

462
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.270
<v 3>Oh yeah.
I'm not gonna say who,</v>

463
00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:32.230
but somebody else told us the fucking story about a,

464
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:37.240
I dunno about,
I dunno,
some buddy of his,
I'm going to make this real vague.

465
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:41.440
A buddy of his that was going through some shit with his wife,

466
00:26:41.441 --> 00:26:45.240
his wife was drinking and then she got hammered and tried to hit him,

467
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.430
swung and miss instead of face plant on the sidewalk and fucked yourself up and

468
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:55.410
then said,
I can't believe you just did that to me and was threatening to,
uh,

469
00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:00.360
do the old domestic violence they do have in the level that that fucking set me

470
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:05.180
off.
Um,
I actually learned something about myself about that and I,

471
00:27:05.181 --> 00:27:07.290
I kind of figured out where that came from.
My kind of,

472
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.450
I grew up with a couple of relatives that did not have good relationships in

473
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:16.560
whatever their experience was.
Subconsciously,

474
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:21.150
they put it on me and I kind of,
I think I just took that in of like,
oh,
women,

475
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:23.520
fuck you over.
You gain,
you get him,

476
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:27.690
you get involved with them and then the other shoe drops and they fuck you.

477
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:28.471
I'm telling you,
Joe,

478
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:32.370
it's like I tonight somehow took that in and I walk around that and with that

479
00:27:32.371 --> 00:27:36.330
energy and that's why that beautiful Israeli check was talking to you and she

480
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:39.540
looked at me,
she was talking to you like,
oh,
and go see this and go see that,

481
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:44.010
blah blah.
She looked at me,
she's just like,
is everything all right?
Take it easy,

482
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.030
you know?
Well,

483
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.820
you know what's funny was like when he wanted the person to call and missed the

484
00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:53.870
version,
I'm like,
oh,
is she going to tell me the places to go to?

485
00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.510
<v 4>No,
she is not.</v>

486
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.860
<v 2>That was one of the funniest things ever in first class because he was so in a</v>

487
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.160
mister amenities.
Whenever she goes to counties,
as she gave Kenny's last name,

488
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.910
Mr and then she's like Mr. Berger nations,
Mr. Barton.

489
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.750
And then she started talking to me.
Since then he's getting some birds you like,

490
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.640
what do you want?
Mercy was so upset,
but in the play they had to go,

491
00:28:16.641 --> 00:28:18.530
can you please call him mister Versie?

492
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.950
<v 4>Okay.</v>

493
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.640
<v 2>That's the thing.
When me and frizzy fly together,
we laughed the whole time.</v>

494
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.580
We looked like two homos going on under our honeymoon.

495
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.743
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

496
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:36.410
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

497
00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.420
<v 3>two guys,
you make the world believe in love.</v>

498
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.433
<v 4>Okay.</v>

499
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.490
<v 3>You see you two guys together.
You like,
you know what a cad happened for me.</v>

500
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.670
This could really happen for me.
So who's your pick?

501
00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:53.130
Who's your pick to go to the a Stanley Cup.
Smart shirts.
Bruins sharks.

502
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.760
<v 2>Rolling both Thorton.
Jumbo Joe coming back,</v>

503
00:28:55.761 --> 00:28:59.300
maybe hoisting the cup and being town.
But yeah,
I had to be,

504
00:28:59.301 --> 00:29:00.290
I had to get it and another

505
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.380
<v 3>great player that we shipped out during that time because he,
you know,</v>

506
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.720
and I told he's not a Bruin.
It's just like what?

507
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.480
What the fuck does that mean?
He's scoring goals by the goddamn bagful.

508
00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.140
I Dunno,
I never understood that one.
They always do you know what it was?

509
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.140
You don't have the flyers did that thing for the longest fucking time where they

510
00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:21.350
still do now that no they don't.
They don't,
but they,
they,

511
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.340
they did that how they want it in 7,475 they kept playing that way.

512
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.390
It was like they kept that high school jacket on for like the next fucking 30

513
00:29:29.391 --> 00:29:33.330
years.
The billings,
the Bruins also had that big bad Bruin.

514
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.440
We played this,
we play a certain style.

515
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.670
So when we would get guys that came in who were big guys who weren't going to

516
00:29:40.671 --> 00:29:43.720
sit in penalty box and they were just going to score a fucking goals,

517
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.470
I don't think we knew how to deal with them or at least carry send it then we're

518
00:29:47.471 --> 00:29:48.304
back in the deck.

519
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.970
<v 2>It wasn't the worst trade though for both parties concerned.
But uh,
yeah,</v>

520
00:29:52.971 --> 00:29:53.810
I had the Bruins,

521
00:29:53.811 --> 00:29:58.610
I the I the ruins had the best chance of beating Tampa Bay a and W I was wrong

522
00:29:58.611 --> 00:30:02.840
about that.
Uh,
Columbus did,
but I,
I,
I just think this is the sharks a year.

523
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.860
I think they all know that they had the right blend of youth and uh,

524
00:30:06.861 --> 00:30:10.860
they got Carlson on the blue and blue line now.
I mean,
they,
they,

525
00:30:10.861 --> 00:30:15.010
they can control 45 minutes with two,
two defensemen between Burger.

526
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.700
But what about the Boston Slam?
I wasn't up on your proposal.

527
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.600
I'm writing for the Boston and slam just because of all the people that just

528
00:30:23.601 --> 00:30:24.950
hate Boston.
I think it's,

529
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.360
I think jealousy and envy is just the worst thing on earth.

530
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.960
When people are jealous,
people are envious people.
It's sickening.

531
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.000
So seek out ways,
jealous and envious.

532
00:30:35.001 --> 00:30:37.670
The way that woman was talking to you in the way she flew by me.

533
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.080
I hope you didn't look across the aisle.
What was so funny was I tell you,

534
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:47.270
I have to tell the story.
We have to tell the story of the,
uh,
family,
uh,
orgy,
uh,

535
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.460
um,
you know,
a family pool with the Holiday Inn and then at the hotel,

536
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.530
<v 3>Oh,
where were we?</v>

537
00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:02.390
We were in Amsterdam.
That was Amsterdam,
but they ended up,
fuck band is great.

538
00:31:02.391 --> 00:31:05.990
Gym downstairs,
spiral staircase down and they had this,

539
00:31:05.991 --> 00:31:08.420
this pool at the spa and I brought my,

540
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.220
I finally remembered to bring my bathing suit and my swimming.
Douglas.

541
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.220
I've been swimming laps every city I've been going to.
Thanks

542
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:19.640
<v 2>God.
Like we like Thorton melon at least in San with Italian filling the pool,</v>

543
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.550
talking about what's going on in your life.
Like,

544
00:31:22.551 --> 00:31:26.360
it's okay bill and get a couple more laps and will cause Steve,

545
00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.490
<v 3>we already did the fucking uh,
the steam room right.</v>

546
00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.750
And I'm thinking,
you know,

547
00:31:32.751 --> 00:31:35.930
there's a men's one in a woman's one or whatever and I forgot I'll close to

548
00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:38.990
Germany.
We were,
well dude,
I'm telling you they will fucking butt ass naked.

549
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.320
We got there and it was like a coed one till we get in there and we fucking walk

550
00:31:45.081 --> 00:31:47.000
in and I look into like the,

551
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.180
the sauna and thought it looked like the partridge family.

552
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.790
It was like an entire family in there.
There was like men,

553
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:57.110
women chance all different ages and like just the lie,

554
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.870
I looked for two seconds and I was look,
look,

555
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.930
the saw a lot of skin and I just started laughing and I turned around,

556
00:32:02.931 --> 00:32:07.700
I walked out,
I had to regroup and be like,
I'm not fucking going in there.

557
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.740
So then I saw the steam room.

558
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.730
So we went in there and we got in there and they had that thing turned on to

559
00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:16.340
about like 72 degrees or something.
It wasn't even,
yeah,

560
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.670
<v 2>hot enough.
It was,
it was,
it was not as hard as your grandmother's house.</v>

561
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.850
<v 3>Yeah.
Do,
it was,
it was fucking terrific.
And then you told me,
I said,
dude,</v>

562
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:26.130
I couldn't look into that sauna room.
And you were like,
yeah,

563
00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:28.800
there's a couple of women in there with their beavers out.
And I was just like,

564
00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:32.970
I'm not,
I'm not fucking going in there.
I'm not,
I fucking refused to do that.

565
00:32:32.971 --> 00:32:36.370
So then those,
those,
those little Italian kids came

566
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.620
<v 2>growing up.
Gadi is Italian kids in there spraying?</v>

567
00:32:40.621 --> 00:32:45.590
Everyone was hose is urgent spreads each other.
Yeah.
It was a little,

568
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:47.630
it was a little,
it was funny how you said it though.
It was like,

569
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.720
we went from like the Holiday Inn and um,
you know,

570
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:55.280
Cincinnati family pool too.
Like we joined the cult in Germany.

571
00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.990
She opened that door.
Yeah.
Like the pool and the pool was,

572
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:01.280
there was a bunch of kids in it.

573
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.370
There's this amazing pool and we were spoiled because there's been nothing but

574
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:06.550
like lap pools for adults.
And we got there to,
yeah.

575
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.920
It was like the fucking way back.
We were standing at a Howard Johnson's,

576
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.780
<v 3>it's fucking a,
I don't know that one.
They used to have,</v>

577
00:33:13.781 --> 00:33:16.660
we used to drive down the cake when I was a kid.
But anyway,

578
00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.810
so I ended up going upstairs and I just fucking worked out instead.
But dude,

579
00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:24.100
I got to tell you right now,
that fucking bullshit when you go into a a,

580
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.350
a sauna in this men and women there and everyday,

581
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:31.740
<v 2>but he is fucking naked.
It's like,

go join a cult.</v>

582
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.650
Go fucking go,
go,
go to one of those states.
This,

583
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.550
I don't understand how it's like we're in a regular part of town and all of a

584
00:33:38.551 --> 00:33:41.540
sudden they go to like a nudist beach,
let's say back.

585
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.160
That's really like a specific kind of fucking person.

586
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.690
Cause there was one in San Francisco.
It's Hilarious,
you know,
the Baker beach.

587
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.550
So I was screwing around.
So I'm like,
uh,
I'm like,
um,
I'm going to show up in the,

588
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.490

you know,

589
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.340
so me and my buddy counts and Kevin get as close as we,

590
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.420
we're walking down and all of a sudden it's like she's with a bunch of people we

591
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:07.980
work with.
No.
Yeah,

592
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.120
I don't,
I don't really,

593
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.360
those days I was known to be naked way more because I drank a lot more,
well,

594
00:34:12.361 --> 00:34:17.130
not a lot more,
but more.
Um,
yeah,

there was no reason for her to the women that just be like spread eagle.

597
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.430
It was like,
they could have just sat there nicely like that,

598
00:34:23.431 --> 00:34:27.600
their robes on like I did.
Yeah.
I don't,
you know,
there was no,

599
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.610
then you go in there and then there's like this pressure because they're naked.

600
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.420
If you don't get naked,
then you're a fucking Weirdo.
And it's like,

I'm,

633
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:40.740
I love how they clarified that so dysfunctional people wouldn't get offended.

634
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.500
It's like,
hey,

Talk about your mom and why she deserves to be happy this mother's Day because

636

All right.

685
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.580
How do you get 5 cents off of a stamp?
Well,

686
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:05.800
I mean they cost more than 5 cents,
so there you go.

687
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.540
It seems like a good deal though.
It is.
Especially in,
you know,

688
00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:14.500
and it makes them want to write more people send out post office,

689
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.290
you know?
Yeah.
You have to have to make sure that my stuff gets there.
It's like,

690
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:24.730
I think I'd never done that.
Only once in my life I put a check and do an ATM,

691
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.990
like seeing somebody face.
Oh yeah.
You're one of those guys.
Well that's good.

692
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.870
Let me kind of kills the copy.
I just read that.

693
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:37.010
I'm not saying that I've said it's great deal.
All right.
Hey,
by the way,
uh,

694
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.690
my patrion page,
I had to shut it down because,
uh,

695
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.870
and for those of you who follow me on Instagram,
I'm,
I'm just,

696
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.790
I just don't fucking,
I'm not,
I just walk around.
I'm not,

697
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:52.140
what am I a fucking working for?
Meet the press or whatever,
some,

698
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.380
some gum shoe with some shit.
I'm not filming this shit.
I'm doing,

699
00:40:56.381 --> 00:40:58.960
I'm doing this shit.
I'm doing so I suck at it.

700
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.600
And I felt bad like I was taking some people's money.

701
00:41:01.601 --> 00:41:03.460
I just don't want to fucking do it anymore.
So we're going,

702
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.480
we gotta youtube all the uninformed.
So now going to be available on iTunes,

703
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:11.860
Google play,
Spotify.
You can catch up now.
New episodes to come.

704
00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:16.420
Me and Joe to Rosa.
Um,
I apologize.
The people that subscribe to my page,

705
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:20.710
I started off fast.
I had a couple of helicopter videos and it just,
I just never,

706
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:24.160
I just never think to do that.

707
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.950
I saw fucking jet blue plane that they,

708
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.610
people thought they were going to crash and people had the presence of mind

709
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.890
during possibly the end of their life.
This.
I loved it.

710
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.280
Started filming like their phones were going to survive.

711
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.550
You fucking drop your phone up a goddamn table with no fucking case.

712
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.260
The screen shattered.
You're going to survive,
you're going to die,

713
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:48.050
but there's going to be a plane crash and your fucking phone's going to have the

714
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:48.884
video.

715
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:53.690
<v 2>Yeah,
no patron just seems like way too much work to keep up the content.</v>

716
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.350
I don't know what to give what to pay for.
I mean,

717
00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.990
I'm not saying I was thinking what to do.
One myself,

718
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.130
we were going to do one for pocket off.

719
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:03.650
It's like when someone gets a free tee shirt,
what else is there?

720
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.610
I'm looking to walk around and if I put my morning skates on there and it's like

721
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.700
then people who just want to see you for free.
I just like give him,

722
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.590
you know like you got give him back.

723
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.400
<v 3>Hey,
you're a man of the people.
Do you think they'd give this as a part of it?</v>

724
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:17.240
That's comforting.

725
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.710
You know when you're in a near death experience to film it because now it feels

726
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:25.250
like you're so excited about the content you're going to have for your
Instagram,

727
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.280
that it takes you out of the fact that she could possibly,

728
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.200
that you're not going to be around to upload it,

729
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.300
that you're going to be a mortal,

730
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.310
everybody's gonna be like epic guy films his own death.
Um,

731
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.790
I don't know John,
I'm just trying to really relate to the youth here.
Let's,

732
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:45.040
let me,
let me read some of these,
I'm sorry there's a couple here Joe that um,

733
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.540
I I I'm gonna start with this one cause this,

734
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.410
<v 2>hello,
this is,
this is mail time.
This is mail time.</v>

735
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.640
I just want to say one thing that I thought it was interesting if you don't
mind.

736
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.800
I thought it was fun.

737
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.440
You can chime in whenever you want because I said hey are cause I didn't know if

738
00:42:59.441 --> 00:43:00.430
we were going to be an APP.

739
00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.910
I didn't know if is like considered Africa that I would knock off five

740
00:43:03.911 --> 00:43:07.480
continents.
I've been to,
no,
it's Asia eight,
right.

741
00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:10.540
So they told me that it's Asia,

742
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.140
but they pretend that they're in Europe.

743
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.000
You were saying they identify so that's what I'm saying.

744
00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:20.710
So they're like transgender in the sense that the,
even though they are Asian,

745
00:43:20.711 --> 00:43:24.040
they identify as Europeans.
Okay.

746
00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.000
<v 3>Yeah,
that's,
that gets into all that ratio.
Like white people.
I don't know.</v>

747
00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:31.630
It's weird.
It's weird.
It's almost like how real estate,
you know,

748
00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:33.460
they do that and they try to act like,
you know,

749
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.420
if you really is Harlan but they call it something else.
Yeah.

750
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.600
Cause they don't want to scare white people or whatever.
It's like ages,

751
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.420
this shit.
Okay.
Well one of the greatest things I ever did was a,

752
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.210
that time when I did that.
Singapore,
Hong Kong,
Mumbai,

753
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.000
they're great fucking people.
So if you're in Asia,

754
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.440
I don't know why the fuck you wouldn't want to say that.
Your Asian,

755
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.250
that's weird to me.
All right.
Rest residents.

756
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:59.090
Scientologists hey Billy orange balls.
See the lack of respect I get here.

757
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:04.510
[inaudible] been a big fan of for years.
Loved all your specials as you podcast,

758
00:44:04.511 --> 00:44:08.650
but I grew up a Scientologists.
Oh,
I know.
Yeah,
I mean,

759
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:10.150
it's really Scientology.

760
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.920
<v 2>How do you do that?
I thought they were gay.
Oh,
psychologist.</v>

761
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:16.903
David.
Easy.

762
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:23.030
You thought Scientologists were like the closet or I note your volt that has

763
00:44:23.071 --> 00:44:25.100
kids,
but other than that,
like,
I mean,

764
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.880
<v 3>well,
it's not everybody.</v>

765
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.030
<v 2>I Dunno.
I think it was just like this cult.</v>

766
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.100
<v 3>Well,
this is the thing.
Christianity is a cult.
They,</v>

767
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.130
yeah,
they,
well,

768
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:42.420
what happens is you get big enough that then you're not a cult.

769
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.150
You just considered a religion.
So I think like that's,

770
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:50.190
that's what Scientology is working towards is getting rid of the cult status.

771
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.660
Just like us as comics that work in their way.
It's that they going up,
you know,

772
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.000
I would say Scientology right now,

773
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:02.370
this selling out improv and they want to become a theater act like a,
you know,

774
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.310
Christianity.
I feel like you like cat.

775
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.540
The Catholicism used to be an arena act and now they're back down to theaters

776
00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:11.550
with after they got caught.
Fucking all those kids.

777
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.070
<v 2>Uh,
I dunno.
Catholicism is like,
they're like,
they're big dude.</v>

778
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:16.760
<v 3>No,
I'll do that.
It's dying in our country.</v>

779
00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:19.490
And so now they're going down to South America.
Watch out.

780
00:45:19.491 --> 00:45:21.440
Everybody in South America.
Don't buy into it.

781
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:24.290
<v 2>No.
I mean,
I know.
I know.
I know you could grow.</v>

782
00:45:24.291 --> 00:45:27.110
I mean really there's like families or just wear a scientologist family that's

783
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.780
just with adults joined.
That's all I get.
No,

784
00:45:29.781 --> 00:45:34.670
but both your parents are Scientologists then you're okay.
They been around long.

785
00:45:34.671 --> 00:45:36.720
I'm sorry.
It's,
yeah.
I don't know.

786
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:41.650
It's not just gay people that joined a week ago.
It's not just guys that,

787
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.870
it's not just guys that like wanted to move up in Hollywood.

788
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.530
<v 3>It's that like right now what is is you have a,</v>

789
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.990
you have a very Hollywood la experience with it,
so there was,
yeah,

790
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:53.010
there was a lot of that

791
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.350
<v 2>seems like in Hollywood it's like if I wasn't gay and I don't want to do Rehab,</v>

792
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.720
then they'll become a scientologist.
It seemed like the next level of a,

793
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:07.260
this sneak in the back door of a career going,

794
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.603
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

795
00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.320
Whenever I look at all religions as the same where if it works via broad,

796
00:46:14.321 --> 00:46:16.030
bless you,
but I think it's all bullshit.

797
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.450
<v 2>Me Too.
I look at the same exact way.</v>

798
00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.480
<v 3>All right.
Growing up as a scientologist,
I was looked at weird,</v>

799
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.980
yelled at in the streets,
brainwashed,
you name it.

800
00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.960
Uh,
brainwashers we sit there talking about all of our fucking shit.
Uh,

801
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:35.290
heard everything.
I never understood it.
What the fuck why though?

802
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:38.170
Then one day it happened.
I look at myself in the mirror.

803
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:42.790
I had a huge piece of lettuce in my teeth all those years.
Embarrassing.

804
00:46:42.791 --> 00:46:44.320
I got says,
he's saying metaphorically,

805
00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:49.570
every comedian who brings up Scientology in that joke's including use says how

806
00:46:49.571 --> 00:46:54.460
crazy we are.
I never said you guys were crazy.
I compared you.
I said,

807
00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:57.820
you were as crazy as my religion.
I thought I showed respect when I said,

808
00:46:57.821 --> 00:46:59.530
you are nuts,
right?
I Dunno.

809
00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.560
I'm trying to make myself the hero and I'll crazy religion is,

810
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:05.470
but I don't believe that that's what you got.
What you guys think.

811
00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:10.120
But does he actually thought we believed in the aliens coming down and the

812
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.120
spaceships and the mind reading?
I never said mind reading.

813
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.040
<v 2>How did they know he was assigning touch industry?
Was He wearing like a,
uh,</v>

814
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:20.070
a battlefield earth tee shirt you probably take?
Probably no,

815
00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.550
he was in Scientology.
We

816
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:24.700
<v 3>told them,
wait a minute.
Whoa.</v>

817
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.450
Because if you actually thought we believed in the aliens coming down the space

818
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.090
ships and the mind reading,
you'd all be on fucking board.
Every one of you.
No,

819
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:37.000
I wouldn't.
That's the cabs of cabs.

820
00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:40.060
That's the coolest shit ever through this.
The coolest shit ever.

821
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:41.770
Just smoking weed,
talking about it.

822
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:46.300
But if it's an actual organization and then some old trusty red edit guy telling

823
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:48.320
me this shit,
yeah,
I don't have fucking buy it now.

824
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:52.960
The other one's Barneys TV and answer them then would be on a spaceship so I

825
00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:53.920
don't buy it.
Anyways.
She says,

826
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.370
I laugh when people say Scientology is crazy and bad and wrong.

827
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.990
And the only source of information on this subject is anti Scientologists who

828
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:06.490
hates Scientology.
I saw the Scientology documentary stay away.
I mean,

829
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.690
it's a decent point.
He's making it a,
if you thought that documentary was good,

830
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:15.610
you would love that documentary Hitler did on the Jews.
Uh,

831
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:18.400
amazing best ever.
Or that documentary

832
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.140
the Wiley Coyote did on the road runner.
Oh Man.
Stay away from the road run.

833
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.030
Most horrible burden all time.
All right,

834
00:48:25.031 --> 00:48:29.240
so this guy's obviously offended and does not have any sense of humor buttons.

835
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.410
You can say whatever you want about the Catholic church.
I mean,

836
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:37.411
we literally tortured people into becoming a torture chamber in this hotel.

837
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.000
Yeah,
800 years old.
Yeah.

838
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.670
You're a torture chamber that they used to put on religious do.

839
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.280
That creeped me out and he goes see that?

840
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:47.950
And it ended at one of the little iron fucking things that you would put the

841
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:51.460
chain around,
a little hoop in the wall.
I was just like,
dude,

842
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:52.360
I don't want to be down here.

843
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:56.320
This what this is like my entertainments and other people get and it was part of

844
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:59.970
the crusade and they will fucking tortured people through.
This is the thing I,

845
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:04.400
you can say whatever you fucking like.
What about my religion?

846
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.780
I'm not saying that there isn't something after for this and spirituality and

847
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:10.300
all that shit.
But religion is,
is a,

848
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.560
is a fucking business and it's in an e.

849
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:18.670
I believe that with mine.
I don't know enough about yours.

850
00:49:18.671 --> 00:49:20.980
And just out of respect that your religion is your religion.

851
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:23.770
I'm not gonna say anything about it,
but like it's pretty much,

852
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:27.730
I dunno if it was be it got blessed.
It's all organized crime.

853
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.770
All right?

854
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:34.030
Most people who are nervous or put off by Scientology have never read any

855
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:38.380
Scientology books.
I dub these people pussy ass bitches.

856
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.580
Scared little men.
Well,
I mean you sounded like a crazy person.

857
00:49:42.581 --> 00:49:45.730
Why do I want to read a book now?

858
00:49:45.731 --> 00:49:48.460
You just sound dumb shit about Scientology though.
It's like,
you know,

859
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.710
have other things to do with my life.
It's like moving.
I want to do that.

860
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.490
I will say this one time somebody recommended an acting class and it was the

861
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:57.640
weirdest fucking thing I ever been in.
All right,
dude.
You know what?

862
00:49:57.641 --> 00:50:00.010
Now I'm going to tell this fucking story.
Cause now you're,

863
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.500
you get going a little too hard here because I'm gonna,
I'm gonna tell you this.

864
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.680
I will,
somebody,
like long,
long time ago,

865
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.680
we're talking billboard with fucking full head of hair long time ago,

866
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.100
said to me a,
uh,

867
00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:15.610
because I was looking to take an acting class because I didn't have an acting

868
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:18.370
gig or anything like that and I was out in La,
you know,
it's what you're doing.

869
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:20.470
You need to get on TV and whatever dumb reason,
right?

870
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:25.210
So this person recommended this acting class.
So I go in,

871
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.930
you know,
acting class,
you know,
it was pretty packed too,
right?
So,

872
00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.530
and there's a guy teaching it,
he's famous.
All right,

873
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.680
I'll tell you after the podcast,
it was so,
I'm like,
wow,
it's revolting blink box,

874
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:42.170
huh?
It was true Travolta.
Blink twice.
But no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He doesn't have time.

875
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:46.910
He's too busy crushing it.
So I fucking go in there and they go,

876
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.310
okay.
And the guy goes to start the class.
He goes,
okay,

877
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.990
does anybody have any news they want to announce?

878
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.590
And some of the class raises their hand and they're like,
yeah,

879
00:50:57.591 --> 00:51:02.030
I just booked two episodes on Jag,
like zone a long time ago.
This dude.

880
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:03.860
And when I tell you the whole class,

881
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.940
like you would've thought somebody just fucking hit three point and to win an

882
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:09.340
NBA championship.
They all just go

883
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:14.810
like fucking crazy.
And I was just like,
dude,
what the fuck?

884
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:16.700
Three other people announced,
oh,

885
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:20.720
I got something on friends or fucking everybody loves Raymond screaming like

886
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:24.200
that.
So then they go,
all right ladies,

887
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:29.350
we have a couple of people auditing the class today.
They go,

888
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:33.470
we got pleased wise,
you stand up comedian,
please welcome Bill Barr Dude.

889
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:36.170
And they cheered that loud again.
Like my face turned red.

890
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:41.060
It was fucking like fucking crazy.
And I'm like,

891
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:45.860
what the fuck?
So during the,
the break of the class,

892
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.130
I go in to meet them,
to talk to him.
I'm auditing the class is what they call it.

893
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.910
You're checking out and the guy's just going like,
you know,

894
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:56.590
we have our own security,
we have our own,
everything was our own,
blah,
blah.

895
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:59.990
And I jokingly said,
Jesus Christ,
they feel like I'm joining a cult.

896
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.200
And he sort of looked at me.
It was,
I was like,
what the,
you know,

897
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.590
so what happened?
So I ended up,
and I talked to the guy during the break,

898
00:52:06.591 --> 00:52:08.600
the famous dude,
and he says,
look at me.
He goes,
well,

899
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:10.970
is that a little much in the beginning was a little much,

900
00:52:10.971 --> 00:52:13.460
and I was looking at him was like,
it was pretty intense dude.

901
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:18.410
So I ended up leaving and I,
I ended up,
I told the story to so many,

902
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:20.660
they will laugh and they go,
where did you go?
And I told them,

903
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.560
and they go build that Scientology.
I go get the fuck out of here.

904
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.680
And then these fucking creeks for like a week kept calling me and like,

905
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.260
dude,
it was freaking me out.
Like they was stocking.
It was a fun,

906
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.170
was supposed to be an acting class and these fucking guys wouldn't leave me

907
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:38.480
alone.
I finally had to get like erm with them and be like,
dude,

908
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.590
I'm not going back.
And the guy goes,
we lost Ya.
Yeah,
Dude.

909
00:52:42.591 --> 00:52:46.010
So fuck you man.
Fuck you.
Like,
dude,
I gotta take something like the,

910
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:50.050
I was like legit,
uncomfortable.
Like I got to the point where like,
I felt like,

911
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:52.560
I'm like these motherfuckers following me around.
Yeah,

912
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.330
<v 2>you do.
Like in San Francisco,
they'd have chicks that go,
hey,</v>

913
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.380
you want to take your personality test?

914
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.240
I'll go sit in a booth with you for 20 minutes.

915
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:04.310
And then all of a sudden it's like they tried to get you to become

916
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.190
Scientologists,
but I don't know why.
Like I don't want to sound stupid.

917
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:10.610
I like reading books,
but are say,
well,
I'm just like,
why don't you read a book?

918
00:53:10.611 --> 00:53:13.910
It's like,
why don't,
why don't,
why do I want to read a book about that Shit?

919
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.830
Listen,
here's the thing,
Joe.
Having said all that,
what they do,

920
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:23.900
and that is way less than the inquisition or any of that other shit.
However,

921
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.190
it's still all unacceptable

922
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.270
<v 3>fucking behavior as far as I'm concerned.
And I'm entitled to that.
So dude,</v>

923
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:33.570
I respect the fact that you are Scientologists.
You want to do that shit.

924
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.980
God bless you people.
You want to go to fucking church people over here?

925
00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:40.650
Whatever the fuck you guys want to do.
I don't give a fuck.
Just,

926
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.770
I just just respect me that I,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't want to,

927
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.950
I don't want to be a part of it.
I just don't want to be a part of it.

928
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:50.160
I just want to be a fucking,
do you know what my new religion is right now,
Joe?

929
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:55.230
The new queer eye for the straight guy on Netflix because they've now taken it

930
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:59.400
to the point that they don't just,
you know,

931
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.720
find straight guys that dress like us
trying and help us out.

932
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:06.500
They actually help people's lives.
Like I saw them.

933
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:10.620
They helped out these two sweet older women that they were running their dad's

934
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:14.040
barbecue joint in fucking Kansas City.
Not only did they do,

935
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.320
we'll make over their clothes.
They got their teeth fixed,

936
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:17.430
they got their hair done.

937
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.870
Then they fucking redid their whole barbecue place without ruining it.

938
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.680
They just updated it and then they also got their secret barbecue sauce.

939
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:29.620
Think they found a factory down the street that would jar it.
They could sell it.

940
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:34.260
So it's like a,
so it's like a bar rescue and queer eye for the straight guy.

941
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.260
Yeah.
But you know,
when I watch bar rescue,

942
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.780
there's something about when they go in there and they're just gagging because

943
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:43.990
of puts those people in like morons.
These people just like needed help.
I feel,

944
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:44.860
I don't know.

945
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:47.970
Everyone's bar seemed like a better place to drink before Taffer gets there.

946
00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:48.410
Okay.

947
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.243
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

948
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.430
<v 3>It's all free drinks and chicks taken off their clothes.</v>

949
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.490
They'd tap her shows up and it's like,
yeah,
I don't need a mint.
Julep

950
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.633
<v 1>yeah,</v>

951
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.900
<v 3>I went that broad top was giving me a favor.
Give me a shot and a beer.
Well,</v>

952
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.070
I just watched one episode of that,
the new queer eye that Kansas City,

953
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.870
when I watched it with me when we were in Iceland,

954
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.000
it literally made me want to be a better person.

955
00:55:12.001 --> 00:55:15.900
Like I'm like all we do is bitch about rich people and fucking politicians and

956
00:55:15.901 --> 00:55:18.270
all of this shit and religion and all of that.
And like me,

957
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:22.320
while we can all be helping each other out,
uh,
on,
on the bottom.

958
00:55:22.321 --> 00:55:24.390
And then then fuck all these people.
It's just like,

959
00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:26.430
and maybe I don't know what I'm going to do.

960
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.360
Probably nothing because I'm a selfish cunt,
but it made,
you know,

961
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.420
it's such a good shot.
Made me think of being about a good being a good person.

962
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.530
Right.
That's a step.
It's his first.
Yeah.

963
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.060
I was going to start singing that Michael Jackson song,

964
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:44.270
but it's a bad time to do that.
All right.
The man in the mirror.
Okay.

965
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.540
All Dad.
Hey Billy billionaire,
give him seven 70%.

966
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.680
I don't even know what that means.
Like cause I was bitching that,
you know,

967
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.090
they should look at the 20 trillion on tax US dollars and the fucking Caribbean

968
00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:01.200
rather than fucking going after newly rich fucking college kids who invented an

969
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:05.360
app and had the audacity to be worth more than 10 million bucks.
Uh,

970
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:09.330
my boyfriend and I have been together nearly four years and the baby talk is

971
00:56:09.331 --> 00:56:13.020
starting to get more serious on his part.
Oh,

972
00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:17.820
I've never really wanted children.
In fact,
I hate most kids,

973
00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:22.170
but I am somewhat open to the idea.
Oh Geez,
you're all over the road here.

974
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:26.950
The problem is that he is 46 and I am 28.
Well yeah,

975
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:28.060
that was going to be a problem.

976
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:33.040
His balls or dre and up over there I can see myself wanting a kid later maybe in

977
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:35.530
five to 10 years.
But with him being so old,

978
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:38.320
I'm not sure we have that kind of time though.
Uh,

979
00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:41.500
you talk about being an old dad all the time and the podcast and while it's

980
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:44.890
funny,
I can see where it's also terrifying.
Yeah.

981
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:49.420
Like am I going to die before I get this bird flying here?

982
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:54.880
Uh,
by the way,
uh,
good on you for getting fit and healthy.
Uh,

983
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.700
we started going to the gym and eating healthy a few years ago.

984
00:56:57.701 --> 00:57:01.150
Our only problem is a little weekend binge drinking.

985
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:05.620
He also hits the Adderall hard at those times.
Oh boy.

986
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.660
Obviously that panics me when considering having children.
Other than that,

987
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:15.340
we make a small team.
We split bills,
travel and have individual hobbies.

988
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.150
Somehow the age different hasn't been a problem except with the baby talk.

989
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:22.480
Should I pull back on the fear and go for it?

990
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.520
Try to wait until I feel ready,

991
00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:28.630
which could be never tell them to adopt another dog.
Thanks in advance.

992
00:57:28.631 --> 00:57:33.370
And if they try to take 70% fight then to the death cheers.

993
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:37.100
Um,
Bill.
Um,
all right.
My opinion

994
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.760
<v 2>and you don't want to,
she didn't want to hear my up and,
all right,</v>

995
00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.030
let's say you guys don't have a kid.
You're gonna ruin your life.

996
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.520
She needs a kid.
He can find somebody else.
Route 28.
You got another 10 years.

997
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.300
You love travel.
You love this.
You love that.
It changes everything.

998
00:57:53.301 --> 00:57:55.720
If you're not ready to have a kid,
do not bring a kid into this one

999
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.710
<v 3>world.
Yeah.
I look at it like a,</v>

1000
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.860
if you love this guy,
you know,
I don't know.
I've seen not,
not,

1001
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.330
it's been nothing but positive having a kid for my myself.

1002
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:10.280
I'm not saying you're not saying it's not positive.
Um,

1003
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.780
but if you're not on the same page,
that's kind of a big thing.

1004
00:58:13.781 --> 00:58:18.730
And that guy doesn't have a lot of time.
Uh,
I dunno.

1005
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:21.900
I guess Tony Randall,
the Mick Jagger had one of those 70 stuff.

1006
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:22.870
Let me not together.

1007
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.430
<v 2>I mean,
I love my daughter everything,</v>

1008
00:58:27.431 --> 00:58:30.640
but your life changes and it seems to me that you're still young.

1009
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:32.940
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:33.451
<v 2>And you want to,</v>

1011
00:58:33.451 --> 00:58:36.600
and you're traveling and you're doing this and you're doing that.
And it's like,

1012
00:58:36.601 --> 00:58:37.710
that ends.

1013
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.570
<v 3>I,
I,
but I also look at like 28.
It's a great age to have a fucking kid.</v>

1014
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.600
I mean,
you,

1015
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.230
you kicked fucking graduates college right around the time you're 50.

1016
00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:53.460
Then you're going to get to be a grandmother or grandfather.
You get to see that.

1017
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.220
We'd get the fucking give people four.

1018
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.860
I'm shippers and they don't do anything in the fucking airport that this,
listen,

1019
00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:02.790
this Biz,
like any big decisions,
there's,
um,

1020
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.880
there's like,
you know,
this ups and downs.

1021
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.030
<v 2>Just get the kid in the old fashioned way.
Fuck around.
And if you get pregnant,</v>

1022
00:59:10.031 --> 00:59:11.890
it's a miracle.
If you don't,
you don't.

1023
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.620
<v 3>All right.
What's the advice that I ever send advice?</v>

1024
00:59:16.621 --> 00:59:20.060
Don't listen to either one of us.
All right.
Need some advice,
buddy.

1025
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:24.200
Billy baldness.
I Love U podcast.
Now he's [inaudible].
Right,
thank you.
Uh,

1026
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:27.020
but ask us just to decide.
I'm in some shit.

1027
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:31.070
So I've been dating this girl for almost two years now and everything has been

1028
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:35.480
great up until about four months ago.
She is non-binary.

1029
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:40.100
What does that mean?
Uh,
that's,
that's above my pay grade.

1030
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:41.600
Hang on a second.
I gotta look that up.

1031
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:46.040
That's one of them codes for like gay but not gay or whatever.
Yeah,

1032
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:48.890
that's one of those ones who take dresses up differently but means to be

1033
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:49.960
somebody else.
But

1034
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.133
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1035
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.410
<v 3>All right.
That went to gender queer Wikipedia.</v>

1036
00:59:56.190 --> 01:00:00.660
What is not by a non non binary gender is an umbrella term to describe any

1037
01:00:00.661 --> 01:00:04.770
gender identity that does not fit into the gender binary of male or female.

1038
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1039
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:13.280
<v 3>Like I said,
nice to try and do the math on that.
So yeah,</v>

1040
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.300
I'm not good in Algebra either.
Wait,

1041
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.580
[inaudible] my daughter's math tutor to tote.

1042
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.930
I don't give a fuck if I'm looking up shit like this or just the definition of a

1043
01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:26.220
word.
Then there's always like another 20 things you have to look up.
Dude.

1044
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.920
I looked up this stupid patriots and Mitchell and ness coat like fucking four

1045
01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:32.170
months ago.
They won't leave me alone.
I'm not buying it.

1046
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.510
Fucking fluff it up with the ads.

1047
01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.900
<v 2>You think he'd give up after you Google?
Not Gender by Nick.</v>

1048
01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:43.940
Maybe.
Maybe he doesn't want a patriots jacket.
All right.

1049
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.670
Now you ready to get them off your trail?

1050
01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.000
<v 3>Nonviolent.</v>

1051
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.090
Various gender is an umbrella term to describe your identity as not fitting into

1052
01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:51.510
any gender.
Binary.
Male and female.

1053
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.190
Non Binary gender also sometimes referred to as gender queer.

1054
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.640
People may for exit and I don't understand gender queer.

1055
01:00:58.641 --> 01:01:03.110
I thought queer was offensive,
but if you,
if it's part of a bigger word,
it isn't.

1056
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.060
For example,
identify.

1057
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.043
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1058
01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:07.943
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

1059
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:13.810
as having no gender fall on a gender spectrum somewhere between male and female

1060
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.560
identifi.
Oh,
okay.
All right.
I,
I think I'd get that now.

1061
01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:23.330
That just means like people look at you to look at you naked.
You're a dude,

1062
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:28.420
but you don't feel like a dude.
Right?
Oh Lord.
I know we could.
A,

1063
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.080
we could never sound dumb right now.

1064
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:33.370
Let's just follow that this high since she's non binaries.

1065
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:38.380
So she has no real sexual preference and she's had had a female friend that she

1066
01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:42.560
dated in high school.
Does that mean this?
Why did he just say she's cool?

1067
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:47.590
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1068
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:52.030
<v 2>I like not by Neri chicks.
That's my kind of chick.
No,
you know,</v>

1069
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.760
that's what they were not learning new words.
You learn something every day.

1070
01:01:54.761 --> 01:01:59.250
I look at that
[inaudible]

1071
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:05.650
<v 3>all right.
Uh,
so she is non-binary says she has no resection private.</v>

1072
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:09.310
She's had a female friend that she dated in high school and it was on and off

1073
01:02:09.311 --> 01:02:10.450
from what I understand.

1074
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.710
But this person moved to California years ago and moved back to our state like

1075
01:02:14.711 --> 01:02:18.160
six months ago and that's when the problem starts.

1076
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:22.410
I had no issue it dude,
you gotta somehow.
No,
you gotta get in there.

1077
01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:25.740
Oh my goodness.
You got to get an idea.

1078
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.620
I had no issue with it until we see one of my girlfriend asked me if I would

1079
01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:33.540
mind if she got a girlfriend,
but I'm not cool with that.

1080
01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:37.350
We talked somewhat about it and she gets irate every time we talk.

1081
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.550
Last night she you wrote cute.

1082
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.480
She cut basically all her hair off and all I can see is get friend now what food

1083
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.500
,
this is like the most important part of the sentence.

1084
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:59.250
On top of that she's been posting nonstop about gay stuff.

1085
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:04.550
Normally I wouldn't care but they also snapchat each other at all times of the

1086
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.620
day and she's gotten very private about her phone.
I mean Jesus Christ.

1087
01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:10.030
Do you have any more red flags?
Seat knee,

1088
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:14.700
which lends me that she walked around with a tee shirt that said not failing

1089
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.770
Dick Right now.
I mean it's,
yeah,
she's,
this is a wrap dude,

1090
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:23.430
which leads me to believe some shit is going town.

1091
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.960
She says she doesn't want to leave me but also won't budge with my requests on

1092
01:03:27.961 --> 01:03:31.110
them taking less on changing platforms.
Listen Dude,

1093
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:36.530
what's going on here is because she doesn't identify is she's kind of leap

1094
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.380
frogging over with political correctness that she's going to go fucking have sex

1095
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:44.940
with somebody else.
When she's,

1096
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
is she in a committed relationship and you have an open relationship,

1097
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.980
then I guess you'd have to roll with this.

1098
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:51.720
But if you guys are in a committed relationship,
she,

1099
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:55.920
she goes out and gets with a guy or a woman that's not cool.
Like,
dude,

1100
01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.940
you got to like,
I would get out of this.
She invited,
she lays him in though.

1101
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.760
Wait,
he's the one that said,
no,
wait,
I missed that part.
Well,

1102
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:09.840
I think up there somewhere,
eh,
Santa Claus lives,

1103
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:14.850
she's nonbinary and she's had a female friend,
blah,
blah,
blah.
No,
on and off.

1104
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.730
But this person moved to California.
I had no issue with this until recently.

1105
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:20.700
My girlfriend asked me if I wouldn't mind if she got a girlfriend,

1106
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.180
um,
that,
that will,
uh,
ice like him.
Well,
am I going?

1107
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:30.700
Am I be going to be part of that folk?
Excuse me.
I was wearing,

1108
01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:33.700
I thought you said that.
She said,
listen,
jump.

1109
01:04:33.701 --> 01:04:37.290
Don't let your fantasy get in the way of what these people actually say.
Anyway.

1110
01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:41.580
Also also to throw a wrench in everything we have.

1111
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.490
We have an apartment together and we are both on the lease.

1112
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.420
I'm kind of fucked because I have no family out here and just one friend I

1113
01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:50.280
initially moved out here for,

1114
01:04:50.281 --> 01:04:53.760
but he got a lady and turned his back on me about a year ago.

1115
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:56.940
What you got a lady to do?
What are you talking about?
Any advice?

1116
01:04:56.941 --> 01:05:01.560
Please keep up the content.
My bald brother.
All right.
This is what I would do,

1117
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:06.390
dude.
Like um,
yeah,
I would just get out of this fucking thing.

1118
01:05:06.391 --> 01:05:09.810
And you're both on the lease so you know she wants to have a new girlfriend over

1119
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.830
ladder.
Who gives a fuck?
And this is the thing,
dude,
I would break her,

1120
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:17.890
I'd break up with her and then just be,
just be fucking cool.

1121
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:20.270
All right.
Don't get involved in.

1122
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.720
But then you know what's going to happen is they're going to mind you to get the

1123
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:26.440
fuck out of there.
But I would actually work on my life more.

1124
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.370
He can't tell me.
Wherever the fuck do you live in?
Does not a place that you can

1125
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:36.070
find on your own.
You know what I would do with the way she just said,
fuck this,

1126
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:37.390
I'm getting a girlfriend and cut her hair.

1127
01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:40.450
She's just doing what the fuck she wants to do.
Then I would be like,
fine.

1128
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:44.780
What I would do,
I go,
I would go out Madrigal well,

1129
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.540
Al just gets the whole fucking thing done.

1130
01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:49.300
And then just hands them a box full of stuff and be,
here's your stuff.

1131
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.780
We're broken up.
I would go fucking get another apartment.
All right.

1132
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:58.600
And uh,
one day while she's at work,
I'd take a day off from work.
I'd get a buddy,

1133
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:03.430
I move all my shit out,
and then that would be it.
And a,

1134
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:04.720
and I had to call and say,
listen,

1135
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:08.770
we need to talk and she's going to come home and be like,
where's all your stuff?

1136
01:06:08.771 --> 01:06:11.200
I said,
it moved into an apartment because we're breaking up.

1137
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.790
And then she's going to get mad.
She's going to say,
you're a coward,

1138
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:16.510
you're a pussy.
And it's like,
no,
no,
no.

1139
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.520
I'm not going to fucking stay here while you mentally fucking torture me.
Okay.

1140
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:24.640
You're doing what the fuck do you want to do?
You know?

1141
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:29.140
So that's good advice.
Yeah,
I'm doing what the fuck he needs to get out.
Yeah.

1142
01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:34.030
Get out of it.
Because she obviously is saying we're done.
Yeah.

1143
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:38.890
And I think that she's leaning,
I mean,
what I can't get,

1144
01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:41.350
not,
not the gay part of it.

1145
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.560
What I can't get past is that you're in a fucking relationship and she's going

1146
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:47.710
to start banging somebody else like,
yeah,
this is what the fuck I'm doing.

1147
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.520
If you were to say that I'm going to start banging another woman,

1148
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:54.250
is it okay if I get a girlfriend?
I don't think she'd be cool with that.

1149
01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:58.420
So I mean,
I don't know all the parameters of that,
but like,

1150
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:01.600
you know,
if you're with a woman,

1151
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:04.630
if she starts banging another woman or a man than,
I don't know whether your,

1152
01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.080
your relationship is at that point,
she didn't invite you in your,

1153
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:11.980
she's basically cheating on you to your face.
Yeah.

1154
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.200
But just because you ask is that,
is that,
I'm going to try that with my wife.

1155
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:19.750
Is it all right if I get a girlfriend in the sun?
All right.

1156
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:24.730
Sex with my feeling very binary.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1157
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:27.030
Whoa.
My God.
Notify you via an area.

1158
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:32.380
If I say my urinary and then I just get my new girlfriend and dress like a dude,

1159
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.110
then to wait on like a technicality.

1160
01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:39.490
[inaudible] my wife bought me an apology.
Like if I bang the new chick.
All right.

1161
01:07:39.491 --> 01:07:40.540
Sex with my wife.

1162
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:45.850
So I am 36 years old and I had been with my wife since I was 19 my wife is one

1163
01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:48.670
year younger than me.
Okay,

1164
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.720
so she's 35 we have three children.
1510 and three.
I mean,
look at this guy.

1165
01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:54.520
This guy's going to be a great grandfather.
I'm jealous.

1166
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.900
We only have sex on average about twice a month.
Dude,
that's amazing.

1167
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:04.030
If you have three fucking kids,
you've been together that long.
Yeah.

1168
01:08:04.031 --> 01:08:06.400
This guy's doing Greg's killing it.
He's killing it.

1169
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:09.280
It's been like this on and off since we had kids.

1170
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:12.130
I met to the point now where I don't even make a move.

1171
01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:17.240
I can't stand the rejection.
So I'll topman the fuck up,
man.
You got to see them.

1172
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.940
You got to see the funny,
they'll hilariousness in it.

1173
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.650
And then the patheticness when he did grab your laptop and go once and porn,
hey,

1174
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.120
welcome to the fraternity.
Uh,
so I just waited until she makes the move.

1175
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:33.440
But I get in a very bad mood after a week without sex.
Oh,
Jesus.

1176
01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.410
<v 2>The man,
the man has no hands.</v>

1177
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:40.320
<v 3>Yeah.
Rob went out,
uh,
from one out,
go smoke a cigar.
Uh,</v>

1178
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:44.630
she will ask what's wrong?
I just replied,
nothing.
Well,
that's your fault.

1179
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:46.430
You got to communicate.

1180
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.370
We haven't very good relationship with the exception of sex.

1181
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.880
I get to a point where I'm actually thinking of leaving her over this,

1182
01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:56.360
but I love my children.
What should I do?
All right.
You're not going to leave.

1183
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.940
Here's the deal.
You have to just,
you got to tell her how important sex is.

1184
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.500
All right?
And you got to tell her that you get in a bad mood.
She does.

1185
01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:05.300
She's not taking care of you on some level,

1186
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:08.600
but this was one of these things with these modern day women where it's just

1187
01:09:08.601 --> 01:09:11.930
like,
you know,
if they're not getting what they need,

1188
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:16.010
they can tell you that you have to do all of these fucking things.
But you know,

1189
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:17.420
if,
if you're like,

1190
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:23.060
I dunno if you ask them to do anything that's considered,
you know,

1191
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:27.320
taking care of you nowadays.
Like I won't even bother with this conversation.

1192
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.840
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
but you know,</v>

1193
01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:33.410
as sad as it sad is a mediocre hand job can be sometimes that's all you need.

1194
01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.680
Maybe,
maybe,
maybe,
maybe.
No,

1195
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:40.010
he doesn't have to be this full law and extravagance.
But maybe,

1196
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.150
maybe once or twice or more a month she could pop into the quick 10 minute
handy,

1197
01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:48.280
<v 3>you know?
I can't tell you though.
You can't try to get her motor running though.</v>

1198
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.650
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Because sometimes women just went,
okay.
It's like,
you know,</v>

1199
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:54.800
it's like another chore.
It's like,
I'll drop you off and go do something else.

1200
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.020
It's like,
so then you just need that other hand.

1201
01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.200
<v 3>No,
it's I gotta I gotta be,
I gotta be honest.
Like it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,</v>

1202
01:10:02.201 --> 01:10:04.090
it really is fucking ridiculous.

1203
01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:07.600
Like the amount of complaint and women do,

1204
01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.600
but the way a husband is treated through,
like,

1205
01:10:10.601 --> 01:10:12.700
I always say like when you first meet your wife,

1206
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:16.720
you'd like the starting quarterback on the team and by the time you get fucking

1207
01:10:16.721 --> 01:10:19.660
married,
you get treated like you're on the taxi squad.
Like,
like you,

1208
01:10:19.661 --> 01:10:21.550
you never even won a championship ever.

1209
01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.820
<v 2>Well that's exactly right.</v>

1210
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.290
Before like w four you have a kid like your Duke and the number one seed.

1211
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.260
And then now my dog is like a 70 [inaudible] now my daughter.

1212
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.040
And now my is like Wichita state.
I'm in the nit,
dude.

1213
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.500
<v 3>Unless I get the kid comes first.</v>

1214
01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:43.130
That's what I'm talking about is like the,
the,
the way,

1215
01:10:43.131 --> 01:10:46.910
somewhere along the line you just start looking at yourself like when did I

1216
01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.890
become the PA of this family?

1217
01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:54.410
And they'll go grab us some coffee.
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't fucking,
I,

1218
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.100
you know,
that's,
that's one of the,
I gotta be honest with you dude.

1219
01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:02.510
All these bitch moaning and complaining that all these women are doing

1220
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.350
specifically white women,
which is just inherently hilarious.
Um,

1221
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.820
is,
is I really just like,
I don't,
I don't,

1222
01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.620
I don't even know where to fucking begin on this one because every fucking guy

1223
01:11:16.621 --> 01:11:20.730
that I talked to who's married is really in the same situation.

1224
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:23.490
And I think it's why guys are so funny is because our,

1225
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:28.140
our situation is funny.
It's like your,

1226
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:32.430
your,
your status versus they're complaining.

1227
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:36.570
You would think that they were living the way that we're living.
It doesn't even,

1228
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.820
it's like you're living in like this alternate universe.

1229
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.130
Like sometimes you want to be like,
wait,
you're complaining,
you're tired.

1230
01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:47.040
Like I dunno,
I,
I to just say I'm a terrible husband,

1231
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.080
but my wife doesn't really complain.
My wife has no other complaints.
She,
she's,

1232
01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.150
she's,
she's really known the components.
Jesus,

1233
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.690
you're a much better husband than me.

1234
01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.760
So I'm sure my wife has her complaints.
No,
no,
I'm not even saying that.

1235
01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:01.980
You know what I'm talking,
I'm not talking about my wife and playing.

1236
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:05.970
I'm talking about all this fucking complaining that is going on with women right

1237
01:12:05.971 --> 01:12:08.610
now.
And it's just like,
like when,

1238
01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:11.490
when they get fucking married for the most fucking,
it's like,

1239
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:16.830
I'm trying to think of a guy that I know who's actually even remotely running

1240
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:21.660
his household.
I just don't,
I just don't see it.
It's like what they want.

1241
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.490
And if they don't get what they want,

1242
01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:25.620
then you're gonna have to deal with their emotions for three days.

1243
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:29.580
So you just like,
subconsciously you just start giving into it.
Okay.

1244
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.920
Which is how the thing works,
which is fine.

1245
01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:34.470
So I don't understand what all the fucking complaining is about,

1246
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:36.750
but evidentaly evidently,

1247
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.090
cause they only got the right to vote a hundred years ago.

1248
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:41.880
They're lives are fucking horrific.
Um,

1249
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.000
girl,
I do,
I get to bring up the potato famine.

1250
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:52.080
A girl kissed another guy.
Oh Jesus.
Here we go.

1251
01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.520
A I neri broad.
Hey,
uh,
Billy,

1252
01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.520
totally red nuts.
I like how you want to use your new fucking

1253
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.290
very broad.
I think this is a great one.
I love it.
No,
but that is,

1254
01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.210
she said she kissed another guy so she wouldn't be bothered with that.

1255
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.020
She's like,
oh,
sorry.

1256
01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:15.120
I know you get that dyslexia blend them blinds.
Okay.
Oh,
the heat?

1257
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.210
No.
Yeah.
You're going to get her old friend kissed another guy.
Alright.

1258
01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.510
Not non-binary.
Ooh,

1259
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.370
they're right on the fucking,
we're out in the edge of society.
No.

1260
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:31.980
Those other letters at the end of the LBG.
What does that one queer nation.

1261
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.980
Genderqueer.
All right.
There's another one issue

1262
01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.850
in that I can never remember the bravos sports to remember it.
All right.

1263
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.700
Just want to say I have a lot of respect for you,
eh.
Thank you.
Anyways,

1264
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:51.120
I'm a freshman in college and I live on the same hall as my girlfriend.

1265
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.620
The other night.
A bunch of the people on our floor,
we're drinking.

1266
01:13:55.621 --> 01:13:56.760
We all got plastic.

1267
01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:01.050
One thing leads to another and someone proposes the idea of spin the bottle.

1268
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.530
I'm not stoked on playing,
but whatever,
I guess.
All right.

1269
01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:08.880
There's your first mistake.
You didn't validate what you were feeling.

1270
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.240
Kissing a few dudes and some girls that I don't want to kiss his.

1271
01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:17.920
Evidently how my night is going to go.
Well,

1272
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.270
you have to kiss the guys.

1273
01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.920
<v 2>Yeah.
That doesn't sound right.</v>

1274
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:26.310
<v 3>Every,
every time.
It's a different world out there,
Joe.
Every time it lands on me,</v>

1275
01:14:26.311 --> 01:14:31.311
I'm doing the tight lip shit as to not upset anyone because that like seemed

1276
01:14:32.671 --> 01:14:34.050
like the right thing to do,

1277
01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.630
which are the guys kiss the guys too,
which is crazy.
My girlfriend,

1278
01:14:39.631 --> 01:14:43.200
however,
is straight up lip locking,
kissing dudes.

1279
01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.710
No tongue or passion or anything,

1280
01:14:46.711 --> 01:14:49.920
but still I felt weird about it.
Yeah.

1281
01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:52.530
Later that night she cried to me gap,

1282
01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.340
so now you feel like the asshole and assured me that it didn't mean anything,

1283
01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.570
but I just can't get the image of her kissing this other dude out of my head,

1284
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.040
nor should you.
She would never cheat on me.
I know that,

1285
01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:08.370
so I'm probably just being a posting.
Any advice would be appreciated.

1286
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:09.121
Here's some advice.

1287
01:15:09.121 --> 01:15:12.790
Don't play spin the bottle with the check he had fucking feelings with with

1288
01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:13.643
other guys.

1289
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.810
<v 2>There is no wrong.
Yeah,
it's like a worst game of spin the bottle ever.
Hey,</v>

1290
01:15:17.811 --> 01:15:20.180
here's my girlfriend than some dudes.
You're always going to come,

1291
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.820
you're always going to lose.
There's always like,

1292
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.740
you're always going to hit the balls be a win for you.

1293
01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.370
So if you find the one hot chick you kind of like on that floor,

1294
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.730
then your girlfriend's going to be pissed.
Why would you play that?

1295
01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.480
<v 3>All right,
so here's the thing,
dude,
I can tell you this right now.</v>

1296
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:37.710
If it was the other way around and she felt that she would have cried either way

1297
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.290
and she would have felt upset about it and you,

1298
01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:45.450
you would have had to validate her feelings on it,
okay?

1299
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:50.700
But because now it's all about their fucking feelings here.
I'm so fucking JD,

1300
01:15:50.701 --> 01:15:52.610
dude.
It's going to be all about fuck you do.

1301
01:15:52.611 --> 01:15:55.830
This is what you feel and let her cry all the fuck she wants.

1302
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:59.190
This is what you feel and he can't get past it.
Fucking break up with her.

1303
01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.480
But here's another thing too.
You fucking,
you fucked up in the beginning,
okay?

1304
01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:06.930
And this is the life lessons.
You were not cool with it and you didn't,

1305
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.080
but you seem like a shutdown dude.
We just like,
well,

1306
01:16:10.081 --> 01:16:12.600
I'm just going to go along with this even though I don't like this.

1307
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.790
So now you turn around in a way,
you know something.
Wait,

1308
01:16:14.791 --> 01:16:19.320
I changed this because you acted like you were okay with it and now you're not,

1309
01:16:19.321 --> 01:16:21.330
and now you're judging her.
So now I actually,

1310
01:16:21.331 --> 01:16:24.180
you know something you fucked up here,
sir.

1311
01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:26.550
I'm just going to give it to you straight like a man.

1312
01:16:26.551 --> 01:16:30.840
You didn't feel like you weren't comfortable with it and you didn't fucking say

1313
01:16:30.841 --> 01:16:31.380
anything.

1314
01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:34.980
And then you sat back and you let her do shit you weren't comfortable with and

1315
01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:37.140
now you're giving me grief over it.
So now you know something.

1316
01:16:37.141 --> 01:16:40.100
I actually validate her.
Tears took me a minute,
took me awhile to,

1317
01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.510
I had to get there.
I had to get there,

1318
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:45.110
<v 2>validate her tears and I will say this,
she's a chick,</v>

1319
01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:48.990
your date and on your floor and your freshman year of college,
get over it.

1320
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:53.160
Move along.
Don't put too much into her.
You gotta.
You gotta live your whole life.

1321
01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.220
Yeah,
it's a bad thing again with the same floor.
That's a bad situation anyway.

1322
01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.290
When you know it's like it's,
it's going to go bad and joy.

1323
01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:05.070
The joy the moment you had move along the sophomore year.

1324
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.570
And try not to date someone on your floor Banger,
but don't fucking dater.

1325
01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:16.810
<v 3>I'm at sage advice.
Joe Barton,
nick,
everybody.
Rose Bowl,</v>

1326
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.970
tailgate legend,
absolutely crushed it over here in Europe.

1327
01:17:19.971 --> 01:17:23.450
And we're going to go walk along the boardwalk here around in Israel.
Tinder,

1328
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:28.010
the board.
Walk down by the Mediterranean Sea.
Sorry,

1329
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:32.810
I can't sing.
All right,
go bro.
And wrap it up tonight.
I hope.
Uh,
that's it.

1330
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:36.250
And thank you to everybody.
The bottom of my heart.
Everybody who showed up,

1331
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:41.290
ridiculous amount of people showed up on this tour or I want to thank them too.

1332
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:45.650
And I mean,
just as the opening act,
you guys trigger me fucking amazing.

1333
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:48.410
Everybody loved Europe.
Everybody.
Yep.

1334
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.990
And we're going to finish strong tonight here in Tel Aviv.
Sick.

1335
01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:55.100
Thank you for the whole tour,
man.
Thank you.

1336
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:58.520
And thank God Clemson and Kenny for treating me the best.
Oh,

1337
01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:02.540
either the bath caddy is the best.
He is a prince.

1338
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:06.350
He's like the Prince of Europe.
That's right.
All right,
guys,
go fuck yourselves.

1339
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:07.610
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
