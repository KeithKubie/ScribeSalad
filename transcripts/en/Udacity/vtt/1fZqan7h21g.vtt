00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
So, these three rules here, you might be thinking, okay, come on we're in the last unit.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.290
Why are we even discussing this? The thing is this.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.730
When we talk about problems that no computer can solve,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.950
I do not want to  be talking about these problems here, beauty of a painting,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.140
or predicting soccer matches or forecasting the lottery.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.720
I want to talk about problems that meet these three requirements here

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.070
and while we can still prove that no computer will be able to solve them

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.960
although these requirements here might sound very simple at first,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.900
its easy to miss some of the details here, which is of course why we're now going to have our first quiz.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.090
I'm going to give you a number of problems and I want you to tell me

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.980
if this is a computer problem according to these three rules here

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.850
or if we would not consider this as a computer problem.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.670
And you have to be very careful here.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
So, some of them are a little bit tricky, but then again you're already in the final unit.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.910
So, you've learned how to deal with tricky questions by now, I hope.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.040
So, here are eight problems for which I would like you to determine

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.380
if they are computer problems according to these rules here.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.760
And again, some of them are bit tricky so you have to be really, really careful in checking it.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.950
The first three problems, given an essay written by his student.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.930
First problems, does that essay have at least 10,000 characters

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.680
Second question, which grade does this essay deserve

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.700
And third question, does the essay contain any misspelled words.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.620
A second set of potential computer problem would be the following here.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.950
Given two integers larger than zero, what is the sum of these two numbers?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.190
Second potential problem, does the smaller integer divide the larger one

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.120
So is it a factor of the larger one so to say.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.180
Third question, given those two integers, please output a random integer between these two.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.589
So, between the smaller one and the larger one.

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:39.970
And finally, I have two more problems for you to check.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.770
One problem is given the string of zeros and ones, check if that string is randomly generated

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.490
and finally, calculate the square root of 5.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.770
So, please for each of these problems, if you think that this is a computer problem

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.389
according to these three rules here then make a check mark,otherwise, leave the box blank.

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:01.430
Again, some of them are a little tricky so you need to check carefully

00:02:01.430 --> 99:59:59.000
and if you get stuck then of course you can also skip to the answer, give this some thought first.
