00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.440
Listening to a lover is a vital skill in relationships,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.640
but there is an associated and perhaps less well recognized talent

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.060
that we may also need to nurture; that of sometimes,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:20.520
not quite listening to what a lover is saying in favor of deathly imagining what they might really mean,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.060
which could be a different thing altogether.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.900
Though taking someone at face value is rightly judged to be a supreme symbol of respect,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.700
within love, it may at points be more accurate, as well as a great deal kinder,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.420
to dig beneath the surface-meaning of words in a search for a partner's real, but more bashful, complex

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.900
or hesitant, underlying intention.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.280
We need to get better at the business of emotional translation--

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.280
at navigating the gap between what people say and what they mean.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.420
Here are some typical examples of the divide.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.900
It can feel profoundly humiliating to admit to another human being

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.880
that they have the power to unnerve, hurt, and destroy us.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.180
To start to love someone is at once to be strengthened in key ways,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.180
but also to be weakened and placed at their mercy, for we become,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.240
if love has gone right, heavily reliant on their good behavior, their kindness, and their dependability.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.060
When this is not forthcoming, we may choose not to lay bare our weakness to the lover who has exploited it.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.140
Our protestations that we're "just fine" are an attempt, as unconvincing as they are touching,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.980
to lay claim to a solidity and invulnerability that our love has, in fact, stripped us of.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.840
It cannot, of course, be that simple or that stark.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.880
For a start, we almost never say such things to people we aren't certain love us really quite a lot.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.240
We need to be very secure and comfortable around someone

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.200
before we can dare to tell them that we want them dead.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.480
Secondly, this kind of rage is evidence not of simple contempt, but rather of immense hope.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.040
We don't speak like this to our colleagues or our friends, not just because we're polite,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.900
but because we don't care about them enough.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.440
We haven't bothered to expect very much from them,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.880
and therefore, cannot muster a fury when they disappoint us.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.520
Only when the bar of expectation has been set dauntingly high,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.000
do we allow ourselves to give way to boundless fury.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.860
This kind of incensed talk is one of the odder gifts of love.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.300
Our authority over our lovers is frequently rather tenuous.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.120
There are so many things we'd like them to do and want, but we cannot, sadly, direct them like marionettes.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.480
Often, the only recourse is to demand without asking--

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.000
to imply without saying.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.780
We aren't just being coy--

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.800
we're up against the limits of what we're able to control.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.480
Passive aggression is what happens to dictatorial wishes

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.740
when they're tempered by the egalitarian reality of relationships.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.820
For the person on the receiving end, it's often hard to know what's happened.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.480
They feel controlled, heavy, guilty, and perhaps a bit sad.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.620
The passive aggressive partner has been clever enough to leave no traces of their manipulation.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.140
On the surface, it sounds like the partner has some options, but within the reality of the relationship,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.900
it's evident that they will simply have to do what they haven't even directly been asked to do.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.600
It sounds controlling and managerial.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.460
It might be a follow-on to a request to take out the bins, to count how many bottles of milk are left,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.220
and to remember to show up no later than 7:00.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.720
This kind of bossiness sounds as if there's no love left.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.640
But the desire to control procedurally is often a symptom of a fear of losing one's partner emotionally.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.560
One has to feel quite out of control to become controlling.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.660
The sternness is really a misguided plea for closeness.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.940
The real message has nothing to do with the table.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.000
What it means, in truth, is that one senses the partner's lack of trust and devotion,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.580
and is resorting to exercising practical control over their life

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.920
in order to achieve some kind of control over what one really wants to get a handle on: their emotions.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.600
One would stop if one felt more reassured of their love.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.360
Controlling behavior is a bid for affection delivered as a barking order.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.480
Most of the time, what people really mean in love is kinder, more tender, and more poignant

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.280
than what they manage to say.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.940
But there are also times when the surface is sweet and the reality, far darker.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.560
As Marcel Proust knew, "In love, it is often the one who loves less who makes the tender speeches."

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.980
The partner may be fooling us and themselves in a sentimental direction,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.080
exaggerating all its pure, good, and simple.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.120
When we translate their words, we should get fruitfully suspicious.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.280
Perhaps we've set the bar of being honest too high;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.720
we've created a situation where we are refusing to accept difficult news,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.280
and their ambivalent, complex emotions.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.060
Quite possibly, with a little more open-mindedness and sanfjua?,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.700
we could come to deal well enough with the darker parts of our partners.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.760
But for now, we're engaged in a dangerous collusion to keep our fears at bay,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.280
thereby allowing them a higher chance of becoming realities.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:42.800
In the ideal future, we will have, in our ears, little devices that will translate our lover's words into what they mean.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.580
We will hear, via our discreet, brushed, steel appliances,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.920
not what they overtly say, but what they are attempting to communicate.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.520
And ideally, they'd be wearing one, too,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.980
for the challenge of translation is, of course, always a mutual one.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.520
Until that time, though, we should always make the effort to decode the messages that we receive,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.000
accepting that it's a legitimate part of the effort of love--

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.720
to interpret, rather than just to listen to another person's words.
