[MUSIC]

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.432
SPEAKER 1:
Hello, I'm Tessa.

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:19.261
SPEAKER 2:
My hat falls off a hundred times!

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.805
SPEAKER 1: 
I think we did a good job.

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:29.287
Yeah? Yeah I think we nailed it,
for, like, dress rehearsals ...

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:30.968
as far as dress rehearsals go.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.294
ETHAN HEARD: So this production is 
the culimination  of a course

00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:42.990
that the whole cast
and some of the designers

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.478
have been taking together.

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:46.958
As you can imagine, Princeton 
students are very busy

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:52.814
so those four hours we're always together
and that time has been invaluable

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:54.943
for putting the show together.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.507
[SINGING] 
"Into the woods it’s time to go"

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:07.248
ETHAN HEARD: Sondheim's writing is very 
detailed and precise and beautiful and deep

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:10.559
You have people running on, grabbing
a prop, running out,

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:13.439
slamming a door ... and that's
been one of the really fun challenges

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.087
of putting it together.

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:20.592
One of the reasons that "Into the Woods"
is such a great show for Princeton

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:26.723
is that there's this breadth of 
18-plus fabulous characters

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:30.479
that are really juicy roles
for a lot of students.

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:33.790
One of the roles is the narrator, who
in the original Broadway production

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:37.903
was played by a 60-plus-year-old actor.

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:39.791
We wanted to reinvent the narrator.

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:42.583
So Kateryn, a freshman, is 
playing the narrator.

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:47.583
She’s embodying it as a kind 
of 14-year-old nerdy bookworm.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:55.169
KATERYN MCREYNOLDS: When the wedding with the prince 
was celebrated, Lucinda and Florinda attended.

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:58.752
ETHAN HEARD: We held our auditions in September 
and we had a fabulous turnout.

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:02.431
[SINGING] 
"There are giants in the sky"

00:02:02.704 --> 00:02:04.064
"There are big tall terrible"

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:08.177
"Awesome scary wonderful giants"

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.272
"In the sky!"

00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:16.993
ETHAN HEARD: We had a freshman 
gentleman who came in

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:21.375
and on his audition form, we asked if 
people are interested in particular roles,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.912
and he was the only person who wrote,
Milky White, the cow.

00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:28.929
At that point I wasn't sure if Milky White
was going to be played by an actor.

00:02:29.217 --> 00:02:32.240
In the original production, 
it was played by a puppet.

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:36.464
And he turned on some electronic
kind of pop music on his phone.

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:42.480
Rolled his shoulders back, and did
a really fabulous improvisational dance.

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:45.360
So he landed that role, no problem.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.400
SPEAKER 3: No less than five pounds.
SPEAKER 4: Moo!

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.185
ETHAN HEARD: The beautiful 
thing about this show is

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:59.616
it's delightful and comic and funny,
and then it asks the audience to consider

00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:03.617
really, the dark night of the soul.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.680
SPEAKER 5: "Maybe I shouldn't 
have stolen from the giant"

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.185
SPEAKER 1: "Maybe I shouldn't 
have strayed from the path"

00:03:09.872 --> 00:03:12.464
SPEAKER 6: "Maybe I shouldn't 
have attended the ball"

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:16.114
ETHAN HEARD: In the second act, 
you see three characters

00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:18.419
die, very quickly, back to back.

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:21.986
You see a group of refugees running
away to another kingdom.

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:24.786
You see natural disaster, you see 
earthquakes, you see

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.026
the forest being ripped apart.

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:34.315
And we get to see these young
college students confront that

00:03:34.932 --> 00:03:38.084
with us and for us, as our proxies.

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:43.251
[SINGING]
"Maybe we forgot"

00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:46.291
ETHAN HEARD: There are two professional 
designers working on the show.

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.907
Reid Thompson designed the set,

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:50.995
and Mio Guberinic designed costumes,

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:54.596
and they were able to come to campus
early on in our class

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.475
and share all their design work 
with the students, which I think

00:03:57.668 --> 00:04:01.107
really kicked off our process
in an exciting way.

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.811
We wanted to make a fresh production

00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:07.844
so our design really updates 
some of the clothing.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.205
Our design avoids trees.

00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:16.707
In the first act, we're in a more 
comfortable, fantastical, colorful place.

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:20.274
And in Act II, that's really stripped away.

00:04:20.532 --> 00:04:28.548
And we go from a theatrical world to a 
more raw, real, naked scary dark place.

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:30.116
We play with a lot of shadows

00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:34.452
and so we theatricalize a lot of the 
magical moments in either

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.731
rear shadow play or frontal.

00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:42.147
So we have a combination of roving lights
on the ground and flashlights

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.026
and all different kinds of cutouts.

00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:47.524
We even have a special effect in Act II.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.708
These big bookcases suddenly dump
hundreds of books. They tilt over

00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:57.187
and make a pretty horrifying sound.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:59.235
The first time we did that 
with the students

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:03.571
there was genuine fear
and adrenaline in the room.

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:10.643
And that was really gratifying to see
how the design was inspiring the actors

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:16.261
and really turning them on to the story
and the experience.

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:22.387
I mean, one of the giants in the field 
of Sondheim study is Stacy Wolf,

00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:26.196
who founded the music theater
certificate  here

00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:29.588
and this is really the kickoff 
production of that new program

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.779
so we thought it would be delicious

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:34.869
if Stacy would take on the role 
of the Giant herself

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.804
We had a fabulous recording session with
Stacy and Hillel, our sound designer

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:43.540
and she just is chewing the scenery. 
She's a fabulous actor.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.540
STACY WOLF: Where is the lad 
who killed my husband?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.540
SPEAKER 7: There is no lad here.
SPEAKER 8: We haven’t seen him.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.540
STACY WOLF: I want the lad who 
climbed the beanstalk.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.676
SPEAKER 9: We’ll get him for you 
right away. Don’t move!

00:05:56.676 --> 00:05:59.109
ETHAN HEARD: Theater, I was saying 
to the cast, is this miracle.

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:03.526
Someone's always bound to be sick,
or hurt, or on a late train.

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:08.020
When everyone is healthy and in the room
and doing the show

00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:09.860
I think that is a miracle.

00:06:10.116 --> 00:06:14.436
to have, you know, 30 collaborators
making a big musical like this happen.

00:06:17.124 --> 00:06:20.325
I think the beautiful thing about 
making theater and sharing theater

00:06:20.582 --> 00:06:23.109
is coming together in a room

00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:26.341
and breathing the same air
and listening to stories

00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:31.972
and reconnecting with 
our shared humanity.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.423
[SINGING] "Into the woods and out of the woods,
and happy ever after ... I wish!"

00:06:40.292 --> 00:07:00.406
"Into the Woods"
