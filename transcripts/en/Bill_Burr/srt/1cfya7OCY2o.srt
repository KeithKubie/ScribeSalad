1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,653
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,080
Hey, what's going on? Hey. Oh,

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,010

Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday.

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,200
Monday morning podcast.
And

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,060
Ahhh,

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,700
just checking in on you. Just
check. Oh, I'm eating my balls.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,530
Do do do do do do on a damn
stage pan, pan, pa pan.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,750
Oh whoa. Freckles is paying the
fucking price. He's paying the price.

10
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,750
Every comedian that has the
special coming up, you know,

11
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:38,260
in the next couple of weeks, whenever
the fuck they're putting it out. I,

12
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:42,660
I believe the rumor I heard a rumor.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,890
Bananarama oh yeah. When are they
going to get back together? Huh? Fuck.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,020
Every year that goes by,

15
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:54,290
everybody was talking about when's guns
and roses going to get back together

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,070
Wednesday axl and slash going.
But what about Banana Rama?

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,730
I heard a rumor they ever getting back
together for a summer fucking tour.

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,950
Um, I'm paying the price. Every God damn
all the comedians out there paid, uh,

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,190
who have a special coming out is that
you just go on stage and you have,

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,940
you know, you got nothing.
You got one little fucking,

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,080
you got one little pea shooter and then
you've got a slingshot and a fucking

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,620
whatever,
two months earlier you had a Howard sir,

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,350
have a fucking act and it's
the weirdest fucking thing.

24
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:32,440
Just imagine if a whatever,
if you're an athlete or something,

25
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:36,790
like every couple of years you had
to relearn that. All the mechanics,

26
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:40,090
but you just couldn't hit the jump
shot anymore. He had to fucking, yeah,

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,580
that that shot was in my repertoire.

28
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,060
Now I've got to relearn how to fucking
do this and but in a different way.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,820
I've got to do it and then I got to shoot
it with my left hand now because they

30
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:51,940
already saw me do it with my right hand.
And then the more you fucking do it,

31
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,550
the more hours you put
out. Right. Then you go.

32
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,320
When I got to bounce
it off my fucking head,

33
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,030
cause you know you can't keep
doing the same shit or everybody's,

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,080
I got more of this say do
that reminds me of this thing.

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,120
You Oh the guy with this person. Right.
You just got to fucking deal with that.

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:11,950
So last night, you know, and of course
they have to go on after Ian Edwards,

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,700
I a n Edwards.
It was like that guy.

38
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:19,390
All he has is a level fucking
material just up there murdering.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,210
And uh,
I went up there with my lip

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,400
[inaudible] basic fucking horse shit.
I was in a really fucking dark place.

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,140
It's funny to be in a dark place and then
like, you know, mentally just like, uh,

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,540
and then to be talking about the
shit that I was talking about and um,

43
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,200
yeah,

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,950
I dunno, but I got to plow through
this shit. Um, as far as like, uh,

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,000
I got to get past my anger and I'm telling
you this fucking exercise that I did

46
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,880
that I'm really starting
to think my shoulders.

47
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,580
How fuck do you put your shoulders up?
Remember that better? I used to do,

48
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:56,950
I think I was stuck in a defensive posture

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,180
like shell shot.
You know what I mean?

50
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,240
There's only so many times you can get
slapped in the back of the head by bigger

51
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,150
kids before you shoulders
are just naturally up.

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,420
Like you're already beginning to block
whatever's coming at your fucking head.

53
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,620
And I think I was kind of
stuck in that and um, you know,

54
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,870
I was talking to some people about
that and it was like, well, you know,

55
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:18,704
there's physical layer.
Yeah.

56
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,350
And then there's the emotional fucking
trauma of what's going on with your life.

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,150
And there's certain people
that think they're related.

58
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,530
I don't know if you guys are
into that hit me shit man.

59
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,390
But you look up this stuff,
you know,

60
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,430
this is like one of these things
when you go to look this up,

61
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,390
you completely leave the
medical profession in the
United States of America.

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Like you start like the doctors slowly
start wearing less and less shoes as you

63
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:49,030
start to go further east with your, your,
you're looking for medical solutions.

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,380
You know, if you're looking for a
medical solution in the United States of,

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,430
of the Americas,

66
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,110
it's going to be a guy in wingtip
shoes with fucking dark socks,

67
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,680
you know, fully clothed, be in
like, okay, yeah, you got a,

68
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:05,690
your rotator cuff is taped up though.

69
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,520
We need to go in and operate
and take the middle. Yeah.

70
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,920
Carl over the wall while
the fucking MCL and all,

71
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:13,490
they're going to give you this
straight fucking how the body works.

72
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,300
We've done an MRI. This is what the
fuck is going on with your body.

73
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,630
But then as you start to go,
you know,

74
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,320
you start to step away from that shit
that the pharmaceutical companies and all

75
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,400
that,
not saying it's all bad,

76
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,710
not saying it's all Ben was the
last time we had a plague. You know,

77
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,980
for as much as the pharmaceutical
companies allegedly
allegedly created a heroin

78
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:37,310
epidemic in this country by handing
out opiates like Flintstone vitamins to

79
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:40,690
fucking adults. Uh, you
know, there's also, you know,

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,880
because nobody's walking around with
scurvy, so that's something, right?

81
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,120
I guess no one really walked
around with scurvy bill.

82
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,100
He had to be on a fucking
boat, lost at sea, you know,

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,210
no wind in your sails and
iron maiden singing, right.
The car safely A. Dot. It is.

84
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,270
Hi. Um, so, uh, yeah,

85
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:03,560
but the further you go down that rabbit
hole, like, uh, the, the fucking,

86
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:07,700
the longer the hair gets,
then there's like, you know,
more loose fitting clothes,

87
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,350
then it becomes sandals.

88
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,630
And then just sort of the more he knew
me and even very your liking like this.

89
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:18,360
And then I get all fucking uncomfortable.
Um, I'll look up some stuff.

90
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,780
Let me hit pause here and I'm going to
look up some shit about like the memories.

91
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:25,400
Let me, let me see what this fucking
doctor looks like. Our perfect,

92
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,950
perfect fucking pervert.
So I looked up memories held in,

93
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,640
in the media that came up was in body.

94
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,420
So of course Wikipedia has something
that's just going to be like, you know,

95
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,240
the old right there, Fred. So the
first thing I scrolled down too,

96
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,880
that was not Wikipedia was tiny Buddha.
All right.

97
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,200
And I swear to God,

98
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,830
it says how to release the painful
memories and emotions stored in your body.

99
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,750
Uh, Jennifer Sterling, of course, now
they're going to let a woman do something,

100
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,730
right? They're not going to
let her in the wingtip world.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So the picture you see is some
Antonio Banderas looking guy with the,

102
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,820
uh, I call it the gay cut t
shirt. You know, you know,

103
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,780
you know the v Neck t shirt
that the fucking gay guys were,

104
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,720
cause they're all fucking in crazy shape.
You know what I mean?

105
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,490
It's not the dad bod cut.

106
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,270
It's the gay male fucking cut where they
have chess cleavage because they have

107
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,960
0% body fat.

108
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,820
So the guys dressed white on white
with the gay cut t and yoga pants,

109
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,460
no fucking shoes.
And he's on the beach,

110
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,430
not a hospitality found.
He looks like fucking a good look.

111
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,300
And Tom Hanks in cast away. If he didn't
give a fuck that he was cast away,

112
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,920
cast away.
Yeah.

113
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,310
And he didn't need to talk to a soccer
ball because he was so fucking centered

114
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,920
and he breathed his way through.
How the fuck did he become a castaway?

115
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,770
I can't even remember.

116
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,430
Yeah,

117
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,370
it must've been his ship sank. Right.
What was he flying with? Amelia Earhart.

118
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,220
I Dunno.

119
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,980
Was it one of those Tarantino movies
where he kind of fucks with history?

120
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,220
All right.
The cure for pain is in the pain,

121
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,360
says somebody named Rumi and
then it says free download,

122
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,080
Buddha desktop wallpaper.
That kind of kills it.

123
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:10,800
You know when you have a good Jesus
or Buddha or Muhammad like wallpaper,

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,940
you know what I mean? Kinda cheeses it
up a little bit now you think, okay,

125
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,550
it's all right. Let me read
it. My Best Yoga voice,

126
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,120
your body keeps a physical
memory of all your experiences.

127
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,590
You have lots of memories stored in your
brain that you can recount in any given

128
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:28,270
moment, even called names. Faces. Yeah,

129
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,010
get out of my fucking brain works what
you fucking sandwich smelled like.

130
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:36,480
But over time these memories fade or
change as time passes as and we mature.

131
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,560
However, even when the memory
begins to fade for you,

132
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,010
rank get to the fucking point.
It lives in your body,

133
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:44,040
in the form of a physical
sensation and behavior patterns.

134
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,590
The body doesn't forget. Now, Jesus,
what's your body from Hell's kitchen?

135
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
And that was for fucking 20 years
ago. You fucking pee shit, right?

136
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,200
Your brain's all forgiving
like, hey man, like, you know,

137
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,000
not gonna lie. I didn't enjoy it
when it happened, but you know, God,

138
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:06,710
I mean just the sunny day, just
go out and enjoy it. All right.

139
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,010
The events of our lives leave
physical imprints in our bodies,

140
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,410
especially when we experience
trauma. Can I? Okay.

141
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,620
Stress and all this shit that
caused the body to fight, flee,

142
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,150
or freeze in order to cope. This is what
I'm saying. I think I was all fucking,

143
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,770
I was in a a,
you know,

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,220
after you take a couple of fucking right
left to their head, you just Kinda,

145
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:30,990
you just walk around.
I just thought I,

146
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,860
you know, I have like
fucking 40 years ago,

147
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,630
whenever the fuck I was in high school,
40 years ago,

148
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,470
was I 18? No, that was 30
years ago. 30 years ago.

149
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:48,520
I was fucking 18 yeah,
I'm a,

150
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:52,690
you knew that phone was gonna
ring. Ah, what, who is this?

151
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,790
Who the hell is this? I, I
should've put it on pause.

152
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
Who is this?

153
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,130
Hello?
Hello.

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,480
Oh,
for fuck's sake.

155
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,650
Can you believe someone would
pocket down me during my podcast?

156
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,040
You know what's funny is I don't
even know who the fuck that was.

157
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,150
I have no idea who the fuck that was.
They have no idea who the fuck I am. I,

158
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,610
that's what's always fascinated
me about when you just fucking,

159
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:25,510
you just dial a wrong number.
I've said this before, right?

160
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:30,470
You dial a number and somebody says hello
and you're like, yeah, hey, is a is is,

161
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,790
is frank there? And they're
like, whoa. And you're like cry.

162
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,820
And they're like, oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,690
They're like,
I'm sorry you have the wrong number.

164
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,280
Now I get wrong numbers.
Everybody gets wrong numbers.

165
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,350
Here's my question to you.

166
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:54,310
Do you think you've ever
accidentally called somebody famous?

167
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,250
You know what I mean? Like
you just fucking, uh, I dunno.

168
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,310
You just dial the wrong number and like
Bill Clinton picked up or fuck it Obama,

169
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,050
we'll throw a Republican in there.
George Bush hang, she's Danny, right?

170
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,870
He fucking picks up and you get,

171
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:18,230
he has to go through the same shit as you
like is frank there? And he said, hey,

172
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,490
where did you say, I just know Brittany's
additional frank e f g. H I love it.

173
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,160
And then they read the fucking number t
like, you don't know what your number is.

174
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,170
Is this blob? No, it isn't.

175
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,760
That's why there is no frank here.
Um, anyways, let me continue on.

176
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,530
All right, well fuck all this shit. How
do I get it out of me? Cause my body,

177
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,680
it never forgets.
It's like fucking Niamh listen,

178
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,910
if you punch me in the
fucking in seventh grade, um,

179
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,480
wait a minute.

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,750
I love that they finally gave Jamie
Foxx the fucking Liam Neeson Merle.

181
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,170
He has a movie coming out where it's one
of those movies like you fuck with my

182
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:57,500
family. I'm going to fucking kill
you. It's about time. You know,

183
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,550
they ran out a young white guys to give
that to and then they just kept going

184
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,820
over and like, Liam Neeson me, let me
know that guys. Like, what is he like?

185
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,450
[inaudible] 83 then he play like
fucking Obi wan Kenobi or some shit.

186
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,060
Um, all right, the first tool
to put your emotional toolkit,

187
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,590
the first tool to put in your
emotional toolkit, and this is why,

188
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,710
this is why I've never been
able to get through this shit

189
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,080
because I was getting no,
because I'm fucked up.

190
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:33,081
But when I start to go down this road
of doctors who don't wear shoes like it

191
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,900
said, okay, the pictures that they have,
okay, this is how to set new year's goals.

192
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,110
You'll actually enjoy pursuing and it's
a stick figure sitting on a rainbow

193
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,480
staring up at the sun with a
big goofy smile on its face.

194
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,230
And uh, I don't know about you
guys, but where I came from,

195
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,600
that sort of happiness was not allowed.

196
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,690
You basically were not allowed to be
happy and it was shamed. Fuck off.

197
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,640
Oh No. Wait. Why am I letting that
react? I, why am I reacting to that?

198
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:13,420
I have the power. I could've, you know,
it's funny, right before he started this,

199
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:18,370
I was thinking I should go into the
settings and I should just turn it off.

200
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,370
And I didn't.
So I created this situation,

201
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,940
not a dead Steve Jobs.
Huh?

202
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,010
You know,

203
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,730
I guess I could get upset with Steve Jobs
with how fucking many times that thing

204
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,280
rings before it goes to voicemail.

205
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,120
But then I imagined that I could actually
go into settings and I could determine

206
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,870
that. I just don't have the patients.
All right. The first tool, okay guys,

207
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,780
your first tool to put in
your emotional toolkit.

208
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,110
This is the type of class I would go
to with Nia and she would just feel me

209
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,920
either starting to get mad or just
laughing at the thing as she being the

210
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:01,030
fucking angel that she is. An open
fucking channel would be like, okay,

211
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,750
what is the first emotional tool?
It's cause she's a woman.

212
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:08,530
She gets to fucking do that to be
like, oh my God, let's get some smores.

213
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,860
They get to be like that.
We're not, you know, no,

214
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,500
you don't have a fucking bottle opener.
You've gotta use your teeth. You know,

215
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,150
it's just,
it's stupid guy shit.

216
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,820
And then if you don't know how to fucking
do that thing where you bring your

217
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,070
beer up to the counter
and fucking slam it down,

218
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,570
you know you're somehow less of a man.
Um,

219
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,550
I like how I'm putting all of my issues
on you guys. All right. Let's say we go,

220
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:33,530
okay. The first tool to put in your
emotional toolbox, non judgment.

221
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,660
Ah, fuck. I mean, there goes
my standup career. I mean,

222
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,040
my entire fucking life is judging people.
All right?

223
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,780
When you feel emotionally triggered
and tempted to turn to food or other

224
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:48,650
addictive behaviors for comfort,
I'm not f well, maybe I am a drunk.

225
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,390
Try not to judge the reaction. Our
bodies are programmed to seek pleasure,

226
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,770
not discomfort.

227
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:59,090
So it's natural to try and find something
to sue the pain and make yourself feel

228
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:03,920
better. The need to suit yourself with
food. I'm not a fat fuck or other means,

229
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,710
doesn't make you a bad person.
It makes you human. Oh God.

230
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:13,060
This is just so gross.
The second tool per mission,

231
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,860
the third tool release, I can't even
read this, the fourth to forgiveness.

232
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,040
Finally time.
Oh my God,

233
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm going to the wrong website. Jennifer
sterling is an emotional eating coach.

234
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,090
Well, what the fuck is to say
I've met the wrong website.

235
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,980
She helps women to stop eating their
feelings and release the physical and

236
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,350
mental emotional weight that keeps
them from feeling the absolute best.

237
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,850
Download the cravings decoder
guide and uncover the hidden,

238
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,060
hidden emotional meeting behind
your food cravings. I don't know.

239
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,210
I don't want to be a
fucking negative person,

240
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,190
but doesn't that sound a fucking generic?

241
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,470
I was craving a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. Okay. What that means is this.

242
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,540
All right, where do you
store your emotions? Where
do you store your emotions?

243
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,250
All right. Now, this person has a phd,

244
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,380
so imagining that they're going
to be wearing more clothes,

245
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,910
they don't even have a picture.

246
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,190
It may surprise you that emotions are
not the sole product of your brain,

247
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,050
but our experience, my fees, Roger,

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,470
this isn't going to say the same shit as
the last website and these emotions can

249
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:22,850
be triggered through your body
work, meditation, breathing,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

250
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,450
Use one half. All right, well, you know,

251
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,330
evidently I'm never going to get scared
cause I can't get through this shit.

252
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,710
Well certainly not while doing
a fucking podcast. You Moron.

253
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,310
Why did you just call yourself
a more on there? Is that,

254
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,270
is that really what you thought or is
that what people told you when you were

255
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:41,631
younger?

256
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,540
That's the type of shit where you just
want to grab the person by their ankles

257
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,940
and drag them out of their chair
and they just walk out of the room.

258
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,490
You know me from that session.
Um,

259
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,060
Jesus Christ, I'm up against the dude. Is
this what it's like to become a parent?

260
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:59,360
You just suddenly become hyper aware
of how unqualified you are and what a

261
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,940
fucking moron you want to like someone's
going to be looking at me like I have

262
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:05,990
questions. Hey, I'm going to be talking
to my kid like, Hey, join the club.

263
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,900
You think any of this
shit makes sense to me?

264
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,940
At least you're a kid and
you can have the comfort of,

265
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:14,210
of of it's okay that you don't know
shit. Where did he get to be? My Age.

266
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:18,260
And you don't have an excuse, you
know, and it's that fucking, uh,

267
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,570
whenever the fuck is in the
Micheal Ray Richardson, Tyson,

268
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,070
Sicily to whatever this fucking name is
quiet leaf Tyson,

269
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,860
I forget what his name is, Ken.
Like fucking the, the, the,

270
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,690
the guy who looks like the cop on the
black cop on Barney Miller who fucking

271
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,530
knows about black holes in the universe
and is a fine wine connoisseur.

272
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,560
Um, you know, that's the kind of
person you need is a debt. That guy,

273
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,820
that guy's got fucking answers. You
know, I was reading a thing on him. Um,

274
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,880
I got it. I can never remember
this guy's fucking name.

275
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,740
Last name is Tyson to graph Tyson.

276
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,660
Tyson scientist. Tyson
sites. We'll go with that.

277
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,660
Is going to be this Mike Tyson's football,
Neil degrasse Tyson.

278
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,430
This is why he's the shit, because not
only is the unbelievably intelligent,

279
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:10,610
he knows that we came from trees or some
shit, whatever the fuck he was saying,

280
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,700
you know, thank God I don't do heavy
drugs. When I watched that guy show,

281
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,153
all right.

282
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,590
He also was talking about how he's into
wine and he was talking about how when

283
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,580
you, whatever you finish a bottle of wine,
you fill it up with water or you go to,

284
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,130
you know, and you're pouring it out.
It does that Glub Glub glub thing.

285
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,180
He was just going,
what'd you do?

286
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,910
Is You just turn the bottle
is you turn the bottle,

287
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,930
it causes a swirling effect and uh, uh,
basically because it's swirling down,

288
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:37,310
then there's that whole in the middle,
lets the air go in. So as, as the, uh,

289
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,850
liquids coming out in the
air can freely flow in

290
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,370
to take up the space that the liquid
once had. And it just flows right out.

291
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,530
Plus it looks,
it looks fucking cool as you do it.

292
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,130
So the next time you pour a big fucking
glass of wine for some real housewife,

293
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,100
you know,
gets,

294
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:59,610
you can't wait to hold her botox
face in your hands. You know,

295
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,060
you don't want to fuck it up by Glub glub
glub in it into a giant glass because

296
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,720
it might go all over a fucking dress
that she's going to wear once, you know,

297
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,060
hey look, you know that, that's what
I get out of Neil degrasse Tyson.

298
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,830
I watched that show and I'm
like, God damn it. You know,

299
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,570
as much as this guy just told me

300
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,210
where we came from in the
universe millions of years
ago or whatever, thousands,

301
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:23,490
I don't know, you know, go back
to Jesus. That was only what,

302
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,870
a couple thousand years ago. Um, as
much as he's teaching me about that,

303
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,650
he's also on the side showing
me how to bang a real housewife.

304
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,400
Um, anyways, so I've continued to uh,

305
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,330
get rid of shit and
I'm still in my office.

306
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,820
That's how much shit I had had two
closets and everything in my room and I've

307
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:47,654
fucking,

308
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,300
I've gotten rid of everything and I might
even do another pass cause I have to

309
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:55,020
tell you, I fucking walk in
there now and I'm relaxed.

310
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,920
I had no idea that when you walk in and
there's a ton of shit that the level of

311
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:05,370
stress that was bringing me, I'm fucking
relaxed. And like there's my drum kit,

312
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,720
there's my guitar, there's
where I keep my pens, you know,

313
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,710
get it out of here. Anything that's
coming in the house, get it the fuck out.

314
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,820
And so then yesterday, of
course, you know, you know,
women are, you know, you know,

315
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:21,000
you know, they are, I mean, if,
if they're not fucking, you know,

316
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,610
watching the real housewives show, if
they're not eating something that they're,

317
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,630
they're on Amazon buying something.
They just, they, they, they,

318
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,930
they fucking consume
shit. So, um, you know,

319
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,160
and spend the holidays. So we've had a
bunch of boxes, people sending US stuff,

320
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:37,920
we're sending them shit in it by my front
door every day there's these fucking

321
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:41,950
boxes. Okay. So what I always do is
I take our fucking address off it,

322
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,430
I put it through the papers,
right?

323
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,990
Then I cut the boxes up and then I take
them over to this fucking place that, uh,

324
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:51,900
you know, one of those mailboxes separate
places, you know. And I say, Hey,

325
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,420
go is some free fucking boxes.
They take it now.

326
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:56,100
I don't know if they throw
it out like goodwill,

327
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:58,770
but I feel like I made the fucking effort,
you know,

328
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,460
but I can't fucking keep the goddamn door
clean and I cut up like fucking 20 of

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,490
these goddamn boxes, you know? Did
you went to have a fucking baby?

330
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,080
Everybody's sends your shit. Everybody
sending you shed socks, shoes, swings,

331
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,600
follow this shit.
And it's just like,

332
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,000
I just love the amount of socks
that they send you. It's like,

333
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:22,110
it's not gonna be able to walk for like
the first fucking, I dunno, six months.

334
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,240
What does it need socks for?

335
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,150
We didn't get me a hang glider.

336
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,580
I mean just that doesn't
even make any fucking sense.

337
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,490
I know you get the baby's
got to keep his feet warm,

338
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:38,340
but does it have to have one pair
of socks for every fucking day,

339
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,340
but six month life, you
know, and then what?

340
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,070
You've got all these little socks,

341
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,060
it's going to grow out of them and like
fucking tits out used to see what level

342
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,330
of a con would you have to be to
look at the cutest thing ever.

343
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:56,530
A little baby socks and it still
makes ship set. See what I'm saying?

344
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,790
Oh, tell your freckles. Need some help
here. Um, all right, let's get to, uh,

345
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,250
some of the, uh, let's get to some of the
announcements. Oh, by the way, everybody,

346
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:10,360
I keep forgetting to promote this,
uh, the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit,

347
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,690
the fifth annual,
uh,

348
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,010
Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.
I still have a nice photo on the wall.

349
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,660
Somebody did have this
great painting of him,

350
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,860
the perfect size and all that that I will
never get rid of. Now, having said that,

351
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:28,060
I don't need anymore. Um, all right.
Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

352
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:32,180
This is the fifth annual one at the
New York City Center. All right,

353
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:36,740
we're going to post the link and all
of that. There's a, it's a 2000 seater.

354
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,090
We've got a couple of
hundred seats left and, um,

355
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,060
it's a great way to
start your year. And, um,

356
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,560
it's one of my favorite shows of the year.
Um,

357
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,990
just getting to see all of the,
uh,

358
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,130
just all my friends and now it's becoming
like newer guys that were influenced

359
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:56,620
by Patrice and then they come
and they talk about, you know,

360
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,950
the amazing comic that he was. And, uh,

361
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,590
I got to tell you that will never not be
in the back of my head cause I love the

362
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:06,790
guy to death. But it's also like
whenever someone will come up to me and,

363
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,120
and give me a high compliment,
you know,

364
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,590
as far as where I am in the comedy
world right now as a standup comedian,

365
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,850
I always think that's,

366
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,050
cause Patrice is in here right now and
Mitch Hedberg and Geraldo and all these

367
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:22,390
other monsters that we lost.

368
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,760
So this is an incredible
benefit. And it, uh, you know,

369
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,920
through the money that we've raised,

370
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,490
his mother's been able to get a
condominium and she's living great.

371
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,200
She doesn't have to worry about
anything, you know, you know,

372
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,470
the only thing, you know, and that's, um,

373
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:44,471
a really a belief of mine
that when somebody passes
and their family members or

374
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,990
you know, the only thing they should
have to deal with his degree from it,

375
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,060
which unfortunately you
never totally get passed,

376
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:51,430
but they shouldn't also have to
deal with all this other stuff,

377
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:54,730
which is why we continued to do the
benefit because I always hated when I was

378
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:55,564
coming up,

379
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,980
when there was an unexpected death and
the person had a family and all of that

380
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:04,030
type of shit. You know, it's like you
do one benefit and it's like, okay,

381
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,630
here's your bag, a loot, you know,

382
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,340
try to make this last for the next
20, 30, 40, 50 fucking years. Um,

383
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,550
I dunno.
So that's why we continue to do it.

384
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:20,320
Plus it keeps the memory of him alive
and all of his comedy out there.

385
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,270
Uh, that is the hope. Anyways. Okay,
so now I want to, the advertising,

386
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,110
the Black Tux. Dotcom. All right.

387
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:34,111
Looking great for a wedding or a special
event has never been easier with black

388
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,530

with high quality rental
suits and Tuxedos.

390
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:42,820
Why is this itchy
delivered to your doorstep?

391
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,610
The Black Tux is giving guys a
new way to rent and get this.

392
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,500
The black Tux offers free home.

393
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,690
Try On's try ons so you can see the fit

394
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:57,230

companies. Man, this is like,

395
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,300
you're not going to have to
leave your house anymore.

396
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,820
You can get food sent to your house.
Wine, Cindy, a house and a fucking Tuxedo.

397
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,530

[inaudible] right there.
This is the list is the final.

400
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,380
This is a final piece of the puzzle.

401
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,000
Like you putting together
a championship team,

402
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:19,900
all you were missing
was to fucking Tuxedos.

403
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,820
You go to blue apron and
get your fucking food right?

404
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,420
You go to fucking loot crate to get
your t shirt that you're going to wear

405
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:30,620
underneath all the bullshit. You go to
a fucking something at me undies, right?

Tux. How do you, how do you do this?

408
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,960
It's the best part is just done
completely online. No trips to the Tuxedo.

409
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,250
Tuxedo shop required. The Black
Tux. Dot. All that's the worst.

410
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,360
When you go to the Tuxedo shop,

411
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,050
there's always that guy who's been
there for like forever and he's got that

412
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,940
fucking tape measure
around his fucking neck.

413
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,070
Whatever the fuck you call that thing,
you know the,

414
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,280
you know those people don't clean their
ears to the point that everything just

415
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,360
turns black in there.

416
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,860
It looks like somebody lit a firecracker
off and both their fucking ears, sorry.

417

The Black tux.com lets you create your

It was disgusting.

536
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:17,350
It wasn't socially redeemable and I don't
think anybody became a better person

537
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,450
listening to it. Um, all right,

so is that the podcast?
That is the podcast.

539
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,230
Um,
now when I get off the podcast,

540
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:29,680
I'm going to go look at these
barefoot doctors. You know,

541
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,640
I can't fucking believe
they, that, you know, the
misrepresented that fucking site.

542
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:37,480
You know, they have some guy sitting
there, right, with the gay cut tee shirt.

543
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,010
And I'm sitting there thinking like,
all right,

544
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,680
this is going to be for angry Fuckos like
me. And it's for a bunch of women who,

545
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,740
uh, every time, uh, their
boyfriend says, hey, you know,

546
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,870
I don't feel like getting a going and see
that movie tonight. I'd rather stay in.

547
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,460
They go, oh they go in, they eat a
fucking death by chocolate fucking thing.

548
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,110
I don't know. I don't even want to
complain about anymore. I really don't.

549
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,860
I'm just freaking out cause
they got a kid come in.

550
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,350
I would just like the kid to show up
already so I can get on with that part of

551
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,870
my life. I suppose this is what,
this is literally what it's like.

552
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:13,871
Sometimes this reminds me obviously too
much emotionally heightened state than

553
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:15,471
this,

554
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:20,471
but I always remember when I would be
standing on the side of the stage and it

555
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,970
was just a fucking brutal crowd and I
knew that they were going to scream and

556
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:30,080
yell the entire fucking show and it
was just going to be 45 minutes of pure

557
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:34,880
fucking hell. I always remember just
the worst part was not going out there.

558
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,750
It was waiting the second I got out there,

559
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:42,260
I didn't give a shit because it's
just like every second I'm out here

560
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,540
is one less is I'm a second
closer to this fucking being over.

561
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,800
It's like doing cardio,

562
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,070
getting on the fucking thing and doing
it is not a fucking problem. It's,

563
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,410
it's the stretching beforehand,
you know,

564
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,160
putting on the workout clothes,
dragging your ass over to the machine.

565
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,160
The second you get on the thing,
I'm in literally 30 seconds into it.

566
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,250
You'll listen to your tone.
Do you have a good fucking time?

567
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,660
Everything is fucking great. It's, it's
the getting, it's the getting there,

568
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,650
at least for me. And you know what?
I think that that's, you know,

569
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,580
it's something that we can all relate to,
is it, I don't fucking know. Anyways, uh,

570
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,890
I start to watch the Celtics
last night against Utah. Uh,

571
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,530
I got to watch that one cause I think
the Bruins had planned today and, uh,

572
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,401
I'm trying to do this.

573
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm going to watch every Bruins and
every Celtic game that I possibly can.

574
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,210
It's fun.

575
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,490
I've got to tell you something I never
realized because I haven't watched it so

576
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:38,780
long.
When you watch NBA hoop,

577
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:41,600
it's so easy to start to get to know
your team because they've got a starting

578
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:45,650
five, you know what I mean? Patriot's.

579
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,560
You got 11 guys on our offense,
11 guys on defense.

580
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,530
Basketball has five
five starters that play.

581
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,610
They start both ways.

582
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,040
Offense and defense run down the fucking
coordinating on defense. You know,

583
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,020
I guess the Bruins just to have a
starting line and then they're starting to

584
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,800
defense when that's five and then
they got a goalie. But thing about,

585
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,511
well how many,
you know,

586
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,280
I don't know how many fucking
players are in a hockey team.

587
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,940
How fucked up is that? All these years
of watch and I don't like football.

588
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,850
There's like 41 42 people you know

589
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,930
of which if you know like 10 of them,
you kind of know your fucking team.

590
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,550
What do you guys think? I'm going to say
there's like 25 guys. Well, let's see,

591
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:27,200
there's four fucking lines. Four
lines, three guys in a line.

592
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:32,180
That's 12 you got two goaltenders
that's 14 and then you've got like what?

593
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:36,920
Eight defensemen? Something
like that. Six to eight. Yeah.

594
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm going to say about 25 and then you've
got like the guys who don't get in the

595
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:43,080
game, you know with the, with the WHO's
hockey stuff doesn't smell it off.

596
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,540
At least their, their practice
stuff probably smells. I'm sure.

597
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,200
How many players on a hockey team,

598
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,460
I'm gonna say 25
under the NHL rules,

599
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,090
each team is allowed to have up to 18
players with additional two goalkeepers

600
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:03,150
for a total of 20. That's
it. Well, there's really no,

601
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:07,800
excuse me not knowing it's only 20
players, right. That's when you're on a,

602
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:12,801
on a crazy level of a sports fan is if
you can name all fucking 20 players on

603
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,950
your hockey team and all what
11 guys on the basketball team.

604
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,330
Just for the simple fact that they fucking
overlap, I would say. And by the way,

605
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:21,800
my,

606
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,190
my wife taped these sports jeopardy's
that were posted by Dan Patrick by judging

607
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:30,360
by some of the questions. It was a
little dated, but uh, I was like,

608
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,130
finally a jeopardy.
I'm going to do well on it.

609
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:36,510
And I still got my fucking ass kicked
because it was, it was fucking hard shit.

610
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,530
Like who is he? Oh, like
they had like, uh, uh,

611
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,160
bankrupt teams teams that went
bankrupt yet it know the owner's name.

612
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,020
If you know the owner's name,

613
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:48,870
it's like you're watching fucking
sports talk radio and all of that.

614
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,880
Shaking me a fucking break. Wait,
what? What's wrong with you? Yeah.

615
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,750
I'll tell you why. No, our specialty
fucking coach, you get to that level.

616
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,870
You know what? I'm just babbling here.
I don't have fucking time to do this.

617
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,720
All I was doing was checking in on you
and that, that's, that's the podcast.

618
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:07,370
Have a great weekend yet conch and
um, no, no, no, no. Why am I, why?

619
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,270
You know what? Why do I say that?
You know why I fucking say that?

620
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,620
Because I'm defensive. I actually
said something nice to you about. Ah,

621
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,700
what are you a fucking shot right
then my shoulders started coming up.

622
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,080
I hope you guys have a wonderful
rest of your week. I can't do this.

623
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,270
I can't fucking do with have a great
weekend. You fucking cunts. All right.

624
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,890
Can I see that in the most
loving way possible? All right.

625
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:35,330
Did that make you uncomfortable? Good.
Welcome to my fucking world and a here.

626
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:40,130
Let's do a little bit of music and
then afterwards we'll play some, uh,

627
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,190
some clips from a
podcasts gone by Thursday.

628
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,370
Then those one a fucking have maybe
on Monday. Who knows? All right.

629
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,140
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you on Monday.

630
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,723
[inaudible]

631
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,760
Hey, what's going on? A Bill Barr
and this is the money, the morning

632
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,850
podcast, the first one for 2009. So
I want to take some time to wait.

633
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,460
Sorry. I tried to, I tried
to, I tried to come out nice.

634
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,980
I tried to start it by being, I can't
do it. I just can't say something nice.

635
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:03,780
Why can't I just start my podcast and be
like, hey, happy new year everybody. Hi.

636
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:07,850
Hope you had a nice Christmas. You
know, even though I feel that I,

637
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:11,580
I can't get myself to say it,
I have to mock it.

638
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,500
I have to say happy new year in a silly
voice. You know, I can't just be like,

639
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:20,310
hey, happy and a happy new. I
can't even do it. Happy New Year,

640
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,660
you know,
that doesn't sound happy or sad or angry.

641
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,430
It just sounds like I'm
reading it off the cue card.

642
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,110
We tried to give it the
feeling it deserves. Hey,

643
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,200
let me try again. Uh Oh, I got a
phone call. Hang on one second.

644
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:45,300
Hang on. Whoa. Hang on one
second. Hello. Hey Dan.

645
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:49,680
What's going on man? Uh, uh, I'm actually,

646
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:54,240
I'm finishing up a podcast. Can I, can I
call you right back and like a beautiful,

647
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,010
I do buy. Yeah. Okay. That's
the fucking text, man.

648
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,820
God Damn Tax Man. It'd
be fucking you. I think.

649
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,380
Hey actually got ahead a little bit.

650
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:06,360
And then what do they do to
come out and they just fucking,

651
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,670
I make the perfect amount of fucking money
in this country. You know what I mean?

652
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,200
I'm not rich enough to fucking afford
somebody to tell the IRS to go fuck

653
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:20,620
themselves and I'm not broke, so I'm,

654
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,610
I'm the fucking, you know what I am and
when he wants you to discovery channel,

655
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:27,600
you know that, that fucking a
gazelle that's walking with a limp.

656
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:30,360
That's what I am.
The fucking lines,

657
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,630
their ears perk up and they try to
separate me from the fucking heard.

658
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,880
That's who I am. When the tax man comes
around from God damn fucking assholes.

659
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,970
All right, sorry. You know, potholes
all up and down my fucking street.

660
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:45,804
You know what I mean?

661
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,470
Why don't I pay you when I just go
down a fucking home depot and buy some

662
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,820
Goddamn tarn I'll fall. Can you buy
car at home depot? I'm sure you can,

663
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:57,180
but God knows there's nobody
there to help you find it. Huh?

664
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,490
50,000 fucking square foot store with
200 foot ceilings and they got like three

665
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:06,010
people with aprons walking around.
You ask them any question.

666
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:09,150
They don't know where the fuck
having a planning section.

667
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:13,520
I fucking bitch shut up to
go hang yourself with your
rate. But no, I don't need,

668
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,670
you're not, you're not the problem. You're
not the problem. You're the poor worker.

669
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:20,160
Sorry about that. Do you
know what they actually did?
They got those automated, uh,

670
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,190
they got those automated cashiers out
here at the grocery store and you know,

671
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,200
I get out and there's a whole
bunch of people just lining up,

672
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,890
lining up out the cooperations fire.
Other Americans,

673
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,140
I swear to God,

674
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,140
if you're one of my podcasts members
and you go to the grocery store and you,

675
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,370
you stand in that automated line,

676
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,980
I want you to delete yourself
as one of my friends. Okay?

677
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,250
I have a zero fucking
tolerance for that shit.

678
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,110
It's unbelievable how stupid people are
and I love how they have like the one

679
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,610
employee where his job is literally
to stand there and teach you how to

680
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:01,280
basically do his job so
that they can then fire you.

681
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,860
And I know what the corporation
is going to do. They have it.

682
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,450
It's going to help cut costs on
food. Really. You got eight people,

683
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,440
they're making $8 an hour.
That's 64 bucks an hour.

684
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,720
You got a thousand people in
here buying cornflakes. What do,

685
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:19,460
what do I save half a cent on my
fruity pebbles? You fucking cunts.

686
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,030
That was the first count
of 2009 right there.

687
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,250
People stand in line,

688
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,750
help keep a fellow American
at work. Huh? Blah blah blah,

689
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:34,490
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. Dude, I'm not even joking.

690
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,650
Don't do that.
Don't do that shit.

691
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:40,490
These fucking parking structures
with their pay stations.

692
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,410
Now I have to be the parking attendant.
I don't work here. I got it for free.

693
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,100
I got to do this for fucking free and
put another guy out of work who now is

694
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:52,580
walking around trying to fight to find
a job for all I know he's gonna start

695
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:57,020
writing jokes. You know,
don't do that shit.

696
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,610
Don't, don't. Okay. You know me?

697
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,910
Yes. You don't know me. You think you know
me cause you listen to me every Monday,

698
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:07,340
but I'm telling something about myself.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

699
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:11,900
This is the one time where I'm going
to get up on my goddamn soapbox, okay?

700
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,320
Which is really difficult for me because
I got a big head and my equilibrium

701
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:19,100
starts to fuck with me when I stand up
on soapboxes, which is why I know preach,

702
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:23,660
but I'm going to preach on this one. Do
not do that. Go to the grocery store.

703
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,060
Stand in line.
Okay.

704
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,770
Let that mother of three keep her job.
Okay.

705
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:34,280
Or that that fucking convicted drunk
driver was trying to put his life back

706
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:38,030
together again.
Let them keep their jobs.

707
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,160
Do not stand and learn how to do.

708
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,410
You're going to do their job for
fucking free and it's not quicker.

709
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,500
And in the future you're going to
actually have to fucking stand there.

710
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,630
And you know what happens when you need
to price check on a fucking cantaloupe?

711
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,580
You have to go do it.
I don't,

712
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,570
I just fucking blows my mind.
We're already pumping our
guests around gas people.

713
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,280
When's it gonna stop? Huh?
Okay. I had a hell of a week.

714
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,290
All right. Actually, you know what?

715
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:12,770
I want to know how you guys feel about
that stuff. I am. I am. I, you know,

716
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:17,060
do you feel like I have a really good
point there because I feel I do all my,

717
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,730
you know,
if I was living in the 18 hundreds,

718
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:23,930
would I be the guy going stop churning
butter? No. Keep churning butter.

719
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,930
Don't let them do this for no,

720
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:30,710
but that's not even a fair example
because it's not like there was,

721
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,230
maybe there was a bunch of butter chairs.
If they could tell him,

722
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,770
I'll come up with automated buttered
butter churning. You know what?

723
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:40,440
I really paid my painting myself into
a corner with that, that reference.

724
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,330
I really had nothing there.
All right.

725
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,680
But I still think I made a
good point there. All right,
let's talk about my week.

726
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:49,680
I had a fucking insane week and,
um,

727
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,230
I went to the rose bowl with
a fellow comedian and uh,

728
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,140
I'm not gonna name his name. Usually I'll
do that. Maybe give somebody, you know,

729
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,160
bump up their friends or that type of
stuff, which I'd love to do for this guy,

730
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:06,660
but my behavior was so,
uh,

731
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,420
colorful. That's the word I'll
use that you know, just in case,

732
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,250
you know what I mean? I'm old
school. I don't name names.

733
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:18,060
When I start talking about a semi crimes
that I committed, not really committing,

734
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,430
well I guess being drunk
in public is a crime bill.

735
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,880
Why don't you shut the fuck up and get to
the story and we'll, I'll be the judge.

736
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:28,560
Fine. Fine. Okay. You guys with all
the tension beginning of 2009 you know,

737
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,070
you guys be more relaxed this year.

738
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,600
You know things going to be
fad in 2000 and maven link.

739
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,750
They gotta rhyme, you know, just
make it rhyme and then, then, then,

740
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,520
then I'm supposed to feel good.
You know,

741
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,430
and I'm not supposed to notice that last
year it was things that are going to be

742
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:48,930
great in 2008 and now you've knocked it
down. Now it's things that would be fine.

743
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,200
Thanks. It'd be great, man.
They going to be fine. No,

744
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,480
don't freak out in 2010. Oh, did they
combine this with Canada in 2011?

745
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,360
Why am I fucking checking myself out at
a grocery store and I'm not getting paid

746
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:10,620
for it? Okay. So my name is,

747
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:14,520
I go to the rose bowl with a comedian.
We're just going to call him Joe.

748
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,790
All right.
Cause that's the classic alias name.

749
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,970
When you don't want to get somebody
in trouble, you just call him Joe.

750
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,570
But the ironic thing is this
guy's name is actually Joe.

751
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,721
So me and Joe,

752
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:30,930
we go to the a fellow comedian and you
can try to figure out who the fuck he is

753
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,540
and it's not fiscal. Um, we
go to the Rose Bowl and uh,

754
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,030
we had great intentions. Okay. Let
me paint a picture for you. Okay.

755
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,170
When you go to the rose bowl,

756
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,680
it's one of the great
tailgating experiences you'll
ever have. First of all,

757
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,110
you go into the Rose Bowl,
okay?

758
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:50,460
The granddaddy of them all home have
a bunch of Superbowls Superbowls with

759
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:52,200
polluted that, that bowl, uh,

760
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,060
if you see that famous Lynn Swann catch
that wasn't made there actually realized

761
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:58,800
that was made at Temple University,
wasn't it?

762
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,800
I don't fucking know
that there's been a on,

763
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,890
I know that Jackie Slater one where
he dropped the ball. That's right.

764
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,540
That that cowboys Steelers won
the greatest fucking, I dunno,

765
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:14,160
clash of two powerhouse
teams I ever saw was the uh,

766
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:14,870
I dunno,

767
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,010
whatever they played once you're fucking
things there and I don't have the

768
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:19,620
information in front of me and I'm
really killing the momentum of the story.

769
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,210
So anyway, so you go there, right?

770
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,260
And you get right behind the Rosebowl
is what I'm assuming is an 18 hole golf

771
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,604
course.

772
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,110
Cause God knows that's how big it felt
at the end of the game when I was two

773
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:37,570
shit faced and we couldn't find
the car and we walked before.

774
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,960
But that, that I'm getting ahead of
myself. You know what I'm foreshadowing,

775
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,940
I'm doing what all great movies.
Do you know what I mean?

776
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,060
You go see a movie whenever they
show movie about a guy who dies,

777
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,740
everybody knows he's going to die.

778
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,160
So they show them diet in the beginning
and then the next scene is they go back

779
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:56,260
to his childhood.
You know what I mean?

780
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,340
Except they never do that with the Elvis
movie because then they'd have to start

781
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:04,660
the movie with some fat, Fuck Diane on
the toilet and no one wants to do that.

782
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,930
I'll just
[inaudible] is that my pancreas?

783
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,710
PLOP. Um, anyways,

784
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,060
so Jesus Christ, let's get some
momentum here. So we fucking,

785
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,230
we go to this tailgate. All right.
And this is the deal. Basically,

786
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:27,100
there's just two of us and amongst us,
we have four hamburger patties,

787
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,750
two bags of chips, hamburger
buns, 12 pack of Bud Light,

788
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,510
12 pack of Budweiser,

789
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,200
and a Clint Eastwood canteen,

790
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,930
size of fucking crown royal,

791
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,670
and to Cuban cigars that I
snuck back from fucking Canada.

792
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,130
So we're ready to go. I got my
sunblock, we loaded up into the Prius,

793
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,730
which is, uh, which was just fucking
hilarious. You know, everybody,

794
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,240
everybody tries to outman people
at the, uh, at the tailgates,

795
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,000
people cone up there with, they
have their fucking, you know,

796
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:06,260
for two or pickups with the lift
kits, you know, their generators,

797
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,140
sky to fucking satellite dish
in a flat screen TV. You know,

798
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,960
I came there with a little Hibachi,
but whatever.

799
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,200
We had the big thing of crown royal,
so people and Cuban cigars.

800
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:19,840
So no one fucked with us, right?
So we're having a great time.

801
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,280
All of a sudden this lady comes
walking by and she's like, Hey,

802
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:27,100
do you want to buy a little ticket
holder fee? A ticket? I'm like,

803
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:31,360
absolutely sweetheart, 10 bucks a
whack. Let me get, let me get that.

804
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:34,420
Two Times they had baby, you know,
you got a cigar in your mouth,

805
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:35,620
you start getting a little swagger.

806
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:38,200
Some reason when he likes
starts rocking back and forth.

807
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:40,630
Like you've got to sing it like
you're going to sing an Elvis song.

808
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,860
I was feeling it and the great thing was
I didn't give a fuck about either team

809
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,240
USC or Penn State. I was just happy
to fucking be there, you know?

810
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,770
But I quickly realized most
people were for the Trojans.

811
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:56,800
So automatically I'm a cunt.
Second concert of the year,
I'm like, you know what,

812
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,610
I'm going to root for the,

813
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,390
I'm going root for Penn state because
this gives me way more chance to annoy

814
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:05,230
people. Plus, I, I've
never liked USC and uh,

815
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,730
most of it has to do back in the day.

816
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:11,731
I used to be a Notre Dame fan before
Lou Holtz with their holy or holier than

817
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:15,670
thou. We don't do steroids. Shut
the fuck up. Yes you do. All right.

818
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,920
I had acne when I was fucking a teenager.
Right. But it wasn't all over my back.

819
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,220
And I also couldn't pick up a
house. Okay. So you fucking,

820
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,740
people are doing steroids anyways.
And also,

821
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:31,460
I always hated the Trojans fight song.
They played every three seconds. Bad, bad,

822
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,040
bad, bad, bad. You know,
they came like half a yard.

823
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,480
And it also reminds me of Fleetwood Mac,
who I never liked. So fuck the Trojans.

824
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,260
Right? So anyway, so we're sitting
there, we're drinking, we're partying,

825
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,860
would equally eating burgers and a,

826
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,390
then we break up the crown royal after
we had polished off a good half a case

827
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:48,320
between the two of us.

828
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:52,760
It's probably nine 30 in the morning
and we just started pounding this crown

829
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,400
royal,
which is going down like fucking Koolaid.

830
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,840
I was really impressed with my ability
or at least the the makers of crown royal

831
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:03,350
that is some smooth shit. So, uh,

832
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:08,351
so basically we start walking towards
the stadium and the alcohol is flowing

833
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:12,950
through me and that's when
I go into my transformation.

834
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,950
I don't know what happens
to me at sporting events,

835
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:19,280
but instantly I just become the loud guy.
I feel like I'm,

836
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:20,480
I'm doing a comedy show.

837
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:25,040
I want to make the people around me
laugh and I also want to irritate as many

838
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,360
fucking people as I can.

839
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,600
So I start walking in there
and I quickly notice, um,

840
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,580
all I know I went to go buy a program.

841
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,510
I'm trying to put this all back
together cause I was pretty drunk. I go,

842
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,510
just to give you an idea of,
of the mood that I was in,

843
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,540
I get to about a hundred
yards from the stadium.

844
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,730
This lady's selling
programs and she's like, Oh,

845
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,830
I get you program can come on and get the
bar graphs and like, I fuck it. I want,

846
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:55,070
I want a souvenir. So I walk up and like,
how much are they? She's like, 10 bucks.

847
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:56,540
My God,
I find,

848
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:59,480
so this other guy comes walking up
because how much for the programs?

849
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:04,780
And The lady's like 10 bucks, right?
And the guy starts bitching Ted,

850
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,560
my kid be right. So I'm standing there,
I got a Cuban cigar. I go, you know what?

851
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,370
Let me get another one, two times.
Let me get two of those. All right,

852
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:16,850
one for you over there. And the
guy's like, really? I go, Hey,

853
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,640
I go take a look at me. They
go, you know, you're looking at,

854
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:22,310
you're looking at a big shot.
Take a good look. There's not a,

855
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:26,270
there's not a lot of us left. I swear
to God, I said that and I was so drunk.

856
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:31,250
I was only half joking.
Like,

857
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,810
I knew I was being an asshole,

858
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,340
but like I was only half had fucking
Cuban cigar. Go Fuck Yourself.

859
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,520
I'm a big shot. Let's get a
program for this fag over here.

860
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,840
Who's bitching about 10 PUCO still
Rosebowl in bitches about a $10 fucking

861
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:46,370
program.
You know what I mean?

862
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,180
He should have been de pants and he should
have his tickets removed right there

863
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,940
and sent right back to wherever
the fuck he, Kiki came from,

864
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,640
send to an Applebee's, watched
the game there. All right.

865
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:01,850
Kind of fucking behaviors. That is
the granddaddy of them all. Thank you.

866
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:05,950
Fucking money out and play the
Goddamn game. All right. So anyways,

867
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:09,710
so I'm hammered, right? And we're
fucking, we're walking and uh,

868
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,860
I don't know what happened. We got
into the stadium, everything was cool.

869
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:16,700
And then they have this weird
sort of like, they funnel you in,

870
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,600
cause it's a really old
stadium. It's like, you know,

871
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:23,060
it's like trying to go through the
Lincoln tunnel like five o'clock at night.

872
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:24,860
It's a pain in the ass.
So I'm standing there,

873
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:27,420
I'm getting frustrated because
it's getting close to kick off.

874
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:29,790
And I hate missing kickoff.
So I'm getting pissed.

875
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:33,780
And I noticed that the Penn state fans,
they got this chant where one of them,

876
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,850
I don't know where it just yells,
we are.

877
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,440
And then all the Penn state fans go Penn
state. And then the dude yells again,

878
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:44,430
we are. And they all go Penn state
and they say it like five times.

879
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,760
And then the end, the guy who
starts the chant goes thank you.

880
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,800
And then everybody screams,
yo welcome.

881
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,310
And I immediately noticed that it annoyed
the shit out of all these UFC fence.

882
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,061
You know,

883
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,490
cause they kind of felt like it was a
home game cause they were out there.

884
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:03,330
So next thing you know, I even
think it, next thing you know,

885
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:07,840
coming out of my mouth, I'm
going, we are, I'm not even,

886
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:10,870
I'm a from Penn state, I don't know shit.
Right. But I just still going, we god,

887
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,450
let's go with Penn State Penn state.

888
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:18,810
And I'm like Dang you. And they're
like, Yo, welcome. I'm like,

889
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:19,920
this is fucking awesome.

890
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,320
I can do this the whole game and annoy
the shit out of people around me. So

891
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:31,830
like it took us 20 minutes,
20 minutes to get through the tunnel.

892
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:36,000
And I swear to God, I was
like, perfect timing light.
As we got through the tunnel,

893
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,690
this chick is finishing
singing the national anthem
as we just take in the rose

894
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:48,030
bowl on a sunny California day,
everybody's wearing their Trojan colors.

895
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,760
Everybody's wearing that Penn state.
There's pompoms.

896
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:55,050
People are going fucking nuts.
And this lady's like, Eh, no,

897
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:57,780
Ho up the wave.
And what is,

898
00:54:57,781 --> 00:55:00,540
she finished a fucking stealth bomber.

899
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,820
Flies right over the goddamn top. I'm
shifts like it's like a fucking acid trip.

900
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:11,040
I almost passed out. Right? So now
you know we've got end zone seats,

901
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,250
you know, evidently I'm not a big shot
and we'll wait at the top of the stadium,

902
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,000
which is a really rough thing to
negotiate when you're a redhead drinking

903
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:20,250
whiskey in the sun, right? So

904
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,340
we get all the way up to like row
whatever, fucking triple f and you know,

905
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,730
it's an old stadium. Okay.
And you know, back in the day,

906
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:33,240
like you would tall if you will, like
five foot six when the stadium was built.

907
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,231
And now,
you know,

908
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:37,140
with fucking growth hormones and
all the preservatives in the food,

909
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,030
we basically outgrown the stadium's,

910
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,450
not to mention the cheesecake factories
that have these fucking people go to

911
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:46,560
every other day.
So I'm trying to walk a tight rope down.

912
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,260
I'm literally acting this out on my
bedroom, by the way. This is how,

913
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,580
into these stories I get to tell.

914
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:55,581
So I'm literally walking a fucking tight
rope trying to get down to my seat and

915
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:59,340
I just become that guy.
I fell, I didn't fall.

916
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,030
I sorta like,
like Lyft.

917
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,470
It was like almost like I was on his show.

918
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,920
I was the only guy in a ship that
was in a fucking perfect storm.

919
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,280
And all of a sudden the whole thing
just listed to the right side.

920
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,260
And I landed on this like
55 year old lady back.

921
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,970
Didn't like land like I was doing.
I was on one foot and I,

922
00:56:19,971 --> 00:56:21,900
I put a knife forearm little,

923
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,740
I'll Samuelson in front of the net fucking
action right on a pack and I was so

924
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:28,780
drunk it took me,
I swear to God,

925
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:33,910
they at least 28 seconds to get off her
and the entire time I am apologizing

926
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:39,930
with my fucking cigar whiskey
breaths just got on site. Uh,

927
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,240
I'm on the side of the fight and I just
couldn't get off because I,

928
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:49,210
the only way to get off or was to put all
my weight on my forearm and use her as

929
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:54,100
a Bannister to push me back up because
nobody's fucking helping me because I'm

930
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:56,050
obviously the drunk guy.
You don't want to touch me.

931
00:56:56,051 --> 00:57:01,051
So 28 seconds to trying to figure out if
I have the quad strength to pull myself

932
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,990
up without pushing off the
back of this old lady's neck.

933
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,020
I finally just say fuck
it and just drive my,

934
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,250
the meat of my forearm right between
her shoulder blades and I get up,

935
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,200
I apologize profusely and I don't
know what Joe was doing at this point.

936
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,640
He was fucking probably just
standing there watching the game.

937
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,460
But basically we finally get to our seats.
It was unreal.

938
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,310
I didn't know what, we got to
our seats and I, we turn around,

939
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:34,630
we faced the game to watch the game and
next thing you know this lady is just

940
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:37,420
screaming at us.
She's like,

941
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:42,550
hey screaming and she's yelling, you
can't smoke in here. And I'm like,

942
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:45,880
what the fuck is she talking about?
Because I put my my cigar out.

943
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,520
I'm gonna tell you to do the
fucking Cuban is sweet too, man.

944
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:50,710
I smoked that thing all the
way down like a Goddamn Roach.

945
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,840
It's like burning my fucking fingers
and she's yelling, stop smoking.

946
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,300
I'm like the fuck she talking about
do I smell like a cigar? And I turned,

947
00:57:58,301 --> 00:57:59,080
I looked,

948
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,880
I looked to my right and Joe is standing
there with the fucking Cuban cigars

949
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:07,630
still lit in his mouth.
I don't know how the fuck he got a pass.

950
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:11,110
Security I think is cause we
had our tickets, those tickets,

951
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:15,460
things I bought around our neck. I don't
know if he headed down by his side,

952
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,230
but he's sitting there chomping on
it like fucking Archie bunker. So

953
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,570
you know, in defense of me, if she just
turned around and she had just said,

954
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:28,270
hey guys, um, you know that, you
know, I don't know if you know,

955
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,090
but there's no smoking in here.
Yeah. I would've been like, you know,

956
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:34,720
I'm a happy drunk. I swear to God, I'm
angry when I'm sober, but I sweat it.

957
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,110
I'm a happy drunk. I just
would've been like, hey, so I
bought that. We didn't know,

958
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,470
oh, what do you use a right, good
luck, uh, by how high, whatever.

959
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,410
I would've kept it at that,
but she fucking was yelling at us,

960
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,590
so I don't like being yelled at.
And I like the info.

961
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,640
I like fucking with people and I'm shit
faced and Joe is of the same ilk and

962
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,580
then that's when it all started,
she just based, she's like,

963
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:02,860
hey, she goes, there's no smoking in here.

964
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:07,690
And then immediately I just go
and I just go and was like, Hey,

965
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:12,190
says who? She goes at California.
You. I had to smoke indoors.

966
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,840
We're like, we're outside. And she goes,
you're not allowed to smoke it. And I go,

967
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:20,950
you're not my mother. This
isn't our section. This isn't
your section. Turn around.

968
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,930
Right. I just kept being an
asshole. And then finally she goes,

969
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,340
I'm going to call security. And
I'm like, call them. She goes,

970
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,910
I'm going to call him. I go, go
ahead and call him in. In my head,

971
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,860
my brain is going, Bill, shut up, shut up.

972
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,520
You're going to get 90 seconds into the
game, you're going to get kicked out.

973
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:44,960
And I just couldn't stop myself. I
just kept saying, call him, call him.

974
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,290
And then,
then she made some sort of comment,

975
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,720
I think about the size of Joe's
knows. And then he said, hey,

976
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,430
he goes, you need to lose a hundred
pounds to talk to me, bitch. He said,

977
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,890
Eh, the guy to the left of us
turned around and he's like, Hey,

978
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,770
I got my kit, I got my kid
here, what are you cursive?

979
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,050
And then Joe goes, well then don't
bring them to a fucking football.

980
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:20,210
So now I'm doing that laugh.
You know that last way,

981
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:24,020
like your mouth is wide open,
but there's no air coming in or out.

982
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:28,010
I'm having the time of my life
and then the fucking guy goes,

983
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,060
he goes, I'm going to call
security. And then I'm just,

984
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,290
then at once again I'm going call up,

985
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,000
I'm going to call him
God and call up call.

986
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,930
I was just calling that bluff because
we was so fucking jam packed and I knew

987
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,730
they weren't going to walk
down there and go do that.

988
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,690
So that lady makes
another fucking comment.

989
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:52,130
At which point Joe makes another comment
about her weight and then she just

990
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:56,840
turns down and it's like mark and yells
down to her husband and next thing you

991
01:00:56,841 --> 01:01:00,840
know this fucking dude comes running
over and he starts screaming at it.

992
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:01,940
Since he's screaming at us,

993
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:06,730
this spray is coming out of his mouth
all over his wife. So it was easy.

994
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:11,300
I didn't fucking, I was just going,
sir, sir, you're spitting on your wife.

995
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:16,190
And once you know, that whole thing
was pathetic. He was like 53 but like,

996
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,210
and I'm 40 and I'm thinking like that
and I'm too old to fight this guy.

997
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:24,330
You know, it was just, Oh God,
I'm trying to piece this together.

998
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,720
And so we all sit down,
right? So then we sit down.

999
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,470
I think Joe would put out the cigar.
Maybe it was just holding it down.

1000
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:31,730
I don't know what was going on.

1001
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,470
But now by this time we'd
already missed the kickoff.

1002
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,690
The Trojan's get the ball and I think
this is the basically the one good play

1003
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,980
Penn state made all day. They Trojans
their first play. I think offense,

1004
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:50,570
they handed off the ball and they tried
to do like some sort of sweep the Penn

1005
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:55,571
state defense strung out and just stuck
this guy either for no gain on full,

1006
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,910
like lots of one yard.
And then Joe go,

1007
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:02,180
I forgot to mention is
a good six foot four,

1008
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,240
just a huge guy just start screaming
like an inch from the back of the Lady's

1009
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:13,720
head. Who's a Trojan Fan. He just
starts screaming like, Nah, Nah,

1010
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:19,470
Nah. I said, I can't believe
like her hair wasn't moving.

1011
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,520
He was yelling so loud as a she,

1012
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:26,260
I know she turned around and she had
that shit up noxious. That's just the,

1013
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,610
it was, it was, it was
great. It was fucking great.

1014
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:32,490
And then basically what would
have for the rest of the game,

1015
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:37,170
shit would calm down and then we would,
we would,

1016
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:37,980
I don't know,

1017
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,640
we would mumble something about her and
then she would fucking yell down to her

1018
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:46,440
husband and then he'd come
over threatening to kick
our ass and we would just

1019
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:50,730
laugh at them. And then, I don't
know, I just realized I was so drunk,

1020
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:53,850
I can't even remember the rest. I
remember it was the very end of the game,

1021
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,230
uh,
somebody,

1022
01:02:58,231 --> 01:03:02,280
Joe or somebody said something about the
score and then the lady in front of us

1023
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:05,010
goes, yeah, I'm surprised you
can count that high. I go, yeah,

1024
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:09,030
why don't you try counting calories?
Right. Something real mean like that.

1025
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:11,970
And then once again, she's like
mark. And then at this point,

1026
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,210
half the crowd and left
because of such a blowout,

1027
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,730
this two comes over and he
starts fucking screaming at me.

1028
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:21,160
Doesn't scream at Joe
because Joe is six foot four.

1029
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,230
He yells at me cause I'm fucking barely
five 10 and I'm a fucking redhead. Right?

1030
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,960
Even with the shaved head,
I still look like fucking howdy duty.

1031
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:31,120
So he starts yelling at me
and he keeps telling me, yeah,

1032
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,540
I'm going to fire you down on the field.
That's all he kept saying.

1033
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:36,720
He kept telling me he's going to grab
me and fire me down on the fucking field

1034
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,740
and I was just, you know, and
I was just being an asshole.

1035
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,960
Good dead do it. I'm going to fight on
bail. You said that you already said that.

1036
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,130
You already said you already said
it. You fucking cunt. All right,

1037
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,300
you got to do it.

1038
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,990
You would have and you didn't so you're
not so sit down and shut the fuck up.

1039
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,060
Which is funny because
by the end of the game,

1040
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,520
everyone in the stands somehow
liked us and hated those people.

1041
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,370
I mean half of it was
because they were assholes.

1042
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,940
The other half was they couldn't
hear the shit that we will mumble.

1043
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,480
And at this dude's wife
pool,

1044
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,970
I know at this point he might
have a little bit of sympathy for,

1045
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:17,820
but I mean I'm telling
you she was, she was, uh,

1046
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,050
she was an asshole and she's the
one who made it personal first.

1047
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,390
She made the comment about
Joe's knows she, uh, oh,

1048
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:28,110
she was doing real hacky lines too.
She's told me I was ugly.

1049
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,770
She goes and I always can lose
weight, you know, which, uh,

1050
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:36,690
I believe I saw during the second
season of def jam and um, you know,

1051
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:37,801
and I thought,
well,

1052
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:41,550
we will come in with was a lot more
clever and if it was a battle of the bands

1053
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:45,450
in a standup situation,
I think we won. So, uh,

1054
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,400
basically what ended up happening,
I know this is a long ass fucking story.

1055
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,690
I don't even have time for questions
this week, but long story short,

1056
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,230
we ended up walking out.
Um,

1057
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,730
I want to believe that somehow the lady
in front of us to who was being a jerk

1058
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:06,870
had a bunch of these dark streaks. On the
back of a shirt towards the end of it.

1059
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:07,800
I don't know what it was.

1060
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,900
It almost looked like a
ashes from a cigar. But um,

1061
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,950
I know that that didn't happen because
there's no smoking in there. But anyways,

1062
01:05:16,951 --> 01:05:20,470
we go to leave and we're
basically so drunk.

1063
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,500
I don't know man.
It took us like fucking nine hours,

1064
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,670
literally took us 50
minutes to find our car.

1065
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:32,740
And I think it was calmer for being such
assholes in, in, in, in the stadium.

1066
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,390
And I don't, I don't know who the fuck
set up the parking lot things out there,

1067
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,320
but they basically,

1068
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:43,350
the way they do the sections on this golf
course is they have like balloons that

1069
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,900
they just have numbers, number
one, number two, number three.

1070
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,110
But they're not lit up so you
can't really see them at night.

1071
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:53,860
So you walk out of the stadium
drunk and you look up and you see,

1072
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,630
I saw the number to where we were,
where we were parked and, but you know,

1073
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,630
you've got to follow the path because
you can't walk through the sand traps and

1074
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:04,360
shit like that.
So you look down for half a second,

1075
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:07,840
then you look up and there's like a big
fucking oak tree in front of you and now

1076
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:08,740
you don't know where you are.

1077
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:12,610
It's like the end of the shining without
the shrubs. It's a fucking golf course,

1078
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:13,390
right?

1079
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:17,500
So and you're far enough away from the
stadium where you can't get your bearings

1080
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:23,020
and were just wandering around and
around and around and it's getting to the

1081
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:28,021
point like you know like hypothermia is
becoming an issue because it's a desert.

1082
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,260
It starts getting cold,
was shit faced and we just can find a car.

1083
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,300
It was like a Blair witch. We kept coming
back to the same goddamn ladies' teas,

1084
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,440
whatever the fuck we were.

1085
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,790
And then I lost all confidence in
my ability to find the damn car.

1086
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:47,020
So I start following Joe, who is
convinced, even though we both know we're,

1087
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,820
we're parked in section two,
we went from section three,

1088
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,270
section four to section five,

1089
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:56,020
and he keeps telling me to go in that
direction because for some reason he

1090
01:06:56,021 --> 01:06:59,140
thinks numerically it's going
to go three, four, five to,

1091
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,710
I dunno, took us an hour to
find the fucking car. And uh,

1092
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,560
at that point I started sobering up and
I started thinking about a behavior and

1093
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:13,420
I was starting to thinking like, yeah, I
Kinda Kinda feel like an asshole. Yeah.

1094
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:15,820
You know, I shouldn't say I
shouldn't taken the higher ground,

1095
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:19,390
even though that girl was a con,
you know? And he was just like,

1096
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:23,960
what are you talking about? What are
you talking about? She was a cunt.

1097
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,810
We treated her like one in and that's it.
That's what I love about that guy.

1098
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:33,520
He just, he just breaks it down
to the simplest fucking point.

1099
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,780
Hey Buddy, I got my kid here. Well, don't
take your kid to a fucking football game,

1100
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,900
which, you know, I know that's
harsh, especially if you have kids.

1101
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,540
But think about it.
Think about it.

1102
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,320
Why would you bring your kid to his
professional to sporting of that?

1103
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,130
Not only that,

1104
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:51,940
that the guy with the kid is being
hypocritical because he was made before he

1105
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:55,240
had a kid. All right? He was having the
time of his fucking life and what now?

1106
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,700
Cause he has a kid now all
of a sudden I'm supposed to,

1107
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:01,510
I'm supposed to fucking act my age.
You know,

1108
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,400
it's like the fucking
baby boom generation.

1109
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:07,120
They banked so much to fucking in the
mud Woodstock that by the time I come

1110
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:10,420
around there's herpes and aids and all
this shit. And then they, you know,

1111
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,170
then they come around with their don't
do drugs where a condom shit after they

1112
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:18,260
had the time of their fucking lives.
I'm so glad all of them I get in debt.

1113
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:23,150
Whole generation is getting hip
replacements now with their fucking cause.

1114
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:27,290
They all had that fucking Olivia Newton
John High impact aerobics tape that they

1115
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:31,130
did try and to stay in shape.
That's the one good fucking thing.

1116
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:34,430
Consider I gotta fuck with the God
damn trash bag around my dick my entire

1117
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,860
career. Right. The very least,

1118
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,680
I at least knew to stretch
before you lifted weights.

1119
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:44,360
And I also dangerous of high impact
aerobics. Okay. When I did my aerobics,

1120
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,940
I definitely was rocking the leg warmers,

1121
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:51,450
but I did not let my feet
leave the ground. Okay. Um,

1122
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,530
so anyways, so that's
my rose bowl story. Um,

1123
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,810
it's a fucking law when I know that, but
I think it had some nice moments. But um,

1124
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:04,040
yeah. But getting back to that, what do
you guys think about that stuff? You know,

1125
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,980
sporting events are not for children.
Okay.

1126
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,920
And I know they always try to talk
about the good old days of sports.

1127
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:16,220
The girl days of sports is bullshit.
Okay.

1128
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:20,600
When I was a kid, first football game
I went to, I was fucking terrified.

1129
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,110
I was terrified.
It was not a place for kids.

1130
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:27,650
It was a place for adults who hadn't
achieved what they thought they were going

1131
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:30,980
to achieve in life to get their
fucking anger and frustration out.

1132
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:35,750
People within loveless
marriages, you know, people,

1133
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:36,584
you know,

1134
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,280
people who could tell they were going
to get laid off the next week or maybe

1135
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:44,000
they already got laid off and they just
wanted to get it out. Okay. And they,

1136
01:09:44,001 --> 01:09:48,290
you know, they've now turned going
to a fucking football game into like,

1137
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:51,860
you're standing in line with a bunch
of people waiting to get their kids,

1138
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,460
you know, photo taken with
Santa Claus. You know,

1139
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:58,400
and even if you go further back than
my childhood, which was seventies,

1140
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:02,660
early eighties, um, if
you go back to the 1950s,

1141
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:05,930
they talk about that. Oh, the good old
days of sports or what do you mean what,

1142
01:10:05,931 --> 01:10:09,630
when, uh, when they finally let a black
guy playing baseball and they said, well,

1143
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,560
fucking black cat on the field and all
that racist shit that was going on.

1144
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,850
Can you imagine the shit that was
getting yelled in the stands when Billy

1145
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:20,660
crystal was going down the ground
and go watch the mic, boy, your boy,

1146
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:23,460
I got myself a hotdog and assess Barilla.
You know,

1147
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,840
they always tell those stories about
how great it was back then. It wasn't,

1148
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,670
it wasn't great. They were
way more racist, way more
ignorant, way more sexist.

1149
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:35,120
And people went to the games and
they saw Johnny Unitas. Okay.

1150
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,910
So now for some reason,

1151
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:41,570
now it's my turn to be an asshole and be
a drunk and have a good time and all of

1152
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:45,910
a sudden I have to take everything down
a level, you know, not now. Now it's,

1153
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,980
it's Chuckie cheese time. It isn't.
And I know you guys are saying,

1154
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:52,280
well that's because you don't have a
kid right now. No, fuck that. Fuck that.

1155
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,010
I wouldn't bring my kid to the game.
Or if I brought the kids to the games,

1156
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:59,450
I would prepare him. I prepare them, you
know, this is what's going to happen.

1157
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:05,300
Okay. You might see a
fight, you know, hey,

1158
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:08,390
dad might even get in one. No, I'm
not. I never took it to that level.

1159
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:12,680
But you know what I mean?
I think, uh, I don't know,

1160
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,380
but it, it did help guilty. I am from my,

1161
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:21,360
my behavior that I actually pulled
up a quote from George Orwell who,

1162
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,490
uh, granted, this is from Wikipedia,

1163
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,640
which the other day I looked up something
that I knew something about and was

1164
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:30,540
completely inaccurate.
But this is according to
Wikipedia, George Orwell said,

1165
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,650
serious sport has nothing to do
with fair play. It's a bound up.

1166
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,490
It's bound up with hatred,
jealousy, boastfulness,

1167
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,170
disregard of all rules and
sadistic pleasures, pleasures
in witnessing violence.

1168
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,670
In other words, it's war minus
the shooting. Exactly. Now,

1169
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:50,880
why the fuck would you bring a
child to that? And not only that,

1170
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,800
when was George Orwell alive
a long fucking time ago?

1171
01:11:55,830 --> 01:12:00,000
I don't know when he was
alive. One of you, right?
1984. He didn't write it in 83.

1172
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,770
I know that he wasn't like the 30.
Stephanie. I'm just saying. See,

1173
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:08,120
that's how he described sports
back then. So guys, like, you know,

1174
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:09,150
these Billy crystal guys,

1175
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,780
we'll always do those little
heartwarming stories about, uh, you know,

1176
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,470
their baseball cards and going down to
the baseball stadium and acting like it

1177
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:20,910
was this fucking, you know, this
time that was lost, you know,

1178
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,760
George Orwell right there
according to Wikipedia,

1179
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,720
think I proved my point.
I'm a moron,

1180
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,050
but I did have a good time and I'm
gonna tell you like this right now,

1181
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:33,630
if you ever get a chance in your
life to smoke a Cuban cigar,

1182
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,500
definitely do it all right.
Because I'm not even a big smoker.

1183
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,560
And I could tell how fucking amazing
that cigar was because I've drank fine

1184
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,720
wines and I can't tell the difference,
you know?

1185
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:49,140
And it took me a long time to be
comfortable with myself, you know,

1186
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:52,530
and he goes through the whole long
process of spinning the big red wine glass

1187
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:57,150
around. I see. Read up on
wine to try to learn. So I, I,

1188
01:12:57,151 --> 01:12:58,020
you know about it.

1189
01:12:58,021 --> 01:13:01,440
So I wouldn't feel so fucking stupid when
they bring a nice bottle of wine over

1190
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,890
and I'm like, you know, this tastes like
the shit I used to drink in high school.

1191
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,770
You know, I learned
that, you know, red wine,

1192
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,920
the reason why it's in a bigger glass is
because something about the oxygen and

1193
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:13,320
you want it to believe more and how to,
you know,

1194
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,010
move it around the fucking table and
then you shove your fucking nose all the

1195
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,610
way in it and yet put it in.
You switch it all around your mouth.

1196
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:23,820
I've got all the moves down and I'm
like, swallow it. I'm like, yes,

1197
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:28,530
this tastes like every other fucking
red wine I've ever had. That's not true.

1198
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:30,210
I can tell the difference between like,
you know,

1199
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:31,980
a Cabernet or Merlot
or something like that,

1200
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:36,981
but like I can't tell like the
difference between a 1499 bottle and a,

1201
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:44,490
a $60 bottle and uh, you know, I guess
I'm trying to say with this podcast,

1202
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:48,090
I'm not that cultured.
Okay. All right. Well,

1203
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,980
so why don't you guys chime in what that,
okay. Like, whoa. Do you think David,

1204
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:56,250
they should have a kids section. Should
they just have a Chucky cheese section?

1205
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:57,893
It's not my fault.

1206
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:00,420
You're knocked her up and you can't
go to a game and have a good time now.

1207
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,910
You know, you want to be getting
drunk with me. All right.

1208
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:07,230
See what I just did there.
That's how I made myself write,

1209
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,750
made this guy who can't
even defend himself, uh,

1210
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:14,020
actually be secretly agreeing
with me. That's how I do it. Um,

1211
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:18,370
did I mention I have a rat
problem? Um, I have, uh,

1212
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,240
I have a really nice apartment, but
the garage I have is a glorified shack.

1213
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,020
Like if they ever decide to do the
Hatfields and McCoys TV series,

1214
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,130
they could shoot it on location
in my garage. Okay. Is a
rotting out hunk of shit.

1215
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:38,380
And even though the door comes down, um,
the hole in the back of the garage, he,

1216
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:40,300
granted you couldn't
drive my car out of it,

1217
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:44,530
but a fucking rat could crawl into it on
a rainy night and then crawl up into my

1218
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:48,940
engine and sleep.
This mother Fucker,

1219
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,690
I took my car down to get it service
and they took out the air conditioner

1220
01:14:52,691 --> 01:14:55,210
filter and it was rat shit in there.

1221
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:59,230
And I got to pause for everybody
going, hey, God is good.

1222
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,920
So you know, being a man, I'm like, okay,

1223
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:07,210
operation kill the fucking
rat is now in motion.

1224
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,340
And I sat there and I thought,
how can I kill this motherfucker?

1225
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,710
And basically what I did was I went to um,

1226
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,510
a smaller hardware cause fuck home depot
and there are eight people in aprons.

1227
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,300
Um,
and I bought a

1228
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:32,400
$114 worth of those rat glue traps and
I got a couple of really big cardboard

1229
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:40,381
boxes and then I took some duct tape
because when you don't know what the fuck

1230
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,580
you doing,
duck tape is always a solution.

1231
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:46,870
And I duct taped 28 of
these mother fuckers,

1232
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:52,050
I think over 30, I think I lost count
how many I did on all these box on,

1233
01:15:52,051 --> 01:15:55,240
on two big boxes,
side by fucking side.

1234
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,100
And I split them underneath my
car. Okay. You want to get dry?

1235
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,890
Why don't you try to get, try and
get by that now? I don't know,

1236
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:05,290
cause rats are intelligent now.

1237
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:10,291
I don't know if what I have in my garage
right now is the star wars plan that

1238
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:14,050
Ronald Reagan always dreamed of.

1239
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,290
I don't know if I have the red version
of that or if I have the Maginot line,

1240
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:23,050
you know, magical line. Anybody?
Amen. You want to read up on that one?

1241
01:16:23,051 --> 01:16:27,400
That's one of the classic military
blenders of all time. Basically,

1242
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:32,050
Germany invaded, you know, France in
World War One. It was trench warfare,

1243
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,710
ton, ton of loss of life. They
came in, they got invaded,

1244
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,080
they got overrun and all that,
blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah shit.

1245
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,650
So they wanted to make sure that they
would never happen again because they were

1246
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:44,680
worried about Germany, you
know? And why wouldn't you Ben?

1247
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:49,060
So they decided to build like
this is called the Maginot line.

1248
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,450
And it was permanent trenches with these,

1249
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:55,990
these fucking basically built in.

1250
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,040
I don't look like an anti,
it wasn't anti aircraft.

1251
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:03,850
That was the problem that killed him. That
was fucking, uh, like machine gun nests,

1252
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:08,230
like permanent all the way around and
they spent all this fucking money on it.

1253
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:11,780
And what's Hilarious, by the time
they went to war with Germany again,

1254
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:17,200
they had perfected the aircraft and they
basically just flew right up and over

1255
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:20,570
all the fucking trenches, you
know, drop bombs on them and shit.

1256
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:24,200
And they once again took over fucking
France and I'm so, I don't know.

1257
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,100
I don't know if the rat laughed
at it, brought into the, you know,

1258
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:30,350
a couple friends over this
shit inside of my car,

1259
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,600
but I'm going to kill that fucker.

1260
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:36,920
And all you animal lovers can go fuck
yourselves because I'm not losing a

1261
01:17:36,921 --> 01:17:40,910
$23,000 automobile to a fucking in.
All right.

1262
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,330
I'm going to show him why I live inside.
All right.

1263
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:48,200
And I don't have to shit on an air
conditional fields filter. Okay,

1264
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:51,380
let's get the podcast questions,
Shelly people.

1265
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,530
Um, I'll let you guys know how it goes
if I kill the rat or not. All right.

1266
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:02,360
Podcast question number one. Bill since
you're a patriots fan, I got to ask you,

1267
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:06,110
what's your honest opinion
on the Tuck rule game? Uh,

1268
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:09,980
I'm a raider fan and I think that was
hands down the biggest bullshit call and

1269
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:12,920
the history of sports.
And still to this day I carry it with me.

1270
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:16,130
The fact that the eight and eight charges
made the play offs over the 11 and

1271
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:18,170
five patriots made me happy inside.

1272
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,110
And while I respect Tom Brady
is one of the great all time.

1273
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,130
Qbs if he snapped his leg in three places,
places I'd be a happy man.

1274
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:29,180
Okay. Um, for those of you
who aren't big sports fans,

1275
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:33,860
the Tuck rule was basically is
basically a rule where the quarterback,

1276
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,870
if he goes,
I basically goes into the passing motion,

1277
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,920
doesn't throw the ball and if
he brings it back to his chest,

1278
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,290
if somebody whacks the ball out,

1279
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:50,291
then it's a considered an
incomplete pass or something.

1280
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:55,250
I really should have looked up the
tough rule. And um, and you know,

1281
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:59,480
basically the Raiders slap the ball
out of Brady's hand. They fell on it.

1282
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,231
They had bought,

1283
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:05,180
they won the game because it was a fumble
and then they brought out this the top

1284
01:19:05,181 --> 01:19:09,800
rule, which nobody had ever heard
of, including probably Tom Brady. Um,

1285
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:12,410
when he wants to know what
is my feeling on that? Um,

1286
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:15,830
I don't feel it was a big relax,
let me finish.

1287
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,610
I don't feel it was the biggest
bullshit call in the history of sports.

1288
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:24,620
I think it's the biggest bullshit
rule in the history of sports.

1289
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:28,820
That's the thing. They made the right
call. The rule needed to be changed.

1290
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:31,850
I think it's a bullshit rule. I think
that that should have been a fumble.

1291
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:36,140
It is a fumble. He didn't talk and he
was going to throw it and he didn't,

1292
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:39,680
and then he pulled it in. He
got slapped. It is a fumble,

1293
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:44,180
but that's what it should be.
But because of the Tuck rule,

1294
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,980
it was actually the right call.

1295
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:49,550
But it's a bullshit rule and
I'm big enough to admit that.

1296
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,340
But the reality is,
you know,

1297
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:56,630
why that happened to you and why you
carry that with you. Oh, poor baby.

1298
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:01,130
You've had to carry that
since. What, 2001 a poor baby.

1299
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,610
You know what I had to carry for almost
20 years was that roughing the passer

1300
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:07,680
call. You're probably
too young, remember this,

1301
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:12,681
but we basically beat the fucking Raiders
in 1976 we had you guys beaten sugar

1302
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,870
bay. Hamilton is coming in against Ken
Stabler. He jumps in the air. Once again,

1303
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:19,830
I'm acting this out.

1304
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:24,600
He jumps in the air as stabler
is going to release the ball.

1305
01:20:24,601 --> 01:20:26,970
He's in the fucking air.
The ball is released.

1306
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:32,240
He slams into Ken Stabler and they call
roughing the passer like he was supposed

1307
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:36,120
to change mid air. Now I don't
know if you guys know this shit,

1308
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:39,600
but back then roughing the
passer was not a yardage penalty.

1309
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:44,700
They basically put the ball where they
were trying to complete it and it was the

1310
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:48,210
end of the game and they threw
a fucking 50 yard hail Mary.

1311
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,110
They called roughing the passer,
so they gave him the ball.

1312
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,060
Now it's not on the 50 they put it on
like the fucking three yard line and the

1313
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,350
Raiders went in to go score.

1314
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,360
That my friend was the biggest bullshit
call of all time because that was a

1315
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:08,100
complete wrong interpretation of the rule.
Do you understand the difference?

1316
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,610
The talk rule is a bullshit rule
that was interpreted correctly.

1317
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,180
So the guy made the correct call.
He did make the correct call,

1318
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:19,350
but I feel for you because
that was a bullshit that was a,

1319
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,260
it's a bullshit rule and the
Raiders should have won that game.

1320
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:27,090
But that was payback because the
Patriots should have beat you in 1976 but

1321
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,070
because a lot of you rate
of fans are a lot younger,

1322
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:31,590
you don't remember it or maybe
you don't want to remember,

1323
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:36,090
but I carried that from
1976 to 2001 all right,

1324
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:38,550
so that was 15 years.
All right, youngster,

1325
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,590
you're only seven years into
your bullshit, so I have
no sympathy for you. Okay.

1326
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,211
Sorry.

1327
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,140
I get heated when it comes to sports
and he said something that was the next

1328
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,060
thing. Let's, what's your, what's your
opinion on the field goal guy? You know,

1329
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,950
everybody, a bunch of guys, I don't
want to fucking read this one.

1330
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,950
I went too long and that when I get
get it kits and some other people,

1331
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,060
I don't mind field goal kickers by the
way. Sorry. I still got my old laptop.

1332
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:07,380
I'm trying to not hit this
button too much. All right bill.

1333
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,980
Um, I want your can be
comedic opinion on something.

1334
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:15,330
I was talking to a coworker of mine
about a girl that I had been seeing. Oh,

1335
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:19,650
I love this question. This is a great
story. Everybody just settle in,

1336
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:23,730
settle in and turn this, turn this down.
Turn this down. Cause I think this has,

1337
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,010
does this have the word continent? I'm not
sure. Okay, here we go. All right bill,

1338
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,570
I want you to comedic
opinion on something.

1339
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:35,550
I was talking to a coworker of mine
about a girl that I had been seeing that

1340
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:36,630
I've been kind of seeing.

1341
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:42,050
I was telling him that one thing I
really like about her is how he wrote the

1342
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:47,040
song, how her, how good
her smell, her hair smells.

1343
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,620
Um, well there's Twat of a girl
that works with me, overheard us,

1344
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,310
and decided to chime in by
saying shit like she wants,

1345
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,260
she wants to meet the girl who would go
out with a guy like me and how she would

1346
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:04,500
actually be nervous to be alone with me.
All right.

1347
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:06,490
I know my reading out loud skills suck.

1348
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:09,340
So let me just sort of paraphrase
what happens. This is at work.

1349
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,210
He's kind of seeing this girl and he
says to a friend of his, yeah, you know,

1350
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:16,510
seeing this girl, you know what? I really
love, your hair smells really great.

1351
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:18,400
That's all I have to send
an instant conversation.

1352
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,750
And then this other girl who's not even
in the conversation as they had god,

1353
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:25,990
I'd love, I'd love to meet the girl
would go out with you. You know,

1354
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:30,310
I'd be nervous to be alone with
you. Right? Completely uncalled for.

1355
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,140
And he goes,
et cetera.

1356
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:37,141
So now we recently found out that that
girl who chimed in just had an abortion

1357
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:43,720
like a week and a half ago.
Jesus. But I brushed her off,

1358
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,380
I, so I brushed her off,
but the bitch didn't stop.

1359
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:53,220
She continued on by asking another female
worker if she'd be nervous to be alone

1360
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:56,830
with me,
which my response was,

1361
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,260
why don't you ask, why don't
we ask someone what it's
like to be alone with you?

1362
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:06,960
Oh, wait a minute. That's
right. You killed it. Wow.

1363
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,040
Wow. Wow. Dude. You said that at work.

1364
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:18,070
Wow. Okay. Okay. And he basically says,

1365
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:23,050
which shocked half of the people at
work and made the other half crack up

1366
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:27,700
laughing. She called me an
insensitive asshole. Yeah. Okay.

1367
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:31,120
But I could care less. To
me. She was asking for it.

1368
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,140
It's not like she was just sitting there
minding her own business and I walked

1369
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:38,820
up and said, what's new fetus
killer? What do you think, Bill?

1370
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:42,250
Was I out of line or was it a kickass?
Come back.

1371
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:48,100
Okay. Let me wrap my fucking
head around this. Um,

1372
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:54,490
all right. First of all, it
was an unbelievable comeback.

1373
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,920
It was a game set and match come back.
You know,

1374
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,860
it was literally,
you know,

1375
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:07,360
I dunno, she didn't even
bring a knife to a gunfight.

1376
01:25:07,361 --> 01:25:11,320
She was sitting there with a water
pistol and you took out a machete and you

1377
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:14,800
fucking chopped her head off and I dunno,

1378
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,980
held it up for everyone to
see and then you swung her,

1379
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:22,600
her fucking head around by the ponytail
and threw it across the office is

1380
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:27,400
basically what you did. Um, well
what do you think? Was I out of line?

1381
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:32,140
Yeah.
I'm going to have to say yes because

1382
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:38,790
I totally understand why you went there.

1383
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:42,760
Like why you wanted to hurt her back
because what she was saying to you was

1384
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:43,241
fucked up,

1385
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:48,241
but she was fucked up on like level two
and then you went right to the penthouse

1386
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:52,830
level. You know what I mean? I'm not
going to say level two. She was good.

1387
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:56,560
She was a good a third of the
way up the building. Okay.

1388
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:59,350
I don't know why I'm using a building
as an analogy, but I'm too deep now.

1389
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:00,250
I have to go with this.

1390
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,340
But you went right to the penthouse suite
and you kicked her ass right off of it,

1391
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,610
and you didn't even do it on the side.
You know where they have that,

1392
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:11,100
that canopy thing with a bellman stance,
we're in a three stooges mover. You,

1393
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,133
you'd somehow live,

1394
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,380
you kicked her out the backside of the
building right down into the fucking

1395
01:26:15,381 --> 01:26:20,270
alley where there's a rat way into
crawl up into my fucking car. Um,

1396
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:26,540
yeah. What I would, what, I don't
know how old you are, but yeah,

1397
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:28,260
you kind of went,
well,

1398
01:26:28,261 --> 01:26:31,900
you didn't have to go where you,

1399
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:36,050
what you have to do as you get older, both
with men and women as psychologically,

1400
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:40,280
you have to realize where they're
coming from and you have to understand,

1401
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:44,720
especially knowing that she had just
had an abortion dude, which is fucking,

1402
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,710
is, is, that's brutal for a guy
that goes through, you know,

1403
01:26:48,711 --> 01:26:52,100
if you have any sort of a
conscious, forget about a
woman who's actually caring,

1404
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:52,963
you know what I'm saying?

1405
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:58,570
And so the reason why she's saying that
she obviously is having difficulty with

1406
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:07,061
her own relationships and is so fucking
insecure that to hear someone around her

1407
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:13,160
actually may be making some
sort of connection and be
happy in that area of her

1408
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:18,161
life is fucking with her so much that
it wasn't enough just to say the means

1409
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,820
shipped to you.

1410
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:24,820
She starts walking around the office like
trying to get people to like reinforce

1411
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:30,050
her statement and to sort
of cock block you and um,

1412
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,050
I understand why,
why you did that,

1413
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:40,640
you know, you know, and
you've gotta understand why
you went to that level. Okay.

1414
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:43,880
You went literally to that level
that had nothing to do with her.

1415
01:27:43,881 --> 01:27:46,760
That adds some shit to do
the baggage you are bringing.

1416
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:50,630
I don't know what house you saw that you
came from a household like my household

1417
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:55,430
where, uh, you know, somebody makes fun
of your shirt and you're like, yeah,

1418
01:27:55,431 --> 01:27:59,410
at least my fucking uncle isn't dead.
You know, you know, you just admit,

1419
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:04,460
you immediately go way beyond
what was just said to you. So,

1420
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,270
uh, was it out of line?
Definitely. Out of line, dude,

1421
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:10,940
you shouldn't say shit like that at work.
I don't want you to lose your job,

1422
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:15,140
but you know I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was fucking hilarious.

1423
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,710
And not to mention who fell
after my Rosebowl story.

1424
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:22,430
Who the fuck am I to say anybody
was out of line. I'm thinking,

1425
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:25,490
you know where I'm at. This is like
your story. I'm trying to break it down.

1426
01:28:25,491 --> 01:28:29,960
How you ended up there is where I'm at
as a human being right now I'm still

1427
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:34,670
doing the what's new fetus killer lines.
But I'm trying not to do that.

1428
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:39,320
You know it's funny on a comedy stage,
but it's not funny at the Rose Bowl.

1429
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,590
All right, but dude, I got,
I got to give you, you know,

1430
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:49,340
I got to give you a fucking over the phone
high five on that one. That was just,

1431
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:53,000
wow. Why don't we ask someone who's been
with alone with you. Oh wait a minute.

1432
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:54,090
That's right.
You killed it.

1433
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:00,680
There's no way people bursted out
laughing. That's one of those things,

1434
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:02,820
if you found it funny,
you made that, you know,

1435
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:06,000
you raise your eyebrows up like
holy shit and you got to walk away.

1436
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,033
You know what I mean?

1437
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:13,500
Somehow there has to be a corner within
10 yards for you to walk around so you

1438
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:18,480
can let that left go. God dammit. That's,
that was brutal. But that was funny.

1439
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:22,080
Come on women. You gotta laugh. You got
to know. That's funny. I know. I know.

1440
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:25,080
It's brutal for, come
on. That was funny. Okay.

1441
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:30,120
Uh, where are we going? Where are we
going? All right. US sports questions.

1442
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:32,940
All of a sudden people really liked the
sports. Okay, another question, Bill.

1443
01:29:32,941 --> 01:29:36,510
What happened to our beloved teams
is a Boston Person. Do the Patriots,

1444
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:39,990
try and keep Matt Cassel.
Knowing Tom Brady is rehabbing,

1445
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,440
is rehab is slightly behind.
Um,

1446
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:48,441
do the jets offer back the second round
they gained from spygate back for the

1447
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:51,150
past? Ah, man, you going real detailed?

1448
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,510
I have no idea what's
happened to our beloved team.

1449
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,010
The Patriots had an unbelievable season.

1450
01:29:56,250 --> 01:30:00,630
And what I love about it is everyone
was questioning bills build Parcell bill

1451
01:30:00,631 --> 01:30:04,800
Parcell, Bill Belicheck because
of the spy gate thing. And uh,

1452
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:06,361
you know,

1453
01:30:06,361 --> 01:30:10,710
look at this year after winning with
the six round pick three Superbowls,

1454
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:14,760
seventh round draft pick, he goes 11
and five and almost wins the division.

1455
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,380
I think he's proven himself as a fucking
coach. And uh, people always be like,

1456
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:23,360
oh fucking spygate. But they got nothing.
They don't have an argument. And a,

1457
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:27,300
the reason why I said bill Parcells is
because I really think that that guy is

1458
01:30:27,301 --> 01:30:31,800
overrated. You know, I think he's
really good at making a team good,

1459
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,470
but he can't get them over the top.

1460
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,210
And he throws temper tantrums when he
doesn't get his way. And he totally,

1461
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:42,870
he's like the Larry Brown of football,
you know,

1462
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:46,310
he's only won two Superbowls 86 and 90.

1463
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,490
And who was his fucking defensive
coordinator? Bill Belicheck. All right.

1464
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,740
He got to the Superbowl game
with the Patriots who was
his defensive coordinator?

1465
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:59,940
Bill Belicheck. Right. You see
bill Belicheck has gone on.

1466
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:04,800
It's won three super bowls.
Parcels has one, nothing, one,

1467
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:06,930
nothing.
He changed the colors of team.

1468
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,530
He definitely gets a winning
tradition going on there,
but he doesn't win. So, uh,

1469
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:13,980
I'd rather have Bella in order
to realize he's a great coach.

1470
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,300
I'm just still pissed that he'd,
he,

1471
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,180
he announced that he was leaving our
team a week before we were going to play

1472
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:21,690
super bowl for his own selfish reasons.
I really annoyed me. All right.

1473
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:26,430
Question number on. Was he going for, um,
okay. For those of you not into sports,

1474
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:29,550
here we go. Here's the non
sports stories. A bill.

1475
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:32,820
When you do an appearance on a
big show like Letterman or Conan,

1476
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,640
what's the protocol for
meeting the other guests?

1477
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:40,110
Because the show hooked
that up automatically or the
guests isolated from each

1478
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:44,030
other and the dressing
room and green rooms. Uh,

1479
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,450
the reason I asked is NBC just recently
had a replay of your Conan episode that

1480
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:51,930
you appeared on with
Keira Knightley was the headliner.

1481
01:31:51,931 --> 01:31:54,930
I assume one of the perks and doing the
show is getting to check out a famous

1482
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:58,290
chicken person, right? Um, no you don't.

1483
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,320
You are on a entirely different
floor than the actual famous people.

1484
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:08,350
You're just the comedian. So I don't
know what it's like to do panel.

1485
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:09,340
I've never done panel.

1486
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:14,740
That's kind of one of my goals here for
2009 eight I can do pony a panel on one

1487
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:19,420
of the later, later shows
like Carson Daly. I just have
to have something to hype.

1488
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:22,870
Maybe I can do that then I'd love to do
that. But I've only been the comedian.

1489
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:26,470
So basically, you know, you're
on kind of on your own floor.

1490
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,960
Um, on Letterman you're on, you have
like your own floor to yourself,

1491
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:35,890
which is cool and kind of creepy.
And then on Conan, you're,

1492
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,110
when I did call and you know what,
I def you definitely more,

1493
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,810
I don't know where they put the famous
people because I'm not near them.

1494
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:47,680
But I did walk out and after
Chuck Norris did his sketch,

1495
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:51,310
I made sure when he walked by
me, I shook his hand, you know,

1496
01:32:51,311 --> 01:32:53,860
thinking like that hand shook Bruce
Lee's hand, you know what I mean?

1497
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,810
Or at least blocked his fucking kick or
some shit and whatever movie that was.

1498
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,980
Um, but no, no, you don't get to meet
those people. Some, some people are cool.

1499
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,590
You know, I remember once in
the first time we did Conan,

1500
01:33:05,591 --> 01:33:08,560
Mary Tyler Moore walked by, looked
into my room, smiled and said hello.

1501
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:14,470
Um, you know, I think a lot of times
people are sitting back there thinking,

1502
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:16,390
what stories am I going to tell you?

1503
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:19,540
Get your head together and you're already
have your crew of people, you know,

1504
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:23,110
people who book you in that
type of stuff. And, um,

1505
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:27,670
cause personally before I go out and
do my set, like literally, you know,

1506
01:33:27,671 --> 01:33:32,110
once the show starts after the first
segment, I kind of send, you know,

1507
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:35,530
all my people out of the room so I can
kind of just basically remember what my

1508
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:39,790
opening joke is. So there
you go. All right. Um,

1509
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:43,060
question numbers or whatever we're on.
I have these numbered wrong,

1510
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,320
some reason says three, even
oil and it's like five. Uh,

1511
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:48,370
I have a question about
your storytelling ability.

1512
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:51,040
When you told the story about
getting the hot dog from pinks,

1513
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,560
it was not only hilarious,
but I felt like I was there.

1514
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:57,370
I suck at being able to replay
the funny shit that happens to me,

1515
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,410
my family is and friends.

1516
01:33:59,411 --> 01:34:02,830
Does your story ability come naturally
or is it something that you've worked on?

1517
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:05,710
How do you put together a good story?
Um,

1518
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:08,440
I'm actually not the greatest storyteller.

1519
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:13,470
I digress a lot and I'm trying to get
to get to the meat of it a lot better.

1520
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:19,940
Um, but yeah, it just kinda comes
from telling a lot of stories, but uh,

1521
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,400
but don't beat yourself up man.
You know,

1522
01:34:21,401 --> 01:34:23,290
there's a lot of people
who can't tell a story,

1523
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:27,850
but it's more like they are the
story, you know what I mean? Like,

1524
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,340
um,
I dunno,

1525
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:35,200
I got a good friend of mine who he does
the funniest shit ever and he as you on

1526
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,930
the ground, he does shit
offstage. I wouldn't do onstage.

1527
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:42,700
And he has you on the ground laughing,
but he, he read, tells the story. It,

1528
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:47,350
it doesn't sound like anything funny
happened, but like in the moment,

1529
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:49,960
he's like the funniest guy.
You ever like a, it's weird.

1530
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:51,610
Like I don't know how I
told that Rosebowl story.

1531
01:34:51,611 --> 01:34:53,350
I was just trying not to get
the other dude in trouble,

1532
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:57,920
but the other dude kind of was the story.
Joe was fucking hilarious.

1533
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,560
Um, I dunno. And then afterwards I'm,
I'm telling the story. I'm the story guy.

1534
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:06,950
I tell the fucking story, but I'm
not the fucking story. All right.

1535
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,850
I'm just a sad little man we
telling shit that I didn't do. Okay.

1536
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:14,400
Question number six.
Um,

1537
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,460
all right. Hey, what's the
word? Uh, Oh, you know what?
I got this one totally wrong.

1538
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:20,850
Like someone asked me the other day,

1539
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,810
a couple of weeks back about what I
think about the Chicago Blackhawks.

1540
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:26,030
I was only mildly paying attention to him.

1541
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:29,720
I didn't realize how good they were this
year and I started watching them. Um,

1542
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:34,280
I think that they're going to go maybe
a couple rounds into the playoffs this

1543
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,150
year. And, um,

1544
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,950
also you asked me why the fuck did
the Bruins get rid of Thornton?

1545
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:45,200
And I was saying why, you know, they
kind of blamed our shortcomings on him,

1546
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:48,590
but I forgot that we got,
we got Phil Kessel in that trade.

1547
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:51,410
So we did get something sort of a

1548
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,560
trying to correct something there.
All right,

1549
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:56,720
let me try to get to the rest of these.
All right.

1550
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:58,700
Here's the new year's
resolutions. People, I know.

1551
01:35:58,701 --> 01:36:03,100
This is getting long news resolutions. Um,
I never understood. Yeah. You know what,

1552
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,840
why don't I hate my shit this weekend.
Going to be at the Improv and Tampa,

1553
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:07,280
go to Improv,

1554
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:10,730
the number two.com for all the information
where you can click right on my

1555
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:13,730
homepage. Please come out to
see me at the Improv in Tampa.

1556
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:17,960
I got a whole new hour is shit.
And um, yeah, come on man.

1557
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:20,570
You can't be just listening
to me for free and my podcast.

1558
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:22,370
I know it's a tough economy,
but for the Christ,

1559
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:26,120
they come out and fucking support me.
All right, New Year's resolutions. Um,

1560
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:30,080
all right, Bill, a lot of people are
against him. Here's a guy I have. No,

1561
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:32,090
I never understood the logic
of new year's resolutions.

1562
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:36,080
There's turning 64 other days a year when
one can decide to do something better

1563
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:36,914
for themselves.

1564
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:40,000
Perhaps it's another marketing
scheme for capitalist bloodsuckers.

1565
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:43,770
I'm hoping that we will make another
hoping that we'll make another irrational

1566
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:47,270
decisions. It's not really a, it's more
of a statement. I kind of agree with that.

1567
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,030
Um,
I absolutely hate new years resolutions.

1568
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:52,790
People trick themselves into believing
that the best time to make changes and

1569
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:54,410
start things is at the
beginning of the year.

1570
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,650
I don't make New Year's resolutions
because they are an unnecessary.

1571
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:02,360
I start every new year off with what I
refer to as my three golden rules. One,

1572
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,850
laugh my ass off.
Every chance I get

1573
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:10,430
to after I have done what I can,

1574
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:15,290
I walk away from those things that
I cannot fix or resolve. And three,

1575
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,150
I surround myself with people,

1576
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:22,151
places and things I love most
and support who I am as a person.

1577
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:26,240
Jesus Christ. There's somebody
who's healthy, huh? Um,

1578
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:30,920
all right. What are, where are we
going here? Where are we going?

1579
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:33,950
Let's wrap this fucking thing up
with the quick overrated, underrated,

1580
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,010
and I'm actually going to pitch it because
you guys have been doing such a great

1581
01:37:37,011 --> 01:37:41,180
job here. Um, I'm going to say
overrated is the movie 300.

1582
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:46,880
Um, that's, it's just
that it's laugh out loud.

1583
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:49,660
Awful.
The second time you see it,

1584
01:37:49,661 --> 01:37:51,770
the first time you see it
visually it's really interesting,

1585
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:56,400
but it's just the stupidest fucking
thing ever. It's complete meathead.

1586
01:37:56,401 --> 01:38:00,660
What it means to be a man. And
you know the, the, the kid,

1587
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,530
you know was crying for his mother and
they fucking stick them in a loin cloth

1588
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,750
out in the wilderness.
It's snowing out.

1589
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:11,840
He's walking around in his bare feet and
he kills some sort of hybrid wolf slash

1590
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:17,150
alien with a stick. And I'm supposed
to believe that. And, and, and,

1591
01:38:17,151 --> 01:38:17,521
you know,

1592
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:22,290
and then they have the fight club moment
where he murders another fucking half

1593
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:25,560
naked,
six year old with this kid.

1594
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:30,180
There's smart dog and they kick
them down that fucking manhole.

1595
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,740
And that one guy does stuff, the beautiful
back flip as he goes, it's fucking gay.

1596
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:38,610
All right. And they take on an army
of 20,000. You know what I mean?

1597
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,780
You know what that movie is.

1598
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:45,200
That's the fantasy every man has after
he put these out in a bunch of women's,

1599
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,630
saw him pussy out in like a bar
fight or something like that.

1600
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:52,230
And then when you're driving home and you
start dreaming of the man you wish you

1601
01:38:52,231 --> 01:38:56,070
were and how you looked and
fucking, you know, mood lighting,

1602
01:38:56,670 --> 01:39:00,420
fuck that movie movie sucks.
It really sucks. Okay.

1603
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:04,260
I think half those abs were painted on
once I saw that Janet Jackson does that,

1604
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,310
you know that you can actually do some
shadowing there on the stomach. Okay.

1605
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:14,070
Um, yes, somebody is some of radon rate
overrated. I losing your virginity.

1606
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,950
Uh, but God, but God SEC's rules when
you figure it out later in life. Also,

1607
01:39:19,951 --> 01:39:23,990
my guitar playing to my friends
is underrated. Uh, Bill Burr,

1608
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,240
the funniest men alive and chicken
wings are also under underrated.

1609
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:30,480
The greatest food ever. Chicken
wings are great when you're younger,

1610
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:33,300
but once your stomach is so full of
grease, when you're in the middle ages,

1611
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:37,590
you can't eat them anymore.
So when joy underrated Jerky,

1612
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:41,460
it's a good source of protein, low in
fat and it's tasty. Great snack. Yeah.

1613
01:39:41,461 --> 01:39:44,730
But you've got to go to a
truck stop to get it and uh,

1614
01:39:44,731 --> 01:39:49,590
there's always the danger of being raped
there, man or woman, um, underrated,

1615
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:49,980
uh,

1616
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:54,980
being in familiar enough company to talk
some serious shit and do some serious

1617
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:56,334
ball busting.

1618
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:59,430
There's nothing worse than going out
with some people you kind of know,

1619
01:39:59,431 --> 01:40:01,260
but you don't know enough
to know their limits.

1620
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:05,940
So you can't mix it up verbally with
my friends at bars watching a game,

1621
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:08,070
it's great knowing I don't
need to censor myself,

1622
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:11,490
but with my girlfriend in general,
acquaintances on couples nights,

1623
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:15,480
it feels like I'm eating with my
grandparents. It's all smallest talk,

1624
01:40:15,481 --> 01:40:19,770
no substance and I'm constantly censoring
myself. It's a psychological prison.

1625
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,290
Exactly.
I'd have to agree with you on that one.

1626
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:25,800
Totally would have to agree with you that
uh,

1627
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,520
less couple of things.
I think that's basically it.

1628
01:40:29,521 --> 01:40:33,690
That's the podcast for this week. I hope
you enjoyed my long ass fucking stories.

1629
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:35,070
Happy new year to everybody.

1630
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:37,560
I hope you guys have a great new year
and I hope you can stick with the new

1631
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:42,150
year's resolutions. Personally, I've
been, um, doing what I always do,

1632
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:47,151
getting myself in shape the first half
of the year before I completely get back

1633
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:51,150
out of shape and nose dive with some
Christmas cookies at the end of the year.

1634
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:55,210
That's what I do. But, you know,
bikini season is coming up.

1635
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:58,480
Um, yeah. You know, I did,

1636
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:01,630
I actually bought that P90x thing that
they have late at night and I got to

1637
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:05,740
admit, dude, it's the fucking shit.
Once you get past the guy hosting it,

1638
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:09,460
you know, I don't know if I already
talked about this. He's, he's kind of a,

1639
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:14,920
if you're doing a sketch about a personal
trainer and you imitated this guy,

1640
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:18,430
they think that what you were doing
wasn't realistic. He goes, oh yeah.

1641
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:23,200
P90X you know, talks to,
hey, there's a nice shoes or
almost as cool as mine. Okay,

1642
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:25,930
let's drop down and do some crunches.
Um,

1643
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,910
but after a while you get to
see that he's just, you know,

1644
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:30,730
it's just a big insecure guy.
You know,

1645
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,460
I think I talked about
this right halfway through.

1646
01:41:33,461 --> 01:41:36,400
He admits that his dad's through
a couple of no hitters, you know,

1647
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:39,640
and you're like this, the pain. Right? And
you never lived up to him athletically.

1648
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:42,310
Did Ya? Snide. You joined
a gym. At the very least,

1649
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:45,430
you're trying to be in better shape than
your old man cause she just want a hug.

1650
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,520
Did that make any sense? It
probably did. That's the podcast.

1651
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:53,440
Thank you for listening.
And um, and uh, that's it.

1652
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:56,470
I don't know how to end it. I never know
how to fucking let it go. See me, a Tampa,

1653
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:01,720
go see me in Tampa at the
