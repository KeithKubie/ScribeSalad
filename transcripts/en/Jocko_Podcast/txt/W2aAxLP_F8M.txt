Speaker 1:          00:00          If you got

Speaker 2:          00:02          okay

Speaker 1:          00:03          diagnosed with a horrible disease night, I tried to think of a better way to ask you this question, which isn't like majorly depressing because this is, but if you got diagnosed with the disease that was going to kill you in a year or 18 months, what would you do with those months?

Speaker 1:          00:23          I, so I role play this all the time. Uh, not, not because I want to dwell the darkness, but this is part of the rehearsing the worst case scenario. So not only do I rehearse this for myself, but I try to spend time around people who are going to die. Uh, and when I get back to the bay area, actually want to volunteer in a hospice center to contend with that. Uh, there are a few things. So I would, I would get my affairs in order relatively quickly. They're already largely in order so that my family would be taken care of. And to be honest, and there aren't many points in my life where I could say this, I would largely keep doing what I'm doing. Honestly. Uh, I think that I stopped. For instance, the tech investing about two years ago, because I felt like I was replaceable. I felt like if I in a sense didn't participate, there were a hundred other people in line who are going to step up and write a check. And that wasn't a unique opportunity nor a unique skill that I held to hopefully put into the world to benefit people in some way. But, uh, the, you know, all the ludicrous experiments, some more practical than others and the podcasting and so on. I feel like I'm putting out the best work that I can and

Speaker 2:          01:42          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I think I'd keep doing it and I'd certainly end. And in the last few years I've, after reading an essay, I think it's called the tail end by Tim Urban on wait, but why about how effectively by the time you're 18 and leave the house, you've spent 80% of the total hours you were ever, ever spent with your parents. Uh, I've reorganized my calendar in my year to spend a lot more time with my family, meaning my parents and my brother, and

Speaker 2:          02:13          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:14          I think I'd keep doing what I'm doing. Honestly until, until I slipped in and up in a pile of dust, which is where we're all ended up. We were ahead. Sooner or later I was listening. I should, I keep wanting to do this. I want to, when I'm listening to certain podcasts, sometimes I want to just live tweet. Like when I'm having thoughts about them and I do it with rogue and sometimes I, I go, man, I should just be live tweeting this. Cause sometimes when he had, who do you have on? Oh when? When he had Sam Harrison. I was just, there were so many things that they were saying that were just hilarious to me. I don't want us to to, but when you had Shay Carl on that at one point, I can't remember his quote, there was this, you got to this topic and you know, you know of what you would do and it wasn't the same question it was, but it was somewhere in the same thing.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Maybe it was about money and got enough money now, or something along those lines and kind of at the same time, you know, he says, he says something like, you know, just imagine being able to spend all this time with your family. And then you said at the same time, cocaine in horse. I was like, I want to be alive. That's cool. Yeah. Shane and I had spent a couple of days together and dusted and which just for those people that don't have any context, he's also raised a church of Latter Day saints, you know, Mormon, Utah. And uh, so I was like, okay. Then whores, which is the nature of my podcast. I loved that was classic.
