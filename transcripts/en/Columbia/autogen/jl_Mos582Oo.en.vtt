yeah so any any questions anything I did
give the right talk though nothing

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:44.309
 

00:25:44.309 --> 00:26:03.289
yes

00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299
 

00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:06.049
I'm not I mean I think it did even the

00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059
I'm not I mean I think it did even the
 

00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:07.369
I'm not I mean I think it did even the
art there was an explicitly political

00:26:07.369 --> 00:26:07.379
art there was an explicitly political
 

00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:09.560
art there was an explicitly political
did you know the art that claim to be

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:09.570
did you know the art that claim to be
 

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.119
did you know the art that claim to be
art for art's sake had an embedded

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:11.129
art for art's sake had an embedded
 

00:26:11.129 --> 00:26:13.100
art for art's sake had an embedded
political message I think for the artist

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.110
political message I think for the artist
 

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.859
political message I think for the artist
that I'm talking about without

00:26:15.859 --> 00:26:15.869
that I'm talking about without
 

00:26:15.869 --> 00:26:17.389
that I'm talking about without
questioning it did like the least

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399
questioning it did like the least
 

00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:19.639
questioning it did like the least
politicized of them was Mary Lou

00:26:19.639 --> 00:26:19.649
politicized of them was Mary Lou
 

00:26:19.649 --> 00:26:21.200
politicized of them was Mary Lou
Williams and one of the reasons why I

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:21.210
Williams and one of the reasons why I
 

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.629
Williams and one of the reasons why I
chose her was that I said I find it very

00:26:23.629 --> 00:26:23.639
chose her was that I said I find it very
 

00:26:23.639 --> 00:26:25.310
chose her was that I said I find it very
interesting that she's the one who

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320
interesting that she's the one who
 

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.039
interesting that she's the one who
doesn't have the framework the analysis

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:28.049
doesn't have the framework the analysis
 

00:26:28.049 --> 00:26:30.560
doesn't have the framework the analysis
right she just has like a genuine

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:30.570
right she just has like a genuine
 

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.999
right she just has like a genuine
commitment to her community right and

00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:34.009
commitment to her community right and
 

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:37.369
commitment to her community right and
that's what makes her become actively

00:26:37.369 --> 00:26:37.379
that's what makes her become actively
 

00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:40.009
that's what makes her become actively
engaged but for all of these artists at

00:26:40.009 --> 00:26:40.019
engaged but for all of these artists at
 

00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:44.269
engaged but for all of these artists at
this time there are they actually this

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279
this time there are they actually this
 

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:47.090
this time there are they actually this
is interesting they don't see a

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100
is interesting they don't see a
 

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.599
is interesting they don't see a
distinction between being able to

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:50.609
distinction between being able to
 

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:55.159
distinction between being able to
produce high quality art and art that is

00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:55.169
produce high quality art and art that is
 

00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:58.009
produce high quality art and art that is
also politically engaged right for them

00:26:58.009 --> 00:26:58.019
also politically engaged right for them
 

00:26:58.019 --> 00:26:59.930
also politically engaged right for them
there isn't a distinction so they're not

00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940
there isn't a distinction so they're not
 

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.509
there isn't a distinction so they're not
out there producing flat-footed art

00:27:02.509 --> 00:27:02.519
out there producing flat-footed art
 

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:06.220
out there producing flat-footed art
right they're producing complex artworks

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.230
right they're producing complex artworks
 

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.549
right they're producing complex artworks
bebop you know is there there's nothing

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559
bebop you know is there there's nothing
 

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.649
bebop you know is there there's nothing
more complex than bebop at this moment

00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659
more complex than bebop at this moment
 

00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:15.440
more complex than bebop at this moment
right i mean it's engaging all kinds of

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:15.450
right i mean it's engaging all kinds of
 

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.440
right i mean it's engaging all kinds of
harmonic structures it's but though all

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:18.450
harmonic structures it's but though all
 

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.019
harmonic structures it's but though all
of those bebop artists were

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:20.029
of those bebop artists were
 

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:22.989
of those bebop artists were
self-consciously saw their art is being

00:27:22.989 --> 00:27:22.999
self-consciously saw their art is being
 

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:25.759
self-consciously saw their art is being
political even even as it was abstract

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:25.769
political even even as it was abstract
 

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:47.740
political even even as it was abstract
so yeah hmm yes

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.750
 

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.890
right right I think the reason why this

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:51.900
right right I think the reason why this
 

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.790
right right I think the reason why this
period is so interesting is that you

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:55.800
period is so interesting is that you
 

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.910
period is so interesting is that you
know Harlem is this mean Harlem is

00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:58.920
know Harlem is this mean Harlem is
 

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.220
know Harlem is this mean Harlem is
Harlem the Harlem that the world knows

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:01.230
Harlem the Harlem that the world knows
 

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.090
Harlem the Harlem that the world knows
because black people were there right

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:04.100
because black people were there right
 

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.740
because black people were there right
now they weren't always there you've

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:06.750
now they weren't always there you've
 

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.970
now they weren't always there you've
learned that I'm sure right they weren't

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980
learned that I'm sure right they weren't
 

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.670
learned that I'm sure right they weren't
always there they came and ever since

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:10.680
always there they came and ever since
 

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.500
always there they came and ever since
there came there's been a slow process

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:12.510
there came there's been a slow process
 

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.570
there came there's been a slow process
of changing that community the 40s is so

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580
of changing that community the 40s is so
 

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.600
of changing that community the 40s is so
interesting I think because in that

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:20.610
interesting I think because in that
 

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.150
interesting I think because in that
period you can see that change begin to

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:23.160
period you can see that change begin to
 

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.010
period you can see that change begin to
happen I mean it gives us a long view of

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020
happen I mean it gives us a long view of
 

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.020
happen I mean it gives us a long view of
history so what you can begin to see

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:27.030
history so what you can begin to see
 

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.870
history so what you can begin to see
what I mean is the groundwork that's

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880
what I mean is the groundwork that's
 

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.930
what I mean is the groundwork that's
kind of put down especially after the

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940
kind of put down especially after the
 

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.520
kind of put down especially after the
war especially with the passage of the

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.530
war especially with the passage of the
 

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:38.390
war especially with the passage of the
urban renewal act is groundwork that

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400
urban renewal act is groundwork that
 

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.170
urban renewal act is groundwork that
will allow for the Harlem that we know

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:42.180
will allow for the Harlem that we know
 

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.150
will allow for the Harlem that we know
as a kind of wasteland as a

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:44.160
as a kind of wasteland as a
 

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.010
as a kind of wasteland as a
representative a kind of wasteland and

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020
representative a kind of wasteland and
 

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.420
representative a kind of wasteland and
abandoned houses and a drug scourge that

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:49.430
abandoned houses and a drug scourge that
 

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.370
abandoned houses and a drug scourge that
that happens in the 40s what happens in

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380
that happens in the 40s what happens in
 

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.040
that happens in the 40s what happens in
the late 40s allows that to happen and

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.050
the late 40s allows that to happen and
 

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.840
the late 40s allows that to happen and
when that happens it creates the perfect

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:56.850
when that happens it creates the perfect
 

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.020
when that happens it creates the perfect
conditions for people to come in and

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.030
conditions for people to come in and
 

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.030
conditions for people to come in and
develop it right to say that they're

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:02.040
develop it right to say that they're
 

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.180
develop it right to say that they're
developing it right so that's one thing

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:05.190
developing it right so that's one thing
 

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.010
developing it right so that's one thing
I'd say is just this kind of long view

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.020
I'd say is just this kind of long view
 

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.870
I'd say is just this kind of long view
of history that gentrification doesn't

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880
of history that gentrification doesn't
 

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.860
of history that gentrification doesn't
just start happening when the

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:09.870
just start happening when the
 

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.440
just start happening when the
brownstones start selling for millions

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.450
brownstones start selling for millions
 

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.880
brownstones start selling for millions
and millions of dollars and some of

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:13.890
and millions of dollars and some of
 

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.370
and millions of dollars and some of
these women particularly Petrie can kind

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380
these women particularly Petrie can kind
 

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.040
these women particularly Petrie can kind
of see it already early on when she sees

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.050
of see it already early on when she sees
 

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.860
of see it already early on when she sees
what's beginning to happen right that's

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:21.870
what's beginning to happen right that's
 

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.280
what's beginning to happen right that's
one thing the other thing I think is um

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:24.290
one thing the other thing I think is um
 

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.080
one thing the other thing I think is um
getting old my thought just went out of

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.090
getting old my thought just went out of
 

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.450
getting old my thought just went out of
my head lessons to be learned long view

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460
my head lessons to be learned long view
 

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.670
my head lessons to be learned long view

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.200
20 the other thing I was going to say is
that the other lesson to learn is to is

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.210
that the other lesson to learn is to is
 

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:07.930

still going on so I think those are the
two lessons learned yes
