00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.140
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you are watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel, in

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.500
the video today we’re looking at how a little
girl’s letter inspired Abraham Lincoln to

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.970
grow a beard.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.710
In 1860, the clean shaven Abraham Lincoln
was running for President of the United States.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.510
This bare faced look was somewhat odd for
a man of the age.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.910
You see, shortly before Lincoln decided to
grow his now famous facial hair, something

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.640
of a beard-olution swept the United States
and by the mid-19th century the formerly predominately

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.600
clean-shaven men of America were now nearly
universally sporting beards.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.160
In fact, one reporter, doing a story on the
new trend in 1857, walked the streets of Boston

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.030
and after counting 543 men that walked by
him, found that 62% of them were sporting

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.319
bushy beards and all but 4 of the rest had
some other type of significant facial hair.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.149
Even those four that lacked any significant
facial hair sported what would later be called

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.300
Side Burns, after General Ambrose Burnside.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.040
The clean shaven look that Lincoln at the
time was still clinging too was out of style.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.120
Needless to say, had Lincoln been running
today, his campaign manager would have told

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.780
him he needed to grow some facial hair, with
most of the voting populace sporting it.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.160
Instead of campaign manager, it was a little
girl who clued Lincoln in that he needed a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160
change.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.040
The girl in question was 11 year old Grace
Bedell from New York, who sent a letter to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.710
Lincoln dated October 15, 1860:
Dear Sir

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.710
My father has just home from the fair and
brought home your picture and Mr. Hamlin's.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.580
I am a little girl only 11 years old, but
want you should be President of the United

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.280
States very much so I hope you wont think
me very bold to write to such a great man

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280
as you are.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.020
… I have yet got four brothers and part
of them will vote for you any way and if you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.910
let your whiskers grow I will try and get
the rest of them to vote for you you would

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.780
look a great deal better for your face is
so thin.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.390
All the ladies like whiskers and they would
tease their husbands to vote for you and then

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.390
you would be President.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.300
My father is going to vote for you and if
I was a man I would vote for you to but I

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.350
will try to get every one to vote for you
that I can I think that rail fence around

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.730
your picture makes it look very pretty …. When
you direct your letter direct to Grace Bedell

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.159
Westfield Chautauqua County New York.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.459
I must not write any more answer this letter
right off Good bye

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.420
Grace Bedell
Apparently not too busy campaigning to answer

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.150
the letter of a little girl, Lincoln wrote
her back from Illinois on October 19, 1860:

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.319
My dear little Miss
Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.349
received – I regret the necessity of saying
I have no daughters – I have three sons

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.439
– one seventeen, one nine, and one seven
years of age.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.249
They, with their mother, constitute my whole
family.

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.870
As to the whiskers have never worn any do
you not think people would call it a silly

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.980
affection if I were to begin it now?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.689
Your very sincere well wisher
A. Lincoln

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.930
Lincoln had numerous documented instances
of self-deprecating jokes concerning his less

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.659
than attractive visage.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.680
In one such instance, while publicly debating
with his longtime rival Stephen Douglas- after

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.540
Douglas called him "two-faced"- Lincoln reportedly
replied, “If I had another face, do you

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.980
think I’d wear this one?”

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.409
(Note: Douglas was not only Lincoln's political
rival, but also a rival outside of politics-

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.409
Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd was courted by both
Lincoln and Douglas originally.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.159
In the end, Lincoln perhaps wished he'd lost
that battle given accounts of his married

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.159
life.)

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.290
Given his attitude about his appearance, it's
perhaps not surprising that despite not definitively

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.459
saying he would grow a beard, after replying
to Grace on October 19, 1860, Lincoln’s

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:36.219
facial hair situation progressed as follows:
But this isn’t the end of the story.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:41.459
On Lincoln’s trip from Illinois to Washington
D.C., the now President-elect made a stop

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.680
in Westfield, New York on February 19, 1861.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.470
On the train platform, he related the story
behind his decision to grow a beard and asked

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.230
if the little girl in question was in the
crowd.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.760
She was and approached; at which point, according
to Bedell, he said:

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.379
'Gracie, look at my whiskers.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.010
I have been growing them for you.’”

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.169
She stated he then kissed her and she never
saw him again.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.250
After Lincoln, every elected President except
William McKinley would sport facial hair.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.950
This trend finally ended when Woodrow Wilson
took office in 1913.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.310
From then on, U.S. Presidents have remained
clean shaven.
