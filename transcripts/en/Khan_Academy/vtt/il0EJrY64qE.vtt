00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.690
What I want to do in this
video is give an introduction

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.410
to the language or
some of the characters

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.682
that we use when we
talk about geometry.

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:12.140
And I guess the
best place to start

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.510
is even think about
what geometry means,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.930
as you might recognize the
first part of geometry right

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.470
over here.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.220
You have the root word
geo-- the same word

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.420
that you see in things
like geography and geology.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.130
And this refers to the Earth.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.750
My E looked like a C right over.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.210
This refers to the Earth.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.470
And then you see
this metry part.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.910
And you see metry in
things like trigonometry

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.480
as well and metry or
the metric system.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
And this comes from
measurement or measure.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.170
So when someone's talking
about geometry, the word

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.140
itself comes from
Earth measurement.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.540
And that's not so bad
of a name, because it

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.200
is such a general subject.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.210
Geometry really is
the study and trying

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.180
to understand how shapes and
space and things that we see

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.600
relate to each other.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.360
So when you start
learning about geometry,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.180
you learn about lines and
triangles and circles.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.360
And you learn about angles.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.620
And we'll define all of
these things more and more

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.470
precisely as we go
further and further on.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.010
But it also encapsulates
things like patterns

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.410
and three-dimensional shapes.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.110
So it's almost
everything that we see.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.160
All of the visually mathematical
things that we understand

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.282
can in some way be
categorized in geometry.

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:31.990
Now, with that out of
the way, let's just

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.530
start from the basics, a basic
starting point from geometry.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.680
And then we can just
grow from there.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.890
So if we just start at a dot,
that dot right over there,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.130
it's just that little point on
that screen right over there.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.140
We literally call that a point.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.130
And I'll call that a definition.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.790
And the fun thing
about mathematics

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.240
is that you can
make definitions.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.800
We could have called
this an armadillo.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.992
But we decided to call this
a point, which, I think,

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.950
makes sense, because it's
what we would call it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.560
in just everyday
language as well.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.710
That is a point.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.330
Now, what's interesting
about a point

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.980
is that it is just a position.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.530
You can't move on a point.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.340
If you were at this point and
if you moved in any direction

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.560
at all, you would no
longer be at that point.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.750
So you cannot move on a point.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.740
Now, there are differences
between points.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.680
For example, that's
one point there.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.850
Maybe I have another
point over here.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.880
And then I have
another point over here

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.670
and then another
point over there.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.610
And you want to be able to
refer to the different points.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.450
And not everyone has the
luxury of a nice colored

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.294
pen like I do.

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:36.210
Otherwise, they could
refer to the green point

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.210
or the blue point
or the pink point.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.450
And so in geometry
to refer to points,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.870
we tend to give them labels.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.990
And the labels tend
to have letters.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.810
So for example, this
could be point A.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.700
This could be point B.
This would be point C.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.220
And this right over
here could be point D.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.812
So someone says,
hey, circle point C.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:56.020
You know which one to circle.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.630
You know that you would
have to circle that point

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.770
right over there.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.860
Well, that so far is
kind of interesting.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.360
You have these
things called points.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.026
You really can't move
around on a point.

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:07.779
All they do is
specify a position.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.820
What if we want to move
around a little bit more?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.330
What if we want to get
from one point to another?

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.600
So what if we
started at one point

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.650
and we wanted all of the points,
including that point, that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.360
connect that point at
another point, so all

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.500
of these points right over here.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.260
So what would we call this
thing, all of the points

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.439
that connect A and
B along a straight--

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.980
and I'll use everyday
language here--

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.320
along a straight line like this?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.022
Well, we'll call
this a line segment.

00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:38.980
In everyday language,
you might call it a line.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.890
But we'll call it
a line segment,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.590
because we'll see when we
talk in mathematical terms

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.000
a line means something
slightly different.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.730
So this is a line segment.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.430
And if we were to
connect D and C,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.375
this would also be
another line segment.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:55.620
A line segment.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.440
And once again,
because we always

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.375
don't have the luxury
of colors, this one

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:01.880
is clearly the
orange line segment.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.880
This is clearly the
yellow line segment.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.120
We want to have the labels
for these line segments.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.630
And the best way to
label the line segments

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.440
is with its end points.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.020
And that's another word here.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.690
So a point is just
literally A or B.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.690
But A and B are also the end
points of these line segments,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.680
because it starts and ends at
A and B. So let me write this.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.129
A and B are end points, another
definition right over here.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.670
Once again, we could
have called them

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.790
aardvarks or end armadillos.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.239
But we, as
mathematicians, decided

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:37.780
to call them end
points, because that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.640
seems to be a good name for it.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.797
And once again, we need a way to
label these line segments that

00:04:44.797 --> 00:04:45.630
have the end points.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.690
And what's a better way
to label a line segment

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.780
than with its actual end points?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.830
So we would refer to this
line segment over here,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.800
we would put its
end points there.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.580
And to show that
it's a line segment,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.270
we would draw a line
over it just like that.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.760
This line segment down here,
we would write it like this.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.010
And we could have just as
easily written it like this.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.170
CD with a line over it would've
referred to that same line

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.030
segment.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.550
BA with a line over it would
refer to that same line

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.840
segment.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.550
Now, you might be saying,
well, I'm not satisfied just

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.990
traveling in between A and B.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.990
And this is actually
another interesting idea.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.170
When you were just on A,
when you were just on a point

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.030
and you couldn't
travel at all, you

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.100
couldn't travel in any
direction without staying

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.710
on that point, that means you
have zero options to travel in.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.570
You can't go up or down, left
or right, in or out of the page

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.020
and still be on that point.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.690
And so that's why we say a
point has zero dimensions.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.860
Zero dimensions.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.000
Now, all of a sudden,
we have this thing,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.740
this line segment here.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.430
And this line segment
we can at least

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.990
go to the left and the right
all along this line segment.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.810
We can go towards
A or towards B.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.010
So we can go back or
forward in one dimension.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.860
So the line segment is a
one-dimensional idea almost

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.190
or a one-dimensional object.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.940
Although these are
more abstract ideas.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.270
There is no such thing as
a perfect line segment,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.240
because you can't move up
or down on this line segment

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.150
while being on it, while in
reality, anything that we think

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.000
is a line segment, even a
stick of some type, a very

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.790
straight stick or a
string that is taut,

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.800
that still will have some width.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.540
But the geometrical pure
line segment has no width.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.130
It only has a length here.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.237
So you can only
move along the line.

00:06:37.237 --> 00:06:39.070
And that's what we say
it's one-dimensional.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.030
A point you can't move at all.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.780
A line segment you can only
move in that back and forth

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.010
along that same direction.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.560
Now, I just hinted that it
can actually have a length.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.070
How do you refer to that?

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.670
Well, you refer to that by
not writing that line on it.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.010
So if I write AB with a
line on top of it like,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.390
that means I'm referring
to the actual line segment.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.000
Let me do this in a new color.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.490
If I say that AB is equal to 5
units-- it might be centimeters

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.000
or meters or whatever, just
the abstract units 5-- that

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.620
means that the distance
between A and B

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.967
is 5, that the length of line
segment AB is, actually, 5.

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:21.300
Now, let's keep on extending it.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.550
Let's say we want to just
keep going in one direction.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.950
So let's say that I start at A.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.380
Let me do this in a new color.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.150
Let's say I start at A.
And I want to go to D.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.490
But I want the option
to keep on going.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.140
So I can't go further
in A's direction than A.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.660
But I can go further
in D's direction.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.112
So this little idea that I
just showed, essentially,

00:07:44.112 --> 00:07:45.570
it's like a line
segment, but I can

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.590
keep on going past this
endpoint, we call this a ray.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.495
And the starting point for a
ray is called the vertex, not

00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:55.870
a term that you'll
see too often.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.994
You'll see vertex later
on in other contexts.

00:07:57.994 --> 00:07:58.910
But it's good to know.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.900
This is the vertex of the ray.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.700
It's not the vertex
of this line segment.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.499
So maybe I shouldn't
label it just like that.

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:07.915
And what's interesting
about a ray

00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:09.748
is it's once again a
one-dimensional figure.

00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:15.850
But you can keep on going
past one of the endpoints.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.990
And the way that we
would specify a ray

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.950
is we would call it AD.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.330
And we would put this little
arrow over on top of it

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.120
to show that it is a ray.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.410
And in this case,
it matters the order

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.160
that we put the letters in.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.809
If I put DA as a ray, this
would mean a different ray.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.580
That would mean that
we're starting at D.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.669
And then we're going past
A. So this is not ray DA.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.940
This is ray AD.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.404
Now, the last idea that I'm
sure you're thinking about

00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:46.215
is, well, what if I could keep
on going in both directions?

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:49.970
So let's say I could keep going.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.880
My diagram is getting messy.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.510
So let me introduce
some more points.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.300
So let's say I have
point E. And then

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.290
I have point F right over here.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.050
And let's say that I
have this object that

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.230
goes through both E
and F but just keeps

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.980
on going in both directions.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.260
When we talk in geometry terms,
this is what we call a line.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.280
Now, notice a line never ends.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.330
You can keep going
in either direction.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.050
A line segment does end.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.490
It has end points.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.440
A line does not.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.320
And actually, a line
segment can sometimes

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.580
be called just a segment.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:30.960
And so you would specify line
EF with these arrows just

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.880
like that.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.338
Now, the thing that you're
going to see most typically when

00:09:34.338 --> 00:09:36.870
we're studying geometry
are these right over here,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.940
because we're going to
be concerned with sides

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.195
of shapes, distances
between points.

00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:43.570
And when you're talking about
any of those things, things

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.070
that have finite
length, things that

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.680
have an actual length, things
that don't go off forever

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.420
in one or two
directions, then you

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.350
are talking about a
segment or a line segment.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.600
Now, just to keep
talking about new words

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.480
that you might confront
in geometry, if we go back

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.690
talking about a line,
I was drawing a ray.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.060
So let's say I have
point X and point Y.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.210
And so this is line segment XY.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.520
So I could denote
it just like that.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.689
If I have another
point, let's say

00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:17.230
I have another point
right over here.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.690
Let's call that point Z. And
I'll introduce another word.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.560
X, Y, and Z all lie
on the same line,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.160
if you would imagine
that a line could

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.480
keep going on and
on forever and ever.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.630
So we can say that X,
Y, and Z are collinear.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.000
So those three
points are collinear.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.770
They all sit on the same line.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.800
And they also all sit
on line segment XY.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.774
Now, let's say we're told
that XZ is equal to ZY

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.190
and they are all collinear.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.210
So that means this is telling
us that the distance between X

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.480
and Z is the same as the
distance between Z and Y.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.760
So sometimes we can
mark it like that.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.270
This distance is the same
as that distance over there.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.970
So that tells us that
Z is exactly halfway

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.760
between X and Y. So
in this situation,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:20.010
we would call Z the
midpoint of line segment XY,

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.387
because it's exactly
halfway between.

00:11:22.387 --> 00:11:24.220
Now, to finish up, we've
talked about things

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.120
that have zero
dimensions-- points.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.230
We've talked about things that
have one dimension-- a line,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.940
a line segment, or a ray.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.030
You might say, well,
what has two dimensions?

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.340
Well, in order to
have two dimensions,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.100
that means I can go
backwards and forwards

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.390
in two different directions.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.619
So this page right
here or this video

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:42.160
or this screen that
you're looking at

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.560
is a two-dimensional object.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.750
I can go right-left.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.960
That is one dimension.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.110
Or I could go up-down.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:54.000
And so this surface of the
monitor you're looking at

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.200
is actually two dimensions.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.292
You can go backwards or
forwards in two directions.

00:12:00.292 --> 00:12:01.750
And things that
are two dimensions,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.860
we call them planar.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.950
Or we call them planes.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.200
So if you took a piece of
paper that extended forever,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.970
it just extended in
every direction forever,

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.530
that in the geometrical
sense was a plane.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.040
The piece of paper
itself, the thing

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.540
that's finite-- and
you'll never see

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.589
this talked about in a
typical geometry class.

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:22.380
But I guess if we were
to draw the analogy,

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.250
you could call a piece of
paper maybe a plane segment,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.110
because it's a segment
of an entire plane.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.190
If you had a third
dimension, then you're

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.590
talking about our
three-dimensional space.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.630
In three-dimensional
space, not only could you

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.050
move left to right along
the screen or up and down,

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.740
you could also move in
and out of the screen.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.120
You also have this dimension
that I'll try to draw.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.410
You could go into the screen.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.430
Or you could go out of
the screen like that.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.890
And as we go into higher
and higher mathematics,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.846
although it becomes
very hard to visualize,

00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:53.220
you'll see that
we can even start

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.601
to study things that have
more than three dimensions.

00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:57.101
