00:00:07.164 --> 00:00:10.144
Xu Xian had just received yet 
another invitation

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:13.704
to the opening ceremony of the new 
Jin Shan Temple.

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:15.594
His wife, Bai Su Zhen,

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:17.574
had warned him not to attend.

00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:21.064
Since she was in fact a benevolent white 
snake spirit in human form,

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:24.194
their marriage had already weathered 
attacks by meddling monks.

00:00:24.194 --> 00:00:26.004
But devout Buddhist that he was,

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.774
Xu Xian felt obligated to make 
an appearance.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:29.914
What they didn’t know

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.694
was that these invitations had come 
from none other than Fa Hai–

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:37.024
the misguided monk who had 
tried to separate the young lovers,

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.794
almost killing Xu Xian in the process.

00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:41.584
The monk confronted Xu Xian,

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.114
telling him that because he consorted 
with a demon,

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:47.484
he must remain at the monastery 
and cleanse his soul.

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:48.774
Xu Xian protested,

00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:51.464
but Fa Hai would not let him escape.

00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:53.904
At home, Bai Su Zhen was uneasy.

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:55.894
Her husband had departed so quickly

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:59.264
that she hadn’t been able to tell him 
she was pregnant with his child.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:03.384
And now he had been gone so long 
she sensed something must be wrong.

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:04.864
She made her way to the temple,

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.244
and upon encountering Fa Hai 
the monk threw his prayer mat,

00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:10.444
which erupted into fire and smoke.

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:11.974
Weakened from her pregnancy,

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:15.944
Bai Su Zhen desperately summoned a fleet
of shrimp soldiers and crab generals

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:19.504
to subdue the monk,
and waves to put out the blaze.

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:21.974
But the water also flooded the 
surrounding area,

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:24.614
drowning many innocent villagers.

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:27.864
For the first time, Bai Su Zhen had 
harmed humans,

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.864
and she fell out of the gods’ favor.

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:32.494
With their blessing retracted,

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:35.984
Fa Hai attempted to trap her 
in his magical alms bowl.

00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:38.094
But just when all hope seemed lost,

00:01:38.094 --> 00:01:40.564
a bright glow came from within her belly,

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:43.174
saving her from the mad monk’s magic.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:44.364
The couple fled home,

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:47.104
grateful to the mysterious power 
that had saved them,

00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:51.654
and soon after, Bai Su Zhen gave 
birth to their son, Xu Shi Lin.

00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:53.504
Yet despite this joyous occasion,

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.654
Xu Xian was uneasy.

00:01:55.654 --> 00:01:58.754
He was shaken by his wife’s accidental 
act of destruction,

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:02.264
and he feared the misfortune 
it might bring upon their home.

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:03.364
Not a month later,

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:05.504
Fa Hai appeared at their doorstep.

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:10.084
He offered Xu Xian an alms bowl to 
ensure good fortune for his newborn son.

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:11.406
Still wary of the monk,

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:14.606
but also remembering Bai Su Zhen’s 
destructive act,

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:16.686
Xu Xian accepted the gift.

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.756
But as soon as the bowl 
entered their home,

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:23.686
it flew to Bai Su Zhen’s head 
and trapped her inside.

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:25.284
Against the family’s wishes,

00:02:25.284 --> 00:02:28.314
Fa Hai buried the bowl beneath 
the Lei Feng Pagoda.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.694
And when Xu Xian begged him to 
release his wife,

00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:32.314
the monk sternly replied:

00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:35.834
“She will be free when the
iron tree blooms.”

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:37.174
Overcome with guilt,

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:39.054
Xu Xian ran away to a monastery,

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.084
leaving Shi Lin in the care of his aunt.

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:44.054
But there was something neither 
of them knew.

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:47.054
The boy was the reincarnation 
of Wen Qu Xing,

00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:48.214
the wisdom god,

00:02:48.214 --> 00:02:51.304
sent to the family to reward 
Xu Xian’s devotion.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:55.204
It was this power that had protected 
Bai Su Zhen at the temple,

00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.474
and as he grew, so did his wisdom.

00:02:57.474 --> 00:03:02.794
At age 19, Shi Lin went to the capital 
city to take the nation-wide imperial exam

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:07.905
and obtained the highest score 
in all the empire.

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:11.895
The Emperor himself bestowed 
Shi Lin’s prize:

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:16.285
an ornate hat decorated with 
jewel-encrusted flowers.

00:03:16.285 --> 00:03:18.284
But though he returned home in glory,

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:21.574
the fate of his parents still 
weighed heavy on his mind.

00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:23.644
Coaxing his father from exile,

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:28.554
Shi Lin took him to visit the Lei Feng 
Pagoda to pay respects to his mother.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:29.715
Kneeling before it,

00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:33.135
he placed his jeweled prize on the 
iron tree as an offering.

00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:36.455
Suddenly, the ground opened and 
Bai Su Zhen stepped out.

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:38.975
With her sins absolved by 
the tribute of a god,

00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:40.905
and a blossom on the iron tree,

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:42.355
Shi Lin had freed his mother,

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.038
and reunited his family–

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:46.798
both mortal and divine.
