00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:04.856
&gt;&gt;I was born in Suva, which
is the capital of Fiji

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:09.216
and life was different in
almost every single way.

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:14.706
My father felt that if I received a
college education here I would be a

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:17.246
lot more successful, so that was one

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:19.266
of the significant
reasons we left Fiji.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.376
I started eighth grade here
and I struggled academically

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:27.746
at first. Coming here to Impact
was really the key thing

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:31.336
that helped me change, because I
was given a chance to start over.

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:36.726
&gt;&gt;My name is Rahil Maharaj and
I go to Impact Academy of Arts

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:41.156
and Technology in Hayward, which is a
small project-based learning school.

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:45.386
We focus on a couple of really
important leadership skills,

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.906
like collaborate productively,
critical thinking,

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:51.896
communicate powerfully, and
complete projects effectively.

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:54.526
So along with making sure
that students are keeping

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:56.796
up with the content, they're
also getting these life skills

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:59.276
that they'll need to be successful
in college and in the workplace.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:05.386
&gt;&gt;An assignment that I had for my
AP government class was the paper

00:01:05.386 --> 00:01:06.476
on federalism.

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:08.836
This paper focused
on the Constitution

00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:13.146
and analyzing the Constitution
to determine whether the state

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:16.266
or the federal government should
be in charge of a specific issue.

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:19.466
&gt;&gt;All the students were given
the choice to pick any issue

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.846
and I picked immigration.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:23.846
The states recently
have been passing laws

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.306
and the federal government has
been deeming them unconstitutional.

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:30.026
&gt;&gt;My family immigrated here so it
kind of pertained to me as well.

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:33.306
And it really evoked
something in me to research

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:36.146
and see what the actual
solution to that issue would be.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:39.436
After researching all
the current affairs

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:44.056
about immigration I began looking
for laws that would give powers

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:46.016
to Congress or give
powers to the states.

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:49.776
Immigration is not specifically
mentioned in the Constitution,

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:54.366
so you have to analyze more
generalized law and apply it.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.826
I came to the conclusion that
the federal government should be

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:01.076
in charge, because not only
is Congress responsible

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:04.396
for national security, the rights
should be consistent throughout every

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:06.886
state, because we do as a
nation believe in equality.

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:11.496
&gt;&gt;I think deeper learning is

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:15.836
when a student learns
something beyond the content

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:19.466
that we're supposed to, where
they're able apply their experiences

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:20.846
or apply the knowledge
that they receive

00:02:20.846 --> 00:02:23.086
from other classes into
what they're doing.

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:28.076
Learning something through deeper
learning really means internalizing

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:29.026
the information.

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:34.266
&gt;&gt;Before coming to Impact I
wasn't really sure whether

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.876
or not I had the right skills and
grades to be able to go to college.

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:42.156
Impact gave me the inspiration
that I was going to have the skills

00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:43.426
to be successful in college.

00:02:44.286 --> 00:02:46.266
It is really important
for me to go to college

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:51.336
because it will give me the skills
and knowledge that I need to succeed,

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:53.556
which is the key reason
that my parents came here,

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:58.316
to ensure that my brothers and I have
a successful career and a happy life.
