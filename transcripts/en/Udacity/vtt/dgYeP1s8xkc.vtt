00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Peter] Given 2 strings, s and t, we want to print out udacious

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
without using any quotes, and we're going to do that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
by using the subsequence operator, the colon.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's say we want to get the first 5 characters from s

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the last 3 from t.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Since we want to print our result out,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we need the print statement, and let's print our s part first.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We want to go from the beginning, so we're just going to put the colon there,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we want to go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Since we want to include the fourth character,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we're going to go end it at 5.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now we want the rest to come from t, which are the last 3 characters.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So we're not going to want to start at the beginning.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We want to start at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6th character.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And we want to go to the end.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This will print out udacious without using any quotes, as you can see.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But there's another solution if you're a true Python guru.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's go to the interpreter to try that out.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We have our 2 strings, s and t.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's say you're like me, and you don't like counting above the number 4.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And we still want to solve this problem without using any quotes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So we're going to have our print, and we're going to use

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
everything but the last 2 characters and s, as we did before.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And since we know all we want is everything but the last 2 characters,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we can just type in -2.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This gives us--the first part, we had an s,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but without having to count 1 character at a time until the end.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's do this same thing with t.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Here we have a little different problem.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We want to start with the last 3 characters.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We're going to use the same negative notation

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and go all the way to the end.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This gives us our 2 parts,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so all we have to do is combine them.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And we get this result without having to count really at all.
