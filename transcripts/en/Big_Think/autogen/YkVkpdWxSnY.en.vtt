and with some of the behaviors that
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.550
and with some of the behaviors that
they've observed and they're more

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560
they've observed and they're more
 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.340

these west winds hit rapidly growing
companies and what we found is that when

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609
companies and what we found is that when
 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.639
companies and what we found is that when
we looked at these unicorns we took 26

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649
we looked at these unicorns we took 26
 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.539
we looked at these unicorns we took 26
unicorns about ten years ago 10 to 12

unicorns about ten years ago 10 to 12
 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.309
unicorns about ten years ago 10 to 12
years ago when we trace them and we

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319
years ago when we trace them and we
 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.539
years ago when we trace them and we
found that virtually a hundred percent

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549
found that virtually a hundred percent
 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.789
found that virtually a hundred percent
of them in two-thirds of them had slowed

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799
of them in two-thirds of them had slowed
 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.679
of them in two-thirds of them had slowed
down dramatically and never hit what

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689
down dramatically and never hit what
 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.719

people wanted them to over be an example
 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.660
people wanted them to over be an example
and second we found that in virtually

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670
and second we found that in virtually
 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.639
and second we found that in virtually
all of the cases the deep inner root

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649
all of the cases the deep inner root
 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.469
all of the cases the deep inner root
cause was not that it was a bad idea in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479
cause was not that it was a bad idea in
 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.260

the first place or the market had gone
 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.739
the first place or the market had gone
away it was actually inner breakdowns

away it was actually inner breakdowns
 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.800
away it was actually inner breakdowns
like like this case and all these linked

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810
like like this case and all these linked
 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.320
like like this case and all these linked
to the founders mentality of linkage to
