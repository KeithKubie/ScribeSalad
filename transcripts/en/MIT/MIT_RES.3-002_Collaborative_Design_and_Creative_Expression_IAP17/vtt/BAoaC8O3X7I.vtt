00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:17.230
PROFESSOR: Okey dokey.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.159
So anybody else with
a specific idea?

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:20.659
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:25.772
AUDIENCE: A fighting game that
you control with your head.

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:26.647
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.637
AUDIENCE: You have to also--
you have to move your head.

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:46.607
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:49.200
PROFESSOR: All right, is
that sufficient to remember?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.630
All right, I don't think we need
any more details on that one.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.887
That seemed to be sufficiently
exciting for folks.

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:57.220
All right, there's another hand.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.406
Yes.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:00:59.864
AUDIENCE: A game with your body.

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:04.238
So like, your right hands
that create [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.130
PROFESSOR: These are really
well scoped for two days.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.490
I'm quite impressed.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.100
All right, paint with body.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.950
And it would be--

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.680
so the right hand is a different
color or a different brush.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.480
And the left hand is a different
color, or a different brush,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.170
or something like that?

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.649
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:27.232
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:39.310
Now, all right-- Yeah--

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.120
oh, wait, sorry.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.082
We'll start back there
and then come forward.

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:42.544
AUDIENCE: A puzzle box.

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:44.392
And then one hand
would be rotating

00:01:44.392 --> 00:01:45.860
through the different
sides of it.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.680
And your right hand would be
like the interactive hand.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.919
PROFESSOR: Oh, funky
like a Rubik's cube type

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:52.960
thing where you have too.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but one
hand is how you move around

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.070
and the other one's
the interactive side.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.945
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:15.769
All right, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.254
AUDIENCE: I have a game
where you're like a ninja

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:20.424
and then throwing swords
are being thrown at you.

00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:22.684
And then [INAUDIBLE]
attack the attacker

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.486
and you're throwing swords back.

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.750
PROFESSOR: That is some solid
interaction right there.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.530
All right, ninja--
so two stage--

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890
one is dodge throwing stars.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.750
The second is throw
throwing stars.

00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:57.400
All right.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.100
Oh, yeah--

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.250
AUDIENCE: What I'm well you
have to indirectly guide

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.875
little asteroid characters
into different places,

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.250
like a square character into
the square place, a triangle

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.452
character into the
triangle place,

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.226
the circle character
into the circle place,

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.844
but you do it indirectly.

00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:15.380
You have no control [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.171
We'd have to find--

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:19.090
I mean, a way to search
people one way or the other.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.820
They behave differently
depending on their physics--

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.180
their body physics.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.200
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.890
So some indirect--
it's like lemmings.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.686
AUDIENCE: Lemmings or
something like that.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:33.560
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.558
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have some sort

00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:38.325
of either procedural or
physics base behavior.

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:40.440
And you don't have a
direct-- you can't just

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.720
grab it and put it there.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.150
You have to find another way.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.120
Can you blow into the
Kinect or something?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.820
PROFESSOR: I think the
microphone can detect noise

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.460
levels, but I don't know
if you could detect blowing

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.870
versus just ambient noise.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.645
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that would be hard.

00:03:57.645 --> 00:03:59.220
[INAUDIBLE] do your
input for that.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.920
AUDIENCE: You'd
have to do something

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.205
that is indirect control.

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:02.080
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.580
OK.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.960
And the end mechanic would be to
guide them home or something--

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.280
to guide them into some place.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.663
AUDIENCE: Into the right place.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.570
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.231
Yeah--

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:41.889
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.550
PROFESSOR: That's so sweet.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.370
I just want to help.

00:04:50.444 --> 00:04:52.877
No, really, I felt that
one right in my heart.

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:53.460
That was good.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.400
All right.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.272
All right, any other
fun specific-- oh, yeah.

00:05:25.272 --> 00:05:27.459
AUDIENCE: A racing
game where if you

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.618
link to the net and your
car could [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:36.890
PROFESSOR: Nice.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.550
That's going to be a really
good educational game

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.620
to put together
in order to learn

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.800
all the mechanics of what's
happening inside of the Kinect.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.260
That's a really nice
learning project.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.245
All right.

00:06:09.245 --> 00:06:10.120
AUDIENCE: Over there.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.841
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes, sorry.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.530
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking of
building a virtual aquarium.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.264
So if you're the scuba diver
and you wave your arms,

00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:25.015
the fish get scared and
they flock away from you.

00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:29.202
And then they slowly sneak
back and then you move

00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:30.656
and it would scare you.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.310
So basically it's kind
of like roll-a-ball,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.329
but the cubes are--

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:40.120
[INAUDIBLE] player.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.590
PROFESSOR: They want to be in
a certain configuration, but--

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.390
AUDIENCE: --until you scare
them and they scatter.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.840
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.340
Cool.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.245
Yeah, I like what you
called it, virtual aquarium.

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:12.030
It's also good one.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.940
You're going to learn
about area factors

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.440
and triggers by doing that.

00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:19.830
Any other?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.370
I thought I saw a hand.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.846
No, it was just a
person doing something.

00:07:24.846 --> 00:07:31.295
Oh, Glenn, do you want to make
a pitch for your 2D puzzle?

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:32.504
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry I'm late.

00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:33.836
PROFESSOR: No, that's all right.

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:35.806
I'm sorry to get you
mid adjustment on--

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:39.130
AUDIENCE: I had computer
malfunction this morning, so

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.360
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.320
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.900
AUDIENCE: So I'm think trying--

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.562
what I've wanted to
do for a long time

00:07:46.562 --> 00:07:50.644
is to deploy 2D grid puzzles.

00:07:50.644 --> 00:07:52.275
So what I mean by
those are things

00:07:52.275 --> 00:07:54.909
like-- if you know
the game of Sokoban.

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:57.260
Tetris is a good puzzle.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.882
So there's a whole range
of these street grids

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:03.980
that have cells.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.630
So you might have a ten
by ten, five by five.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.900
Anyway, so there's a whole
range of good puzzles.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.382
I've tried to design a
bunch of new puzzles.

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:18.630
And I would like to learn
an infrastructure-- software

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.180
infrastructure that will
let me quickly build

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.520
versions of these puzzles and
deploy them across platform.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.645
And so I'm hoping Unity might
be something [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:32.870
So what I'd like to do is--

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.794
so are we doing mini projects?

00:08:34.794 --> 00:08:36.710
PROFESSOR: Mini projects,
yeah-- mini projects

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.380
that utilize the Kinect
in some small way.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.450
That way when you do
your larger project--

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.250
yeah, once you do your larger
project, it doesn't have to.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.610
So it could be a grid
puzzle game that you just

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.870
move the object around.

00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:53.320
AUDIENCE: So what I'm thinking
as a first mini project is just

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.040
to try to learn how to
put a grid on the screen--

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.454
2D grid.

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:02.252
And have a single element
that moves [INAUDIBLE],,

00:09:02.252 --> 00:09:04.440
sort of like roll-a-ball
except-- roll-a-ball,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.843
except that it would move
discretely from one cell

00:09:06.843 --> 00:09:09.654
to the next and not dynamically.

00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:11.320
If we wanted to get
fancy, eventually we

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.200
could try to do animation to
move the ball or the element

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.290
from one cell to the
next, but initially I'd

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.886
just have it reposition
and jump to a bottom jump.

00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:24.890
And so the first
pass is just to be

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.040
able to control-- have a
grid, represent the grid,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.536
control the ball,
and move it around.

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:33.680
That's simple, but simple things
sometimes take a long time

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.456
when you're creating software.

00:09:35.456 --> 00:09:39.564
If we get beyond the
first stage of that then I

00:09:39.564 --> 00:09:42.906
think we'll have a simple game
in the past just as an exercise

00:09:42.906 --> 00:09:47.130
[INAUDIBLE] target, where you
move the ball to the target

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.542
cell and as soon as
you hit the target,

00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:51.750
as soon as you get onto the
cell that has the target,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.270
the target will
jump somewhere else

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.950
and then move again to
try to get to that target.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.660
So again, it's a
pretty trivial game.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.410
PROFESSOR: I made a
website that did that.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.868
It had a button,
and every time you

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:05.860
clicked it it didn't do the
thing it said, it just moved.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.045
AUDIENCE: Moved the button?

00:10:07.045 --> 00:10:07.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
moved the button.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.270
It just moved itself.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.880
So it was like, submit, submit--

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:15.495
AUDIENCE: And then
the variation of that

00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:18.620
that it's not far to get
from an actual puzzle that's

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.796
pretty challenging.

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:22.640
So you could put in obstacles
on the grids or certain cells,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.890
you could make a pass through.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.348
You could make a
maze, for example.

00:10:25.348 --> 00:10:29.370
You have to get through the
maze to get to get the target.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.770
I developed a version of this
that I call multi-target,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.920
where you have two or
three things that move

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.730
and then when you
control them they

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.210
all try to move in the same
direction, unless one of them's

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.610
hitting an optical or something.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.270
Any that hit opticals
wouldn't move.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.970
So you could use the
opticals cleverly

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:53.380
to change the relative
positions of the moving objects.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.250
The game objective is to get
all of the moving objects

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.753
onto the target simultaneously.

00:10:58.753 --> 00:11:01.450
So there might be three
targets [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.950
movables and you're
trying to get all three

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.679
simultaneously onto [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:09.070
Things along those lines.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.200
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.210
All right, any other
specific mini projects?

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.102
Just you base things--

00:11:16.102 --> 00:11:21.520
oh, yeah, awesome--
oops, sorry, what?

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.720
AUDIENCE: Where you're-- in a
situation where you're angry

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.704
at everyone.

00:11:27.704 --> 00:11:30.164
People are trying to comfort
you and trying to help you,

00:11:30.164 --> 00:11:34.370
but you just do-- every single
time [INAUDIBLE] hand motions

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.370
and then they just fly away.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.989
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:43.530
PROFESSOR: Just
like, leave me alone.

00:11:46.797 --> 00:11:49.338
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] they're
trying to be like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:49.338 --> 00:11:51.274
I don't know.

00:11:51.274 --> 00:11:54.662
You have make with your
like, with your cursor,

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:56.610
but in this case
you move your hand.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.421
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
a little gesture.

00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.296
Right, right, right--

00:11:59.296 --> 00:12:01.040
AUDIENCE: If you do wrong or
not in enough time, then--

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.490
PROFESSOR: --they,
like, hug you.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.823
AUDIENCE: They just come closer.

00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:08.500
PROFESSOR: I want to make
a comedic joke about it,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.070
but I'm too uncomfortable,
so I'm not going to.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.600
No, I think it is very funny.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.930
And I think a lot of people
will identify very, very

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.760
much with it.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.950
I don't know how
to describe that.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.420
The get away game?

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.465
The--

00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:26.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.700
PROFESSOR: The loners dilemma?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.469
AUDIENCE: Shoo--

00:12:31.469 --> 00:12:33.385
PROFESSOR: Shoo-- that's right.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:46.340
Push away-- all right, I'm going
to call it push away affection,

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:51.600
although that may be too
strong of a title for it.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.860
PROFESSOR: Right, it is good.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.960
So there's some implicit
stuff that has happened here,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.850
which is some of you
are starting to think

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.570
about the interaction mechanic.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.970
So you're thinking
about the Kinect

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:14.220
in a nice way, which is you
can map some type of movement

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.070
onto an interaction
with the game.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.420
So you can think a
really simple mechanic,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.540
which is like grab, move--

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.080
it's exactly like a mouse, and
everything is perfectly fine,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.627
and my mind knows how to do
that because I use mice all day.

00:13:26.627 --> 00:13:28.460
But with the Kinect,
you can do these things

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.500
like, this means get away
from me, whereas this means

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.940
all right, come in for a hug.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.580
And you can start thinking
about very different interaction

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.510
mechanics.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.200
And there was
something similar here

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.642
where just any type of
wiggle is a-- scare the fish,

00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:49.100
which is not
something you normally

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.415
think about when you're thinking
of building a video game,

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.290
but when you have the
Kinect you can actually

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.885
think about these new
interaction models.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.547
AUDIENCE: Does the
Kinect distinguish

00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:04.280
between open and closed
[INAUDIBLE],, for example?

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.920
PROFESSOR: It does with 70%
accuracy most of the time.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.240
Are you guys saving the--

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.900
there was a making
a tree grow game.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.990
Are you saving that
for the large project?

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.210
Yeah, all right, sorry.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.380
Never mind, never mind--
forget that I said that.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.240
All right, any other fun
things with different--

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, pet
foam puzzle where

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.723
you have to navigate
the ball from start

00:14:37.723 --> 00:14:39.380
to end without falling off.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.660
But instead of
controlling the ball,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.460
you are going to push the ball.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.070
PROFESSOR: Mhm,
like using force?

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.695
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.530
PROFESSOR: Yes, so platform--

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.730
so you're the God of wind.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.339
And you can push a
gust and it rolls

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:09.630
a little bit in that direction.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.760
You have to redirect it.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:29.960
Awesome.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.020
So that's pretty good.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:37.550
We have space for one, two,
three, four, five more.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.949
And they don't have to happen.

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:41.240
So if you have ideas and they
don't happen, no problem.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.550
AUDIENCE: I think I'll
just share the tree one.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.940
So it's actually taken
from the cartoon Totoro

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.380
from Studio Ghibli.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.106
In the middle of
the movie there's

00:15:51.106 --> 00:15:53.410
Totoro who grows this tree.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.225
So he brings--

00:15:54.225 --> 00:15:57.164
[INAUDIBLE] all of his friends,
like the two girls, and they

00:15:57.164 --> 00:16:00.325
bow like the Asian-- when
you're praying you bow.

00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:04.600
And then as you bow, these
seeds grow into little leaves

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.975
and then grows into a
small tree and then grows

00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:07.930
into a huge tree.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:13.590
So it's like another
form of the storytelling.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.090
The little girl's
like, your life is

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.804
going to-- you're growing up.

00:16:16.804 --> 00:16:19.289
You're going to be in a
different state of your life

00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:20.780
soon.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.250
So maybe this game
could be-- as you're

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.330
doing what you referenced
with the aquarium

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.278
too-- when you're
making a little gesture,

00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:30.220
something grows.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.720
PROFESSOR: So anytime you're
hands are together and near

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.580
your head or
something like that.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.150
Nice.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.320
AUDIENCE: Like Totoro.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.100
PROFESSOR: Like Totoro.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.027
Did I spell it right?

00:16:40.027 --> 00:16:40.860
I just am guessing--

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.818
AUDIENCE: Totoro, yeah.

00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:44.460
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.020
So this is a really good gesture
that can be easily defined,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.895
which is hands come
near each other.

00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:52.020
They come near the head a
certain distance and then

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.252
all three drop down.

00:16:53.252 --> 00:16:55.460
So you're going to have to
have somebody on your team

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.580
you can program to recognize the
gesture, but you have support.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.130
And we can help you get that.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.030
But, yeah, I like
this tree growing one.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.829
To start in the
next two days, you

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.650
could just have
gesture recognized

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.410
and then have something grow.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.740
And that's the extent of
what you do in two days.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.170
It just keeps growing or as long
as you're holding it it grows.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.670
And that's a really
well scoped four hour

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.922
thing to try to
do with the team.

00:17:23.922 --> 00:17:25.894
AUDIENCE: This is
similar to the paint

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:30.688
one, but what if it
was pair one instead?

00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:35.134
Where instead of painting,
you're [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:45.845 --> 00:17:50.120
The second form of
attraction would be water.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.240
So then you could see which
way water pass through whatever

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.665
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:56.665 --> 00:17:58.565
PROFESSOR: Nice.

00:17:58.565 --> 00:18:16.262
Terraforming new-- cool.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:19.690
I don't know if I'll use that
space, but I left it there.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.180
I'm going to throw one
out, which would-- oh, no,

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:23.680
never mind.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.763
I'm not going to say that.

00:18:24.763 --> 00:18:27.250
It would be way too complicated.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.519
Forget that-- my brain is
usually too confused to--

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:33.310
AUDIENCE: How good is
[INAUDIBLE] resolving

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:40.230
a position if you jump
from one point to another?

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.922
PROFESSOR: Like if
you jump like that?

00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:45.505
AUDIENCE: It can see your feet
very well, as long as you point

00:18:45.505 --> 00:18:47.705
it down, though, at first.

00:18:47.705 --> 00:18:49.704
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking,
maybe, that you can just

00:18:49.704 --> 00:18:53.900
make this Super Mario
collapsible bridge thing--

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:59.136
you have to cross a bridge
within a limited time.

00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:01.760
Because each [INAUDIBLE],, once
you touch it it would just fall

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.175
down and you just have to--

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:05.180
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:10.120
So it's scrolling at you and you
have to jump across the bridge.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.550
AUDIENCE: You have to run
fast and also precisely

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.494
on that block,
otherwise you'd miss it

00:19:14.494 --> 00:19:16.438
and you'd fail the game.

00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:19.119
AUDIENCE: That would
be very doable.

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:20.160
PROFESSOR: --very doable.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.730
I don't know why I wrote the
word adventure, but I did.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.090
I'm going to draw a foot--

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.450
a little person's foot.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.310
That's a person and here is--

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.237
I don't know if that's--

00:19:53.237 --> 00:19:54.070
something like that.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.920
All right, two more.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.960
It's for my OCD.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.570
I don't want to leave part
of the board left uncovered.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.940
It's not necessary, but it
would make me so happy inside.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.270
What's other cool
things that people do?

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.440
Food or--

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.654
AUDIENCE: How about [INAUDIBLE]
bowling, but there's

00:20:25.654 --> 00:20:26.904
obstacles in your way as well?

00:20:26.904 --> 00:20:29.390
And so once you
release the ball,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.474
you can also try to change the
direction of the ball by like--

00:20:33.474 --> 00:20:34.412
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:39.570
PROFESSOR: So the actual bowling
that we do where we're like,

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.610
yeah, come on,
lead to the right.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.690
That's really good.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.950
You're capturing a very
intuitive interactive

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.610
there, which is you roll
it and you go, come on.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.330
OK.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.016
So we're going to
call it real bowling.

00:20:55.016 --> 00:20:56.004
AUDIENCE: Jedi bowling.

00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:57.570
PROFESSOR: Jedi bowling-- nice.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.620
And then you can have
little mice run out

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.490
across because your turning
and you're like, no, no,

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.490
don't hit the mouse, no.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.325
All right, and then
there was another hand--

00:21:16.325 --> 00:21:19.880
AUDIENCE: Maybe if you had
all little magnet balls--

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.940
and I'm not sure if the Kinect's
accurate enough, but to be

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.178
able to just play with a
virtual ball of magnets.

00:21:30.907 --> 00:21:32.740
PROFESSOR: I would love
it if somebody tried

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.090
that for the mini project.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.530
And then if it went fairly well,
did that for the main project.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.540
And then I could tell
a really good story

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.262
about how this class
led to the thing

00:21:42.262 --> 00:21:43.720
that we built this
class for, which

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.540
was to do something that's
an interactive science demo,

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.050
and would also feed into
our pitch to make a VR cave

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.490
inside of the university.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.069
You nailed it.

00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:00.360
You were holding that one
for last and I appreciate it.

00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:22.190
So it'll be something-- so it
doesn't do so well on fingers,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.834
but it'll be something
where you can move--

00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:26.500
it'd be like as if
you're in a ball pit,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.375
but the balls are
all kind of magnetic

00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:32.170
and you can move
them with your body.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.990
And then maybe somewhat very
related to the fish thing.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.690
So just a different
physics that's

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.025
governing the flocking
of these objects that

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:40.900
are around your body.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.410
OK, cool.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.925
Anybody feel like
they had one in

00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:47.800
and they were too shy
to say it, but now they

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.754
feel like they should
because you can?

00:22:51.754 --> 00:22:53.280
Nope-- all right.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.208
AUDIENCE: Idea--

00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.600
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.910
AUDIENCE: So this may
be a little advanced

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:03.868
for a [INAUDIBLE] project, but
I'm thinking of 3D rotations

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:08.714
of multi cell pieces, like 3D
Tetris type pieces that could

00:23:08.714 --> 00:23:09.214
be--

00:23:09.214 --> 00:23:11.644
I assume you can
make pieces in unity

00:23:11.644 --> 00:23:16.104
that are pooling together
cubes or something

00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:18.068
and so that they
all move together.

00:23:18.068 --> 00:23:19.800
And so the idea would
be to just come up

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:26.350
with reasonable Kinect gestures
that would rotate in 3D.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.495
And so the mini
game could be-- it

00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:34.106
could be you've got a piece that
you have to match to a target

00:23:34.106 --> 00:23:35.094
orientation.

00:23:35.094 --> 00:23:37.564
So maybe a little display
shows the orientation

00:23:37.564 --> 00:23:39.096
you're aiming for
and you just have

00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:40.390
to rotate the piece to get it.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.361
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:42.361 --> 00:23:43.360
PROFESSOR: That is good.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.100
And there was another
one over here,

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.824
which would have a similar--

00:23:47.824 --> 00:23:49.480
AUDIENCE: --puzzle
box, bottom left.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.800
PROFESSOR: Bottom
left-- puzzle box.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.150
Puzzle box, yes-- all right,
so this one was something

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.730
like, you have a
box, and you move it,

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.920
and you can rotate it
in some meaningful way.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.780
And then this one allows
you to do some interaction.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:08.650
So maybe you're painting
the sides of a ceramic vase

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.210
or something.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.160
So these two would have
very similar mechanics.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:21.700
All right, so the next
thing is you're all

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.610
going to stand up and--

00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:29.590
is this going to work
with this many people?

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.390
Yeah, we're going to explore.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.015
So you're going to
stand up, and you're

00:24:33.015 --> 00:24:36.400
going to come up here, and
make a vote for the ones-- oh,

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.050
do you want a picture of that?

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.133
Let me get out of the way.

00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:48.780
I think there's about
10,000 sales there.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.610
OK.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.950
So come up and do a vote.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.860
So if you are interested in
doing it come-- oh, sorry,

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.340
I thought I was
in your way again.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.550
Come up and just put
a little check mark,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.590
which is like, I'm
interested in this thing

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:07.120
and this is going to help us
self-organize in some way.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.010
And we can narrow this down to--

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.350
how many people
are in this room?

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:19.285
Three, six, nine,
12, maybe 35 and--

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.180
so getting this down to
eight to nine projects.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.330
So you're going to want
to be in a team of three,

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.880
but I don't want you instantly
to go like, I already

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.690
know somebody so I'm going to
be in their team no matter what.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.760
Try on the mini
project, and then I

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.740
won't make you do it
on the big project,

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.610
to go based on your interest and
maybe collaborate with people

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.820
that you have never talked to.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.719
And it will only be two
days, so it's at worse

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:51.260
going to be two days where you
get to sit and play with unity

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.130
and not talk to people that
you don't want to talk to.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.479
So this is the time
to do that experiment.

00:25:57.479 --> 00:25:59.270
And you might make a
new friend, who knows.

00:26:03.661 --> 00:26:04.160
OK.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.500
You can either come up
and do the check box thing

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.160
or find some way to
self-organize around

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.510
which project you want to do.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:20.510
And I know that this will be
chaos for 15 to 20 minutes.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.640
And then once you
organize around a project

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.120
that you want to do, start--

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:26.660
well, no.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.120
For 15 or 20 minutes,
try to figure out

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.790
who you want to work
with on which projects.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.530
And then we'll come together
and you'll start to refine it.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.714
It doesn't have to be the
exact vision of the person who

00:26:38.714 --> 00:26:40.130
wrote it on the
board, but there's

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.040
something about one of these
projects that interests you.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.350
Maybe it's you want to know how
to do the hand rotation or arm

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.940
rotation type thing.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.770
Maybe it's that you
want to understand

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.490
how just to detect this thing
and do flocking algorithms

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.740
so objects will move
in a certain way.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.555
So figure out something
about one of these

00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:01.490
that interests you.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.860
Go find the other people
who are interested in it

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.100
by some method,
and talk to them,

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.665
and see if it seems like a
good fit, or if they have--

00:27:10.665 --> 00:27:13.040
because you may come up and
somebody's like, I love fish.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.414
And somebody else
is like, I want

00:27:14.414 --> 00:27:16.400
to detect motion like this.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.340
And you decide not to work
together because one of you

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.590
really just wants to build
fish and the other one just

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.130
wants to do body motion.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.820
So try to do something.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.465
I like this chaos.

00:27:31.465 --> 00:27:33.590
Should would do the name
game again or do something

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.820
to make us more extrovert?

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.130
Are we feeling confident?

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.640
OK.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.130
On the count of three say a
number between zero and 10,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:45.334
which represents how introverted
and shy you feel right now.

00:27:45.334 --> 00:27:46.000
I'm sorry, what?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.120
AUDIENCE: 10 being what?

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.019
PROFESSOR: 10 being like, I am
so ready to-- oh, yeah, right.

00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:51.560
You're right.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.101
That would be an
inverse-- all right,

00:27:53.101 --> 00:27:56.840
so 10 means I'm just going
to stand up and go hug

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.700
a stranger right now.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.587
And zero being, I am just so
terrified to stand up and talk

00:28:02.587 --> 00:28:04.670
to somebody right now, not
even the people I know,

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.544
do I want to talk to.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.610
So 10 being super
extroverted, zero

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:14.702
being super introverted--
one, two, three, seven.

00:28:14.702 --> 00:28:16.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.830
PROFESSOR: All right,
so five to four.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.800
All right, we're going to
try to get that to a seven

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.450
and then we're going to have you
get up and talk to strangers.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.300
So how about we close
our computers now,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.220
and I'm going to walk you
guys through, and then

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.970
do a big circle around
the room, and we're

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.670
going to do an improv
game to make ourselves

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.530
feel a little more extroverted.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.590
And it'll be super
fun, I promise.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.350
So close your computers.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.100
Move the tables to the
center of the room.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.940
Make a big circle
around the room.
