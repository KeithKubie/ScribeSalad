00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.830
Internships may not always seem like the most
exciting way to start a career but even celebrities

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.080
have used interning as a stepping stone to
become a major star.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.480
Whether it be through family connections,
university networking, or pure determination,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.650
these 10 celebrities paid their dues.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.610
Here are 10 Successful Stars who Started out
as Interns.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.080
After you hear our list, let us know what
you think in the comments below and be sure

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.380
Aubrey Plaza
Aubrey Plaza’s disinterested demeanor for

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
which she is best known, may be ideal for
her comedic styling but for her time as an

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.700
intern for multiple companies, her unique
personality was met with varying results.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.960
One of her first internships was for Post-Its
which required her to do menial tasks such

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.210
as wallpapering an entire bathroom with the
sticky notes.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.630
Plaza was also given internships related to
her chosen career field.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.730
Along with working as an assistant for short
films, and as an intern for the comedy troupe

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.739
The Upright Citizen’s Brigade, Plaza was
also given a job as an NBC page and spent

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.969
much of her time on the Saturday Night Live
stage where her future Parks and Recreation

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.430
co-star Amy Poehler had the privilege of seeing
Plaza in action.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.080
In a 2006 episode of 30 Rock, Plaza played
an NBC page, which allowed her to combine

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.420
her behind the scenes gig with her acting
aspirations.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.049
Steven Spielberg
Steven Spielberg is a film industry icon who

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.600
has directed some of the most beloved films
in the last four decades.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
Accomplishing such success relied heavily
on his own dedication and passion for the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.420
film industry and the magic of movies.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.950
After being rejected from USC film school
but before dropping out of California State

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.299
University, Long Beach, Spielberg was given
an internship at Universal Studios.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.720
After he was no longer a student and had completed
his own short film, he continued to find ways

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.630
to sneak into the studio lot and held a position
that was not exactly an official internship

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.750
which allowed him to gain access to watch
filmmakers in action.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.470
His time at Universal enabled him to get his
short film “Amblin” viewed by the studio

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.340
vice president which scored him a directing
contract.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.100
Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey is one of the most powerful

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.630
celebrities in history, but she wasn’t always
the media mogul she is today.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.560
Even Oprah had to pay her dues by being an
intern.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.870
After college, she started her career in broadcasting
interning for a CBS affiliate in Nashville.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.700
The internship didn’t last long as she was
promoted to news anchor.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.680
She was the youngest and first African American
news anchor for WLAC-TV.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.170
She went from one news job to the next, and
scored her first talk show with 1978’s People

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.170
are Talking.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.700
Eight years later, she landed her very own
show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, which made her

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.719
a household name.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.749
Anderson Cooper
For what may be the most impressive internship

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:45.040
on the list, Anderson Cooper scored an unpaid
position for the CIA for two summers during

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
college.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.950
One can assume that with a writer father and
a fashion designer and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.510
as a mother, networking was probably not much
of an issue for the CNN journalist.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.120
During his time as a student at Yale University,
Cooper interned for the government agency.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.569
As enticing as taking a position at the Central
Intelligence Agency after college may have

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.049
been, Anderson decided to become a journalist
instead stating he was a news junkie his entire

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.390
life and would be much more adept to working
in the newsroom instead of being employed

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.989
by the federal government.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.109
After more than two decades of success as
an award-winning journalist, Anderson obviously

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.620
made a wise decision.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.879
Mindy Kaling
Before Mindy Kaling headlined her own television

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.029
show and became a New York Time’s Bestselling
author, she was an intern for Late Night with

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.209
Conan O’Brien.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.829
As a nineteen-year-old college sophomore,
she was thrilled to have scored what she believed

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.799
was a glamorous internship with one of her
comedy idols.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.980
However, Kaling wasn’t exactly the best
intern as she wasn’t completely willing

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.150
to complete the tasks assigned to her.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.280
Rather than doing the basic duties of an intern
such as filing and photocopying, the actress

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.659
did her best to follow O’Brien around to
see him in action.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.299
Working with her hero was much more important
to her and she found everything else to be

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.510
a waste of time.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.680
Luckily, her career did not depend on the
success of her short time at Late Night.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.219
After college, Kaling and her roommate did
their own comedy writing by composing the

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:06.109
stage play, “Matt and Ben”, which led
to a staff writing job on The Office.

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.010
Not too bad for a less than stellar intern.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.900
John Krasinski
Mindy Kaling isn’t the only alum from The

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.700
Office who started out as an intern for Conan
O’Brien.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.340
However, John Krasinski was given much more
to do during his time as an unpaid worker.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.409
During his summer break from Brown University,
the future Jim Halpert worked as a script

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:24.689
intern for Late Night.

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:29.210
Krasinski has stated that his time at the
funnyman’s show was an invaluable experience.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.030
He was able to parlay his intern skills as
not only a successful comedic and dramatic

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.379
actor in film and television but also as a
screenwriter for films such as Promised Land

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.710
and the film adaptation of David Foster Wallace’s
short story collection, Brief Interviews with

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.520
Hideous Men.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.550
Diddy
Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy are just a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.090
few of the names Sean Combs has been known
for but his many titles do not even compare

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.970
the to the countless positions and titles
he has obtained in his career.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.840
The rapper, actor, producer, and entrepreneur
among other things, started out as an intern.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.890
After two years attending Howard University,
Combs dropped out of school in favor of an

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.150
internship with Uptown Records in New York
City.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.879
The business mogul had a reputation in college
for throwing outlandish and memorable parties

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.430
which served him well in the music community.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.229
During his internship, he worked with up and
coming artists like Mary J. Blige.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.990
He was signed on for an official job at Uptown
but was fired not long after, which prompted

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.039
him to create his own company, Bad Boy Entertainment.

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.590
Tom Hanks
With five Academy Award nominations and two

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.939
wins, Tom Hanks has established himself as
a talented actor who has a knack for choosing

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:32.939
the right roles.

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.440
Before he proved his dramatic ability, the
1980s were filled with wacky film comedies

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.449
and becoming a titular bosom buddy on the
small screen.

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.319
In the previous decade, Hanks honed his craft
by working as an intern for the Great Lakes

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.500
Theatre Festival in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.389
For three years, Hanks did a little bit of
everything to help out the festival including

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.990
set design, lighting, and stage management.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.599
With so much of his time allotted for the
festival, Hanks ended up dropping out college

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.370
at California State University, Sacramento
in favor of experience.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.039
Obviously, it was the right choice for one
of the biggest movie stars ever.

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.389
Donald Glover
Donald Glover may be best known as Troy Barnes

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.830
from NBC’s Community or as his rapping stage
name Childish Gambino but the talented writer,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.930
actor and comedian has been plugging away
in the industry for years despite his youth.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.270
While attending New York University, Glover
worked as a summer intern for Comedy Central.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.849
For some, internships can be a performer's
ticket to fame and success but for Glover,

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.699
it was NYU’s sketch comedy group Derrick
Comedy which caught the attention of Tina

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.080
Fey and resulted in a staff writing job for
30 Rock at the age of 23, which makes this

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.639
particular performer’s time as an intern
appear slightly less exciting compared to

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.800
the others on our list.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.789
Olivia Munn
Long before Olivia Munn was brandishing her

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:50.060
telekinetic Katana as Psylocke in X-Men Apocalypse
she was an intern at an NBC affiliate for

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.060
Tulsa.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.919
After receiving a degree in Journalism from
the University of Oklahoma, Tulsa was only

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.240
her first stop as an intern.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.669
In 2004, Munn made her way to Los Angeles
to pursue acting but found an internship with

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.180
Fox Sports.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.189
The internship led to a paid reporter job
for the network but even with a background

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.009
in journalism, the gig didn’t sit right
with the actress who hated working in live

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:12.009
television.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.490
Preferring to follow her passion rather than
continuing her work as a reporter, Munn segued

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.740
toward an acting career by way of direct-to-dvd
films and ultimately found success in major

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.379
movies and appropriately enough, HBO’s The
Newsroom.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.379
That was our list.
