00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:04.149 align:start position:0%
is not the right time and and then maybe

is not the right time and and then maybe
it<00:12:04.360><c> just</c><00:12:04.390><c> conclude</c><00:12:05.260><c> so</c><00:12:05.560><c> here's</c><00:12:06.040><c> the</c><00:12:06.160><c> basic</c>
