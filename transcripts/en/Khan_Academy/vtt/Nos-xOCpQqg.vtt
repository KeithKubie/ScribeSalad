00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.140
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.835
is explore how experimental
probability should get

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:09.981
closer and closer to
theoretical probability

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:13.063
as we conduct more and more experiments

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:15.687
or as we conduct more and more trials.

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:19.238
This is often referred to
as The Law of Large Numbers.

00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:22.842
If we only have a few
experiments, it's very possible

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.288
that our experimental probability could be

00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:27.462
different than our theoretical probability

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.209
or even very different.

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:32.545
But as we have many many
more experiments, thousands,

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:36.125
millions, billions of
experiments, the probability

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:39.404
that the experimental and
the theoretical probabilities

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:42.662
are very different,
goes down dramatically.

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.877
But let's get an intuitive sense for it.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.154
This right over here is a simulation

00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:49.184
created by Macmillan USA.

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:52.434
I'll provide the link as an annotation.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.915
And what it does is it
allows us to simulate

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.150
many coin flips and figure out

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.557
the proportion that are heads.

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:02.721
So right over here, we can
decide if we want our coin

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:03.556
to be fair or not.

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:05.072
Right now, it says that we have a

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:07.372
50% probability of getting heads.

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:09.455
We can make it unfair by changing this

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:11.915
but I'll stick with the 50% probability.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.301
If we wanna show that on this graph here,

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.224
we can plot it.

00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:17.982
And what this says is at a time,

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:20.159
how many tosses do we wanna take.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.768
So let's say, let's just
start with 10 tosses.

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:26.512
So what this is going to
do is take 10 simulated

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:28.437
flips of coins with each one having

00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:30.725
a 50% chance of being heads.

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.700
And then as we flip, we're gonna see

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760
our total proportion that are heads.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.357
So let's just talk through this together.

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:39.270
So starting to toss.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.478
And so what's going on
here after 10 flips?

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.961
So as you see, the first
flip actually came out heads

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.342
and if you wanted to, say what's your

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.753
experimental probability
after that one flip,

00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:52.623
you'd say well, with only one experiment,

00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:56.382
I got one heads so it
looks like 100% were heads.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.170
But in the second flip, it
looks like it was a tails.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.203
Because now the proportion that was heads

00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:04.358
after two flips was 50%.

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:07.062
But then the third flip, it
looks like it was tails again

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:11.257
because now only one out of
three or 33% of the flips

00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:12.931
have resulted in heads.

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.345
Now by the fourth flip,
we got a heads again,

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:17.649
getting us back to 50th percentile.

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.299
Now the fifth flip, it looks
like we got another heads

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.796
and so now have three out
of five or 60% being heads.

00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:28.270
And so, the general takeaway
here is when you have

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.972
one, two, three, four,
five, or six experiments,

00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:35.886
it's completely plausible that
your experimental proportion,

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:38.256
your experimental probability diverges

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.089
from the real probability.

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.359
And this even continues
all the way until we get to

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.240
our ninth or tenth tosses.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.131
But what happens if we do way more tosses.

00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:50.134
So now I'm gonna do another,

00:02:50.134 --> 00:02:53.687
well let's just do another 200
tosses and see what happens.

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:56.313
So I'm just gonna keep tossing here

00:02:56.313 --> 00:02:59.263
and you can see, wow look
at this, there is a big run

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:02.431
getting a lot of heads right over here,

00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:03.826
and then it looks like
there's actually a run of

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:05.530
getting a bunch of tails right over here,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.797
then a little run of heads, tails,

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:09.498
and then another run of heads and notice,

00:03:09.498 --> 00:03:13.829
even after 215 tosses, our
experimental probability

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.913
has still, is still reasonably different

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:18.735
than our theoretical probability.

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.917
So let's do another 200 and see

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:23.834
if we can converge these over time.

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:27.102
And what we're seeing in real-time here

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:29.466
should be The Law of Large Numbers.

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:32.675
As our number of tosses get
larger and larger and larger,

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:36.059
the probability that these
two are very different

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.328
goes down and down and down.

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:41.209
Yes, you will get moments
where you could even get

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.174
10 heads in a row or
even 20 heads in a row,

00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:46.435
but over time, those will
be balanced by the times

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:49.033
where you're getting
disproportionate number of tails.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.773
So I'm just gonna keep going, we're now at

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:52.595
almost 800 tosses.

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.428
And you see now we are converging.

00:03:56.373 --> 00:04:00.171
Now this is, we're gonna
cross 1,000 tosses soon.

00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:04.338
And you can see that our
proportion here is now 51%,

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:09.485
it's getting close now, we're at 50.6%.

00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:11.719
And I could just keep
tossing, this is 1100,

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.252
we're gonna approach 1200 or
1300 flips right over here.

00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:17.743
But as you can see, as we get
many many many more flips,

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:20.582
it was actually valuable to
see even after 200 flips,

00:04:20.582 --> 00:04:22.606
that there was a difference
in the proportion

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:24.455
between what we got from the experiment,

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:26.763
and what you would theoretically expect.

00:04:26.763 --> 00:04:28.611
But as we get to many many more flips,

00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:32.004
now we're at 1,210, we're
getting pretty close

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.318
to 50% of them turning out heads.

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:38.326
But we could keep tossing
it more and more and more

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:39.976
and what we'll see is, as we get

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:42.228
larger and larger and larger, it is likely

00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:44.421
that we're gonna get closer
and closer and closer

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:45.655
to 50%.

00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:49.008
It's not to say that it's
impossible that we diverge again,

00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:51.903
but the likelihood of
diverging gets lower and lower

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:55.841
and lower the more tosses,
the more experiments you make.
