well don't know how far back that goes
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.080
well don't know how far back that goes
and and that means also you don't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
and and that means also you don't
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.840
and and that means also you don't
exactly know what you're dealing with

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850
exactly know what you're dealing with
 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.069

right to some degree you're dealing with

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079

it's better to think about that way
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.429
it's better to think about that way
because it becomes an existential issue

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

humiliates himself and then there's this
 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.080
humiliates himself and then there's this
rain of frogs which he kind of takes as

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090
rain of frogs which he kind of takes as
 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.390
rain of frogs which he kind of takes as
a sign from God and then he goes to his

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
a sign from God and then he goes to his
 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.069
a sign from God and then he goes to his
father even he's like eight years old

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079
father even he's like eight years old
 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.009
father even he's like eight years old
this kid and he says you have to stop

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019
this kid and he says you have to stop
 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.140
this kid and he says you have to stop
doing this to me and he's dead serious

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150
doing this to me and he's dead serious
 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.629
doing this to me and he's dead serious
about very careful not being you know

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639
about very careful not being you know
 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.640
about very careful not being you know
what would you call insubordinate

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650
what would you call insubordinate
 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.009
what would you call insubordinate
nothing like that he decides that that's

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019
nothing like that he decides that that's
 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.399
nothing like that he decides that that's
coming to an end right now and you have

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409
coming to an end right now and you have
 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.020
coming to an end right now and you have
to make those decisions in your family

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030
to make those decisions in your family
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.490
to make those decisions in your family
because otherwise things propagate down

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
because otherwise things propagate down
 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.740
because otherwise things propagate down
the generations right and every family

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750
the generations right and every family
 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.780
the generations right and every family
is rife with pathologies of one form or

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790
is rife with pathologies of one form or
 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.110
is rife with pathologies of one form or
another and you can learn from that and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120
another and you can learn from that and
 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.110
another and you can learn from that and
refuse to push it forward and that's

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120
refuse to push it forward and that's
 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.520
refuse to push it forward and that's
part of I think what you do when you

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530
part of I think what you do when you
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.289
part of I think what you do when you
when you when you shoulder your

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299
when you when you shoulder your
 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.629
when you when you shoulder your
existential burden because everyone is

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639
existential burden because everyone is
 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.310
existential burden because everyone is
the beneficiary and the victim of the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320
the beneficiary and the victim of the
 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.769
the beneficiary and the victim of the
tyrannical father just like everyone is

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:22.779
tyrannical father just like everyone is
 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.300
tyrannical father just like everyone is
the beneficiary and the victim of mother

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310
the beneficiary and the victim of mother
 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.700
the beneficiary and the victim of mother
nature and of themselves

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710
nature and of themselves
 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.740
nature and of themselves
and so you lock horns with out and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750
and so you lock horns with out and
 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.270
and so you lock horns with out and
straighten it out one way or another and

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280
straighten it out one way or another and
 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.400
straighten it out one way or another and
you don't move it forward to the next

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410
you don't move it forward to the next
 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.420
you don't move it forward to the next
generation so and maybe you detach it a

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
generation so and maybe you detach it a
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.779
generation so and maybe you detach it a
bit from your parents too because god

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789
bit from your parents too because god
 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.779
bit from your parents too because god
only knows what combination of

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789
only knows what combination of
 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.790
only knows what combination of
catastrophes culminated in their

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800
catastrophes culminated in their
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.240
catastrophes culminated in their
particular forms of pathology so good

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250
particular forms of pathology so good
 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.700
particular forms of pathology so good
enough

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710
 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.790
