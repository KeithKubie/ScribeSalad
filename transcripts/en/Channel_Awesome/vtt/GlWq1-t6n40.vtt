00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.569
Well, seeing how last year, everyone seemed to enjoy seeing me get tortured with the Disney sequels, this year,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.109
I'm gonna do something kind of similar. At least, I think it's similar, in that I haven't seen any of the subject matter

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm gonna review this month. I'm talking about the Disney Channel original movies now seeing how they started in 1997

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
I'm not gonna lie they were a little past my time, so I didn't grow up with any of these

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.740
Why are they worth talking about then?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.420
Well because the Disney Channel Original Movies got so popular that almost helped define a whole generation okay not

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.219
define, but it was a big part of it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.479
it was too many kids would say Ninja Turtles was to me or he-man or

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.300
Transformers or any of these other silly things that a lot of people my generation grew up with yeah, they were ridiculous

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.140
But they also left an impact for some reason well all through the month of December

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.059
I'm gonna take a look at these films and tried to figure out why they were so popular if they deserve to be so popular

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.910
And if they hold up as an adult or were they only meant for kids and even if so were they really any good for

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
Kids now if you take a look you quickly realize there are a ton of these movies that go way

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.649
Beyond how many days there are in December so I'm only gonna try and do the most popular ones and if there were ever any

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.159
sequels to did they deserve the attention the popularity well

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.109
There's only one way to find out I have no idea if I'm in for something great or something terrible or both

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.699
I'm curious to see what a generation under me grew up with and it actually holds up at all

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.520
Some of these are even movies based on shows. I'll get an idea

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.299
What kind of shows kids were watching - am I in for a wild adventure or nothing?

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.930
But pain there's only one way to find out this is Disneycember the Disney Channel original movies

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.540
Let's do this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.090
So the very first film to ever premiere was in 1997 called under wraps, I'll admit

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.399
I don't remember people really talking about this

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.010
But it is the very first one so I think it figures to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.530
Talk about it now from the story under wraps sounds like the most phoned in Disney Channel movie

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.290
You can imagine

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.999
Three quirky friends get together and break into an old creepy house

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.390
They discover a mummy's tomb

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.279
And inside it a mummy and the mummy comes alive and starts running through suburbia not knowing where to go or what to do

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.829
Wouldn't you know it a little friendship starts up?

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.449
but some evil mobsters want them for themselves and yet this sounds really friggin stupid, but

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.669
surprisingly for such a lame and overdone setup this can really be

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.989
Funny creative imaginative and even have kind of a dark sense of humor. Yeah, no joke don't believe me

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.379
Just look at how it opens a family is arguing around a dinner table

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.529
The little boy calls his sister a cow it already starts of so delightfully mean-spirited the father goes to do the dishes

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.530
But then a knife falls in the garbage disposal

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.769
Spinning around when a monster breaks through the window grabs his head and stabs it on the spinning knife in the garbage disposal

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.480
holy shit

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
I can't believe this is a Disney Channel

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.339
orginal movie starting off this way now of course it goes the direction you think it's going. It's not really happening

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.470
It's a movie. They're watching, but even in the movie the whole entire theater goes red like the gore happens

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.670
They're just not showing it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.390
And that's a really creative way to kill somebody this film starts off with already a really original way of killing somebody off

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.610
But it doesn't just stop there the kids in this movie are super cynical the lines

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.780
They say to each other are almost like Simpson lines even though they can't swear or do anything that wrong

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.740
There is kind of this edge to them that reminds me a little bit of Monster Squad

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.190
It's hard to explain is kinda like this natural mean-spiritedness that most kids have at that age

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.919
But for some reason aren't really shown on screen that much

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.869
Kids do throw insults at each other and they try to see if they can one-up one another they talk about

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.920
sleeping in the nude

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.009
they want to go inside this house where somebody died just because they can they discover later that there's a key to get into the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.539
House and when they asked why they didn't use it, they're like what's the fun in that breaking is much more cool?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.770
It's that bizarre kind of kid logic. I strangely enough kind of remember at that age

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.779
theirs this line where one of the boys asks what does celibacy mean and the girl says it means no chicks

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.770
He says he could never do that and she says trust me you'll get used to it. Okay

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.730
It's not shocking

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.259
But it's just that little extra that separates it from a generic Disney film and on top of that all the characters are strange like

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.880
Really weird odd people. There's a guy who owns the weirdest bookstore

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.719
That's covered in skulls and gore and he answers the door by pretending

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.570
He has a knife stabbed in his back, and he falls to the ground

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.780
How would that keep any customers that would scare everybody away?

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.390
But that's more important to him than actually selling anything even the characters at the fast-food

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.890
Joints are kind of weird and odd they all have distinct characters and a lot of them just focus on hurting this poor mummy

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.300
every other second

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.930
he's either being smacked or pulled or even burned look at this his nipples are on fire and this is that a hospital too

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.660
everything is just out to hurt those poor guy speaking of which this is the same guy who is from coach and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.229
Gargoyles and he actually has two roles than this he plays the mummy who sadly doesn't have much talking or expression

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.460
But he still does okay

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.220
And he also plays the guy who's dating the main kid's mom he doesn't like him very much despite him being very nice

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.490
and yeah

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.240
They're kind of doing like a Captain Hook thing aren't they were both the father or father to be and

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.109
supernatural character kind of represent that fear of what's coming forward

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.910
But then you see he gets used to the monster as he'll get used to the dad and yeah

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.810
You know what this actually kind of works

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.250
It's been done, but I think a lot of the stuff in this movie's been done

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.729
But they kind of playfully acknowledge it even when it's really stupid at the end where they have to fight off the phony gangsters

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.449
How do they do it they pretend like their eyes are gushing out of their heads?

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.269
And then they knock the person out and tie them up with intestines

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.539
I love this kind of stuff you would never see this in a Disney movie

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.679
This kind of just barely g-rated humour tickles me in just the right way

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.699
It's not overly dark and aggressive to a point where it becomes awkward

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.569
But it's just enough the downside is the second half does slowed down a little bit and some of the laughs go a little quiet

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.900
But I thought the whole thing was gonna be like that for a good. I don't know two-thirds of the movie

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.780
I was surprisingly kind of enjoying it okay, not loving it, but there was some laughs here in there. I don't know

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.919
I'm not gonna act like this is anything great, but for a little Disney Channel movie

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.269
I thought it actually had more to it than it needed if you're looking for that little kid

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.989
Halloween movie that goes a little further than it needs to with some memorable characters weird scenes and

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.760
Surprisingly funny lines. I say this is actually worth checking out

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.869
in the same way a kind of self-aware

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.759
B-movie is worth checking out take a look for yourself and see if it's worth getting wrapped up in
