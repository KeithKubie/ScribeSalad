00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:02.950
VICTORIA: Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.620
Thanks so much for
coming to this talk

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.810
by my wonderful friend James
who is also a first time author.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.250
I want to tell you three
quick things about James.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.080
The first is that James'
book is about the importance

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.720
of experience.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650
And I want to vouch for the
fact that this guy doesn't just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.940
talk the talk, he
walks the walk.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.250
James and I met 14 years--
ago almost to this day--

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.881
on an overnight bus going from
Delhi to Rishikesh in India.

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:35.630
For those of you who
don't know Rishikesh,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.046
it's supposed to be sort of
the yoga capital of the world,

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:40.820
the Beatles went there to
see the Maharishi Mahesh,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.450
Jerry's ashes are
there, et cetera.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.740
And I was, of course, there
to go and check myself

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.040
into an ashram to continue
to do the yoga that I

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.190
was in love with.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.590
And James was there to learn
about this thing called yoga

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.580
that he'd heard about but
didn't really know what it was.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.690
He said he was going to
be there for three days.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.790
And after we went
into this ashram,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.600
he sort of fell in
love with the Ashtanga,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.120
and the macrobiotic
diet, and the meditation,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.920
and the aura reading, and
even the homemade colonics,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.910
and basically,
decided to stay there

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.680
for 30 days with
me, which is where

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.050
we became such great friends.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.730
So this guy is the real deal.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.970
The second thing is that
when we were in India,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.020
James and I were
absolutely love struck.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.130
Not with each other.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.210
We actually both had
partners-- him in London

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.110
and me in the States, and we're
no longer with these people--

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.500
but we were so bored in
the ashram at night--

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.100
absolutely nothing goes
on in an ashram at night--

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.400
that we would write
these incredible love

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.849
letters to our
significant others,

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.390
and we would read
them to each other.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.920
That's how bored we were.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.920
And I can just tell you that he
is the most beautiful writer.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.910
So I'm so happy that 14 years
later, he has written a book.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.000
And the third
thing to tell you--

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.030
just because it will
endear him to you--

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.171
is that James is about to become
a father for the second time.

00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:58.420
He didn't know if he would
be able to make it out here

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.920
in time before his
wife gives birth.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.731
So I'm very happy
that he's here.

00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:02.355
Welcome, James.

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:10.849
JAMES WALLMAN:
Thank you, Victoria.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.390
That's pretty funny
because I haven't

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.247
heard that story for some time.

00:02:14.247 --> 00:02:16.330
Especially, the bit about
writing the love letters

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.240
and reading them to each other.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.100
Because I've actually found some
I never got around to sending.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.810
And they are-- you know those
really embarrassing letters

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.010
that you never sent
for good reason?

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.010
So I'm touched that you
say I was a good writer,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.050
but I think I wasn't back then.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.380
But anyway, I appreciate
that very much.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.220
It's great to be back
in Mountain View.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.040
And I say back because I
lived in Palo Alto in 1997.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.710
And I have a strong
connection to Mountain View--

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.900
a strong experiential
connection to Mountain View,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.300
actually-- because
when I was here,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.730
I learned how to scuba dive
with the Bayview Divers.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.350
Anyone learn to scuba
dive in Mountain View?

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.260
I have the card.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720
It's the card I've been using
on this trip to the States

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.056
as my ID.

00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:00.680
So every time I was
in New York before,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.410
and I was going to buildings
like the Hearst Building,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.590
the Conde Nast Building,
the Time &amp; Life Building,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.660
and they want to see ID.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.390
And I gave them the ID
of this scuba diving card

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.560
I have from when I
was in my early 20s--

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.833
I mean I look completely
different, obviously-- Anyway,

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:17.416
and that was-- I
checked this out-- it

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:18.540
was before Google started.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.040
It was a year before
Google started,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.425
so I was here first, all right.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.995
Thank you for
coming, first of all.

00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:28.134
I really appreciate it.

00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:29.800
For those of you that
don't have a copy,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.892
the book is called
"Stuffication."

00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:33.350
And what I'd like
to do is give you

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.900
an introduction to that,
where it came from for me.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.280
And the best place, I think, to
begin a story of "Stuffication"

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.500
in a talk like this,
is a place where

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.550
I think a lot of
great stories begin.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.450
In a time of war with
the young couple in love.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.560
So about 70 years ago--
on January 27, 1940--

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.690
war was raging in
some parts of Europe.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.509
But in London, it
was still quite.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.800
It was a quiet night in London.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.760
There was snow falling gently.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.280
And just out of a busy,
bustling, noisy dance

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.365
hall, a man by the
name of Jack, wearing

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:19.440
a dark suit, a white
shirt, and a Dickey bow tie

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.580
stepped outside with
his new bride, Pam.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.190
And he turned to Pam, and
he said to her, "Come on.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.580
Let's go home."

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.650
And they tramped through
snow to their first home.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.280
They had two rooms.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.830
They had a living room
and they had a bedroom.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
The kitchen and the
bathroom was shared

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.830
with the other people who
lived in the building.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.250
A few years later,
they had a son, Allen.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.990
And when Allen grew too big to
share the bedroom with them,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.800
they gave him the bedroom.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.670
So every night, after
Allen had gone to bed,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.350
they would make up one
of those camp beds.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.392
You know those camp beds?

00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:58.433
They would make up a camp
bed in the living room,

00:04:58.433 --> 00:04:59.560
and they would sleep there.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.240
And every morning, before
Allen left for his paper route,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.980
he would wake to the
sound of sizzling

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.300
and the smell of bacon,
and eggs, and sausages,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.470
and something that
English people used

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.910
to eat called fried bread.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.350
And Jack would get up
every morning, early,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.670
and make that for Allen.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.100
And he did that every
day until the day Allen

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.240
left for university-- for
Liverpool University-- in 1962.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.250
Allen was the first
person in his family

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.752
ever to go to university.

00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:32.710
He made the most of it.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.690
He played for the
university soccer team.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.350
Notice I said soccer.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.630
He saw bands that
were hugely famous,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.360
but he saw them before
they were famous.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.134
So of course, he saw the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:48.800
And if you ever meet
him, he'll tell you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.320
that within five
minutes of meeting him.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.460
And then he did what most
of us do after university.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.820
He settled down, he got a job,
he got married, he had kids,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.690
and I'm one of them.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.460
Allen is my father.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.210
Jack is my grandfather.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.090
This is my back story.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.520
Why am I telling you this?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.260
Because in the story of our
everyday, workaday family,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.800
you can see the story
of stuffication.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.990
In the story of our
very typical family,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.200
you can see the shift
in circumstances

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.800
from scarcity to abundance.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.680
And you can see the
change, as well,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.670
in terms of what that means for
our attitudes, our aspirations,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.130
and our values.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.050
You see my grandparents, Jack
and Pam, they were typical.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.210
They lived not so very
far from survival mode

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.510
as most people did back then.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.250
And as 99% of humans had always
done since the dawn of time.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.690
And my father was typical, too.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.820
He was a typical,
materialistic baby boomer.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.676
And as a typical,
materialistic baby boomer--

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.830
one of the key things he did was
that-- he measured his life--

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.780
in many ways-- in
material terms.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.970
Like the homes he lived
in and the cars he drove.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.320
And I remember them all.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.390
From in the '70s, kind of
boxy, sky blue Triumph Toledo.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.450
Anyone know what a
Triumph Toledo is?

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.550
But you can picture it.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.130
British built.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.920
It was OK.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.760
And in the '80s, he
moved on to much slicker,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.500
sportier, kind of curvier,
more imported cars.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.070
And he ended the decade
in a red Porsche 911.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.210
And he was typical,
too-- I think

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.890
for his time-- in
that he grew up

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.230
believing in the
counterintuitive idea,

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.330
we should gain ground in the
early 20th century, which

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.870
was at the very
heart of materialism.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.844
And was sometimes called
the American paradox.

00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:57.760
And that was the idea.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.010
That if we wanted to have
more, we had to spend more.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.060
A virtuous circle of materialism
that changed circumstances.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.300
Now do you remember
the last time

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.270
you called someone
materialistic?

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.460
Have you done that
in the last month?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.720
I ask people this, and
most people say nothing.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.990
Then, this one.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.420
Have you thought
someone's materialistic

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.560
in the last month?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.200
OK.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.620
And it's quite an insulting
thing to think isn't it right?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.910
You're kind of
putting someone down.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.400
And that makes sense today.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.289
But back then,
saying someone was

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.169
materialistic-- materialism--
wasn't such a bad idea.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.169
In fact, it made perfect
sense because it offered

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.390
my father, Alan, and the
rest of the baby boomers

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.140
the straightest route--
the straightest road--

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.670
from the scarcity they'd been
born into to the abundance

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.824
that they were
helping to create.

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.240
The abundance and
the better world

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.470
they were making for
themselves, for the society

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.600
around them, and
for their children.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.320
So I grew up the benefactor
of that to a large extent.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.260
And I also grew up
believing in that idea.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.750
And I grew up thinking I
would be just like my dad.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.520
I would be materialistic.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.960
But then something happened.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.930
And I think lots of
things have happened.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:26.290
And they've all added up to this
situation I call stuffication

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.910
So stuffication is
that feeling you

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:35.120
get when you open up the closet,
and it's full of clothes,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.840
but you can't find a
single thing to wear.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.990
It's that feeling you
get when you root around

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.540
inside a cupboard-- whatever
it might be-- to find the one

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.829
thing you need through a pile
of stuff that you don't use.

00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:50.370
Instead of thinking
of more-- the way

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.850
we used to-- as a
good thing, we now

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.450
think more means more
hassle, more to store,

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.000
more to manage,
more to think about.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.890
More isn't better
anymore, it's worse.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.740
I think overwhelmed,
suffocating from stuff,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.770
we're feeling stuffication.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.660
Why isn't materialism
working anymore?

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.840
Now, as with anything
as-- I think--

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.609
seismic of stuffication, there
are loads of different answers.

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:19.150
If you ask a different
expert, you'll

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.180
get a different emphasis.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.010
So a philosopher might say that
it's to do with status anxiety.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.780
We've had enough
of stuff because we

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.240
had enough of the
status anxiety that

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.730
comes with materialistic
consumerism.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.070
A psychologist like Oliver
James might say it's affluenza.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.390
We've had enough of
stuff because it's

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.930
giving us affluenza.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.950
Mass consumption is
leading to mass depression.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.830
And a political
scientist, might say it's

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.830
because of the stable society.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.880
We're just not so
bothered about stuff

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.940
anymore because
we know that we're

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.090
going to have a roof
over our heads tonight,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.650
and there's going to be
food on the table tomorrow.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.670
We're just not so bothered
about the basic materialistic

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.520
concerns anymore.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.870
We've climbed that first stage
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.010
An anthropologist
might say-- I'm

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.400
going to quote here
from the Center

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.150
on the Everyday Lives of people,
based in Los Angeles, which

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.610
has just completed the most
comprehensive report ever

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.300
conducted into how
people are living today.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:28.450
And they said-- that
we have more material

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.080
things than any
preceding society.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.560
They use the term "light-years
more possessions than any

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.990
preceding society
in human history."

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.950
That we're struggling
under material saturation,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.240
there we're coping with
extraordinary clutter,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.400
and that we're in the
middle of a clutter crisis.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.094
And a technologist
might-- I think-- smile

00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:49.010
at all of these ideas.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:53.650
Ya sure, status anxiety,
affluenza, the stable society,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.450
clutter crisis.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.170
This is all relevant as to
why we've had enough of stuff.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.120
But the real reason that we're
moving on from material things

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.620
is because we can.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.580
Why have a room full of
Encyclopedia Britannicas when

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.080
you can search for
the answer you're

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.600
looking for through-- as
a search angle-- Google,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.310
you can use.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.430
Worth a try, that joke, right?

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.260
That's why I'm a
writer, not a comedian.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.660
Anyway, but thanks.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.306
But why have a car, why
have a second car, when

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:27.000
you can use Zipcar
or you can use Uber?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.070
Why have a suitcase
full of books

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.820
when you go on holiday--
for those of you

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.702
that went on holiday
in the '70s and '80s--

00:12:32.702 --> 00:12:34.160
it was a real
challenge about which

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.743
books were you going
to take with you.

00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:40.309
But why do that when
you have a Kindle?

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:42.350
I think you know what it
looks like anyway right?

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.540
But that-- thousands of books--
why have a room full of books?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.710
I think all of these
reasons is partly

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.029
responsible for stuffication.

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:54.570
But if you think
about them-- I think

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.240
what's really interesting about
them is none of them are blips.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.740
None of them are
blips that are here

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.620
one year and likely
to be gone the next.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.100
I think they're all observable,
observed, long-term trends.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.480
And that's why I
think stuffication

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.520
is going to be the defining
problem of the 21st century.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.530
So how do you solve a
problem like stuffication?

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.780
Now my job-- the job of a
trend forecaster, not comedian

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.540
as we've already
established-- is fascinating.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.320
It gives me really
interesting insight,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.510
gives me a really
unique viewpoint,

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.510
and it opens me up
to a lot of ridicule.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.790
As Yogi Berra said, "It's
hard to make predictions,

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.969
particularly about the future.

00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:45.260
And the thing is, if you're
going to make a prediction,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.050
if you're going
to say something's

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.560
going to happen in the
future, at the very least,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.110
you'd better have a
decent methodology.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:56.980
So I don't look
into a crystal ball.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.050
And I don't read tea
leaves, and I've tried.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.700
Maybe in Rishikesh.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.950
And I don't breath in vapors
by the Oracle at Delphi.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.420
The method I use is
far less ancient,

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.760
but I think it's
far more robust.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.000
It's inspired by
something a futurist--

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.360
called William
Gibson-- once said,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.400
that "The future
is already here,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.020
it's just not very
evenly distributed. "

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.460
And it's informed by a way
of reading cultural change,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.410
which has been applied more than
5,000 times since it was first

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.870
codified by a sociologist
called Everett Rogers,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.064
Iowa State University in 1962.

00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:39.480
Some of you will
have heard of it.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.460
It's the diffusion
of innovations.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.290
And it's a way of reading
cultural change that works out

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.270
how ideas, innovations,
new ways of living,

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.430
working, cooking,
whatever it might be,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.326
spread from the innovators--
the few innovators

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:57.530
to the early adopters, the
early majority, late majority,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.970
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:05.200
So my job is to spot the
future here in the present.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.060
It's to identify the
innovators in the innovations,

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.170
the big ideas that are
going to catch on and spread

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:18.340
from these few people to
the many in the mainstream.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.220
So I've looked all around the
world looking for the answer,

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.480
looking to understand
this problem better

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.340
and to find an idea-- which
I think-- has the power,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.860
has the legs, has the ability
to move from these few

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.210
to these many.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.180
And as you can imagine, I've
run up many blind alleys.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.470
I've kind of come
to lots of dead ends

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.730
and all kinds of things that
I thought were the answer.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.620
Minimalism is a great example.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.392
But of all the things
I've looked at--

00:15:49.392 --> 00:15:50.850
and the book is,
to a large extent,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.616
a kind of process of me
going through this one,

00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:54.240
does this work?

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.290
This one, does it work?-- I've
come across one idea, which

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.640
I think is going to catch
on and become dominant.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.030
I call it experientialism.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:08.040
And the people who live
this way, experientialists.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.880
So the experientialists,
instead of looking for status,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.120
identity, happiness, and
meaning in material things--

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.490
like materialists
did-- experientialists

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.130
are finding status,
identity, happiness,

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:27.020
and meaning, and
experiences instead.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.220
Experientialism-- and I've
said it a lot of times--

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.240
I think can solve a
problem like stuffication.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.830
More importantly,
experientialism, I believe,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.510
will solve stuffication.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.580
And I say that because
firstly, it's better.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.680
It's just better
the materialism.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.130
Giving us status,
giving us identity,

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.305
giving us meaning in our
lives, and making us happy.

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:57.180
But more important than
that-- more important

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.042
than being better--
I've seen the signs.

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:01.000
I've seen the evidence.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.180
Even if it's still
unevenly distributed,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.369
that we are moving
away from materialism,

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.150
and the experientialism
is making the leap

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:17.250
from the innovative few to
the many in the mainstream.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.364
So first up,
there's the evidence

00:17:19.364 --> 00:17:21.680
that shows that our
attitudes are changing.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.520
There's a guy called
Ron Inglehart-- he's

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.849
a political scientist at
the University of Michigan--

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:32.110
and based on a hunch that
Ron had back in 1969,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.610
he started studying
our attitudes.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.710
And in 1970, he found
that 80% of people

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.840
were materialistic
in Western countries.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.680
Now-- in today's
world-- it's 50%.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.830
So you can see very clear,
there is long-term decline

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.330
in how materialistic we are.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.750
And I think where it's really
interesting is that, as well

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.300
as our attitudes changing,
there is now evidence

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.420
that our behavior is
changing, as well.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.850
There's a guy called Chris
Goodall-- he's a Cambridge

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.070
grad, he was a
McKinsey consultant,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.890
he taught economics at
Harvard for a time--

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.340
he has analyzed the material
flows-- the flow of materials--

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.040
through Western
economies, so looking

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.140
at the States and
the UK, for example.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.100
And he's discovered that we
are consuming less stuff.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.140
Less paper, concrete,
cars, steel, fertilizers,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.540
electricity.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.430
He's happy having
seen all this evidence

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.020
to conclude that we've reached
the point of peak stuff,

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.680
and that we're now
passing that point.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.800
Now besides those
there's technology.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.580
And I mean, technology in
terms of wearable tech.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.150
For example, the quantified
self movement, life logging,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.880
and social media.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.140
All of these things
make our lives

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.180
much more connected, much
more trackable, and much more

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.660
sharable.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.380
I imagine you're
aware of this, right?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.260
What's really interesting for me
about all these technologies--

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.380
in particular, I think
the social aspect of it,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.420
social media-- is
they're fundamentally

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:15.420
changing how we express our
identities and we get status.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.150
So go back to the 20th century.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.900
The best way to get status
and express your identity

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.510
in the 20th century,
was through the stuff

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.260
you owned-- handbag,
car, shoes, whatever

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.930
it might be-- not
from what you did.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.520
Because back then,
who knew that you'd

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.930
been to Utah or Tahoe
skiing for the weekend?

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.890
Who knew you'd been to
Marrakech on your vacation?

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.380
Who knew you'd been to a
really great talk from a trend

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.071
forecaster at lunch time?

00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:48.570
Thank you for staying
with me there.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.260
I appreciate that.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.692
My wife says that was a
funny joke, but they you go.

00:19:54.692 --> 00:19:56.150
But the thing is,
in today's world,

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.810
with all your followers on
Twitter, Instagram, Google+,

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:05.140
and Facebook-- your friends,
fans, followers-- they do.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.350
So now if you take a
picture from the chair

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.300
lift in Squaw
Valley or Park City,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.250
or if you take a picture of the
sun setting behind the Atlas

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.260
mountains from the rooftop
of your riad in Marrakech,

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.400
or you even tweet a
quote from something

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.810
you heard a talk at lunch time.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.585
And this matters.

00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:26.210
This matters because
it matters for how

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.840
we express our identities
and we get our status.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.310
And that matters for people
because status and identity

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.730
matters, right?

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.430
And social media
and this technology

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.630
matters for the rise
of experientialism

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.400
because this isn't the
innovative few anymore.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.290
There are hundreds of millions
of people using Instagram,

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.250
Twitter, and Google+.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.210
There's 1.2 billion
people on Facebook--

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.780
that's as many people as are
in the Catholic Church-- who

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.440
are expressing their identities
and getting their status,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.120
not from what they have,
but from what they do.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.400
And this matters-- I
believe-- for you, for me,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.810
and for all of us.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.060
The question is, I guess, how?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.420
About 12 years ago--
on January 27, 2002--

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.450
my father brought
my grandparents--

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:23.030
Jack and Pam-- over for
lunch to my new apartment.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.270
It was my first home.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.280
It was in Brixton,
in south London

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.020
and it had three bedrooms.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.610
I had a living room, I had
a separate dining room,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.390
a separate kitchen, had this
great, big, west facing garden.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.740
It was awesome for parties.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.020
It was a great first home.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.228
And they come over for lunch.

00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:43.050
And I had a job in
advertising at the time.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.750
I think I was a bit
gung-ho, talking

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.110
quite big about how successful
I was and was going to be.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.370
And just before they
left, my grandfather

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.840
handed me an envelope.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.030
And just after they left, I
opened it, as you can imagine.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.470
And it had a note in it.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:04.580
And it had on it 27/1/2002-- he
wrote the date the British way

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:11.096
with the day and then the
month-- "On this day in 1940,

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:14.820
Nana and I tramped through
snow to our first home.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.850
Memories live
longer than dreams.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.010
Good luck."

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.380
A little bit later-- probably 20
to 25 minutes later-- my father

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.460
was just driving back starting
to cross the river Thames--

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.690
it was a black 5 Series
BMW, if you're keep up

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:36.759
with the cars of my father--
and my grandfather choked.

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:38.300
And he kind of
collapsed in his seat.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.930
My father obviously stopped.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.760
And then he drove
as fast as he could.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.930
He jumped lights.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.360
He actually got pulled over
and got a police escort.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.360
He did everything he could
to get my grandfather

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.530
to a hospital as
quickly as possible.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.680
He did what he could, but my
grandfather died that day.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.160
And obviously, I
thought about the note

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.850
that he gave me quite
a lot since then.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.380
First of all, did
he know that he

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.900
was going to die that day
when he gave me that note?

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:21.000
And what did he mean by memories
live longer than dreams?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.130
Did he mean that the past is
not as good as the future?

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:32.320
Or did he mean-- as I've come
to believe-- that the material

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.400
dreams are all well
and good, but life

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.580
is made of up memories,
which come from experiences?

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.140
Now whatever he meant, it
was quite a passing shot.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.000
In those final
moments, to address

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.310
the most important
question a person can ask.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.910
The question that Aristotle
asked in the Nicomachean

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.870
Ethics, almost 2 and
1/2 thousand years ago.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.370
The question every one of us
should ask-- as individuals,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.750
as parents, as
influential people

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.960
who market stuff and change the
world, being citizens or where

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.720
we work, whatever it might be.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.320
And the question is-- I think
you know the question, right?

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.570
How should we live
in order to be happy?

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.320
And in the 20th century,
I think the answer

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.510
to that, in many
ways, was clear.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.080
You should be
materialistic because that

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.570
was creating abundance
for everybody.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.680
And I think in the 21st
century, when our problem isn't

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.780
scarcity, our problem is
abundance-- I think so much

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.560
abundance that there's time
of stuffication-- I think

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.890
that quite the answer has
fundamentally changed.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.120
So the story of
stuffication ends with you.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.480
What are you going to do about
the most pressing problem

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.520
of our time?

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:09.100
There are 3 things you can do
to try out experientialism.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.900
Three steps.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.630
First step, destufficate.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.954
Step two, don't restufficate.

00:25:15.954 --> 00:25:17.870
Once you've gone through
the bother of getting

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.078
rid of all that stuff you
don't wear, you don't need,

00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:21.740
you don't use.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.620
And it's so easy to
go out when you've

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.930
created space in your
closet on your shelf,

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.810
because we've been trained
to be consumers, to do that.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.700
But it's really important
not to go out and buy

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.530
more stuff you don't need,
you don't use, you don't wear.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.192
But for me, step
3 is the best bet.

00:25:38.192 --> 00:25:39.900
Because 1 and 2 are
just hygiene factors.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.108
They're just starting points.

00:25:41.108 --> 00:25:43.300
Step 3 is a game.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.450
And it's a game I like to think
of as the Brewster's Millions

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.260
game.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.170
Some of you probably won't
have read the 1902 novel

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.060
or seen the 1985 movie.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.030
Anyone got no idea what
Brewsters Millions is?

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:57.582
All right.

00:25:57.582 --> 00:25:58.290
Oh, a few of you.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.610
OK.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:05.226
It only got 6.4 out of 10 on
IMDB, which is a crying shame

00:26:05.226 --> 00:26:05.850
and it's wrong.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.780
It's a great movie.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.660
Anyway.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.980
So Brewster's
Millions, the movie,

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.960
is about this guy who has to
spend $30 million in a month

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.290
and have nothing physical,
tangible to show for it.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.870
Now to play the
game properly, you

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.550
don't have to spend $30 million
in a month, unless you have it,

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.670
that's obviously your choice.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.480
But what you do have to do--
to play the game properly

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.370
and to really experience
the benefits-- is

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.690
to spend the same
amount of money

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.630
that you'd spend
in a normal month,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.200
but have nothing
physical, tangible

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.620
to show for it at the end.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.140
And that's all you have to do
to join the experientialists.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:55.610
And if you do that-- I promise
you-- you'll have more stories,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:59.370
you'll have more status,
you'll be happier,

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.400
life will feel like it
has a lot more meaning.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.460
But more than that, I think
you'll be one of the pioneers.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.770
I think you'll be one
of the pioneers leading

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.670
the rest of society out of
the storm of stuffication

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.020
on the straightest, most
positive, most aspirational,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.340
most fun route to
a better world.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.810
I think you'll be one
of the pioneers leading

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.860
the rest of America,
the rest of the West,

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.230
the rest of the world from
the old age of materialism

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:33.340
to this new era of
experientialism.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.340
And more than that
even, I think you'll

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.010
understand what my
grandfather, Jack, meant

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.465
that memories live
longer than dreams.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:44.540
Thank you.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.810
Questions, if anyone has any.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.760
AUDIENCE: So if we take this to
the end, and everybody becomes

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.110
destuffified, and
we are so good at it

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:08.460
that everybody around the
world becomes destuffified--

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.790
JAMES WALLMAN: Destufficated,
but I like your version.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.160
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.276
So then what happens to Google?

00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:15.940
JAMES WALLMAN: Great
question, I think.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:16.440
OK.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.820
So I'm just going to
repeat that back to you.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:24.260
If everyone becomes
destuffified,

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.354
what happens to Google?

00:28:25.354 --> 00:28:26.770
Can you be a little
more specific?

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.186
I think I know
what you're saying.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.160
If you take it to
its purest end,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.840
like we need to go
to the grocery store.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.275
We need stuff, certain stuff.

00:28:40.192 --> 00:28:42.150
I guess what I'm confused
about in implementing

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:46.110
this in my own life is,
what do you spend money

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:49.810
on-- it's kind of a riddle--
what do you spend money

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.255
on and have nothing
to show for it?

00:28:52.255 --> 00:28:53.130
You know what I mean?

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:53.880
JAMES WALLMAN: OK.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.940
That's a great question.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.310
So how do you
spend money and not

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.810
end up with
something at the end?

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.285
When did you last go holiday?

00:29:03.285 --> 00:29:04.590
AUDIENCE: Friday.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.820
JAMES WALLMAN: Oh, great.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.670
Friday.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.040
Please give the man a mic.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.706
Where did you go?

00:29:10.706 --> 00:29:12.560
AUDIENCE: I went and
bought a new car.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.260
JAMES WALLMAN: OK.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.500
Can I-- just to get a
little bit of clarity here,

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.920
that's not playing the game.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.280
A holiday is not buying a car.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.280
You've actually picked up on
two very brilliant examples

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.780
of different purchases.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.590
I have a car and
I take holidays.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.300
I would conceive one of
those-- don't get me wrong,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.550
it gives me experiences--
but one is quite a material

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.592
purchase.

00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:39.050
The thing about
not having anything

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.719
at the end of it, a great
example is a holiday.

00:29:41.719 --> 00:29:43.760
That's why I wanted to
follow it down that route.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.510
I didn't know you were
going to play nasty.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:52.080
So let's say you go
skiing for a week.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.662
What do you have,
physically, at the end of it?

00:29:54.662 --> 00:29:56.620
You might have some
pictures on your telephone,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.550
but, really what you've
had, is a great time.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.860
Or let's say you go
on a stag party, which

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.400
is a-- what do you
call it over here?

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.450
Bachelor Party.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.810
You don't take any
pictures, right?

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.030
But you have an amazing time.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.735
It gives you [INAUDIBLE] and
identity are quite closely

00:30:13.735 --> 00:30:16.150
connected, gives
you real identity,

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.851
it gives you, hopefully,
some happiness.

00:30:17.851 --> 00:30:20.100
You've had a good time, if
you can remember any of it.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.900
And it gives life
a sense of meaning.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.530
But you don't come back from
it with a whole bunch of stuff,

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.030
do you?

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.350
Hopefully, you've lost stuff.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.690
Anyway, so just to
be really clear.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.130
So in terms of what I
mean by experiences,

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.970
is that which is something
where you're doing something

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.250
rather than having something.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.100
That's the kind of
classic distinction.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.710
There's two psychologists--
called [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.760
and Tom Gilovich-- and they had
a paper they published in 2003

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.920
called, "To Do or To Have?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.400
That Is the Question."

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.230
And it was-- it is--
considered to be

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:59.200
the kind of classic
moment in research.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.250
To find, for the first
time, whether material goods

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.310
or experiential goods gave
people more happiness.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.810
And they proved,
for the first time,

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.500
that experiential goods
gave people more happiness.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.910
But to begin that
piece of research,

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.524
they started by saying,
what's a material good?

00:31:13.524 --> 00:31:14.690
What's an experiential good?

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.800
Because for some people, a TV is
experiential, and some people,

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.000
it's material.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.710
Just to be really clear,
this is not anti-consumerist,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.170
it's not anti-capitalists,
it's not even anti stuff.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.470
It's totally pro
consumers, pro capitalist,

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.760
and it's not anti stuff.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.710
It's having stuff.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:35.850
We bought a bread maker
a couple of weeks ago.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.710
Now that has got the potential
to be a waste of money.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.750
But my wife insists
that we will use it--

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.610
and we fully intend
to-- in which case,

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.320
it's got use, right?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.870
So it's not anti
having stuff, it's

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.299
anti having too much stuff.

00:31:49.299 --> 00:31:50.590
Does that answer your question?

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.250
AUDIENCE: That does.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:51.770
Yeah.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.360
I now know how to implement
your three principles.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.030
JAMES WALLMAN: Great.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.440
Thank you.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:54.939
Good.

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:55.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.460
I think you make some
very interesting points.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.880
I mean, I can relate to what
you say in terms of my parents

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.420
lived a simpler life than me.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.340
My grandparents
lived a simpler life.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.830
And they were happier.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.035
They were more social.

00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:09.410
They interacted
with more people.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.770
They had fewer things.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.330
Another trend I've
seen in my generation

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.800
is not just materialism,
but it's also boredom.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.820
People are just bored.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.220
If we have so many things to do.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.680
We have more to do,
we are always bored.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.750
I've never heard that word
from my previous generations.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.797
So do you see a correlation
between the two?

00:32:30.797 --> 00:32:32.380
JAMES WALLMAN: That's
a great question

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:36.705
that no one has asked me in
any presentation I've given.

00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:39.080
So you-- can I just say back
to you-- saying there are so

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.910
many things to do, we're bored.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.220
AUDIENCE: People get
bored with their job.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.100
They have more opportunity,
but every type of person

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.940
you talk to, their like,
I'm so bored with my job.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.740
Whereas, if I look at my uncle--
who worked at the same place

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.390
for 30 years-- he never
used the term bored.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.694
They were just happy
doing what they did.

00:32:57.694 --> 00:33:01.140
JAMES WALLMAN: I'd really like
to give a good answer generally

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.640
but I don't know
if I have an answer

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.330
because I think having loads of
possibilities-- I mean, boredom

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.862
is your own
responsibility, right?

00:33:08.862 --> 00:33:10.820
It comes to the weekend
and you've got a choice

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.740
of-- especially where
you guys live, right?--

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.140
there's so many outdoor
activities you can do.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.252
Or you can go to San Francisco.

00:33:19.252 --> 00:33:20.710
I mean, the world's,
kind of, here.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.680
There's so many
things we can do now.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.520
I think being bored is terrible.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.144
And if you're bored of your job,
you should do a different job.

00:33:27.144 --> 00:33:29.550
I, personally, am
infused by my job.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.960
And it's been my
experience of the people

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.370
that I-- I was in New
York for a few days,

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.480
I've now been here in
California for a few days,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.410
and everyone-- I've talked to
seems to be really fired up.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.750
We went to a great
Super Bowl party

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.650
and no one seemed bored at all.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:51.400
I don't know, is this
just a general malaise?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:51.900
OK.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.770
Because I would have thought,
if you've got more things to do,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.700
it's just a question
of having-- there

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.660
are challenges with attention.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.889
Absolutely no doubt about it.

00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:00.930
There are challenges with
sticking with something

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.300
long enough to enjoy it.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.790
But I don't know if I can
answer that better than that.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.639
AUDIENCE: It's probably related
to lack of attention span.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.820
Over time, we've
lost attention span

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.389
with so many things around us.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.750
Kind of like you said,
we open our closet,

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.198
but we don't like anything.

00:34:18.198 --> 00:34:20.239
And it's like, what is it
that we're looking for?

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.073
We have lost that,
to some extent.

00:34:23.073 --> 00:34:24.489
JAMES WALLMAN:
Well you can become

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:25.892
a kind of zombie consumer.

00:34:25.892 --> 00:34:27.350
You just buy more
stuff because you

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.120
think it's going
to solve problems.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.300
You're going to turn
to retail therapy.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.150
But that's the truth
about retail therapy,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.650
in terms of buying stuff, it
won't make you any happier.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.960
But if you buy an
experiential good,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.949
like going on a rock
climbing course,

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.250
you'll be so scared you
won't be able to be bored.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.449
So if you're bored, go
rock climbing, or skiing,

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:47.159
or surfing.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.125
That's frightening, too.

00:34:49.125 --> 00:34:52.530
AUDIENCE: What's different
with social media

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:59.920
now replacing some of the
materialistic aspects of that

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.640
is different from coming
back with a bunch of slides

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.180
or coming back with some videos
that I took on my camcorder?

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.430
JAMES WALLMAN: Great question.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.930
Thank you.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.670
I think this comes to the heart
why social media is important.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.599
If you-- I'm going to guess
you're in your 20s, right?

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:17.640
AUDIENCE: Just left them.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.130
JAMES WALLMAN: OK.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.550
So if you went on holiday in
the '90s, or your friends--

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.500
you ever remember going to a
friend's house in the '90s,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.572
and they-- would pull
out their holiday snaps.

00:35:28.572 --> 00:35:30.780
And there was that that
awful moment where you think,

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.500
Oh, God.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.320
And they'd show you a
picture Jean at the Acropolis

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.180
and then Jean eats souvlaki and
then Jean doing something else.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.480
How painfully dull
was that, right?

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.230
And it took them-- if
you think about it--

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.720
how long did it
take them to share

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.685
their holiday with people?

00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:50.060
Because they would have had
to have, not just you around,

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.250
all their other friends.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.235
So let's say it's
the '90s, and you

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:56.140
go on a really
incredible holiday.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.802
Let's say you go to Greece, and
you're really excited about it,

00:35:57.802 --> 00:35:59.330
and you go see the
ruins, et cetera.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:01.750
And you want to tell
100 of your best friends

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.560
about your holiday.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.137
And let's say-- it's hard
to do it at a party--

00:36:06.137 --> 00:36:08.470
so you need to see them at
dinner or at personal drinks,

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.460
right?

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.230
So let's say you can
manage 6 people at a time.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.810
Stay with me here for the math.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.520
So you've got to have 10,
15 different arrangements

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.100
to see people.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.440
That takes a long time-- takes
like a couple of months--

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.920
to share with people
your experiences.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.450
Whereas today, you could
post it on Facebook,

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.460
and you've got your
500, 600 friends that

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.130
are right there that can see it.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:36.540
So what social media has done
has catalyzed that opportunity

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.362
to share what you're doing.

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:39.820
So if you'd just
run a Tough Mudder

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.690
course-- I think this is one of
the reasons why Tough Mudder is

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.490
increasing so quickly--
you can instantly

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.950
share that with people.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.510
And that has a real impact
on how you see yourself.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:56.050
It has a real impact on how you
present yourselves to others.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.820
So that's what social
media has done.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.900
I constantly hear
about Facebook,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.410
it'll be something else next.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.740
It doesn't matter which platform
it is that people are using.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.190
We now are used to the
idea of social media.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.102
It will stay with us.

00:37:11.102 --> 00:37:13.060
Now that means there's
been a fundamental shift

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.690
from having things
to doing things

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.820
in terms of expressing
our identities.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.209
AUDIENCE: So I'm a Millennial,
a group about whom our consumer

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:23.750
behavior as much
has been speculated.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.540
We are the group least likely
to buy a car now, least

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.840
likely to buy a house.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.305
And I always get a
little weary when

00:37:30.305 --> 00:37:31.680
I hear about how
people are like,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.600
oh, your generation just values
Instagram and social media

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.500
and you like experiences more
than things because you just

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.520
like sharing your every
thought on Facebook.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.610
Mostly, it's actually
because I think

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.600
were less likely to buy cars
because-- like me instead--

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.350
you're spending the equivalent
of a brand new BMW S

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.030
series on your education.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.850
And so it's not so much that
I like Instagraming photos

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.190
from my bike ride more, as I
feel like I have actually less

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:00.100
money to spend on stuff.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.050
And so I'm wondering what
the recession you feel

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.387
might play into this movement
away from stuff, how you think

00:38:07.387 --> 00:38:09.970
it's maybe going to be different
for people for my generation,

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.810
for whom, things are
just going to become

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.740
less part of the picture
because of the rising

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.720
cost of other things, like
healthcare, like education.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.590
And whether or
not you think then

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.270
that some of your advice on how
you would implement those three

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:25.510
steps would be different.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.050
JAMES WALLMAN: Good questions.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.450
I think you've asked me
quite a lot of things there.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:29.990
I'm going to try
to say back to you.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.430
No, it's fine.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.640
It's really interesting.
, Especially since you are

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.610
a Millennial, it's very easy
for me stand here and say,

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.030
Millennial's are doing this,
but you are a Millennial.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.050
So you're asking me,
how should a Millennial

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.090
implement those three steps?

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:49.900
That was your final part, but
before that you were saying,

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.730
what do I think about education?

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.990
Where does education
fit into this?

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.657
And the economy.

00:38:54.657 --> 00:38:56.198
Education, economy,
and how does that

00:38:56.198 --> 00:38:58.315
affect Millennials and
this shift from materialism

00:38:58.315 --> 00:38:59.320
to experientialism.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.056
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm wondering
how you see the recession

00:39:03.056 --> 00:39:05.680
and rising costs of education is
factoring into people's choice

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.309
not to buy things.

00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:08.350
JAMES WALLMAN: All right.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:12.580
So the economy is a
really complicated one--

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.322
to be frank with you--
because it's certainly

00:39:15.322 --> 00:39:17.030
something I would
never try and forecast.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.590
Because there's so much.

00:39:21.722 --> 00:39:23.180
In terms of how it
affects people--

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.940
I think is really
interesting because-- there's

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.850
a particular time of your life
and if there is a recession--

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.000
or there's a lack of money in
your family around that time--

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.060
you become much
more materialistic

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.290
than other people.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.915
So this kind of
broad brush approach,

00:39:36.915 --> 00:39:39.290
that the boomers were this,
and the Millennials are this,

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:43.100
and Gen X are like this,
it's quite broad brush

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.560
over-- generalizations.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.850
And there will be different
people within that.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.470
My brother and I
are two years apart,

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.680
and he is far more
materialistic than me.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.585
Because not long after my
father having that Porsche,

00:39:52.585 --> 00:39:53.662
his company disappeared.

00:39:53.662 --> 00:39:55.370
And therefore, all
the money did as well.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.810
Therefore, my brother went
through a crucial period

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.340
where we had no money.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.740
And therefore, he's much
more materialistic than I am.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.789
So the economy will affect
this is an interesting way.

00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:06.330
And some people will
feel less stable

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.600
and therefore, become
more materialistic.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.250
But we've also had
recessions before.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.045
That kind of comes and goes.

00:40:13.045 --> 00:40:14.420
I don't know if
you Nate Silver's

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.570
"The Signal and the Noise" but
if you consider how forecasting

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.990
works, and the way
that trends work,

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.350
you may consider the idea
that 80% of people that

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.410
were materialistic,
and now it's 50%.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.120
Within that time, it
will go down a bit.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.280
So I think there's
still a long term trend.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.810
In terms of
education, I would say

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:36.700
education is a great example
of an experiential good.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.590
It's not tangible.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.010
I don't know what your
educational situation is,

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:45.190
but for those of us that have
a degree of the first level,

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:50.840
the next level, or a doctorate,
how many of us have the--

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.710
do you get
certificates over here?

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.990
Do you keep them?

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.640
I have no idea where
my certificates are.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.390
I don't think my
mom has them even.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.800
It's very much an
experiential good.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.970
It's not a material good.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.860
It's not a kind of solid thing.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.770
And as a Millennial, in
terms of those three ideas,

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.210
I don't actually think it
makes a difference what age

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.050
or who you are.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:19.580
The simple aspect of it is,
if you want to be happier--

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.926
And the research is fascinating.

00:41:20.926 --> 00:41:22.800
If you look at the
research that experiential

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.716
versus material goods.

00:41:23.716 --> 00:41:25.690
There's one great example.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.740
People are happier, if they
talk about experiences.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.560
And we enjoy listening
to people that

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.400
talk about experiences more.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.220
So on that basis, if
you've got a choice,

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.050
you're feeling bored
on a Saturday morning,

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:40.430
go spend your money and
time doing an experience.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.560
You'll be happier because
you'll be doing it.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.150
You'll be happier because when
you talk to people about it,

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.219
you'll be happier.

00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:48.010
And you'll have more
friends because people

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.810
will want to listen to you more.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.920
So an experiential good
is so much more positive.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.245
The other aspects about a
experiential good-- as opposed

00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:56.828
a material good--
have you ever bought

00:41:56.828 --> 00:41:59.790
a pair of shoes that squeak
when you walk in them?

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.610
Or those trousers
that seem to swish?

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:02.790
Or a coat.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.240
What do you do with those
shoes, or those things?

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.880
You wear them but
they annoy you.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.060
You never want to wear them.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.090
Eventually, you throw them
away or do you just squeak?

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.181
Maybe you do.

00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:14.680
The thing about a material good,
if you buy a material good,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.180
and it's not very good, there's
nothing you can do about it.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.740
You bought a bad good.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.720
That's it.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.990
If you have an experience
that goes wrong.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.459
The bus trip
across-- I was going

00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:26.250
to say a bus trip across
India [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.800
but since that was
a fun bus trip.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.275
But the bus trip across
India-- or Peru, or Columbia,

00:42:31.275 --> 00:42:34.684
or Thailand where
it all goes wrong.

00:42:34.684 --> 00:42:36.100
Have you all been
on one of those?

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.400
The person next to you was sick,
or some other unpleasant thing

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.530
was happening, the
windows wouldn't shut

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.730
or they wouldn't open,
it was too hot, too

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.110
cold, you were sick.

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:45.860
It all went wrong.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.600
It was supposed to take
2 hours, it took 3 days.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.710
Have you all been
one of those trips?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.310
And how bad was it at the time?

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:55.760
And how amazing is it now?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.450
And that's the funny
thing about experiences.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.870
If you buy an experience,
and it's really bad,

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.970
it's actually brilliant.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.940
So my advice to you would be
shift from material things

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.652
to experiences.

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:10.610
It has a lot of other
knock on effects as well.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.070
The environment, for example.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.562
But yeah, those are reasons.

00:43:14.562 --> 00:43:16.020
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering how you not

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.664
get stufficated by the
stuff of experience.

00:43:18.664 --> 00:43:20.830
So for example, if you go
skiing, you have the skis.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.399
You might have the scuba gear.

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:23.440
You have the bread maker.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.196
You have all that stuff, right?

00:43:25.196 --> 00:43:26.570
Maybe you go to
Thailand, and you

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.560
buy that beautiful painting,
but you went to Peru,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.893
and you bought this other thing.

00:43:29.893 --> 00:43:31.800
All of a sudden, your
house is full of stuff,

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.554
but it's all related
to experience.

00:43:33.554 --> 00:43:34.970
So how do you not
get stufficated?

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:36.859
JAMES WALLMAN: That
is a great question.

00:43:36.859 --> 00:43:38.650
It's funny, there's a
bit in the book where

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.770
I, kind of, really take that on.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.559
There's a guy in the
book called Ben Howe.

00:43:43.559 --> 00:43:44.350
He's an Australian.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.210
If you go to his house in
Adelaide in South Australia,

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:49.610
he's got a really regular house.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.879
If anything, it's not messy,
but it's not completed.

00:43:53.879 --> 00:43:55.670
You know, you walk into
your friend's house

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.010
and sometimes think, how
long have you lived here?

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.350
And you think
they've been a month,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.558
but they've been there years.

00:43:59.558 --> 00:44:02.110
It's kinda that.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.320
But you go to the garage,
and you put up the, kind of,

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.016
rickety door, it's
full of stuff.

00:44:08.016 --> 00:44:10.640
He's got his motorbike in there,
he's got his kite surfing kit,

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.223
he's got his wind surfing kit,
he's got his rock climbing kit,

00:44:13.223 --> 00:44:14.860
he's got his skiing kit.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.230
I'm not anti stuff.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.700
The message of stuffication
is not anti stuff,

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.390
it's anti too much stuff.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.550
It's anti focus on stuff.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.800
I wish I mentioned the bread
maker because that really

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.380
is stuff.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.800
But anyway, the smell of fresh
bread, it's a lovely thing.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:33.220
But if you want to ski, you
have to have things to do that.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.662
At the same time,
a walk in the park

00:44:35.662 --> 00:44:38.120
is an experience you can have
and don't need a lot of stuff

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.870
apart from feet.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.360
And if you look at statistics,
if you live near a park,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.420
you will be happier.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.070
It's just one of those facts.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.080
So and you mentioned going to
Peru and buying the painting,

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.972
you don't have to
buy that painting.

00:44:50.972 --> 00:44:53.182
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:53.182 --> 00:44:56.870
JAMES WALLMAN: Well I've been
to Peru, I have no paintings.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.640
[INAUDIBLE] No
paintings from Peru.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.940
I have a couple of paintings.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:04.730
But I remember it really
well-- I heard a howler monkey,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:08.310
for example-- and this
was certainly in an era

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.830
before I had a telephone
that could record sounds--

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:15.130
but I can remember the sound
of that surreal howler monkey

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.024
to this day.

00:45:17.024 --> 00:45:18.690
I hadn't talked about
that howler monkey

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.870
for about a decade, so thank you
for bringing that back to me.

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:24.410
But you don't need to have
stuff to have an experience.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.534
Although, the two
sometimes come together.

00:45:27.534 --> 00:45:29.450
AUDIENCE: Could there
be too many experiences?

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:32.680
To the point where
the value of them

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.820
is lessened because you're
doing so many things?

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.702
I think my life has
shifted in that way.

00:45:36.702 --> 00:45:39.160
I don't have a car, I've lived
in so many different places,

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.600
so I could always purge.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.720
And I'm always Tahoe
or Europe or whatever.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.330
But maybe you're searching
for something big,

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:48.890
like bigger the next time.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:51.649
Could it dull what's important
and what makes you happy?

00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:52.690
JAMES WALLMAN: Thank you.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.010
It's a really good
question as well.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.260
And its really interesting
talking to people that move

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:56.990
country a lot.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:00.410
They get this so quickly
because they do the country move

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.820
purge all the time.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.370
And by definition of moving
from one country to another,

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.000
they're appreciating
the experience

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.610
of going to another country.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.859
They tend to be more interested
in this kind of thing.

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.630
And I've spent a couple ski
seasons in the mountains.

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:18.160
At the end of five months
of being at a ski resort--

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.740
I have to be honest-- it sort
of loses some of its fizz,

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.400
compared to right
at the beginning.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:29.980
And for someone who's
got so many experiences,

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.260
that your signs get
dulled by experiences,

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.310
that is a great problem to have.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:35.450
Let's be really clear here.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:40.010
Stuffication is a
fantastic problem to have.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.940
Scarcity-- not having enough--
is a horrible problem to have,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.917
actually.

00:46:44.917 --> 00:46:47.000
And I'm not saying this
for everyone in the world.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.630
This is for rich,
Western countries.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.360
Other countries don't
have nearly the abundance

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.619
that we have per capita,
but as a whole country.

00:46:56.619 --> 00:46:58.410
So stuffication is a
great problem to have.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:03.300
If you get to the point where
you've done wind walking,

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:08.180
you've flown in helicopters,
you've been skiing in Kashmir,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.870
you've spent time with monkeys,
whatever it might be, right?

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.995
If you've got to the point
where you're stufficated

00:47:12.995 --> 00:47:16.750
with experience, are you saying
you're at that point now?

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.880
Because I'd say that is an
amazing problem to have.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.140
The thing is as well
here, is that there's

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.960
an element of the material
versus the experiential choice,

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.490
being a first level
heuristic-- a kind

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:37.360
of simple way of making the
right choice-- because one

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.320
of the key things about this
actually is, is it extrinsic

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.640
or is it intrinsic?

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.900
In terms of how you
make the decision.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.250
So if you buy material
good for yourself--

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.960
So I'm not trying to show off
to you about my break maker.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.970
I really mean that-- I'm buying
the bread maker because we

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.580
discussed it and
we think we will

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.154
enjoy having that experience.

00:47:58.154 --> 00:48:00.070
And fresh bread is really
expensive in London,

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:01.769
by the way.

00:48:01.769 --> 00:48:03.560
I don't want to fixate
on this bread maker.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.110
But we the decision for us.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:08.170
We're not doing as an extrinsic
thing to say, hey, look at us,

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:09.796
we bought a bread maker.

00:48:09.796 --> 00:48:11.670
And it can be the with
same with experiences.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.290
You know those
people who will go

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.310
to the place to go on holiday.

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.632
They'll read a magazine and
go that's the place I have

00:48:17.632 --> 00:48:19.090
to go on holiday
because then I can

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.704
tell people I've been there.

00:48:20.704 --> 00:48:21.620
You know these people?

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.670
You all have friends like
that, or acquaintances?

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.930
You don't get as
much pleasure if you

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.790
buy that experiential good
for an extrinsic reason,

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.070
than if you buy it for
an intrinsic reason.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:37.100
But-- and this is why I like
the distinction between material

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.720
and experiential
decisions-- even if you

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.730
buy that experiential good
to show off to other people--

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:47.690
to tell people who you are other
than doing it for yourself--

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:49.820
you'll still be
doing that thing.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.210
Let's say you
decided that you have

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.410
to ski in Squaw Valley--
for the sake of argument--

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:55.650
now there's snow
there, you've decided

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.858
that you have to do that so
you can tell your friends

00:48:57.858 --> 00:48:58.850
you've done it.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.440
You'll still be skiing
in Squaw Valley.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.540
Do you see what I mean?

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.609
So that's why I think
that distinction works.

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:07.150
But if you get to that point
the stufficate with experiences,

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.590
let's definitely talk.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:12.250
AUDIENCE: Isn't the risk
that we are replacing

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.320
one problem with just another?

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:20.280
With stuffing our lives with
experiences and actually,

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.270
our time is much more limited
than this pace we have.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:30.500
So is it a better way to
live your life actually,

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.600
or should we actually look
for even another answer.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.210
Make time to think and not
just to get our experiences

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.229
going for holidays, new
restaurants, and so on.

00:49:43.229 --> 00:49:45.020
JAMES WALLMAN: It's a
really good question.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.290
Thank you.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.600
Often when I'm
explaining this-- and I

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.460
give a talk on this-- I tend to
talk about things that you do,

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.290
actively do.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.510
Because probably, it's
easier to visualize,

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.770
and it makes it a bit more
interesting to listen to.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:05.090
But sitting, thinking
is an experience,

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:06.570
as far as I'm concerned.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.700
And I don't think
that we're replacing

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.069
one problem with another.

00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:13.360
I think we're replacing one
problem with something that

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.670
is exponentially better.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.620
And I agree with you that
we only have so much time.

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.490
Experiences take time.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.600
But that's life.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.389
And the choice of
experiences that you do

00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:28.555
are the choice of what you
do with your time, that's

00:50:28.555 --> 00:50:29.971
what you do with
your life, right?

00:50:29.971 --> 00:50:35.860
As opposed to you're saying that
there's more space for stuff

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.590
and therefore, we should
spend money on stuff

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.200
because we've got lots of space.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.650
If you look at demographics and
the urbanization of the world,

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:45.754
we have less space.

00:50:45.754 --> 00:50:48.170
There's seven billion people
now, it might be nine billion

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.200
by 2050.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.280
More people living in
cities, less space.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.203
So I think we have
less space, but I

00:50:55.203 --> 00:50:59.159
think the most important part
of your question was about time.

00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:00.700
The other thing
about experientialism

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.500
is a focus on what
you do with your time.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.760
It's about your experiences.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.510
And what could be more
important than what

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.700
you do with your time, as
opposed to the stuff you buy?

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:16.580
So in terms of the refocus from
material things to experiences,

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.880
I think there's a refocus
on life and what matters.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.680
AUDIENCE: My
question is about how

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:25.580
do you with people becoming
less and less materialistic--

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:31.720
compared to even 40 years
ago, as Mr. Inglehart said--

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.510
how do you think it's going
to influence job market?

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.760
Because not all of
us can make a living

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.920
writing programs
or writing books.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.090
Some of us, for example,
enjoy creating stuff.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.559
Sewing or something like that.

00:51:45.559 --> 00:51:47.350
So if we're going to
be less materialistic,

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.850
is that going to become
a problem for people

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:53.830
who are making their
living producing stuff

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:57.175
and selling stuff?

00:51:57.175 --> 00:51:59.860
JAMES WALLMAN: It's a
very interesting aspect

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:04.960
of the problem of materialism
and the defining problem

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.710
stuffication.

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.560
The shift from the material
to experiential economy

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.830
is what's going to happen
to some industries.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.430
With any change, there are
winners and there are losers.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.630
You ever heard of a guy called
Ned Ludd, who led the Luddites?

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.240
Ever heard the
phrase, the Luddites?

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.180
So when the Industrial
Revolution got going in the UK,

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.090
this guy in the north of England
smashed some of the machines.

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:28.840
He may have just been
drunk-- it turns out

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.877
he may have not been
protesting at all.

00:52:30.877 --> 00:52:32.960
Apparently, if you look
into it, it's really odd--

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.710
but he became their
hero and they and they

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:37.220
called themselves Luddites
because those machines were

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.104
taking away their jobs, and
they were hugely concerned.

00:52:41.104 --> 00:52:42.770
Did that stop the
Industrial Revolution?

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:43.220
No.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.261
Should it have stopped
the Industrial Revolution?

00:52:45.261 --> 00:52:45.810
Not at all.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.685
Because it was the
Industrial Revolution that

00:52:47.685 --> 00:52:51.360
led to the consumer evolution
that gave us abundance,

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.200
that gave us everything
that we have today.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.990
So there will definitely be
changes in the job market.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:00.510
And definitely be changes
in terms of what we value.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:02.472
And I think it will
change for the better.

00:53:02.472 --> 00:53:03.930
You think about 3D
printing, what's

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:08.610
3D printing going to do for all
those people who make stuff?

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:11.040
When you can 3D
print it at home,

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.380
it's going to completely
change that market, isn't it?

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.210
Why you going to have loads of
factories of people producing

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:19.680
plastic goods, when you
can print it at home?

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.050
So the world is
changing, anyway.

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:28.100
And what I'm hoping-- this is
my belief-- what materialism

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.350
did for standards of living
in the 20th century, which

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:34.120
was just revolutionized them
in a way that just had never

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.200
happened in the whole
of human existence.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.300
I think experientialism could
do that for quality of life

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.920
in the 21st century.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.810
We could end up in
this age of leisure,

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.840
which [INAUDIBLE] talked
about back in the '30s.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.931
That's what I hope.

00:53:47.931 --> 00:53:48.430
SPEAKER: OK.

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:51.570
Why don't we thank
our speaker today.
