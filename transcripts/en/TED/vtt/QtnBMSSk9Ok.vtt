00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.310
I'd like you to imagine
what it would feel like

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:20.569
if, for two whole minutes,
your left arm was continuously flapping,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.947
your eyes were constantly rolling,

00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:25.901
your jaw was clenching so hard

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.701
that it felt like your teeth
were about to break,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.432
and every ten seconds,

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:34.734
you were forced to let out
a loud, high-pitched screech.

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:36.202
(Tic)

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.712
This is how I lived
at the young age of six,

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.881
every waking moment, seven days a week.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:44.926
(Tic)

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.362
And these were only some of my symptoms.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.973
When these symptoms surfaced,
my life literally changed overnight.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:56.593
I could no longer go to school,
see my friends or even eat out,

00:00:56.617 --> 00:01:00.786
because my tics would attract
the attention of everyone in the room.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.263
In search for a cure, we flew to New York

00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:08.468
to meet with the best pediatric
neuropsychologist my parents could find.

00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:10.911
(Tic)

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:15.009
But the doctor did not give us
the easy remedy we had hoped for.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.093
Instead, she diagnosed me
with an incurable neurological disorder,

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:21.517
Tourette syndrome.

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:26.172
Oftentimes, medication can be
an essential and valuable part

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:28.029
of many treatment processes.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:31.419
But in my case, the drugs
only made things worse.

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.474
One drug put me in a wheelchair,

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:38.019
because my legs had gotten so numb
that I couldn't move them.

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:41.323
Another one caused me to hallucinate.

00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:43.769
I would see green people running after me,

00:01:43.793 --> 00:01:46.506
threatening to boil me in a pot
and drink me as soup.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.130
And it was really scary.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:50.213
We tried drug after drug

00:01:50.237 --> 00:01:53.522
to find something that would bring me
some sort of relief.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.331
But every single attempt
just ended up making things worse.

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:04.265
It is estimated that in 2013
in the United States alone,

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.964
the prescription drug expenditure

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:08.932
to treat neurological conditions
and mental illness

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:13.107
was about 89 billion dollars annually.

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:16.659
But imagine if there were a way
to treat these conditions

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:20.520
without a price or without side effects.

00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:25.210
Imagine if your doctor prescribed you
a daily dose of music.

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:30.439
I'm here today to share with you
my personal experience with music

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:33.680
and the effect that it had
on my neurological disorder.

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:35.145
(Tic)

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:38.015
Tourette syndrome
is essentially a series

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.040
of involuntary movements and sounds,

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:41.513
known as tics.

00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:46.353
The best way for me to really describe
what it's like to have Tourette syndrome

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:48.967
is something I'm sure
you're all very familiar with --

00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:50.498
the hiccups.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:52.536
You can try to stop yourself from the act.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.395
You can hold your breath and count to 10,
or drink water upside down,

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.537
but there is just nothing
you can do about it

00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:02.377
until the sensation passes
and the hiccups have taken their course.

00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:07.234
I often lay on my bedroom floor
after an attack of tics,

00:03:07.258 --> 00:03:09.305
feeling exhausted and in despair.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.510
(Tic)

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:14.847
My equally desperate mother
would attempt to soothe me and herself

00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:16.538
by putting on some music.

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.069
She would play peaceful music
to soothe our aching hearts.

00:03:20.664 --> 00:03:22.347
And we'd lie together on the floor

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:24.672
and allow the beat
of the drums to uplift us.

00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:27.728
And as the rhythms and the tunes unfolded,

00:03:27.752 --> 00:03:31.053
our spirits would rise,
our moods would be lighter,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.118
and we would be rejuvenated.

00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:34.789
(Tic)

00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:40.124
Very soon, and rather unknowingly,
I became an addict of this newfound drug.

00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:44.712
When I found myself slipping
into my bouts of sadness and self-pity,

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.299
I would rush to the 88 keys of my piano,

00:03:47.323 --> 00:03:51.664
knowing in my heart that the tones
and rhythms from each one of those keys

00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:53.222
would soon set me free.

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.259
At the time, I didn't realize
how much music was helping me.

00:03:57.283 --> 00:03:59.416
It was just something I did by default.

00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:02.513
When I wrote my songs,
it wasn't to impress anybody.

00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:04.003
It was just a release.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.553
But the more I played,
the less my symptoms surfaced,

00:04:07.577 --> 00:04:10.013
and the intensity of my attacks reduced.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:14.236
So I became curious as to how
these songs were soothing my symptoms.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.648
And I wondered if there were
any other cases of medicinal music.

00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:21.041
So I began to search.

00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:25.734
I found that there was
a highly successful US congresswoman,

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:28.202
Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560
She lost her ability to speak.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.122
Because the ability to speak
and the ability to sing

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:36.339
lay in two separate parts of the brain,

00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:39.109
her doctors brought in
music therapists to work with her.

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:42.283
The therapists encouraged her
to sing her thoughts,

00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:44.450
since she was incapable of speaking them.

00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:45.832
And through this technique,

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:49.352
the congresswoman was finally able
to regain her speech.

00:04:49.697 --> 00:04:52.081
Music helped heal Gabby Giffords.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.728
Scientists have found that music causes
our brains to release a natural painkiller

00:04:57.752 --> 00:04:59.133
known as oxytocin

00:04:59.157 --> 00:05:01.315
and a feel-good chemical, dopamine.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.260
Dopamine is essential
for a healthy nervous system

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:06.817
and strongly impacts emotional health.

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:11.005
Music also affects our heart rate,
breathing and pulse rate,

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.829
as it stimulates blood flow.

00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:16.092
In addition, it lowers
our cortisol levels,

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.616
thus reducing anxiety,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.818
which is a common stimulant
for neurological symptoms.

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:26.399
In our lifetimes, we are all going to know
someone with a neurological disorder.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.804
If it's not a family member --

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:29.995
(Tic)

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:32.352
it could be a friend or a coworker.

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:34.991
Please help me spread this message:

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:39.500
music has the ability to uplift our lives
and heal us from within.

00:05:40.616 --> 00:05:42.251
I still have Tourette syndrome.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.531
I deal with it every day, every hour.

00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:46.997
I'm going to deal with it
for the rest of my life.

00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.537
And that means that I have to frequently
excuse myself from my classroom,

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.383
because my verbal tics
can be extremely distracting.

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:57.149
That means that sometimes
when I wink my eyes involuntarily,

00:05:57.173 --> 00:06:00.123
the guy sitting opposite from me
thinks I'm flirting with him,

00:06:00.147 --> 00:06:01.298
when I'm really not.

00:06:01.322 --> 00:06:02.325
(Laughter)

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.680
And I have to tell him,
"Sorry -- I wasn't trying to flirt."

00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:08.188
But the most amazing thing is

00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:12.641
that when I sing, play music
and even just listen to music,

00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:13.815
I don't tic.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:18.744
I've been onstage numerous times
in highly stressful situations,

00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:21.196
with thousands of people watching me.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.000
And while I do tic
before my performance --

00:06:24.024 --> 00:06:25.042
(Tic)

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:28.418
when the music starts,
the tics take a back seat.

00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:34.795
So I may have written my own lyrics
and composed my own music.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:39.140
But in reality, I've realized
it was the music that composed me.

00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:40.911
Thank you.

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:45.920
(Applause)

00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:52.257
(Tic)

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:56.509
(Music)

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:25.952
(Singing) I think I took
my mask off too soon

00:07:26.276 --> 00:07:29.294
'Cause you were there
and then you were not

00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:32.715
I think I pushed it all onto you

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:35.934
I should have dragged it out
dragged it out

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:42.545
I think that maybe each time
I lose a bit of myself I put it back on

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:48.953
Just to fake it till I break
my own heart in two

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:57.937
And oh I wanted you
to know the real me

00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:00.743
And take it seriously

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:04.636
But now

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.866
I'm not loving you
I'm not loving you

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.285
I'm not loving you

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:13.206
I thought I could trust you

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:17.879
But you're running away
from me and my mask

00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:21.234
I'm not loving you
I'm not loving you

00:08:21.258 --> 00:08:23.753
I'm not loving you

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.806
Right now

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.147
I think I took my mask off too soon

00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:40.108
Because you screamed when I pulled it off

00:08:40.132 --> 00:08:43.670
You told me you were unprepared

00:08:43.694 --> 00:08:46.821
And like that
just like that

00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:53.642
I think that maybe this time
it hurt more than it ever has before

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:58.540
I think maybe this blow I took
was a little more

00:08:58.564 --> 00:09:01.093
A little more

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:07.309
And oh I wanted you
to know the real me

00:09:08.532 --> 00:09:11.203
And take it seriously

00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:15.152
But now

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:18.398
I’m not loving you
I'm not loving you

00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:20.825
I'm not loving you

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.217
I thought I could trust you

00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:28.518
But you're running away
from me and my mask

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:31.917
I'm not loving you
I'm not loving you

00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:34.505
I'm not loving you

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.738
Right now

00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:50.944
(Applause)
