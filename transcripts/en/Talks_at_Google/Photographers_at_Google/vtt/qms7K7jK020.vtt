00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.160
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Today our guest is award winning
photographer Catherine Hall.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.319
&gt;&gt;audience member: Woo hoo!

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.370
&gt;&gt;Presenter: We're gonna be recording this
presentation and it's gonna be posted on the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.660
@Google YouTube channel.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.190
So when we get to the Q&amp;A section there's
a microphone on the right and make use of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.050
that so we can get that on the recording.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.499
&gt;&gt;audience member whispering: I have some
questions.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.789
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Now about Catherine; Catherine
has lots of accomplishments to her credit.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.220
She's a photographer, instructor, mentor,
she has her own weekly photography show and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.140
many, many more accolades.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.550
I was fortunate enough to meet Catherine about
nine months ago.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.560
She was hosting a photo op in San Francisco.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.250
And what really impressed me about Catherine
the first time I met her was her dedication

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.850
to make sure that everybody walked away with
a, having experienced something new, having

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.450
learned something new from this experience.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.400
So without further ado, it's my pleasure to
introduce you, Catherine Hall.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.290
[Applause]

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.309
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Thanks Ricardo and I'm so
honored to be here.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.250
Thank you guys all for coming and filling
up the beautiful colored chairs.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.310
So I'm gonna play a little slideshow first
and then I'll go right into the presentation

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.140
and then we'll do questions and answers at
the end.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:02:47.810
If anyone has a burning question while I'm
talking feel free to raise your hand.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:04:58.139
[Chiming noise]
[Applause]

00:04:58.139 --> 00:06:26.850
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: What am I gonna teach people
from Google?

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.380
The day I started thinking about it and I
think, I'm a professional photographer but

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.060
I want you to understand that there is not
a disconnect between you and I.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:47.759
What I mean by that is every single photograph
that you just saw was a self created project.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.980
It was not a job, it was not a client.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.660
I might have sold the images later, they may
have gotten published or won awards but they

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.521
are all things that I went out, I had an idea
and I just pursued it.

00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:03.490
And I thought about photography, what does
photography really about?

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.550
If you wanna build a body of work it's really
about creating your own opportunities.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.060
And that's true whether you're an amateur,
an enthusiast, a professional, it's across

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.050
the board.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.740
So I thought, that's something I wanna discuss,
that's something I wanna share, is how I,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.190
how important it is to be, if you a will,
an opportunist.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:31.530
So, "Your daughter will not graduate high
school."

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.240
That's what my parents were told when I was
in 5th grade.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.430
When I was in 5th grade, you know those multiple
choice tests that have the A, B, C, D?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.330
Instead of reading the question and selecting
the appropriate answer I would make drawings.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.039
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So I wasn't doing very well

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:52.039
in 5th grade.

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.080
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So my parents took me to

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.880
a learning disability place and tried to figure
out what was going on and they proceeded to

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.479
tell my parents that they needed to pull me
out of regular school because I would never

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.169
finish high school.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:15.139
I remember my parents telling me that and
I thought, "I don't wanna leave my friends."

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:23.180
And this is the first time I can remember
someone putting a serious limitation on me

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.690
and I wasn't gonna buy it.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.650
So, not only did I finish high school
[Laughs]

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:38.149
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: but I finished top of my
class at CalPoly and I think I got like two

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:39.149
B's.

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:44.490
The point of the story is it's interesting
how in life people will put limitations on

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.410
you and photography is the same way.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.029
It's really hard to be a professional, it's
really hard to do this, it's really hard to

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:53.730
do that, don't try.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.980
And I found that, don't listen to those people.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.300
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: cause the greatest limitations

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.300
are really self imposed and by listening to
others that might not have your best interest

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.730
at heart.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:14.720
So, definition of opportunity; a favorable
juncture or circumstances; a good chance for

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.660
advancement or progress, all of these.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.160
Opportunity is a great word.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.139
When you think of opportunity you think, "Yeah,
opportunity it's good."

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:30.190
So wouldn't you think the direct correlation
that an opportunist would have an equally

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.819
positive connotation?

00:09:31.819 --> 00:09:38.120
"One who takes advantage of any opportunity
to achieve an end, often with no regards to

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.889
principles or consequences."

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:43.119
Is the definition of an opportunist.

00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:55.709
Thesaurus of this, look at this, the synonyms;
conniving, cunning, deceitful, devious, bully,

00:09:55.709 --> 00:10:01.649
cheat, delinquent and my absolute favorite,
devil.

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:06.089
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: And I'm thinking, I've been

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:08.480
calling myself an opportunist for years now.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.220
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: That's horrible.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.199
And I started to think how can two words with
the same origin have such opposite meanings?

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:23.319
How can one be so negative and so positive?

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:30.550
And then I realized what it was; people are
jealous.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:36.619
When you see people out there creating their
own opportunities, excelling, succeeding,

00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:39.459
a lot of people get pissed off.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:43.850
They say they cheat, they say they're, whatever
it is that they say.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:52.799
The point of the story is there's a sort of
believe in our culture that you shouldn't

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:57.980
get to where you are by creating your own
opportunities and going on the fast track,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.549
you need to work hard, work hard, work hard,
work hard.

00:11:02.549 --> 00:11:06.269
We hear that all the time in our culture and
it's so prevalent.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:12.769
And yes, there's the work hard, work smart
sort of thing and I think, yes, of course

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:19.749
you have to work hard but you should work
smart, equally smart or more smart.

00:11:19.749 --> 00:11:28.149
This is my absolute favorite phrase that I
hear, "You are so lucky."

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:36.839
Do you guys get that ever, "You work at Google,
you're so lucky?"

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:43.379
And I think to myself, okay, yeah I'm sure
luck had its point in this whole thing but

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:47.199
really, am I here today cause I'm lucky?

00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:51.399
Or because I wanted to be here and I worked
hard for it and I worked smart and I created

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.010
my own opportunities?

00:11:53.010 --> 00:12:02.249
"There is no scarcity of opportunity to make
at living at what you love; there's only scarcity

00:12:02.249 --> 00:12:04.009
of resolve to make it happen."

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:06.589
This is by Wayne Dyer.

00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:10.040
And I really, really believe this.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.989
So I'm gonna share with you guys a couple
stories and this is really applicable, a lot

00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:21.989
of them will correlate, actually I just realized
there was a couple photos from an assignment

00:12:21.989 --> 00:12:24.609
in the slideshow, but most of them weren't.

00:12:24.609 --> 00:12:30.350
But, point of the story is whether you're
doing a commercial shoot or a personal project

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.970
it's really relevant to everyone.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.279
I wanna emphasize that again.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:44.220
So I got hired to do this shoot for, by John
Deere and they decided that there was not

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:53.299
gonna be an art director, a team, they forgo,
they forwent the advertising agency completely

00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:57.220
and brought me on as the only person in charge
of the shoot.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.910
So, I arrive and they, of course, had set
up models for me and at least got something

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.220
there for when I arrived.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.359
I showed up and do not trust people that are
not the photographers or are not the ad agencies

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:12.359
to get you models.

00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:16.050
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Or locations for that matter.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:24.050
So I got there and realized that early on
that what they had given me was not, the content

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:29.189
they gave me was not gonna allow me to produce
work that I felt proud of.

00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:35.859
So we started at 4 a.m., I show up models
aren't good, locations aren't good, long shoot

00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:42.860
day, 3, 4 o'clock in the afternoon we're finishing
and I'm thinking 12 hours later I do not like

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.519
any of these images.

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:50.430
The easy out would be, "You know what, they
set it up, they decided not to hire an ad

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.060
agency and here we are today."

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.379
[Coughing]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: But that's not me.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:02.939
So we're driving away and I'm thinking to
myself, "What am I gonna do?"

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:08.299
And I turned to my assistant and I say, "We're
have to, we're just getting started.

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.629
We need to find something else."

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:17.389
So the campaign was, just like Harley Davidson,
John Deere wanted to make it more about lifestyle

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:21.329
than product and that's why they just brought
me in and they didn't bring in an advertising

00:14:21.329 --> 00:14:26.269
team is because they really wanted to get
the real life of John Deere.

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:31.839
So I figured, I'm gonna drive around and I'm
gonna find people that use John Deere.

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.329
So that's what I did.

00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:39.899
And I found this man and that's his home.

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:44.220
And I walked up to his door cause I saw he
had john Deere equipment everywhere and I

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.629
thought this would be perfect.

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:49.040
So I walked up to his door, I knocked on it
and I said, "Hey, I'm doing this assignment

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.040
for John Deere, is there any way I could shoot
you this afternoon when the light gets nice?"

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.920
"Oh, okay, sure."

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.600
"Alright, do you have any family members?"

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.360
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Classic Mennonites.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.549
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Lots of family.

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:15.029
And it was interesting because I asked him
if he had family members, he said, "Yes" I

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:17.609
said, "Can you please have them all come back?

00:15:17.609 --> 00:15:22.160
" And this is just some random girl; he doesn't
know me from anyone, walking to his door saying,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.749
"Can you bring your family over so we can
do a photo shoot?"

00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:30.109
I show up and they're all, you know, dressed
in their best, right?

00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:34.529
And they're so excited to be in this photo
shoot.

00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:40.739
So I photographed their family and this was
so exhilarating, this is, I knew when I was

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:43.490
getting it this was what it was like.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.739
This is what John Deere life is like.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:54.309
So the results from this were that these were
actually the images that they chose to use.

00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:58.540
And these images secured me as a, they're
still my client today.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.680
Had I not gone out and done this there's no
way the other images would have passed.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.040
They would have gone back to the theory of
having an ad agency and doing it that way.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.749
So the lesson behind it is really not being
limited by your resources.

00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:20.149
Alright, so, I love to travel, who out there
likes travel photography?

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:21.689
A lot, yeah that's a popular one.

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.550
That's how I got started, just so you guys
know.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.119
I just would go on trips and take my camera
and take a bunch of photos.

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:37.519
And during one of these excursions I was in
Vietnam and I had this whole plan.

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:41.600
I found out about this little village at the
top of this mountain I thought, "Oh, this

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.759
is gonna be such a great experience."

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:49.649
I'd heard of a couple people going to it before
so it was a little bit known but still there

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:53.109
wasn't a ton of Westerners up there and I
thought, "Wow, what an authentic cool thing.

00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:57.089
I'm gonna pack a backpack, I'm gonna hike
up there, spend the night and photograph this

00:16:57.089 --> 00:16:58.089
village."

00:16:58.089 --> 00:17:00.949
Very, very, very excited.

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:06.569
So I'm walking along with my little backpack,
all happy, going to the place and then I come

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.339
along this most beautiful girl.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:13.699
I think, "Oh, I'm just gonna follow this girl."

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:17.789
So I'm following her thinking she's gonna
walk up to the village I'm going to and I'll

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:22.250
get some photographs of her along the way
and it's gonna be fantastic.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.559
So we're walking along and at the base of
the mountain it becomes a split.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:28.559
Whoa.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:31.019
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: At the base of the mountain

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:38.740
it becomes a split and we're going left, right?

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:45.020
Except for she goes right and then there's
that moment of plans?

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.059
Girl?

00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:49.100
Plans?

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.139
Girl?

00:17:51.139 --> 00:17:58.700
So I follow my intuition and I follow the
girl.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.630
We walked 4 hours.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.470
This is how far she walks home from school,
4 hours.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.220
You see her little jelly shoes?

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.820
We were walking through rice fields with snakes.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.899
This is such a cultural, incredible experience
to see her life.

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:23.940
I'm sorry I don't have a bigger one but this
is their family and this is why she walked

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.390
me and brought me to this home.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.180
So much more authentic than a village people
knew about, right?

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.180
And I spent the night.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.980
I stayed with them in their home.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.889
Can't speak a word of language, doesn't matter.

00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:36.770
And this is what I was exposed to.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:43.730
I remember walking home the next day and it
started raining and I pulled out my trusty

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.799
poncho which, by the way, I totally recommend
when you're shooting, always have a poncho.

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:52.730
Pulled out my trusty poncho put it over m
backpack with my camera, walking and the rain

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:58.120
was pouring over me and I was thinking to
myself, "This is the most amazing day of my

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120
life.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.799
This is the most amazing experience."

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:07.690
So the lesson from this is don't let plan
for possible, keep that in mind possible,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:12.059
future opportunities make you miss the ones
right in front of you.

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:17.850
It's really easy to have a plan and be really
excited about your plan and be blindsided

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.910
to everything else around you.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:27.830
So if you do have those intuitive hits, photography
is all about intuition, if you have an intuitive

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.090
hit while you are shooting, listen to it.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:41.990
Appalachia, so I had spent several hours with
this family building this beautiful rapport

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.899
and I photograph people that's what it's all
about, building a rapport.

00:19:45.899 --> 00:19:51.150
I had access to their home, to their backyard,
their family, their kids, I'm working working

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:56.160
working and I'm just not getting anything
but I'm stubborn.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.770
I'm not gonna leave until I get something.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:05.580
And then I look up and across in the neighbor's
yard I see this girl.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.570
And I think, "Hum, I could be stubborn and
I could stay working with this family I've

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:16.000
invested so much, or I'm getting out of here
right now and going to photograph this girl."

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.700
So I went with option B and I knocked on the
door, asked her mom, she hesitantly let me

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.830
in the house and into the backyard.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.759
Hesitantly, she told me I could take one photo.

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:32.779
[Coughing]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: And it wasn't like, "Okay,

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:34.409
sure I'll take one photo."

00:20:34.409 --> 00:20:35.549
Click, click, click.

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:40.450
It was like, "You can take one photo and I'm
standing right next to you watching me."

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.000
So she let me slide with two.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.179
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: But this is what I got.

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:47.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So the phrase, don't beat

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.760
a dead horse.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:54.360
If you're photographing something and it's
just not working, I mean you guys are at Google

00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.590
so I imagine you had a lot of drive and some
of you are probably stubborn like I am, don't

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:06.210
allow your drive and stubbornness to miss
other things that might be around you.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:11.840
If something's not working photographically
it's okay to let it go and move on to the

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.379
next opportunity.

00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:16.549
So, Adobe Lightroom Adventure in Tasmania.

00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:22.440
This was really exciting, in 2008 Adobe sent
17 of, what they say, are the world's best

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.210
photographers to Tasmania to beta test Lightroom
2.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:32.080
So they sent me along and I was by far the
youngest one.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.380
I was so nervous.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:42.429
To add insult to injury, I had been, I had
a job already preserved so I had to show up

00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:44.990
a week later than everyone else.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.899
So I have all these icons that have already
been there a week, gathering all these wonderful

00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:55.029
images, I'm competitive like most people are
in their own ways, I get there and I'm freaking

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:56.029
out.

00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:58.250
I have to do, I have to get results, I have
to get images.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.169
How am I gonna catch up?

00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:07.400
Totally intimidated but I'm fired up, the
next morning I'm going to get gold images,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.429
it's gonna be amazing.

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:15.200
The situation; I am a portrait photographer
and there are no people in Tasmania.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.429
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: I'm driving around looking

00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:21.500
for people and they are not there.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.659
It is so sparsely populated.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:30.539
Oh, by the way, did I mention all the other
iconic photographers were like landscape photographers,

00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:33.799
adventure photographers, like all the things
that are perfect for Tasmania?

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:41.129
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So what am I gonna do?

00:22:41.129 --> 00:22:45.990
So I knocked and I knocked and I knocked.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.590
Can any of you guys guess what I was doing?

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.590
Come on, somebody?

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.730
&gt;&gt;audience member: Going door to door?

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.759
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Going door to door, baby.

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:58.360
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: That's what I did.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.629
I just started knocking on people's doors
and asking them if I could photograph them

00:23:02.629 --> 00:23:06.019
cause that was the only way I could find people.

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:12.539
The interesting thing about it is this actually
became a huge advantage.

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:16.370
Not only was I able to photograph people but
I was able to photograph them in their own

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.230
environment.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:26.629
So this is this guy, he was hilarious, he
was in his 80, ugh, I don't know in his 80's

00:23:26.629 --> 00:23:33.549
or 90's but I asked him if he had any, a wife
or someone that he lived with.

00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:37.210
And he's like, "Oh no, I can't settle down
with just one lady."

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:45.419
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: This was the back, so coal

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:53.140
mining is really, it actually reminds me a
lot of Tasmania, I mean Appalachia in the

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.049
sense that there's a lot of areas that there's
a lot of coal mining that no longer exists.

00:23:57.049 --> 00:24:01.029
So you have the people that used to have jobs
no longer having jobs.

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:05.529
And this was an old train rusting in the back,
this was a little girl believe it or not,

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:08.990
not a little boy and that was just in their
back yard.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:16.019
This is a great story, so toward the end of
the trip it actually became kind of a joke

00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:19.280
that I was the one going around knocking on
all these doors.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.890
And I had a guide and our last day he said,
"Let's play a game."

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:28.850
And I said, "Alright, I'm up for a challenge,
what do you have for me?"

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:34.710
He said, "I'm gonna find the scariest house
and dare you to knock on the door."

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:40.230
So I mentioned to you that Tasmania's like
Appalachia, it's like the Wild West even though

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.210
Appalachia's not west, but point being that
it's crazy.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:52.610
There's like do not enter, gun signs, like
it's not somewhere, there's like dogs beware,

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.529
private property, completely littered with
signs.

00:24:56.529 --> 00:25:00.600
So we pull up to this house and he's like,
"Alright, here you go."

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.190
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: I look at him and I think,

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.320
"Ugh, alright."

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.340
And what I found interesting enough was the
weirder the house was the nicer the people.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.140
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So I went and knocked on

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.019
the door and sure enough it was this family
and they invited me inside and I hung out

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:26.630
with them and they, eventually we went outside
and I asked the kid, he was 4 by the way,

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.639
"Anvill can you show me your favorite toy?"

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:37.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: He pulls out a frickin'

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.350
chainsaw.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: And the thing was that this

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.529
was a real chainsaw, this is not a toy.

00:25:44.529 --> 00:25:46.379
It is heavy.

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:50.550
And what amazed me most is look at how he's
holding it with such ease.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.519
This was seriously his favorite toy.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:26:00.080
So I have to warn you though, if anyone's
gonna go out there and do this, it doesn't

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.590
always turn out so well.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:07.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yeah, that's why I don't

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:11.539
like photographing in Asian cultures cause
there's all dogs everywhere and they come

00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:13.630
bite at you.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:19.399
Anyway, the result is the images got lots
of rewards, they were published, had incredible

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:20.399
experiences.

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:27.000
One of the best things was because I came
a week late I was supposed to be on my own,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.019
everyone else was leaving but I wanted to
stay an additional week past everyone and

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:37.789
I was supposed to be on my own Tourism Tasmania
actually funded the rest of my trip because

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:43.419
they were really interested in the images
that I was getting and they were unique.

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:46.890
So a lot of really wonderful things came out
of this.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:55.779
So the lesson being, do not be limited by
your resources and do not be limited by apparent

00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:58.009
resources.

00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:02.289
And what I mean by that is it would have been
really easy just to say, "You know what, there's

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:09.549
not a lot of people in Tasmania I guess I'll
just shoot landscape or I'll shoot devils

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:13.929
or, you know, Tasmanian devils, but instead
it was kind of coming

00:27:13.929 --> 00:27:16.900
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: coming to the conclusion

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.519
that no, I am a portrait photographer, that
is what I excel at, how can I make this work?

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:27.630
So there's a show out there called 9 by Design,
have any of you guys seen it by any chance?

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:36.260
It's a design show on the, it was on the Bravo
network now it's on HGTV and it's this family,

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.450
they're incredible designers.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:43.559
They live in Manhattan they basically take
buildings and completely renovate them.

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:49.679
So, for example, the last home they created
was a sex shop and they just completely tore

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:55.620
it out and renovated it and built a 20 million
dollar home right in New York.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.000
So watching this TV show, and I'm not this
type of person like I don't like fall in love

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.320
with stars, but there's something about this
family that I really, really liked.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.259
And I kind of fall in love with this family
watching their show and I kept thinking, "How

00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:12.799
cool would it be to photograph this family?"

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:18.450
So, the situation is, I've fallen in love
with them, I see great potential, not only

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.940
photographing their family and their kids
because I am interested in them but also they're

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:30.389
designers, they do Tyra Banks' house, Trump's
house, like they have a lot of contacts.

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:33.799
And they love photography so I think, "Wow,
I can tap into their clientele and become

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:35.799
a referral from them.

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:43.190
So the only problem is I live 3,000 miles
away, I have no contacts, they have no contact

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:51.990
information listed and I don't really have
a family portfolio to show them.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:58.039
One would think, "Good luck" right?

00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:00.080
But I wrote a pitch letter anyway.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:09.169
I labored over the pitch letter, sent it on
a Friday and honestly had zero expectations.

00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:13.519
I sent it to their agent cause that was the
only contact I get, sent it to a New York

00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:16.799
agent expecting nothing.

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:22.769
Monday morning I got a call from their agent
and she said, "they've gotten a ton of requests,

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:26.999
you're the first person that they're gonna
invite into their home."

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:32.350
I mean they'd had journalists come in but
never a photographer come in and stay with

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.350
them.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.970
I lived with them for 3 days.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.039
And these are some of the images I got.

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:45.860
So this is their family bathtub and this is
their two twin sons and their baby son.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.580
This is their son Breaker, he's the cool one.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:56.570
This is Breaker and their nanny, so they have
I think 5 or 6 nannies cause they have 7 kids.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:03.549
But their nanny, you can see their relationship,
they're really, really part of the family.

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:10.610
This is Robert talking, sitting on his desk,
there's two desks like this in the entire

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.610
world.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.520
One is in the Museum of Modern Art and the
other one's in his bedroom.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.070
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: This is their teenage daughter,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:23.669
Bellamy, and I really wanted to play on, she's
12 and she's entering that really complex

00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:26.429
age.

00:30:26.429 --> 00:30:30.100
This is their gym in their basement, their
son's really into basketball.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:37.990
This is their daughter Tallulah; this is the
view right outside their house.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:46.740
So, the point of the story is this is that,
first off, this is one of the most rewarding,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.730
fun weekends or 3 days of my life.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.659
I had so much fun, this family is so special
and photographing them was so inspiring.

00:30:53.659 --> 00:30:58.620
They also invited me back to be recorded on
their show.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.450
So they're featuring me on their show which
is coming out in June and now I'm their family

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:09.360
photographer, they want me to come to Brazil
to photograph them and I'm building this portfolio.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.840
There's a lot, this is just the beginning
too, I know a lot of other amazing things

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.299
are gonna come out of this.

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:19.970
So I really wanted to share this to you because
I think it's really easy to say something

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.730
won't work without trying.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:27.450
Cause from an outsider, if somebody told me
the situation that I was going into writing

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.850
that pitch letter, most people would say that's
a waste of your time.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.489
So don't dismiss it until you try it.

00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:37.779
This is another shoot.

00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:42.980
I did this shoot as a test shoot when I was
in New York and I was really inspired by it.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:49.220
And I came to San Francisco and I thought
I'd love to do this old Hollywood San Francisco

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.220
shoot.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.769
I kept waiting for like a client or a project,
something to come to me and then I realized

00:31:55.769 --> 00:32:02.580
it wasn't gonna happen, no one was gonna share
the vision that I had and if I really wanted

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.399
to do this shoot I had to do it on my own.

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:09.740
So I spent several months putting together
a team and finding a venue.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:16.539
And these are just a few of the people that
I pulled together and we created this really

00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:18.929
inspiring, wonderful shoot.

00:32:18.929 --> 00:32:24.909
And a lot of times I have no idea what I'm
gonna do with the images.

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.909
And that's okay.

00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:28.809
If you have an idea, just go for it.

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:33.470
So have any of you ever been to the Julia
Morgan Ballroom in San Francisco?

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.970
It's like; it's magnificent, really beautiful.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:41.559
So obviously I got a lot of satisfaction from
the shoot and it was my first experience really

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:46.190
producing a shoot and how much work went into
it and got a better understanding of the industry

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.019
through it.

00:32:48.019 --> 00:32:52.379
And I also pulled together this team and made
a lot of contacts and still work with them

00:32:52.379 --> 00:32:53.379
today.

00:32:53.379 --> 00:32:58.009
And the images got published, won awards and
so a lot of great things happened afterwards

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.799
but that wasn't my impetus for doing it.

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:05.239
My impetus for doing it was cause I had an
idea and I had a sort of, we go back to intuition,

00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:09.309
I knew it was something I needed to do.

00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:13.539
So the lesson is if you're passionate about
an idea you're the only one who can really

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:16.279
make it happen.

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:22.029
Which brings us to personal projects, I have
a show that Ricardo mentioned, it's called

00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:27.019
Twit Photo and we interview these exceptional
photographers every week.

00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:33.369
And there's one common thread between all
of them which is great because this common

00:33:33.369 --> 00:33:40.730
thread connects you professionals to you guys,
amateurs, enthusiasts, aspiring pros, not

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.580
aspiring pros cause you work at Google but
point being people that love photography,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.970
it's all the same.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:57.179
And what every single photographer says is
that you have to have personal projects.

00:33:57.179 --> 00:34:02.279
So these are just a couple of the projects
that I've done where it's just been, this

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:05.440
is Burning Man, you've heard of Burning Man.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.070
Has anyone gone to Burning Man?

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.649
Alright, one person, we're connected.

00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:15.510
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So these are just a few

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.580
of the images I've gotten.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.919
I've gone there about 4 or 5 years and that's
the thing that's great about personal projects

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:23.119
is that they can last as long or as short
as you want them to.

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:26.800
So if you're inspired by something you just
keep going back, you keep working on it.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:33.040
And then, like I said, we don't plan for these
things but things come out of it later.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:39.629
Whether it's getting you on magazines or winning
awards, here's a little exhibit that I did,

00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:43.490
so if anyone wants to know what Burning Man's
like this gives you kind of a brief.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:44.799
[Music plays]
[Laughs]

00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:49.000
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yeah, that's what it's like,
it's kind of crazy.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.210
[Music plays]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: But we did a full on exhibit

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:58.690
with metal prints, Bay Photo sponsored it
and it was a day time and a night time exhibit.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:07.540
[Music plays]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Does anyone wanna go?

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:12.150
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: It's pretty cool, photographically

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:18.150
actually, that's the reason I went is I wanted
to photograph it and it's very cool for taking

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.150
photographs.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:25.280
There's a lot of interesting art projects,
people, tons of stuff to photograph.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.510
So the lesson is every great photographer
will explore their passions through personal

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.080
projects.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:41.300
Alright, so we've talked a lot about the importance
of creating your own opportunities and doing

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.540
work that you love and following your intuition.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.810
So, what do you guys think is the number one
reason that people don't pursue their passion

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:50.930
and just make it happen?

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.430
Come on, anyone?

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.940
&gt;&gt;audience members: [inaudible]

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.440
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Time.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.440
Money.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.450
&gt;&gt;audience members: [Inaudible]

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.950
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: What?

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.460
&gt;&gt;audience members: They think more than act.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.980
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: They think more than act.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.470
That's a good one, big talker, no action.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.470
&gt;&gt;audience members: Fear.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.480
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: AH!

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.049
Fear, four people said it at once.

00:36:11.049 --> 00:36:12.320
You guys are all awesome.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:18.630
Everything you guys just said is totally right
but it all leads to fear.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:24.730
It all leads to fear; money, I started doing
travel photography when I was in college.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.210
I had to go to Asia cause that was the only
place I could afford.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:34.290
You know, every single thing I hear, it all
comes back to fear.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.609
What is the definition of fear?

00:36:35.609 --> 00:36:42.890
It is a distressing emotion aroused by impending
danger, pain, etcetera, whether the threat

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.150
is real or imagined.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:49.760
I think the key here is the threat is real
or imagined.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.890
We all know that fear is good, right?

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.099
If the threat is real you need to react.

00:36:55.099 --> 00:37:04.799
Unfortunately, emotionally fear is not real,
it is imagined, so it becomes real to you.

00:37:04.799 --> 00:37:15.230
I actually, interestingly enough, I see fear
often as a sign of something I need to do.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:19.839
If I get that feeling like, "Oh I don't wanna
do this" and I start making excuses.

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:23.240
"Ah, I don't have enough money, I don't have
enough time, I don't have this, this ,this."

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.230
It all comes back to fear.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:35.180
So here's a couple things where I think fear,
overcoming your fear can help you as a photographer.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:40.990
So number one, don't be afraid to make fun
of yourself or laugh at yourself.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:45.740
If you photograph people, in particular, if
you're really serious looking through the

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:51.670
camera then they're gonna be a little intimidated.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:56.940
If you're loose and you're having fun and
you're engaged, and I'm not saying you have

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.349
to be different than who you are as a human
being, but what I am saying is don't be too

00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:03.609
uptight.

00:38:03.609 --> 00:38:08.600
Especially when you're working with children,
allow yourself to come to their level, allow

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.540
yourself to act like an idiot.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.810
Being an exceptional artist and playing safe
don't co-exist.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:22.550
If you're gonna really excel at something
you can't do it by playing safe.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:27.339
So I wanna tell you guys a little story about
Connor who's one and half years old.

00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:29.170
I met him at Burning Man.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.000
I photographed him in front of his grandfather's
trailer.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.369
When it's time to process the photos I wanted
to do something kind of complex and kind of

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:41.910
dark.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.859
I wanted to do something that was different
but it was risky.

00:38:44.859 --> 00:38:50.660
And when I was done with this image I did
not want to share it with his father.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.069
I did not minimize the dark circles under
his eyes, I accentuated them.

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:59.710
I did not minimize the dirt and dust all over
him, I pulled it out.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.869
And this image at the exhibit I did was the
most controversial image there.

00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:10.010
Half the people looked at it and, this was
the most conversation, this actually promoted

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.770
the most conversation as well, half the people
looked at it and thought, "Oh my gosh that's

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.770
so cool.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.610
This kid is at Burning Man, he's dirty, this
is what kids are supposed to be like."

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:23.440
And the other half of the people are like,
"you shouldn't really bring kids to Burning

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.440
Man.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.470
It's not good for him to breathe in this alkaline
dust."

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:33.600
So it really created a lot of conversation
and I was very, very scared for his father

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.900
to see this image.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.950
Interestingly enough he loves it.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.799
He called me, he wants prints, he wants the
file, he wants to do this that and the other.

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:45.799
He's so excited.

00:39:45.799 --> 00:39:49.619
This is the best photograph he's ever seen
of his kid.

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:56.720
Tallulah, she's the daughter of the Novogratz
family in New York that I photograph that

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.790
I talked about, that have the show.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.490
Tallulah is 12.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.099
You know what it's like when you're 12.

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:09.490
You're going through all of these changes
and you're figuring out who you are.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.369
She's twins with Bellamy who I showed you
in the slideshow, they're as opposite as can

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:15.660
be.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:21.069
So when it was time to photograph Tallulah,
I was trying to figure out, you know, who

00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:22.340
she is as a person.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:30.079
She's very complex, she's very smart, she's
got kind of a dark side, how am I gonna show

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.660
this in this image?

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.770
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So I put together this image

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.620
and I photographed it, I processed it and
I was, once again, horrified, like really

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:45.870
scared to share the image with the family.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.600
They loved it cause that's their daughter.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.089
So don't make judgments on what you think
people will think.

00:40:54.089 --> 00:40:59.860
Don't play it safe when you have no idea what
others perceptions are.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:05.910
You're making decisions on your own perception
which is not real and which is not right.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.400
So fear is a little darkroom where negatives
are developed.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.599
And that's the one thing I really want you
guys to walk away with.

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:15.630
When it comes to your photography don't forget
this lesson.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.630
Yes?

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:22.790
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So his question was most
of my portraits are outdoors and do I control

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.539
light or do I shoot with natural light.

00:41:26.539 --> 00:41:32.510
I started off exclusively shooting with natural
light.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.940
And now I will travel with a reflector.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.010
And I recommend California Sunbounce, they
make beautiful reflectors.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:44.180
You do not need to carry around huge equipment
while you're shooting in these remote locations.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:50.560
You can and I do sometimes cause I see value
to it but you can do a lot with a reflector.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:56.589
The other thing is don't be afraid, it's good
to use shade, you know, so you can shoot any

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:57.960
time of the day.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.910
But if you have a reflector you'll at least
get pop and contrast and color and the main

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.930
thing is you really wanna make sure that their
eyes are not dark sockets.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.839
So you stick someone in the shade and don't
use any reflectors, a lot of times their eyes

00:42:10.839 --> 00:42:14.440
will just kind of go black and lifeless and
you really wanna avoid that.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.780
So if you are using a reflector make sure
you're at least getting a little, what we

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.980
call, a ping in the eye.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.140
Does that help?

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.140
Yeah?

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.960
&gt;&gt;male #2: You don't seem to be a big fan
of smiling faces.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.960
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Oh, great question.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.710
So he says I'm not a huge fan of smiling faces.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.960
And actually that's a great observation.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.710
The first thing I tell people when I shoot
them is, when I shoot them

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.650
[Makes shooting noise]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: is do not smile.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.599
I don't want you to smile.

00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:46.819
If I make you laugh then laugh, if you're
feeling like smiling then naturally smile

00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:48.430
because I'm doing something silly.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:52.670
But I'm controlling them in a sense, I'm telling
them what to feel.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:57.100
So if I act crazy silly I want them to laugh;
it will be real, it will be authentic.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.690
But the main point of the story is I don't
want people doing any expressions that are

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.380
not real.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.530
So I guess the moral of the story is that
I don't like people smiling.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.750
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yes?

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.630
&gt;&gt;male #3: How do you do focusing?

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.442
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: How do I do focusing?

00:43:16.442 --> 00:43:19.470
So, that's actually a really good question,
I had other tips but we don't have time to

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:20.530
get through them.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.460
One thing, I use auto focus for everything.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.570
And the one thing I learned is the center
point, especially if you're using really fast

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:34.339
lenses like the 85 1.2, the center point is
the best focus point.

00:43:34.339 --> 00:43:35.670
It's the fastest one.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:40.531
So if you're ever having a problem focusing
your lens by using, you know, you can change

00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:45.579
like if you have a side point, put it to the
center cause that's the only way I can focus

00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:47.140
with an 85.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.299
Does that answer?

00:43:49.299 --> 00:43:53.500
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yeah, I had the same problem with
an 85 focusing.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.090
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yeah, it's the only way
to do it.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:59.330
Do, I'll get it focused on the center point
and then I'll recompose.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.309
Cause I'm never, my subjects never in the
center or very, very rarely in the center

00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:08.080
so it's kind of like a dance, focus, compose,
focus, compose, but that's the only way it

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.720
works with really fast lenses like the 85.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.640
Or, actually, the slow lenses if you will.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.640
Yeah?

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.640
&gt;&gt;male #4:But there is curvature of field
and if you do that then you can't focus.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.760
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yeah, so he just had a great
observation.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.609
He said that there's curvature of field and
if you do that by the time, it's not gonna

00:44:24.609 --> 00:44:25.750
be optimal.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:31.619
When shooting portraits it's so negligible
that it really doesn't matter for me.

00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:35.700
If I was shooting something like architecture
that was gonna be blown up to a huge billboard

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.839
then I would be more concerned about that
and I would manually focus at that time.

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:45.200
So if your goal is to have the sharpest focus
and you're shooting something that you want

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.440
depth, great depth of field, and you have
the time to manually focus, then manually

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.200
focus, but with people they're moving, I'm
not gonna do anything huge with the files,

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.690
I don't think it really matters so much, but
that's a good observation.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.080
Yeah, oh sorry did you, he was holding for
awhile, yeah?

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.099
&gt;&gt;male #5: Do you get model releases for all
of your photos [inaudible].

00:45:04.099 --> 00:45:06.690
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yeah, I'm so glad you asked
that.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:12.960
He asked if I get model releases and this,
I can't even tell you how important it is

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.460
to get model releases.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:20.349
When I first started my career I was in college,
I was just traveling around taking photos

00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:25.359
and I wasn't getting model releases cause
I figured, I'm not doing anything with these

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:27.000
I'm just building a portfolio.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.589
And it's really easy to do this and this goes
back to fear cause it sucks getting a model

00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:33.359
release, doesn't it?

00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:34.620
It's not fun.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.690
So I made an excuse and didn't get them.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.359
And then Adobe asked me and then I started
getting recognition for my work and Adobe

00:45:42.359 --> 00:45:47.099
wanted to do something with my images and
I had no images cause none of them had model

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:48.510
releases.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:54.780
So the moral of the story is, I think it's
very, very, very important to get releases,

00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.140
I think also you do not need to use intimidating
language.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:07.520
So like the Getty releases and a lot of them
have this crazy legal language, it's actually

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.780
legally better to have a simple release that
just says Catherine Hall can use, and I'm

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.960
coming out with a model release app by the
way.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.620
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: It's been submitted to the

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.620
Apple store.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:23.180
But it's called Top Model Release and actually
using a device even makes it less intimidating

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.609
somehow and it's really, really easy to get
model releases that way and organize them.

00:46:27.609 --> 00:46:34.530
But you can create custom releases and my
release is literally, "Catherine Hall photographed

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.849
me on May 16th, 2012.

00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:40.700
She has permission to use the images in any
purpose in any form."

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.119
Period.

00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:47.470
Versus like she can distort my face and da,
da, da, da, da.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:51.960
Cause you don't really, in a lot of ways it
makes it actually less legal when you have

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.750
those really convoluted long releases.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.750
Yeah?

00:46:54.750 --> 00:47:00.559
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Yeah, he's asking about
models asking about consideration.

00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:05.880
Asking for money, asking for, and I think
that really depends on the individual.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:12.130
When I photograph people it's, I'm giving
a lot too.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:16.329
It's kind of, we're building a relationship
and they're as invested as I am.

00:47:16.329 --> 00:47:20.770
When I'm going into these people's homes I'm
giving them prints.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:26.770
So if you're traveling a lot I recommend carrying
a Polaroid so you can give someone the print

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:31.160
automatically cause otherwise you have to
send it and it takes long and you don't wanna

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.160
do it.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.430
But if you can give them something right away
that's great.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:39.930
But what I found is as soon as you start negotiating
money, especially before you start shooting,

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:41.900
then it sort of taints the relationship.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.579
Cause then all of a sudden it's not about
an experience anymore.

00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:49.849
It's about them hiring, being hired for a
job.

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:54.520
However, in the past, what I have done if
I've seen someone being really needy or a

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.110
family being needy, I've gone through the
whole thing with no expectation of money and

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.660
then at the end given them something as like
a token of my appreciation.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.630
But I've had people ask me for money right
out of the gate and I'll actually avoid photographing

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:11.760
those people because I know their intentions
not pure.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.789
And usually those people are the ones that'll
be like, "Alright, you get one shot."

00:48:15.789 --> 00:48:20.600
And then you wanna take more and they want
more money and it's just not a very good experience

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.750
for anyone.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.490
And the photographs don't feel authentic and
real.

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:29.579
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: So he's asking basically
how often, what proportion do I feel the images

00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:32.900
can be kept natural or do I need to go in
and retouch.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:38.539
I think this is very, very subjective and
I like images on both extremes from other

00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:39.539
photographers.

00:48:39.539 --> 00:48:46.510
For me, personally, I like bringing out, I'm
trying to tell a story with every single image

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:51.140
so I use Photoshop as a tool to illustrate
that message of that story.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:55.920
So, for example, the boy with the dust all
over him, if I hadn't retouched the dust to

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.920
really come out it wouldn't, it would feel
a little flat.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.500
So I wanted to accentuate, yes he was dirty,
he was at Burning Man, it was crazy, it was

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.819
hot, you know?

00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:12.839
So I want that story and I use the retouching
as a way of sort of making sure that message

00:49:12.839 --> 00:49:14.131
is given to the viewer easily.

00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:16.390
&gt;&gt;male #6: My question is do you actually
see them

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:19.730
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Oh, do I see them retouched
or do I see them

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.079
&gt;&gt;male #6: Yeah when you take the picture
do you see them

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.470
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: That's a really, really
great question.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:30.049
He's asking if I see it in advance or if it's
something I do during post, come up with a,

00:49:30.049 --> 00:49:33.369
I definitely do not see it retouched.

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:36.940
Some people will, they will shoot it knowing
how it's gonna end up.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:42.079
For me, I'm very organic with the way I shoot
and I'm not, I'm just thinking about getting

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:46.039
the best I can in camera and that's, my focus
is on that.

00:49:46.039 --> 00:49:51.210
So the lighting, the composition, all these
different factors and then when I pull in

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:55.760
the image I think, alright, that's when the
second tier of the creative process starts.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.490
Is where do I wanna take this with the retouching?

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:03.650
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Alright, well thanks everybody
for coming out tonight and thank you Catherine.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:04.650
&gt;&gt;Catherine Hall: Thank you guys so much.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:04.651
[Applause]
