00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
A person can be healthy...but can a country
be healthy?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.880
Population health indicators measure the distribution
of health throughout a given population.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.929
These kinds of indicators are what sociologists
use to study patterns in health outcomes across
different social groups.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.099
Because, like all things sociological, we
want to understand the wider patterns of health.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:26.100
So, if you’re trying to figure out your own risks for a
disease, it might be useful to know the average number
of people like you who have contracted that disease.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.780
Or if you’re a policymaker trying to figure out
which diseases to spend money and time on,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.580
you might want to know which disease has
the highest mortality rates in your country.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.440
As we talked about last time, there are lots
of factors that can affect your personal health –
and those factors often vary by social group.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.360
So when we explore population health across
social dimensions like age, gender, race, ethnicity,
class or religious beliefs,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.800
we come up with differences in what health
looks like for that group.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.340
Let’s start by talking about what some of the
important indicators for population health are,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.180
and see what these indicators tell us
about health in the United States.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:11.140
[Theme Music]

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.630
When we talk about the importance of
health, there’s an underlying implication here:
humans don’t want to die.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.340
The healthier you are, the more likely you
are to put off a visit from the grim reaper.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.560
Which is why we use the length of someone’s
life as one indicator of how healthy they are.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.440
One crude indicator of a population’s health is
life expectancy – the average number of years
an individual can be expected to live.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.760
And you can use life expectancy to get a
better understanding of what kind of person
tends to live longer,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.820
which is a pretty good proxy for the
overall health of a community.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.800
For example, in the United States, and for
that matter, almost every other country on the
planet, women tend to outlive men.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.080
For men in the United States, the average life
expectancy at birth is 76.3 and for women, it’s 81.2.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.760
And White Americans tend to live longer than
Black Americans.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.200
79 is the life expectancy for White Americans,
whereas for Black Americans the number is
quite a bit lower: 75.5

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.180
In addition to helping us to understand the overall
health of the population, or portions of it, life expectancy
also tells us something about its future.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.280
Do we expect to have more elderly citizens
in the future?

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.230
If people live longer, what does that mean
for the retirement age?

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.900
This has implications for the structure of work
and leisure and helps when planning the costs of
things like social security and medicare.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.800
Another important population statistic is
the birth rate for different populations.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.240
Just as life expectancy helps us answer questions
that go beyond health, the birth rate tells us about more
than just the reproductive health of a population.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.760
There are a couple different ways to measure
the number of kids being born.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.860
One is a straight birth rate: in a given
year, how many live births are there for every
thousand people?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.040
But that might not be the right measure.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.240
After all, if people are living a lot longer,
there are going to be more people who are
living past child-bearing age.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.700
This would make the birth rate go down, even if the
number of kids each generation has stays constant.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.020
Because of this, we might use what’s called a total
fertility rate: the number of live births for every 1000
women between the ages of 15 and 44.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.960
Total fertility rates let us compare birth
patterns across generations.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.980
A larger generation might have more kids –
after all, more parents means more kids – but there
might be fewer kids per person, or vice versa!

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.240
The number of births per year in the US has
been declining over the last 50 years.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.720
Some of that is because there are fewer women
of childbearing age now than there were when
the Baby Boomers were having kids.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.640
But even If we look at the total fertility
rate, that has also gone down,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:34.380
from 68.4 births per 1000 women of
childbearing age in 1980, to 62.5 births per
1000 women of childbearing age in 2015.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.840
Now, if we split up the population up by race,
we see big differences in the total fertility rate.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.580
It’s highest for Hispanic Americans, at 71.5 births
per 1000 women, and lowest for non-Hispanic
White Americans, with a total fertility rate of 59.3.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.840
And even here you can see the influence of
society on human procreation.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.500
Access to things like contraception and prenatal
care, and cultural traditions, shape the number
of children that are born.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.240
So, birth rates tell us about the categories
of people entering our society, but we might
also care about who is leaving us, too.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.040
Mortality rates are death rates in a given
population, and they can tell a lot us about
its overall health.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.980
For example, infant mortality rates are often
a key indicator of a group’s health.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.580
Because infants are especially vulnerable
to disease and malnutrition,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.150
their mortality rate tells us something about
broader issues, like poverty levels, and availability
and quality of food, water, and health services.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.860
For example, Black Americans are more than
twice as likely as White Americans to die in infancy,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.700
partially because these children are more
likely to be born in lower income families.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.520
Lower economic standing generally means
less access to health care,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.480
and there’s clear evidence that Black Americans
are much less likely to have access to quality prenatal
care than other racial and ethnic groups.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.000
Overall mortality rates can also help us understand
the pace of deaths in a community:

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.380
in a given year, how many people in that group
have died as a fraction of that population?

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.960
Mortality rates tend to be higher for men
than women, and higher for Black Americans
than White Americans…

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.560
which might not too surprising given what we
learned about life expectancies for those groups earlier.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.980
In the US, the leading causes of mortality
for both men and women of all races are heart
disease and cancer.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.920
But what kills men and what kills women differs
a bit as we get further down the list of leading
causes of death.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.520
Men are much more likely to die from an unintentional
injury or accident than women are and also have
much higher suicide rates than women.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.910
There are mortality differences by race as
well, with Black men more likely to die from
homicide than other groups.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.500
Drilling down into this data a little more, we can also
understand population health by looking at the types
of diseases that different groups are susceptible to.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.380
Morbidity refers to the presence of disease,
while morbidity rates tell us something about the
frequency of disease within a given population.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.660
Diseases can also be co-morbid, meaning that
two diseases coexist in a person at the same time.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.680
Comorbidity rates tell us how common it
is for people in a population to have any two
diseases at one time.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.640
One thing to note here: incidence of a disease is
not the same thing as the prevalence of a disease.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.440
Incidence refers to the number of new cases reported
in a given time frame, whereas prevalence refers to the
number of existing cases in the population.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.100
So, put another way, incidence tells you how
likely you are to contract a disease.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.540
Prevalence tells you how many people already
have it.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.120
And I’m sure it won’t surprise you to hear that
morbidity rates within a society can vary a lot across
demographic groups for a number of reasons,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.780
like the racial makeup of a society or the
age profile of those people.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.580
Different subpopulations may have different
genetic makeups that can influence health.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:29.080
For example, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is
associated with higher rates of BRCA-1 mutations,
which is a genetic risk factor for breast cancer.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.420
Different populations may also be exposed to
health risks resulting from their physical environments,
like the neighborhood they live in.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.900
For example, Black children in the US have
higher asthma rates relative to White children,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.760
partly because of higher exposure to environmental
toxins in their homes and neighborhoods.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.500
But it can be hard to separate the effects of
something like pollution from other aspects of where
a person lives that might also affect their health.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.860
People who live in poorer neighborhoods are
more likely to be exposed to more pollution

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.360
– so is it the pollution or the poverty
that leads to worse health outcomes?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.180
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to look at
this question more closely.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.860
Three American economists, Janet Currie, Michael
Greenstone, and Enrico Moretti

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.800
figured out a way to separate out the effects of
pollution on kids’ health by looking at what happened
when the government cleaned up toxic waste sites.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.300
All across the United States there are places
known as Superfund sites –

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.400
areas that the government has deemed so polluted
that it requires an expensive, government funded
cleanup to make the place habitable.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:30.340
As of 2015, the EPA found that 53 million Americans
live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, including
about 18% of children under the age of 5.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:37.680
Currie, Greenstone, and Moretti compared health
outcomes for children who were born near a Superfund
site either before or after it was cleaned up

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.460
and found that kids born after the clean up
were 20% less likely to be born with a congenital
anomaly, like heart murmurs.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:51.260
Since the only thing that had changed with the
clean up was the level of pollution, this study tells us
something you might already have guessed:

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.840
being exposed to toxic chemicals at a young
age can be really damaging to your health.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.980
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.660
There are lots of environmental risks that
can be damaging to your health – houses with
lead paint, second hand smoke, smog.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.920
Because these risk factors tend to be more
common in low income areas, they disproportionately
affect less educated and minority Americans.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.320
And low income Americans are also more likely to
experience social environments that pose health risks.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.600
For example, the amount of stress a person
is under can have a big effect on both their
mental and physical well-being.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.020
And these groups are more likely to live or work in
high stress environments, like neighborhoods with
higher crime rates, or unfulfilling jobs with long hours.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.740
Another social factor that affects health?
Racism and discrimination.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:40.640
Sociologist David Williams has connected this unique
psychosocial stressor to increased rates of stress-
related disease morbidity among African Americans,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.100
like heart disease that may contribute to
higher risks of early mortality.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:51.040
All of these factors – the individual risk
factors, environmental risk factors, social risk
factors, and psychological risk factors –

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.160
combine to help explain the health disparities we
see across different social groups in the US.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.400
Today, we learned about some of the indicators
that help us measure health for different populations,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.750
including life expectancy, birth rates,
mortality rates, and morbidity rates.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.000
Then, we talked about three contributors
to health disparities:

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.660
individual factors like genetics, physical factors
like pollution, and social factors like stress.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:20.340
