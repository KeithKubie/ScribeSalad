repetition compulsion and this is the
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.209
repetition compulsion and this is the
fact that we all tend to repeat the same

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219
fact that we all tend to repeat the same
 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.310

dysfunctional patterns of behavior again
and again and again and again even

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
and again and again and again even
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540
and again and again and again even

you say something back and you very
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.730
you say something back and you very
quickly confront what's the pattern that

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
quickly confront what's the pattern that
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.210

you find yourself typically getting into
note that pattern that's your cycle of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
note that pattern that's your cycle of
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.550
note that pattern that's your cycle of
discord and they're typically of some

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
discord and they're typically of some
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.800
discord and they're typically of some
sort of common thread of trigger

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810
sort of common thread of trigger
 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.020
sort of common thread of trigger
something that tends to commonly trigger

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
something that tends to commonly trigger
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.720
something that tends to commonly trigger
those kinds of conflicts it might be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730
those kinds of conflicts it might be
 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.910
those kinds of conflicts it might be
that in your relationship you always

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
that in your relationship you always

anything that even subtly demonstrates
 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.760
anything that even subtly demonstrates
exclusion now you're back in that cycle

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770
exclusion now you're back in that cycle
 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.880
exclusion now you're back in that cycle
of discord so how do you deal with the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890
of discord so how do you deal with the
 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.640
of discord so how do you deal with the
repetition compulsion first step is to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
repetition compulsion first step is to
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.800
repetition compulsion first step is to
become aware of your cycle of discord

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810
become aware of your cycle of discord
 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.790
become aware of your cycle of discord
who says what who says what next because

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800
who says what who says what next because
 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.880
who says what who says what next because
the moment you know that pattern you can

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890
the moment you know that pattern you can
 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.400
the moment you know that pattern you can
decide to break any little node in that

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410
decide to break any little node in that
 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.580
decide to break any little node in that
cycle and you break the whole cycle

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590
cycle and you break the whole cycle
 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.470
cycle and you break the whole cycle
here's the frustrating part though the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480
here's the frustrating part though the
 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.690
here's the frustrating part though the
honest-to-goodness frustrating part the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700
honest-to-goodness frustrating part the
 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.180
honest-to-goodness frustrating part the
moment you try to break that pattern

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190
moment you try to break that pattern
 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.050
moment you try to break that pattern
it's going to feel extremely

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060

uncomfortable for you because this is
 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.250
uncomfortable for you because this is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.240
moment you try and change that cycle
you're in a sense threatening a part of
