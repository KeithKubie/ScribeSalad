00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.410
So you now know how the recipient
can trust that the message

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.350
actually came unaltered from its sender,
but how do the sender and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.030
recipient each know that the other
is who they say they are?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.030
Could a hacker be
masquerading as a doctor

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.860
in order to get access to health data
and use it to file fraudulent claims?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.580
Assuring trust to prevent this is
the job of the Registration Authority.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.750
Their job isn't particularly
technically complex.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.600
It's driven by policies intended to
assure that the background of people or

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.170
entities is thoroughly verified before
they're issued a pair of certificates.
