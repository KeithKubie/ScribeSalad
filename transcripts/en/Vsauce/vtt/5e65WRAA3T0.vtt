00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.120
Happy birthday, hair's on fire.
And what is this dog worried about?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.100
Oh great.
It's episode 43 of IMG!

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.559
Say "cheese."

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.629
Oh. Also on Tumblr this week I found
this price sticker.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.310
Oh Pooh.
Here's an awesome plan I found on "dvice."

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.090
Not designs for a skyscraper,
but for an Earth scraper

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.390
in Mexico City; an inverted building that
goes down into the ground,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.430
300 meters deep.
We've all seen contrails before,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.530
clouds formed when the vapour in hot
airplane exhaust cools high up in the cold

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.719
air and the moisture

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.980
condenses, but there's also the opposite

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.499
of a contrail. When a plane flies low enough
through a cloud that

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.989
already exists and its hot exhaust turns
the visible water

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.260
back into water vapour, making a distrail, a racing part of the cloud.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.140
Wow, look at these legs on
Spain's Minister of Defense.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.800
Are her feet on the wrong legs?
I mean, the big toe

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.600
on your right foot is on the left,
but hers is on the right...?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.620
Well, it turns out it's actually an optical illusion.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.810
Her legs are not actually crossed.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.760
MoIllusions.com explains it with this.
.gif break.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.860
MoIllusions.com, by the way, is a great
site if you're not already checking it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.790
out frequently.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.300
Earlier this week it covered cinemagraphs,
a special artistic type

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.390
of animated .gif where video has been frozen
and only a small portion of it is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.500
allowed to still be

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.910
a motion picture.
The effect is quite dramatic

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.180
and beautiful.
This is an advertisement for tires,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.970
but maybe also for pandas?
And the only thing worse than being

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.470
alone is being watched.
Eeyore's nose is a cute little

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.660
face and in earlier episode I talked
about cats

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.880
wearing bread.
Well, according to BuzzFeed, they are now

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.780
also wearing tortillas, pitas and the birds

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.920
are catching on.
Of course, proper dental care is the real feline

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.860
challenge, so let's take a moment
for cats brushing their own teeth.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.510
Owls can be pretty darn scary,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.590
but charts, on the other hand, can be
pretty darn informative.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.629
I love charts has analyzed
the Alanis Morissette's idea of

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.849
"Irony," as well as mathematical dance moves.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.340
And this helpful chart showing powers of 10
from one septillionth

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.760
to one septillion. They also pointed
me to a recipe for tiramisu on Cooking

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.049
for engineers.com.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.069
Rather than list directions,
this method flows from left to right

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.290
grouping actions to ingredients. People like
getting their picture taken as they fall down

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.260
Splash Mountain

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.420
and we've all seen the funny planned
poses, but this game cube one was new

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.970
to me

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.750
and the shades are really what makes it.
Oh, there it is.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.209
My tongue cleaner with guaranteed export
quality. Just as nice of course

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.139
are these shoes: metal detectors, keyboards,

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.329
aliens and sandwiches;

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.459
which I like to put inside bags that
make them look mouldy,

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.810
covered in bugs or make my lunch a notebook,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.019
a pair of jeans or comfy, comfy felt.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.359
Chart Bin is another great info fix source.

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.030
Their interactive nuggets of wisdom show off
things like the only countries that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.530
border

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.030
only one other country or which side of
the road

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.269
people drive on by country.
In the United States,

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.419
we drive on the right hand side. In the
UK and Ireland they drive on the left and

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.909
in Spain they drive on the right,

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.530
but in Kenya they drive on the left,
which is where I am

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.250
right now. Nairobi, Kenya. There's some
really great YouTubers out here doing some

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.989
cool stuff and I put some links to my favorites
in the description. The same site

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.470
also has a global map,
where you can mouse over a country to see

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.669
its national flag. I've been busy trying
to memorize the flags of

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.229
all these countries using the National
Flag's quiz app on my phone,

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.970
but this site is awesome 'cause it also gives you
the reason the flag looks the way it

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.470
does.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.199
Interesting fact: the flag of Mozambique
is the only flag on

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.010
Earth that has a modern weapon on it.
That's right. It's got an AK-47

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.370
on the flag representing their
independence. Pretty neat, right?

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.520
And as always,

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.880
thanks for watching.
