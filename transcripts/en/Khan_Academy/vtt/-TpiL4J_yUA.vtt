00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.110
Simplify 3a times a to
the fifth times a squared.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.950
So the exponent
property we can use here

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.210
is if we have the same
base, in this case, it's a.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.110
If we have it raised
to the x power,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.400
we're multiplying it
by a to the y power,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.870
then this is just going to
be equal to a to the x plus y

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.370
power.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.411
And we'll think about why
that works in a second.

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:24.730
So let's just apply it here.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.040
Let's start with the a to
the fifth times a squared.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.490
So if we just apply
this property over here,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.940
this will result in a to
the fifth plus two-th power.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.480
So that's what those guys
reduce to, or simplify to.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.700
And of course, we still
have the 3a out front.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.950
Now what I want to do is
take a little bit of an aside

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.930
and realize why this worked.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.760
Let's think about what a to the
fifth times a squared means.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.880
A to the fifth
literally means a times

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.170
a times a times a times a.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.890
Now, a squared literally
means a times a.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.120
And we're multiplying
the two times each other.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.796
So we're multiplying these
five a's times these two a's.

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:12.920
And what have we just done?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.110
We're multiplying a
times itself five times,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.375
and then another two times.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.560
We are multiplying
a times itself.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560
So let me make it clear.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950
This over here is
a to the fifth.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.410
This over here is a squared.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.020
When you multiply
the two, you're

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.870
multiplying a by itself
itself seven times.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.180
5 plus 2.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.680
So this is a to the seventh
power. a to the 5 plus 2 power.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.945
So this simplifies to 3a
times a to the seventh power.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.460
Now you might say, how do I
apply the property over here?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.790
What is the exponent on the a?

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.490
And remember, if I just
have an a over here,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.920
this is equivalent to
a to the first power.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.830
So I can rewrite 3a is 3
times a to the first power.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.710
And now it maybe makes
it a little bit clearer.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.804
A to the first power-- and
the association property

00:02:08.804 --> 00:02:10.720
of multiplication, I can
do the multiplication

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.100
of the a's before I
worry about the 3's.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.940
So I can multiply
these two guys first.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.992
So a to the first times
a to the seventh-- I

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.450
just have to add the exponents
because I have the same base

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.020
and I'm taking the
product-- that's

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.250
going to be a to
the eighth power.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.110
And I still have
this 3 out front.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.840
So 3a times a to
the fifth times a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.530
squared simplifies to
3a to the eighth power.
