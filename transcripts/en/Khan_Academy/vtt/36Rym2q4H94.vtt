00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.140
Let's say we were to take a
little excursion to the moon.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.070
And so here we are
sitting on the surface

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.740
of the moon-- that's the
surface of the moon right there.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.800
And with us to our excursion to
the moon we brought two things.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.500
We brought ourself
a concrete brick.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.940
So that's my brick
right over there,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.070
although it's orange-- we'll say
it's an orange concrete brick.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.630
And I also bought a
bird feather with us.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.150
So this is the bird feather.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.900
And then my question
to you is, if I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.210
were to hold both the
brick and the bird feather

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.370
at the same time, and I were
to let go of both of them

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.580
at the same time and ask
you, which one of them

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.590
would hit the surface of the
moon first, what would you say?

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.090
Well, if you based it on
your experience on Earth--

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.740
on Earth if you were to
take a break and a feather,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.560
a brick would just
go straight down.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.716
A brick would just
immediately fall to the Earth,

00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:58.090
and it would do
it quite quickly.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.880
It would accelerate
quite quickly.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.790
While a feather would
kind of float around.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.380
If you had a feather on Earth,
it would just float around.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.420
It would go that way,
then it would go that way,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.370
and it would slowly make
its way down to the ground.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.190
So on Earth, at least
in the presence of air,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.010
it looks like the brick
will hit the ground first.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.780
But what would
happen at the moon?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.050
And what's interesting about the
moon is we have no atmosphere.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.440
We have no air to
provide resistance

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.210
for either the brick
or the feather.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.550
So what do you think
is going to happen?

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.350
So your first temptation
would say, well,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.120
let's just use the
universal law of gravity.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.950
So what is the force of
gravity on the brick?

00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:47.670
Well, you could
calculate that out.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.980
The force of
gravity on the brick

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.210
is going to be equal to big G
times the mass of the moon--

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.660
I'll say that's m
for mass and then

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.850
the subscript is lowercase
m for moon-- the mass

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.490
of the moon times the
mass of the brick divided

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.810
by the distance
between the brick

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.015
and the center of
the moon squared.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.210
Fair enough.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.460
That's the force on the brick.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.176
What's going to be the force
due to gravity on the feather?

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:29.550
Or another way to
think about it,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.180
the weight of the
feather on the moon?

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.180
We'll do the same calculation.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.870
The force on the
feather is going

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.970
to be equal to big G times
the mass of the moon times

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.370
the mass of the feather
divided by the distance

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.150
between the center
of this feather

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.120
and the center of
the moon squared.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.560
That's the distance,
and then we square it.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.834
So if you look at both
of these expressions,

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.250
they both have
this quantity right

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.530
over here-- G times the
mass of the moon divided

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.730
by the distance
between this height

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.150
and the center of
the moon squared.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.730
So they both have this
exact expression on it.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.910
So let's replace
that expression.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.130
Let's just call that
the gravitational field

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.830
on the moon.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.655
So if you apply this
number by any mass,

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:25.180
it will tell you the weight
of that object on the moon,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.420
or the gravitational
force acting downward

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.990
on that object on the moon.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.310
So this is the gravitational
field of the moon.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.280
So I'll just call it g sub m.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.420
And all it is, is all of
these quantities combined.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.940
So if we simplify
that way, the force

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.700
on the brick due to
the moon is going

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.020
to be equal to that lowercase
g on the moon-- normally

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.710
we use this lowercase g for
the gravitational constant

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.887
on Earth, or the
gravitational field on Earth,

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:52.970
or sometimes the acceleration
of gravity on Earth,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.470
but now we're
referring to the moon.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.320
That's what this lowercase
subscript m is doing for us.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.240
So it's equal to that times
the mass of the brick.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.200
For the case of the feather,
the force on the feather

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.670
is equal to all
of this business.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.665
So that's the g sub m times
the mass of the feather.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.440
So we're going to assume,
which is a reasonable thing

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.760
to assume, that the
mass of the brick

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.810
is greater than the
mass of the feather.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.160
What's going to be
their relative forces?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.720
Well, here you have a greater
mass times the same quantity.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.327
Here you have a smaller mass
times the same quantity.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:41.910
So if the mass of
the brick is greater

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.243
than the mass of the feather,
it's completely reasonable

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:47.130
to say that the force
of gravity on the brick

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.000
is going to be greater
than the force of gravity

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.690
on the feather.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.370
So if you do all
this, and everything

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.527
we've done to this point
is correct, you might say,

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.610
hey, there's going to be
more force due to gravity

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.090
on the brick, and that's
why the brick will

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.690
be accelerated
down more quickly.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.500
But what you need to
remember is that there

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.820
is more gravitational
force on this brick.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.070
But it also has greater mass.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.170
And we remember the
larger something's mass

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:20.490
is, the less acceleration it'll
experience for a given force.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.210
So what really determines how
quickly either of these things

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.282
will fall is their
accelerations.

00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:26.990
And let's figure out
their accelerations.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.660
I'll do this in a neutral color.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.102
We know that force is equal
to mass times acceleration.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:37.560
So if we want to figure out
the acceleration of the brick--

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.470
or we could write
it the other way.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.130
If we divide both
sides by mass, we

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.630
get acceleration is equal
to force divided by mass.

00:05:50.147 --> 00:05:51.730
And acceleration is
a vector quantity,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.780
and force is also
a vector quantity.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:02.550
And in this situation, we're
not using any actual value.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.400
But if I were using
actual values,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.250
I would use negative numbers for
downwards and positive values

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.000
for upwards.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.720
But we're not using
any signs here.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.470
But you could assume that
the direction is implicitly

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.700
being given.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.690
So what's the
acceleration of the brick?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.780
That's a lowercase
b I was writing.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.160
The acceleration of
the brick is going

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.720
to be equal to the force
applied to the brick divided

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.174
by the mass of the brick.

00:06:32.174 --> 00:06:34.340
But the force applied to
the brick, we already know,

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.300
is this business
right over here.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.640
It is little g on the moon,
the gravitational field

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.100
on the moon, times
the mass of the brick,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.930
and we're dividing that
by the mass of the brick.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.260
So the acceleration on
the brick on the moon--

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.530
the acceleration that the
brick will experience--

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.750
is the same thing as that
gravitational field expression.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.370
It is g sub m.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.080
This is how quickly it would
accelerate on the moon.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.980
Now let's do the same
thing for the feather.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.480
I think you see
where this is going.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.780
The acceleration
of the feather is

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.520
going to be the force
on the feather divided

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.240
by the mass of the feather.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.530
The force on the
feather is g sub m--

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.022
g with the subscript m--
times the mass of the feather,

00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:25.480
and then we're
going to divide that

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.210
by the mass of the feather.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.490
And so, once again,
its acceleration

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.660
is going to be
the same quantity.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.660
So they are both going to
accelerate at the same rate

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.600
downwards, which
tells us that they'll

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.440
both hit the ground
at the same rate.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.406
They'll both accelerate from
the same point at the same time,

00:07:41.406 --> 00:07:43.030
and they'll both have
the same velocity

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.071
when they hit the ground.

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.640
And they'll both hit it
at the exact same time,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.940
despite one having
a larger mass.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.640
So the reality is, because
it has a larger mass,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.470
it has a larger gravitational
attraction to the moon.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.840
But because of its
mass, that attraction

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.730
gives it the same acceleration
as something with a smaller

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.380
mass.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.790
So any mass at the same level
on the surface of the moon

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.920
would experience the
same acceleration.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.780
So now the quite
natural question

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.150
is, wait, Sal, if that's true
on the moon it should also

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.130
be true on Earth.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.380
And it would be true on Earth.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.500
If you did this
exact same experiment

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.800
and you evacuated all
the air from the room,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.425
so that you didn't
have air resistance,

00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:26.850
and you took a
brick and a feather

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.360
and let them go
at the same time,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.230
they will both hit the ground
at the exact same time, which

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.877
is a little unintuitive,
to imagine a feather just

00:08:33.877 --> 00:08:35.460
plummeting the same
way a brick would.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.100
But it would if you
evacuated all the air.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.502
And so the reason why
we see this over here,

00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:42.460
and I think you get the
sense because I already

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.482
talked about
evacuating the air, is

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.690
that the difference between
the brick and the feather

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.224
is all due to air resistance.

00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:51.390
If you took the same brick,
or if you took something

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.170
that had the same
mass as the brick,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:59.647
and you were to flatten it out
so it has more air resistance--

00:08:59.647 --> 00:09:01.980
but let's say it has the same
mass, let's say this thing

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.350
and this thing have
the same mass--

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.770
this thing would
fall slower than

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.110
that because it'll have
more air resistance.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.470
It has more air to collide
into, to provide resistance

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.180
as it falls.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.900
And if you took a feather and
if you compacted it really,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.400
really, really, really, really,
really small-- the same mass

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.370
as a feather, but you made
it so small that it could

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.340
cut through the air-- you'll see
that it will drop a lot faster.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.980
So the real difference between
how things fall on Earth--

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.960
if you had no air,
they would all

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.220
fall at the exact same rate.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.464
It's only because of air that
they fall at different rates.

00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:37.630
And the air does two things.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.280
For constant
pressure-- so if you

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.210
have two objects that
have the same shape,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.430
the object that is heavier,
that has more weight,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.910
will fall faster
because it'll overcome--

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.930
it'll be able to provide more
net force against the air

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.560
pressure.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.540
If you have something
that has the same weight,

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.430
the object that is
more aerodynamic

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.520
will fall faster-- the
one that cuts through,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.670
the one that has the
least air resistance.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.140
And as a little
experiment that you

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.900
can try in the comfort of
your own room right now,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.490
take a book like this.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.452
And you could drop it.

00:10:11.452 --> 00:10:13.410
And then you could take
another piece of paper,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.989
or even a little postcard or
something, and you drop it.

00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:17.530
And you'll see, of
course, a postcard

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.980
will fall much slower
than this book.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.730
But what you do is put the
postcard on top of the book

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.830
so that the book is
essentially breaking

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.110
all of the air resistance
for the postcard.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.812
And what you'll see is, if
you put it on top of the book

00:10:30.812 --> 00:10:32.270
and you were to
drop it, you'll see

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.040
that they fall at
the exact same rate.
