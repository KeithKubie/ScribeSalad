NARRATION BY SYLVESTER
MCCOY: There once

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.400
was a clever and passionate girl
who wondered away from a fair.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.370
She ventured inside
a wagon-like ride,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.615
and what did she find in there?

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:37.280
"The Squickerwonkers."

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.790
Welcome my dears said
a voice from the winds,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.650
to the fabulous squicker show.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.060
You dropped in your coin,
so now you can join.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.760
Come up here and
see how it goes.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
The girl looked
around to see who

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.660
it was that spoke
with a sinister tone.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.200
But she saw not a soul
save a rat and old.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.297
It seemed that the
girl was alone.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.280
And once there came
a noise from above,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.770
nine figures swung
down from the shadows.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.790
Their bodies hung loose
as a strung from a noose

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.568
as if all nine were
hanging from gallows.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.290
Come on to the stage.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.910
Don't be afraid.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.090
Meet my motley crew.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.260
They may have their vices
but those are my spices

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.446
and I suspect so do you.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.450
The head of the
Squickerwonker troop

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.111
is known as Papa the Proud.

00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:02.110
MARK DOUGLAS: All right.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.484
That was a little bit
of "Squickerwonkers"

00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:06.900
by Evangeline Lilly, and that
was actually her reading it,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.270
which I was really
impressed that she

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.479
could do that with her voice.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.810
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could please

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.643
give a warm welcome.

00:02:11.643 --> 00:02:16.330
You know her as "Freckles"
aka Kate from "Lost," Tauriel

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.870
from "The Hobbit," and she just
finished filming "Ant Man,"

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.940
I believe.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.400
She's the queen of comic con.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.030
Give it up for Evangeline Lilly.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.350
EVANGELINE LILLY: You
have awesome hair.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.340
Awesome hair.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.620
I expected everyone at Google
to have awesome hair like that.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.414
So many of you are
so much more boring

00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:41.580
than I thought you would be.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.417
TODD WOMACK: Come on,
give them a chance.

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:42.490
Give them a chance.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.400
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.070
Way to insult the audience
right out of the gate.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.243
EVANGELINE LILLY: All right.

00:02:45.243 --> 00:02:46.120
But wait.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.417
You guys are amazing.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.399
I'm so happy to
be here at Google.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.483
TODD WOMACK: There you go.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:52.523
EVANGELINE LILLY: Google.

00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:53.858
G-O-O-G-L-E. You know G.

00:02:53.858 --> 00:02:56.610
TODD WOMACK: Dot com.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.070
MARK DOUGLAS: I was trying
to get a feel for it.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.770
I was there.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.730
I was with you.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.641
This is on right?

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:02.140
Hello?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.640
OK.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.560
Good.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.614
TODD WOMACK: Who did
the voice over for that?

00:03:05.614 --> 00:03:08.030
EVANGELINE LILLY: That was the
incredible Sylvester McCoy.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.540
Some of you might know
him from Doctor Who.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.580
And he was Radagast
in "The Hobbit."

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.599
He did an amazing job.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.640
TODD WOMACK: You really
brought out the big guns.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.420
I mean, Peter Jackson
did the forward

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.760
to this book and Fran
Walsh and Philippa Boyens

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.471
who basically write the movies.

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.970
EVANGELINE LILLY:
I was lucky enough

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.365
to be hanging out with big
guns when I made the movie,

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.090
so on their downtime, they'd
invite me over for dinner,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.580
and I'd be like, you want
to just look at this?

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.200
I just brought something over.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.710
It just happened
to be in my purse.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.380
And then they were
wonderful enough

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.550
to give me their
feedback and input

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.540
and actually Fran Walsh
and Philippa Boyens

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.720
worked tirelessly with me.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.550
They had no extra time,
but they spent ours

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.280
helping me edit the
book and make it

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.280
everything it should be.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.130
Because I initially wrote
the story when I was 14,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.710
and it wasn't the poem
that exists in this book.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.890
I had to go through a ton of
rewrites to make it publishable

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.970
and make it something
they would essentially

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.960
introduce a series of 18 books.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.970
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, wow.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.049
TODD WOMACK: So that
leads us to, well,

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.590
I guess we've gotten
to get a picture

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.184
from the VO and the audio what
kind of the piece is about.

00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:14.475
MARK DOUGLAS: The general tone.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:17.360
It's much scarier that way.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.225
I was like, ooh.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.600
EVANGELINE LILLY:
I just recently

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.350
was that the Brooklyn
Library, and I

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.940
started by asking the kids in
the audience, how many of you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.130
have read the book,
and almost everyone

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.670
had because we had
prepped the kids.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.130
And then basically--

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.400
MARK DOUGLAS: Did your
teacher make you read it?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.350
EVANGELINE LILLY: And did she
tell you to say you love it?

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.850
TODD WOMACK: What
age were the kids?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.910
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Second graders,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.400
impossible to
control, by the way.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.900
Second graders are crazy.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.717
But I asked them was a scary?

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.300
Did you guys think
the book was scary?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.250
And they were all like
no, it's not scary.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.380
We're so tough.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.760
And then I did it this
way with the audio

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.086
and I actually read it
instead of Sylvester.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:58.720
And like I could tell that
within the second or third

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.410
page, they were all like,
I'm kind of scared now.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.045
TODD WOMACK: They're like
this is lady is nuts.

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:07.420
EVANGELINE LILLY: I don't know
if it was me or the music.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.070
MARK DOUGLAS: Mommy, why is the
pretty lady freaking us out?

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.620
EVANGELINE LILLY: Oh,
speaking of pretty lady.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.840
It was the cutest
thing in the world.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.560
There was this little
boy in the front row.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.226
I mean, it was like, if you were
the little boy in the front row

00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:19.160
and he sat there
through the whole thing.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.480
It was so distracting and
he just kept doing this,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.655
you are so beautiful.

00:05:26.597 --> 00:05:28.930
I was wearing bright red
lipstick that day and you know,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.720
little kids are suckers
for bright red lipstick.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.490
TODD WOMACK: Are they?

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.781
MARK DOUGLAS: I think there's
a couple guys up here who

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.360
are fighting the urge
to say that right now.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.617
You were talking about big
guns, speaking of guns,

00:05:39.617 --> 00:05:40.450
like what do you do?

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.699
TODD WOMACK: Why did you
bring out the big guns today?

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.070
MARK DOUGLAS: Was it just
all that bow and arrow work?

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.100
EVANGELINE LILLY: No.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.270
I mean, everyone
is always like so

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.600
what did you get a trainer
and all that stuff for roles,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.500
and I don't do
any of that stuff.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.249
I'm the laziest fit
person in the world.

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:57.290
TODD WOMACK: Do you do
like the "Rocky IV" thing?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.220
MARK DOUGLAS: What is
the secret to that?

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.750
because I got the
lazy part down.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.450
EVANGELINE LILLY:
The secret to that

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.630
is that for a good
10 years of my life,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.670
I was obsessed with fitness.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.000
So there's a lot of
muscle memory in here.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.440
So like now like
since I had a kid,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.100
there's just not
so much time for it

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.720
or nearly as much
passion for it.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.610
But there was a
period in my life

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.700
where I would be the
person in the gym

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.830
for like two or three
hours at a time.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.032
MARK DOUGLAS: In one day.

00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:27.990
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.950
Sometimes twice a day.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.140
MARK DOUGLAS: I do
that over a month.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.544
EVANGELINE LILLY: I loved it.

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:31.460
I loved it for awhile.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.120
MARK DOUGLAS: But this is
really, this is your passion.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.120
Is this kind of an
area that you want

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.345
to go in more so
than acting even.

00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:42.480
EVANGELINE LILLY: Well, for
anybody who is in any way,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.090
shape or form a fan of mine,
they probably know that

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.690
I'm kind of vocal about
the fact that I'm not--

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.230
I don't love acting and it's--

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.110
MARK DOUGLAS: What?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.950
EVANGELINE LILLY: I know.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.260
Every struggling actress out
there just wants to lynch me.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.630
They probably hate my guts,
but it just sort of happened,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.990
and I got lucky, and
this thing happened,

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.860
and I was sort of taken aback
by it, and I didn't love it.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.932
It wasn't for me
really, and so I've

00:07:05.932 --> 00:07:08.265
continued to do it because
it's a pretty decent day job.

00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:08.790
It pays OK.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.790
TODD WOMACK: Not to bad.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.980
Yeah.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.320
Yeah.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.380
EVANGELINE LILLY:
But in the meantime,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.150
I've been working
very hard on pursuing

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.220
my actual dream and
my actual passion,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.970
which is to be a writer.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.550
In fact, in the last
let's see five years,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.980
I have spent a year and
three months acting,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.396
and I have spent the rest of
the time, full time as a writer.

00:07:29.396 --> 00:07:32.020
MARK DOUGLAS: But it was kind of
interesting for somebody who's

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.930
not crazy about acting, you're
in some pretty cool stuff.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.020
EVANGELINE LILLY: I know.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.390
Isn't that great?

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.332
MARK DOUGLAS: I mean,
but it's kind of nice.

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:39.790
You don't have to
feel the pressure

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.292
like take every like
girlfriend part, or you know?

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:45.630
You get to do some
really cool stuff.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.110
I mean like, "Ant Man,"
I mean, do you just

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.020
have nerds camping out
in your front yard?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.650
EVANGELINE LILLY:
You know, what's

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.100
wonderful is I sort of come to
the promised land of geekdom

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.730
because I was--

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.210
MARK DOUGLAS: You're at
the very core of it now.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.992
EVANGELINE LILLY:
I found my people.

00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:07.200
TODD WOMACK: These people
are working on their phones

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.600
while they're listening.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.190
That's how geeky we are.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.190
EVANGELINE LILLY: They're
20%-ing right now.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.512
TODD WOMACK: Oh, look at that,
throwing around the lingo.

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:16.470
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:16.970
I know.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.360
I was not like the
cool girl in school.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.390
I broke the--

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.635
TODD WOMACK: Was
that your opinion?

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:25.510
EVANGELINE LILLY: No.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.657
For real.

00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:26.590
TODD WOMACK: You
grew up in Canada.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.330
EVANGELINE LILLY: I did.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:27.829
I did.

00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:33.150
And I will admittedly say that
because the cool girls didn't

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.799
want a pretty girl wandering
around that was outside

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.419
of their core, because
that's a threat,

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.330
I was technically allowed to
be called a part of the group,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.950
but never, like never fit.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.480
And I was always a loner,
and I was always on my own

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.200
because those girls would
want to get together

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.670
and I read "16 Magazine" and
go through wedding magazines

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.180
and talk crap about other
girls and probably boys,

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.390
and I just couldn't go there.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.420
I couldn't get to it.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.765
I was busy writing
"The Squickerwonkers."

00:09:05.765 --> 00:09:07.140
MARK DOUGLAS: So
this wasn't just

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.020
something you pulled
out of a drawer, that

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.930
was like part of
it was made, but it

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.180
wasn't in like limerick style.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.096
EVANGELINE LILLY: It
wasn't in limerick style,

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.040
but it was poetry.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.510
In fact, at EvangelineLilly.com,
the original poem

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.744
is posted because it's so weird.

00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:25.160
I was actually preparing-- I'm
doing a book tour right now

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.610
for the book.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.070
MARK DOUGLAS: As
we speak right now.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.270
EVANGELINE LILLY: As we speak.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.660
Literally.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:27.930
This is it.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.750
TODD WOMACK: This is it.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.250
Yeah.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.780
EVANGELINE LILLY:
And I kept sort

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.640
of preparing for these
readings I was going

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.400
to do with these kids,
and it was so strange

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.650
because every time I would
prepare what would come out

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.800
of my mouth and out of my
mind was the original poem.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.040
It gets so ingrained in my
mind, it's so much the original

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.617
that it's the one that
I keep coming back to.

00:09:46.617 --> 00:09:48.200
So I posted it on
my website because I

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.616
thought it would
be fun for people

00:09:49.616 --> 00:09:51.110
to see the evolution
of the story.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.950
MARK DOUGLAS: And did
it really come out,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.580
I mean, do you feel
confident, like does

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.830
is a really look like you
always imagined it or better?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.890
EVANGELINE LILLY: Better.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.860
Weirder.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.525
Creepier.

00:10:03.525 --> 00:10:04.660
TODD WOMACK: So yeah.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.930
Starting there, how
about your partnership

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.320
with Johny Fraser-Allen
who illustrated the book.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.060
He's like a Weta Workshop guy.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.560
Right?

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.492
And that's who does all the
effects, physical and digital.

00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:16.200
EVANGELINE LILLY:
These people are geeks.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.723
They know who Weta Workshop is.

00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:17.798
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:17.874
Right.

00:10:17.874 --> 00:10:18.374
Do you?

00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:19.070
Do you?

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.250
MARK DOUGLAS: I feel
an hour here, lady.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.530
EVANGELINE LILLY: She's
like, I'm not that geeky, OK?

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.913
MARK DOUGLAS: "Lord
of the Rings."

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.950
They do all the "Lord
of the Rings" stuff.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.640
TODD WOMACK: You need a
period-accurate crossbow,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.344
call up the Weta Workshop.

00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:31.510
So he was working there,
and you guys were obviously

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.670
spending time together
because of "The Hobbit

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.990
or what happened?

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.720
EVANGELINE LILLY: No.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.110
It didn't quite work that way.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.390
I was at Weta Workshop, so
Weta Workshop works similarly

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.620
to Google in the
sort of 20% notion.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.504
They really encourage
their artists

00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:46.670
to pursue their own passions
and their own projects,

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.330
and they sort of
facilitate that.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.250
And I was walking around this
incredibly-creative, inspiring

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.939
building, sort of like being on
the Google campus where people

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:55.980
come here probably, I'm
sure you're used to this,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.985
and they're like, oh, my god.

00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:58.693
I would want to work
somewhere like this.

00:10:58.693 --> 00:10:59.600
This is amazing.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.330
And that was me.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.829
I was that obnoxious
person at Weta.

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:03.820
I just being like
this is incredible.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.750
It's this creativity factory,
and I'm a creative person,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.990
and I've always wanted
to create my own things.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.489
And that was one
of the tough things

00:11:11.489 --> 00:11:16.342
about being an actor was, like
I'm not good at being the one

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.300
that someone says, do
this and then I go do it.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.420
I'm better at saying, do this.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.520
So I just wanted to create
something of my own,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.660
and I've been dreaming
about and claiming

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.480
that I was going to
become a writer for about,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.982
at that point, three years
since around the last season

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.940
of "Lost," saying this
is what I'm going to do.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.184
I'm going to go be a writer.

00:11:34.184 --> 00:11:35.600
But man, like just
going and being

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.960
a writer is a lot harder
than it might seem,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.852
so I showed the head of Weta
Workshop, Richard Taylor,

00:11:40.852 --> 00:11:42.560
some of my children's
storybooks and said

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.240
is there any illustrators
in this building who

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.050
might be interested
in partnering with me.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.133
And Johnny fell in love
with "The Squickerwonkers"

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:49.700
and created this
concept painting

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.910
with these marionette puppets.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.050
And I was like, they were not
originally marionette puppets.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.447
Originally, all I knew was
they were human but not human,

00:11:58.447 --> 00:12:00.280
and I knew they were a
bit creepy and weird.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.450
But he brought the wagon,
he brought the puppets,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.050
he brought the teddy, he
brought all this stuff

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.280
to the table that
enhanced, and just

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.030
it sort of felt
like what I didn't

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.770
know I was holding in my
brain came out of his hand.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.480
It was incredible.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.050
MARK DOUGLAS: So
should we tell people

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.591
a little bit about
what the story is.

00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:20.120
It's basically a
kind of bratty girl

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.860
who comes across these
marionette characters

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.310
and they sort of teach her
a lesson-- spoiler alert--

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.072
and turn her into one of them.

00:12:29.072 --> 00:12:30.030
EVANGELINE LILLY: Whoa.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.570
Spoiler alert.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:30.970
MARK DOUGLAS: That's
a big spoiler.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.640
EVANGELINE LILLY: Oh, my god.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.190
That's it.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.260
That's the end.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.511
No need to buy the
book now, guys.

00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:38.010
MARK DOUGLAS: You can buy them.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.220
It's over there at
the end, by the way.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.386
EVANGELINE LILLY: So it's
clearly a cautionary tale,

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.760
but I'm always emphasizing
that it's intentionally

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.520
a modern-day cautionary tale.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.660
In that the old
cautionary tales,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.810
just programmed into kids'
minds this polarized worldview

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.440
that there's an us and a them.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.269
There's bad guys and good guys.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:55.810
And you want to be
with the good guys

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.180
so you can go kill all the bad
guys, or punish the bad guys,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.347
or not associate with them
and exclude the bad guys.

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.304
TODD WOMACK: Let them
hang out with your group,

00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:04.587
but not in the inner circle.

00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:05.420
MARK DOUGLAS: Right.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:05.670
Right.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.500
EVANGELINE LILLY: I got you.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.080
MARK DOUGLAS: I see
where this came from.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.563
EVANGELINE LILLY:
You got my number.

00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:09.500
You got my number.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.850
I'm just getting back
at all the popular--

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.070
MARK DOUGLAS: It's
all coming together.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.778
EVANGELINE LILLY:
--girls with this book.

00:13:14.882 --> 00:13:16.340
Essentially what
I wanted to do was

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.910
to reprogram kids to realize
no, nobody's perfect.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.790
Nobody's all good.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.900
Nobody's all bad.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.345
We've all got a bit
of vice within us,

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.360
and we've all got some
great qualities about us.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.790
And it's all about, first
of all, accepting and loving

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.420
yourself as you are, which
the protagonist of this series

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.250
is the Squickerwonkers
who are extremely flawed,

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.280
sort of creepy,
weird-looking puppets.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.290
So having heroes who don't
look typically like heroes,

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.570
but then also remembering
and teaching children

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.760
that there are consequences
to your actions

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.430
and so understanding
yourself and knowing yourself

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.740
on both sides, the
dark and the light,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.860
is how you sort of can
live a happier life

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.770
and not befall the sort
of end that befalls Selma.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.680
So I just think I
look around me and I

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.500
see a lot of entitled,
disillusioned teenagers.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.040
Oh, yeah.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.190
You guys know.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.574
MARK DOUGLAS: Teenagers.

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:09.990
EVANGELINE LILLY:
And I think part

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.110
of that is because they were
taught in their storybooks

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.760
that if you're a good person,
life turns up perfectly,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.450
and everything is great in your
world, and that's not real.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.070
And they were also not told
that good people can have flaws.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.403
There's just a lot of things
missing in the programming,

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.470
and I think that that's
one of the reasons why

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.590
if something bad happens
to them, it's like-- me?

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.577
I'm a good person.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.660
That can't happened to me.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.186
That's not right.

00:14:32.186 --> 00:14:32.980
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.012
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:14:34.012 --> 00:14:36.470
MARK DOUGLAS: You just go around
telling kids shit happens.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.230
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Shit happens, dude.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.702
Life's tough.

00:14:39.702 --> 00:14:41.410
The sooner you wake
up to it, the better.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.270
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.810
The one part that really kind
of creeps me out about this

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.620
is, they all have
coins for our eyes.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.880
There's something
really odd about that.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.730
What does that have to do with--

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.290
EVANGELINE LILLY:
It's a great story.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.420
So remember how I told
you I brought this

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.510
to a friend and Philippa and
they helped me with editing?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.120
When I brought them the
Illustrated version,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.467
Philippa almost peed
pants her pants,

00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:07.550
not from excitement, from
stress because she said,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.299
you can't do this.

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:09.612
You can make this book.

00:15:09.612 --> 00:15:11.320
Everyone's going to
think it's "Coraline"

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.520
because all these puppets
had buttons for eyes.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.084
And I'd never seen "Coraline."

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.250
I was a bit out of the loop.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.970
And so she made me go sit
down to watch the film.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.290
And so after the book had been
already finished illustrated,

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.070
I mean, it was done and
dusted, I watched "Coraline"

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.340
and had a conniption
because obviously, I

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.110
realized I can't repeat
what's already been done.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.990
So we had to find
something else to put

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.340
on the eyes that wasn't buttons.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.982
And of course, creative
projects usually

00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.940
have a mind of their own,
and they find the way

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.970
to the best solution.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.700
And what happened was I
throw this idea of maybe we

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.130
could put coins on their eyes
and then Johnny Fraser-Allen

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.850
lit up and said, you realize
that in Irish culture

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.260
you put coins on a person's
eyes at their wake.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.560
It's like a symbol of death.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.250
And I was thinking,
that's so good.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.000
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.670
Better than buttons.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.910
Buttons are for
losers, "Coraline."

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.870
So what were like growing up--

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.380
EVANGELINE LILLY:
There are people

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.450
in the audience who
didn't like that.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.240
There is like an
oh, don't go there.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.970
TODD WOMACK: I don't care.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.010
I'll get fired any day now.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.810
It doesn't matter.

00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:18.840
So growing up and maybe
after your formative years,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.600
were there are sort of
darker influences like books

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.170
and movies that you were
into like, we were talking

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.956
about some of the
ones that we like,

00:16:25.956 --> 00:16:29.050
like the original "Hobbit," the
animated series was a little,

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.780
especially the goblin
things, so creepy.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.280
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
this looks a lot

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.170
like-- has kind
of a similar style

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.869
to that cartoon, some of the
animation in the drawing.

00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:40.160
EVANGELINE LILLY: Who wasn't
a huge fan of "Labyrinth?"

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.118
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, yeah.

00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:43.170
EVANGELINE LILLY:
"The Dark Crystal."

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.313
Does anyone in here--
god, it's magic.

00:16:46.313 --> 00:16:46.813
Yeah.

00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:50.490
Come on, with his bulging wand?

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.970
That scared me as a child.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.770
That was the scariest
part of the movie.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.290
Who was?

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.710
Michael Jackson?

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.094
I'm so glad it was Bowie.

00:17:01.094 --> 00:17:02.510
MARK DOUGLAS: I
found out recently

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.460
that a lot of women of a
certain age first male crush

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.370
was David Bowie in "Labyrinth."

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.690
EVANGELINE LILLY:
In "Labyrinth".

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.024
Yes.

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:10.730
MARK DOUGLAS: And
that's so weird.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.469
He's so androgynous
and kind of like-

00:17:12.469 --> 00:17:13.510
EVANGELINE LILLY: I know.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.890
MARK DOUGLAS: He's got
like Tina Turner hair.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.015
My wife is like, oh my god.

00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:18.848
EVANGELINE LILLY: But
he's an old, grown man

00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:20.359
hitting on a child.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.819
and all us little
11-year-olds were like, whoa.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.319
I feel something in my pants.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.880
I don't understand
what's happening.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.545
MARK DOUGLAS: It's the
Bowie voice probably.

00:17:28.545 --> 00:17:28.980
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.460
That helps.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:29.860
That helps.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.484
And he can do that
thing with the ball.

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:34.900
MARK DOUGLAS: You want to go
to Chuck E. Cheese with me?

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.882
Chuck E. Cheese.

00:17:36.882 --> 00:17:39.290
EVANGELINE LILLY: And
what about Edward Gorey.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.590
Does anyone here
know Edward Gorey.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.270
He was the best.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.770
MARK DOUGLAS: So
you were definitely

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.850
into like the
creepy kid stories.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:45.952
TODD WOMACK: Were
you specifically

00:17:45.952 --> 00:17:46.570
into that kind of stuff?

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.360
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Not specifically.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.180
It's just sort of
like across the board.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.940
I mean, I like a
good "Giving Tree."

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.750
Everybody does.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.180
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, sure.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.490
EVANGELINE LILLY: And there's
nothing creepy by "The Giving

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:53.990
Tree."

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.589
I like it all.

00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.880
I had somebody asked me can
we do an interview with you

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.890
where you basically
tell everybody

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.150
why fluffy books suck.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.260
And I was like, no.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.984
I mean, I think
kids need all of it.

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.400
They need the
spectrum, and I just

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.775
see that there's a lot of sort
of kitten bubble gum books

00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:09.510
out there.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.740
And so we need the balance.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.460
We need it all.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.960
TODD WOMACK: And this is the
first of many in this series.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.460
Yes?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.376
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yes.

00:18:16.376 --> 00:18:17.134
18 to be specific.

00:18:17.134 --> 00:18:18.800
MARK DOUGLAS: Have
you written them all?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.430
EVANGELINE LILLY: No.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.040
I know what they'll
all-- like I know

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.920
the story for the
first nine, and then

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.920
I know the plot like the
gist for the final nine,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.800
and the reason
for 18 as somebody

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.600
who worked on "Lost" saying
this was really important

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.642
is because I have an
overarching plan for the series.

00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:40.100
I'm not just shooting
from the hip.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.040
MARK DOUGLAS: Bam.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.420
Burn.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.310
TODD WOMACK: You
heard it here first.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.600
EVANGELINE LILLY:
They had a plan.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.974
I'm not knocking them, but I
know y'all didn't think they

00:18:48.974 --> 00:18:50.255
had a plan.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:52.380
TODD WOMACK: They're going
to come out of the wagon

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.400
and it's 1907.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.970
What?

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.040
MARK DOUGLAS: I won't ask you
too many "Lost" questions,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.840
but did you ever in
the middle of a scene

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.776
go-- what's going
on? in that show?

00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:07.840
EVANGELINE LILLY:
All the fucking time.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.450
All the time.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.520
By the way, after season
three, they lost me completely.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.440
I was like, I don't--

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.040
MARK DOUGLAS: You were like,
I'm in the corner writing

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.010
"Squickerwonkers."

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.480
And can we get her on set?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.940
EVANGELINE LILLY:
l literally would

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.487
come to set with
alcohol because I

00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:22.070
was like that's the
only way I'm going

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.270
to make sense of this scene.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.306
I get a little lips--
a little loopy.

00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:26.055
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:27.850
We're getting all kinds of dirt.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.250
I mean we both love--

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.340
EVANGELINE LILLY: It's
an adult audience, right?

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.450
MARK DOUGLAS: I mean,
we both love that show.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.820
We stuck with it
to the very end.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.940
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thank you.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.100
Thank you for sticking with us.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.280
MARK DOUGLAS: My wife
was like after what

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.071
happened with Vincent,
but didn't Vincent--

00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:40.300
he was upended at
the end, right?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:40.800
Oh, no.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.600
I said I wasn't going to
go on a "Lost" rampage.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.310
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Your wife particularly

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.600
wants to know about Vincent.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.219
I mean, of all the
questions she could ask me,

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:49.010
she wants to know what
happened to Vincent?

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.218
MARK DOUGLAS: She likes dogs.

00:19:50.218 --> 00:19:51.720
I don't know.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.220
OK.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.220
Back to "The Squickerwonkers."

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.650
So when you write
a children's book,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.090
do you consult with
child psychologists

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.310
or just kind of go for it?

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.660
Because some of our
videos on our channel

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.810
involve puppets and stuff
that kind of looks like a kid

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.920
might want to watch that,
and then the next thing

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.836
you know, the puppet
will be like doing drugs,

00:20:13.836 --> 00:20:16.570
and we're like is this-- not
that any of the Squickerwonkers

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.070
do drugs.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.778
EVANGELINE LILLY: One
of them does smoke,

00:20:18.778 --> 00:20:20.260
and I got a lot
of flack for that.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.967
MARK DOUGLAS: So do you
worry about that stuff?

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:25.050
EVANGELINE LILLY: You know,
if I worried about it,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.890
this would not exist.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.890
I'm tell you, everybody told
me, everybody told me no.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.246
Nobody would publish this book.

00:20:32.246 --> 00:20:33.620
People were like,
we're not going

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.076
near that with a 10-foot pole.

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:39.050
I had a really big publisher
outright tell me not like,

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.620
in my opinion, or for this
particular publishing company,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.660
it was outright, you
will not be successful.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.180
That book won't sell.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.306
And I just thought, I
think I'm on to something.

00:20:52.306 --> 00:20:55.420
This has got to
be good if people

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.360
have such an extreme
reaction to it.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.266
So no, I didn't consult
any child psychologists.

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:04.932
TODD WOMACK: That was
his question, by the way.

00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:06.522
MARK DOUGLAS: No,
I'm just curious.

00:21:06.522 --> 00:21:07.980
EVANGELINE LILLY:
But I did explore

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.230
a lot of the psychology
of childhood,

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.310
and I call it a
playground drama because I

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.950
think we forget that the
scariest people on earth

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.570
are children.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.070
"Lord of the Flies" might be
the scariest story in the world

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.876
because kids are crazy.

00:21:21.876 --> 00:21:23.750
They don't have any
sense of right and wrong.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.416
They don't have any
sense of boundaries,

00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:27.470
and they just like
attack each other

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.690
on the playground for
absolutely no reason.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.010
But adults are never
talking to kids

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.840
about all that
craziness and darkness

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.430
that they deal
with day in and day

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.112
out with each other in their
social circles, and their lost.

00:21:39.112 --> 00:21:41.570
They're left to sort of navigate
those waters on their own.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.070
And so I did think a ton
about child psychology

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.535
when I was writing the book.

00:21:45.535 --> 00:21:49.520
TODD WOMACK: And when
you go into this place

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.840
where you're writing these
books-- I know you have a child

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.870
and you have a lot of
projects and so forth.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.230
Where do you go, like
physically and emotionally

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.656
to like work on these?

00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:05.620
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Because I am a mom,

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.460
I don't go where I would
probably otherwise, go

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.770
and I think otherwise I
would like go on a trip,

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.560
or I would go to some beautiful
location day in and day out

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.510
and be doing it there.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.240
Instead, I work from home.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.870
I have a home office.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:19.730
It's beautiful.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.350
I mean, it overlooks a jungle,
and it's very inspiring,

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.220
and it's lovely.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.500
But my son regularly
through the day

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.350
comes pitter-pattering
up the stairs

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.730
and comes mommy do you
want to play with me,

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.271
and we talk and we have a moment
and then he goes away again.

00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:34.850
And the nice thing is that
he has this really delusional

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.660
concept that everybody has two
parents at home all the time.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.810
Because he has a
stay-at-home dad, and he's

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.160
very, very fortunate
in that way.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.900
So that's one of the ways
that I kind of am juggling it

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.030
all is that I work from home
so that I'm also very present

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.960
for my son even though I'm
working ridiculously hard.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.170
TODD WOMACK: You're writing
a demented children's book

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:52.900
in the other room.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.650
EVANGELINE LILLY: By
the way, he loves it.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.430
He's three and a
half, and he loves it.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.790
MARK DOUGLAS: That's great.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.341
I really think it's a fun book.

00:22:58.341 --> 00:22:59.965
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Like, when she gets--

00:22:59.965 --> 00:23:02.050
as soon as she turns into
the puppet at the end

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.932
and then the curtain closes in a
sort of morbid way of like they

00:23:04.932 --> 00:23:07.390
end it with like the curtain
closes, and you're like, what?

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.770
That's it?

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:08.340
She's gone.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.970
There's like a rat
dusting the stage.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.270
And my son, it's
his favorite page.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.130
It's nothing but a
rat dusting the page,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.040
but it's like she got locked.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.700
Yeah.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.280
Because he gets
locked in his room

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.912
all the time for
throwing tantrums.

00:23:22.912 --> 00:23:23.870
TODD WOMACK: All right.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.920
Is there a little piece you in
any of the characters, maybe

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.530
the main character?

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.460
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Everyone asked that.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.150
Everyone always asks me that.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.130
TODD WOMACK: No,
when you were young.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:29.700
EVANGELINE LILLY: It's fair.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.620
It's a fair question.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.120
Everything I write now by the
way, everything I write now,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.600
I am the protagonist.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.800
I am fully self-involved
in that way,

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.380
but this one I wrote before the
self-involvement settled in.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.580
I was too young, and
it isn't really me,

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.490
but my favorite character
is Greer the Greedy

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:46.460
because she's bonkers.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.810
I mean, she's just nuts,
and I love nuts people.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.680
In fact, that was a note
that I got for my publisher.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.510
In the book, it actually
says that she's crazy,

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.250
and they were like,
you can't say that.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.041
You can't say that.

00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:59.030
That's politically
incorrect because you

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.220
don't talk about crazy
people because there

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.649
are actual crazy
people out there.

00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:03.440
I was like, I know.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.000
I have so many in my family.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.326
That's why I want
to talk about them.

00:24:08.326 --> 00:24:10.522
MARK DOUGLAS: If you
were a Squickerwonker,

00:24:10.522 --> 00:24:11.480
what would you name be.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.127
There's a lot of alliteration,
Papa the Proud, Mama the Mean.

00:24:15.127 --> 00:24:16.960
EVANGELINE LILLY: If I
was a Squickerwonker,

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.211
I would be Sally
the Self-involved.

00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:24.012
MARK DOUGLAS: Todd,
what about you?

00:24:24.012 --> 00:24:25.220
TODD WOMACK: Todd the Turtle.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.640
I don't know.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.510
EVANGELINE LILLY: Turtle?

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.825
TODD WOMACK: Slow.

00:24:26.825 --> 00:24:27.690
EVANGELINE LILLY:
That's not a vice.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.760
TODD WOMACK: Slow and lazy,
and I like lettuce a lot.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.570
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.900
I think maybe like
Mark the Motionless.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.540
We both have a similar problem.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.390
EVANGELINE LILLY: They're
emphasizing their laziness.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.830
TODD WOMACK: On that note,
we do have a couple of mics

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.865
out here, guys, and if you
want to ask a question,

00:24:42.865 --> 00:24:44.490
feel free to approach
one of those mics

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.810
and we'll call on you
when it's your turn.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:51.615
In the audio book, I noticed
does it ever go full-on song?

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:53.170
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Not full-on song.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.211
There are moments where
the Squickerwonkers start

00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:58.060
humming out of tune because
they can't sing very well.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.640
But no, I mean, there
is an audio book

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.790
that will be exclusively
for sale on audible.com,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.363
well not exclusively on
audible, because they've put it

00:25:06.363 --> 00:25:09.740
on all different platforms
like iTunes and Amazon.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.290
But there will be
an interactive book

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.947
exclusively for
sale on iTunes where

00:25:12.947 --> 00:25:15.030
there will be little
interactive elements for kids

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.860
like you can change the sepia
images in the book to color

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.932
or maybe little
bits of animation.

00:25:21.932 --> 00:25:23.390
There's a little
pop-up video by me

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.180
and the Illustrator at the end
where I kind of help parents

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.960
figure out how to talk to their
kids about this crazy book

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.300
because I think they'll be
a bit at a loss at the end

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.510
when their child says, what?

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.660
And they go, I don't know.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.740
Let's not read it again.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.000
So there's a video there to
help sort of guide parents

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.100
through that conversation.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.500
By the way, speaking of
having to read it over

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.460
and over and over, again
that was one of our goals.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.490
Johnny and I when we set
out to make this book,

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.780
we were like, OK, how many
parents dread reading time

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.040
with their kids because
they're like I'm

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.990
going to have to read where
is spot for the 700th time,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.180
and I'm over it.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.479
So we were like, we've got
to make a book that even

00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:02.770
parents would be like, let's
read "The Squickerwonkers"

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:03.540
again, you know?

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.360
So it was like appealing to
hopefully all generations,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.780
like all demographics,
parents, teenagers.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.600
My 14-year-old
niece, when I first

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.020
read it to her, not because
it's really her demographic just

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.260
because I love my
niece and we're close.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.092
I read it to her and she
was like, oh, it's so good.

00:26:21.092 --> 00:26:21.800
It's really good.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.490
And then she got really
embarrassed and upset

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.380
for a moment out of nowhere,
and she goes, wait a minute.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.990
Auntie, is this a
book for little kids?

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.620
And I was like,
well, technically.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.120
But I think it's for
everybody, like for anybody.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.710
I like it.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.876
I'm an adult, and I like it.

00:26:37.876 --> 00:26:41.320
She was like, I was so
embarrassed for a minute

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.610
because I really like
it, and I really want it.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.715
I was like awesome.

00:26:45.715 --> 00:26:46.340
That was great.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.381
TODD WOMACK: It's $14.95.

00:26:47.381 --> 00:26:49.650
MARK DOUGLAS: I think it's
nice that you give kids

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:55.340
credit to sort of grasp some
of these concepts of like,

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.250
the main character,
she's not all bad,

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.875
and the Squickerwonkers
aren't all bad,

00:26:58.875 --> 00:26:59.980
and they're not all good.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.830
I mean, I know my mom let
me read Stephen King when

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.040
I was a kid just because she
was happy that I was reading

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.850
anything, and I'm pretty
disturbed because of it,

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:12.690
but I do read.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.820
EVANGELINE LILLY: Hey, you got
four million followers, man.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.020
Disturbed works for you.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.360
TODD WOMACK: So
is there any plan?

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.340
I see the audio is great and
the visuals are really awesome.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.052
Is there any plan to make
an animated thing out of it?

00:27:26.052 --> 00:27:29.380
EVANGELINE LILLY: Do any
of you know who LAIKA is?

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.640
Do you know the company LAIKA?

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.650
You know the
company LAIKA, yeah,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.650
like they made "Coraline"
and "ParaNorman"

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.342
and the amazing "Boxtrolls."

00:27:36.342 --> 00:27:37.800
Have you guys seen
"Boxtrolls" yet?

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.630
It is so good, so, so good.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.310
I've had conversations
with them about it,

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.429
and I'm not ready
to make a movie yet

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:47.720
and they're not really ready
to make a dark movie right

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.962
now because they just
made three in a row.

00:27:50.962 --> 00:27:52.670
MARK DOUGLAS: You
could get Peter Jackson

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.730
to make a three-hour
version of this one book.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.065
EVANGELINE LILLY: A
three three-hour version.

00:27:59.065 --> 00:28:00.140
MARK DOUGLAS: No, sorry.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.792
Go ahead.

00:28:01.792 --> 00:28:03.500
EVANGELINE LILLY: Hey,
man, I'm with you.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.360
I was a huge "Hobbit" fan, OK?

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.800
And it was supposed to
be two movies originally,

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.522
and then when they turned it
into three, I was like oh, no.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:10.605
no, you didn't.

00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:12.200
MARK DOUGLAS: They shot
those like did 1984.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.495
I know it was a long time ago.

00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:14.100
EVANGELINE LILLY: I know.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.600
I know.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.840
People were like, oh, are
you sad that it's over?

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.093
I was like, well, I was six
years ago when it ended.

00:28:20.093 --> 00:28:24.710
MARK DOUGLAS: I'm like, I
didn't even want to be in it.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.970
Did you have to
audition for that?

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.610
I feel like he
kind of hand picks,

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.100
he has like visions of people.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.600
EVANGELINE LILLY:
This is not a lie.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.390
This is the truth.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.820
He told me in 2004 he
wanted me to play an elf.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.580
He was like, if I had been
casting "Lord of the Rings"

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.690
before you like
became an actress,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.170
I would have made you an elf.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.110
MARK DOUGLAS: Like if he saw
you on the street he'd be like,

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.700
you're an elf.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.910
EVANGELINE LILLY: Seriously,
but at the moment,

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.780
it was the most crushing thing
he could have ever said to me.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.460
I mean, I felt like I could
have dropped to my knees

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.960
and bawled my eyes
out because I was

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.350
like I would have
died to be an elf.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.020
I wanted to be an
elf all my life.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.750
And then you just gave it to
me and took it right away.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.630
But then like 10
years later, he was

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.320
like hey you want to be an elf?

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.670
MARK DOUGLAS: So he
just added an elf.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.505
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah, he did.

00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:10.796
He was like I'm just going
to put an elf in this movie.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.450
MARK DOUGLAS: And elves are
the best looking in that world,

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:15.950
right?

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.520
TODD WOMACK: By far.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.010
By far.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.820
EVANGELINE LILLY: I don't know.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.390
I don't know.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.970
Humans like Aragorn?

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:20.649
Come on.

00:29:20.649 --> 00:29:22.440
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
you've got to go Viggo.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:22.883
Where's the king?

00:29:22.883 --> 00:29:24.448
He's got to be the most
handsome guy in the whole world.

00:29:24.448 --> 00:29:24.685
EVANGELINE LILLY:
He's pretty hot.

00:29:24.685 --> 00:29:26.643
TODD WOMACK: Does anybody
else have a question?

00:29:26.643 --> 00:29:28.345
Any questions?

00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:30.720
Go ahead to the microphone so
we can get it on film here.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.210
EVANGELINE LILLY: Don't be shy.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.290
You with the
humongous earphones.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.719
TODD WOMACK: Start over here.

00:29:35.719 --> 00:29:38.010
EVANGELINE LILLY: Those are
in case I was too obnoxious

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.859
and he needed to
like muffle his ears

00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:41.150
and not have to listen to this.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.525
AUDIENCE: Actually
those are so I

00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:45.280
could make good use
of my walking up here.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.500
In terms of other
demented children's books,

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.970
can you recommend some more?

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:51.897
I'm thinking "Belloc's
Cautionary Tales"

00:29:51.897 --> 00:29:53.105
and things like that as well.

00:29:53.105 --> 00:29:54.646
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Yeah, well, I mean,

00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:57.120
I actually can say that
when I was a little girl,

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.690
I was quite literarily deprived
because my parents were blue

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.810
collar, small-town
Canadian people.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.010
They did not have
university educations.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.632
I don't even remember ever
being read to us a child.

00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:10.840
TODD WOMACK: Not even on
the back of a Labatts bottle

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.830
or something like that?

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.030
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah,
something like that.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:13.730
TODD WOMACK: Canada jokes.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.605
MARK DOUGLAS: Like watch
the hockey game, eh?

00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:16.563
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:30:16.563 --> 00:30:17.070
Exactly.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.954
But thankfully my grandfather
gave me some good dark books.

00:30:19.954 --> 00:30:22.370
So I don't have like a massive
library of them in my mind,

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.911
but I mean, more recently, since
I started writing this book,

00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:27.160
I've become more aware
of who's out there now.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.310
They weren't so much
as a kid or at least

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.270
I wasn't aware of them.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.570
But like Gris Grimly,
he's incredible

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.410
and his art is amazing.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.467
He has this weird way of
making creepy art look cute.

00:30:38.467 --> 00:30:40.050
It's great because
it like tricks kids

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.716
into thinking it's a
cute story and then

00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:45.340
they're always kind
of horrific and scary.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.420
And then there's like
Neil Gaiman, of course.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.060
He's like the king of dark,
and I mean, even as an adult,

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.130
his stories scare
the crap out of me.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.656
They're very, I
mean, then he goes

00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:55.780
to the whole other extreme.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.420
And he's always said like
stories are meant for escapism

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.864
so don't limit where
people escape to.

00:31:01.864 --> 00:31:03.280
If they want to
go somewhere dark,

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.726
let them go somewhere dark.

00:31:04.726 --> 00:31:06.662
MARK DOUGLAS: How about
a question over here?

00:31:06.662 --> 00:31:08.120
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.600
I'm a huge, huge fan.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.060
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thank you.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.300
AUDIENCE: And I
don't have any kids,

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.299
but I still bought two
books for my future kids.

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:14.982
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thank you.

00:31:14.982 --> 00:31:17.865
AUDIENCE: Don't
have two so-- I have

00:31:17.865 --> 00:31:19.445
a "Lost" question
if you don't mind.

00:31:19.445 --> 00:31:20.700
EVANGELINE LILLY:
You know, it's funny

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.674
when they said, does
anyone have any questions,

00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:24.715
you can go to the mic and
nobody went to the mic.

00:31:24.715 --> 00:31:27.131
I was going to be like, guys,
you can ask me about "Lost."

00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:29.497
MARK DOUGLAS: I was about
to say the same thing.

00:31:29.497 --> 00:31:30.830
AUDIENCE: I stuck it to the end.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:34.660
It really opened me up
as a person, I think.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.690
And I have a question
about Jack and Sawyer.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.190
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Of course, you do.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.662
MARK DOUGLAS: We
were going to call

00:31:41.662 --> 00:31:42.210
you Freckles the whole time.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:42.540
EVANGELINE LILLY: I'm
not going to tell you

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.800
who's a better kisser if
that's what you're asking.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.700
AUDIENCE: Something more
metaphysical than that.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.450
EVANGELINE LILLY: More
physical than that?

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.620
MARK DOUGLAS: Metaphysical.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.810
AUDIENCE: Metaphysical.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.560
So suppose you were not tied
to your character in the story,

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.870
but you were you
as in real life.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.650
Who would you have a crush
on in terms of the character?

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.130
MARK DOUGLAS: Do you know
what metaphysical means?

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.288
You work at Google, man.

00:32:07.288 --> 00:32:10.560
EVANGELINE LILLY: What
he means is, which chakra

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.400
would respond to
which of those men?

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.127
MARK DOUGLAS: Jack or Sawyer.

00:32:16.127 --> 00:32:16.710
Easy question.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:17.240
Come on.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.073
EVANGELINE LILLY: It's
not an easy question.

00:32:19.073 --> 00:32:20.270
OK, let's see.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.190
I mean, I like rugged men.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.550
I like men who typically
are kind of like manly men.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.394
No offense to all
the metrosexual men

00:32:28.394 --> 00:32:29.060
in the audience.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.220
You're awesome too.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.550
And I've dated my fair
share of metrosexuals,

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.940
but they're both manly.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.400
It's just like the whole stupid
good guy, bad guy argument,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.400
and of course, everybody
knows the girls

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.880
typically like the bad
guy when they're young

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.230
and then they get their hearts
stomped on enough times,

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.490
and they go maybe I'll
settle for a good guy.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.210
And then they stick with the
good guys, and like oh, no.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.060
I just want a good guy.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:52.610
That's all it is.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.610
I just really wanted a
good guy when really they

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.560
just settled for them.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.768
And then when the bad guys
come around, they're like,

00:32:57.768 --> 00:32:58.780
oh, I'm kind of tempted.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.660
No, I'll stay with my good guy.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.730
I'm kind of tempted.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.320
No, I'll stay with my good guy.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.620
And that's my way of
skirting around the question

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.900
and not answering it.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.150
MARK DOUGLAS: That's pretty
metaphysical though, yeah.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.060
AUDIENCE: Then you
would want Sawyer then.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.155
I take it that is the answer.

00:33:12.155 --> 00:33:12.655
Right?

00:33:12.655 --> 00:33:13.930
EVANGELINE LILLY:
That is the point

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.400
of "Lost" is you're going to
interpret my answer however

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.450
you want to interpret it.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.810
MARK DOUGLAS: You've got a
metaphysical answer for sure.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.232
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thank you.

00:33:23.232 --> 00:33:24.909
TODD WOMACK: How
about over here.

00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:26.450
AUDIENCE: So I have
a kid on the way,

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.380
so I'm looking for
children's books, so thanks.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:28.765
EVANGELINE LILLY: Awesome.

00:33:28.765 --> 00:33:31.410
AUDIENCE: My question was, it
was originally a poem that you

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.960
wrote when you were young
and then obviously, you

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.285
made an important stylistical
change by turning it

00:33:36.285 --> 00:33:38.410
into limericks, but it's
still the original version

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.460
that sticks in your mind.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.720
So are you happy with the fact
that you transformed the style

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.040
and why do you feel that this is
a better way to tell the story?

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.390
EVANGELINE LILLY: That was
a really good question.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:48.930
Thank you.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.370
I don't know, actually.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.370
I ask myself that all
the time, like why

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.336
did I go away from
the original story

00:33:55.336 --> 00:33:57.210
because sometimes I miss
it, like sometimes I

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.070
like the simplicity
and sweetness of it.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.780
But there were some very
worthwhile reasons why I did.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.750
One of them was, my editor was
like, you have to fix this.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:08.679
It's not very good.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.650
It's got something in there,
but it's just not that good yet.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.170
And then the other one
was, over the 20 years

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.429
that I had it in my
mind, it had sort of

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.770
brewed into a series of stories.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.451
It brewed into more
than it originally

00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:29.159
was where I started
to think about, well,

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.080
who are the other
"Squickerwonker" characters

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.530
and when I say "The
Squickerwonkers,"

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.920
there's only one person who
originally was narrating it,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.469
which was Papa the Proud and
so who are the other ones.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.560
And his name wasn't Papa
the Proud at that time.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.671
And so then it was
like, well, if I'm

00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:46.420
going to expand it out
into a series which

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.560
is what I feel it
wants to be, then I

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.620
have to change the story so that
it sets up a world that sets up

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.699
the characters so that you could
be introduced and ushered in,

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:00.290
and then the series would
carry on and open up the world.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.450
The original was just
a very standalone poem.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.425
It was just silly and
the simple and this one

00:35:06.425 --> 00:35:08.680
has a lot more depth.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.300
Thank you.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.100
MARK DOUGLAS: And
I think we're going

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.870
to do two more questions so we
have time for the book signing.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.166
EVANGELINE LILLY:
You're great laugher.

00:35:15.166 --> 00:35:16.540
I saw you in the
crowd, and I was

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.120
like, I'm just going
to focus on that guy.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.394
He's a great laugher.

00:35:20.394 --> 00:35:21.560
AUDIENCE: Years of practice.

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:27.850
EVANGELINE LILLY: That's great.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.466
You're probably the healthiest
person on the planet.

00:35:30.466 --> 00:35:33.950
AUDIENCE: So I know you have
this grand vision for 18

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.480
books that building
on this one, but I

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.510
was wondering if you would
see yourself ever writing

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.452
adult books or like young
adult fiction instead of just--

00:35:43.452 --> 00:35:44.993
EVANGELINE LILLY:
He did say fuction.

00:35:44.993 --> 00:35:46.034
You didn't hear it wrong.

00:35:46.034 --> 00:35:46.820
He said fuction.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.935
We're going metaphysical
again, guys.

00:35:51.935 --> 00:35:54.217
MARK DOUGLAS: Maybe
he's from New Zealand.

00:35:54.217 --> 00:35:55.300
EVANGELINE LILLY: Fuction.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.740
MARK DOUGLAS: Love fuction.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.830
EVANGELINE LILLY: Me too.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.740
Love my fuction.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:09.620
So 2015, the plan is Titan have
partnered with me to publish

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.970
a graphic novel series,
which will be geared

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.110
towards young adults and adults.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.650
And it's based on a screenplay
that I wrote about six

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.040
or seven years ago
called "The Fortress."

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.740
And my plan is to also
take time during that year

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.020
while we're building
up the graphic novel

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.390
series to write a novel
series based on this story.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.920
So I'm excited to
dive into novel work

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.510
because one of the things
that is so hard about writing

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.690
for children is you have to
have so much self-restraint

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.840
because the amount of
words you're allowed

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.790
to have in the book is so few
that to get across everything

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.000
you want to tell is a very,
very difficult in such a

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.860
tiny amount of time.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.235
So I'm really excited to just
sort of take off the chains

00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:53.739
and write my heart
out and create novels.

00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:54.780
Let's see if I can do it.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.100
I actually have no
idea if I can do it.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.260
MARK DOUGLAS: You can't do it.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.344
That was a great question.

00:36:58.344 --> 00:36:59.301
How about the next one.

00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:00.450
AUDIENCE: My name is Becky.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.250
Hey, what's up?

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.950
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Hey, what's up?

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.199
AUDIENCE: Hey, that's my girl.

00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:04.260
I don't have a question.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.660
I've been stalking
you for years.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.380
I know everything about you.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.005
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Awesome. [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:08.005 --> 00:37:11.399
AUDIENCE: I had an
invitation, actually.

00:37:11.399 --> 00:37:13.440
I and a lot of people at
Google work in a program

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.520
called Citizen Schools.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.010
It's really amazing, and we work
with a group of kids in Harlem.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.050
They're sixth graders.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:20.250
It's a struggling school.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.250
Really awesome kids, and
we go there every week.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.269
And I was trying to
look up your book tour,

00:37:24.269 --> 00:37:25.810
and I couldn't really
find the dates,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.880
so you might want to talk to
people about like getting that

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.210
up.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:28.540
EVANGELINE LILLY: What?

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.400
It's on my website.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.540
It's on all my socials.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.290
It's all over my--

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.552
AUDIENCE: Very well on mobile
perhaps, but my problem.

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:36.010
But I'm not sure
if you're around--

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.530
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Definitely my problem.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.480
AUDIENCE: --in New York
City on December 8,

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.890
but the kids are
coming to Google

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.170
for their final presentations.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.690
They do this big thing called
the WOW where they teach back

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.856
and they get really excited.

00:37:44.856 --> 00:37:47.520
So if you are in town, I do
want to invite you to this.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.480
This is school's WOW on
Google on December 8.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.280
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.360
for the invitation.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.835
I will be on a "Hobbit"
press tour at that time.

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:55.420
AUDIENCE: Eh, that's fine.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.586
EVANGELINE LILLY: I'm sorry.

00:37:56.586 --> 00:37:58.160
MARK DOUGLAS: Maybe
next time though.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.340
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming here.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.170
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.836
Book number two is
coming out next year,

00:38:01.836 --> 00:38:04.647
and I will make sure, I will
mention that to my peeps

00:38:04.647 --> 00:38:06.480
so that we can put it
in the tour next year.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.330
I would love to do that.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.180
That sounds amazing.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.720
Thank you.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.790
AUDIENCE: Right on.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.390
EVANGELINE LILLY: And you're
also a great audience member.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.730
I heard all your like
comments and laughing.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.021
Love it.

00:38:17.021 --> 00:38:17.520
Chee-hoo.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.450
MARK DOUGLAS: I'll ask you
one more thing before we go.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.690
EVANGELINE LILLY: You
said two more questions.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.720
Maybe you're Greer the Greedy.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.352
MARK DOUGLAS: All right.

00:38:26.352 --> 00:38:27.560
EVANGELINE LILLY: No, ask me.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.100
Ask me.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:28.420
Ask me.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.461
I don't want this to end.

00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:32.480
MARK DOUGLAS: Once my mom caught
me lying when I was a kid,

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.270
and she read "Pinocchio" to me.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:40.084
And when would you suggest
reading this to a child?

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:42.000
EVANGELINE LILLY: I would
suggest reading this

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.480
to your child when they have
a super duper big tantrum

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.170
for absolutely no good
reason to have a big tantrum.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.280
It's a great teachable
book in that way.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.150
Like in the end, the kid
gets totally punished

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.280
for their tantrum,
and there's no out.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.000
There's no like,
oh, but it was OK.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.440
That's a rule in my house.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.960
If my son is misbehaving--

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.890
MARK DOUGLAS: Buttons
go in the eyes.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.380
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:04.920
Boom.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.790
No, the coin.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.390
The coins.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.434
MARK DOUGLAS: I'm sorry.

00:39:06.434 --> 00:39:06.478
I'm sorry.

00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:06.500
Coins.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.210
EVANGELINE LILLY: But like if
he has to apologize to somebody

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.610
and they go, it's OK.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.590
I go no, it's not OK.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.810
It's not OK.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:14.420
It's not OK.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.320
You can say thank
you for your apology,

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.810
or I forgive you, or let's move
on from this, but it's not OK.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.730
And I just think too many times
kids are like told, but it's OK

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:24.365
and it's no.

00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:25.930
You were misbehaving.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.720
Locked.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.290
TODD WOMACK: Lock him up.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.170
You heard it here.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.520
MARK DOUGLAS: Ladies and
gentlemen, I think that's it.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.533
I think we're going to--

00:39:34.533 --> 00:39:35.790
AUDIENCE: How about
a little round

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.290
of applause for a
special guest today.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.820
Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:38.896
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:39:38.896 --> 00:39:39.979
Thank you much for coming.

00:39:39.979 --> 00:39:42.845
TODD WOMACK: And we'll let
you get over to the thing

00:39:42.845 --> 00:39:44.930
and do some signing.
