00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now the answer we just calculated was very elegant.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We used the nice assumptions that the sun's rays arrive in parallel and the earth is a sphere.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We made some nice calculations involving the geometry and the trigonometry that we learned

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but at the end of the day, if our answer doesn't stand up to reality, we need to start over.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now let's see, how did Eratosthenes do against reality?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, his calculated circumference was 46,250 kilometers and we compare that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to the 40,000 kilometers that we currently know is the actual circumference of the earth.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Clearly he was off, but how much was he off by?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Can you think back to the beginning of the unit and tell me what was Eratosthenes'

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
percent error in this calculation?
