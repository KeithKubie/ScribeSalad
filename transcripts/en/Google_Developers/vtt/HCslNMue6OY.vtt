00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.067
Hess: Hello and welcome.

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:05.467
Thanks for coming to the last
session of the last day

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:08.501
and hearing a little bit
about web services

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:10.300
on Google App Engine.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.634
So my name is Ron Hess,

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:16.033
and I'm a developer evangelist
with Salesforce.com.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.400
And I have with me
Ryan Marples,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.801
also a developer evangelist.

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.868
Ryan, raise your hand.
Stand up.

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:25.200
And Iein Valdez
from Appirio.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.567
Appirio is a partner
of Salesforce.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:28.901
[applause]

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.067
And has a cheering section.

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:34.334
Appirio is a partner of Google
and a partner of Salesforce.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.334
And he's built
a really interesting demo.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.968
So we're going to do
a couple of things today.

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.901
We're going to talk
about some code.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:43.467
We're gonna talk about
some new technology,

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.501
an open source project,

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.100
and we're gonna
see some demos.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.868
So before we get
too far into it,

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:54.367
I'd like to ask the audience:

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.334
How many people
are familiar with Salesforce?

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.834
How many people
have heard of the platform?

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.033
Maybe used it.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.934
Maybe they use it
at a current company.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:06.133
Fantastic.
Okay, that's a great showing.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.334
So a lot of the stuff
that I'm gonna talk about,

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.234
Salesforce you'll
understand right away.

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.067
And then of course
you're at a Google conference,

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:15.767
so you will understand
how exciting App Engine is.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.567
This is our
safe harbor statement.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:20.067
It's a reminder to make
your purchasing decisions

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:21.934
based on current features.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:26.100
You can read more about this
on salesforce/investor.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Today the agenda,
as I mentioned,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.801
we're gonna talk about
Force.com platforms

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:34.834
to get you up to speed on all
the exciting features there.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.968
And we're gonna talk
about how we're connecting

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:38.434
these two clouds--

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:41.501
the Force.com platform
is our cloud--

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.000
and the Google App Engine--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.334
and all of the apps
that run on Google

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.400
represent the Google cloud,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.934
and how these two platforms
actually work together.

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.167
We're going to talk
about how we build that bridge

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:56.267
so that they can communicate.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:59.300
We'll also show
a simple Hello World,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.901
because I love
to show some code

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.701
in all of my sessions.

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:05.367
And then Ryan's built

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.901
an exciting
product catalog demo,

00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:10.000
so he's gonna
demonstrate that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.534
And then Iein has
a demo from Appirio

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:16.868
that shows
real-world-type solution

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.834
that combines
both of these clouds.

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:23.234
And of course we'll
have time for Q &amp; A.

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:27.434
So first, to understand
the Salesforce cloud,

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:30.000
the Force.com platform,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.267
I want to break down
what we offer

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.033
into these three categories.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.734
It's the real-time
infrastructure,

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:39.367
which is the bottom row--

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.667
I want to make sure
you can all see that--

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:45.067
and all the features
it brings to our cloud.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:47.634
Then we'll talk a little
about the cloud platform.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.467
And finally the cloud apps.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:53.534
That's the Salesforce cloud,
the service cloud,

00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:56.901
and your application
that you build on our platform.

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:58.601
Those are all on top,

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.434
and they enjoy all
the services below.

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:02.801
So on the infrastructure side,

00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.200
we are a SAS 70 certified.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.367
We are ISO 27001 certified.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:11.467
So when you build apps
on our platform,

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.868
you're enjoying
the certified platform.

00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:17.200
We have proven scalability,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.868
real-time upgrades,

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:20.534
a trust system--

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.100
all of these kind
of infrastructure features

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.601
that you also enjoy
on Google App Engine.

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.234
Then on top of that,
we have the cloud platform.

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:31.701
And our cloud platform
has a bunch of modules

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:33.567
that are built in

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:35.868
that you don't have
to code for.

00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:38.067
A great example of one
of these built-in modules

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.901
is our real-time workflow
and approvals.

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.801
So with our platform,

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:47.701
each user can be a recipient

00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:50.534
or a participant
in a workflow process,

00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.567
and they can be an approver
or just an observer

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:54.200
of a workflow.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.767
And so workflow
is one of the things

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.567
that we provide for you.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.701
You don't have to build that.
You don't have to code that.

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:01.200
Along with workflow,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.501
there's analytics,
there's a content library,

00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.934
there's unlimited
customizations.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.434
And as you build customizations
on our platform,

00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:11.267
we build the UI for you.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:14.400
So all those things combined
make it a very fast way

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.300
to build apps in the could.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.734
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in a minute,

00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:22.267
but the really exciting thing
is how we're gonna combine

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:23.634
these clouds.

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:25.501
So let me keep moving.

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:28.901
So with the Force.com platform,

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.567
you do get all the benefits
of building apps in the cloud.

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:35.467
You get no-hassle upgrades.

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.634
You build it
on our infrastructure.

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:40.968
We take care
of all the gunk,

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:45.000
and you can build your app
and focus on the value add

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.567
that your company brings.

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:48.667
And this is the same
with Google's clouds.

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:50.567
So again, you're seeing
a parallel here.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.367
Things that we offer
and things that they offer

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:53.868
are very similar.

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:56.834
We're going to show you
how you don't have to choose.

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.868
You can actually combine.

00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:02.567
So this represents--

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.267
This shows you
all of the things

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:07.534
that you might have
to build otherwise,

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.834
but on our platform,
we provide these for you.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:11.734
So it's a great way
to get started,

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.567
build something quickly.

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:17.701
App exchange is our directory
of applications.

00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.267
Our real-time content library
and so on.

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:21.868
All of these things
are build for you,

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:24.801
and you'll be able to access
them on Force.com platform.

00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:28.601
So many apps have been built
using these features,

00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:31.968
but those apps may or may not
be able to talk

00:05:31.968 --> 00:05:33.367
to the Google apps.

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:37.934
So how do we kinda combine
both of these clouds?

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:40.400
So in order
to understand that,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.133
how we're going to
combine everything,

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.667
I want to talk about
Google's cloud architecture.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:47.033
And this is
a cloud that I got--

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:49.067
a slide that I got
from my host, Scott McMullan.

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:51.334
And Scott,
are you here?

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:53.033
Scott's not here right now,

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:55.000
but Scott gave me this could

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.734
to understand how Google
sees their architecture.

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:00.434
And you can see
what they've got

00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:03.534
is Google Apps
like Mail, Calendar,

00:06:03.534 --> 00:06:05.767
Documents, and Gadgets.

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:07.534
They also have
third-party apps.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:11.434
And those sit on top
of Google's infrastructure.

00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:13.501
And inside of Google's
infrastructure,

00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:15.701
they represent
Google App Engine.

00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:18.634
So that's where
App Engine sits.

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:22.033
And you can see that
App Engine is already built

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:25.434
to handle integrations with
other third-party services.

00:06:25.434 --> 00:06:27.968
We'll talk about
specifically how that's done

00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:30.601
for the next few slides.

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.868
But I wanted to show
this architecture

00:06:32.868 --> 00:06:35.567
and alongside
the Salesforce architecture

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:40.000
so you can see
how really similar they are.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.634
So there's a slide.
You saw that earlier.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:44.367
It's the infrastructure.

00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:46.167
On top of the infrastructure
is the platform.

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:48.367
On top of the platform
are the apps.

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:52.167
And there have been more
than 850 ISV apps

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.934
built on our platform.

00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:58.667
We have a million users
and 60,000--

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:02.601
Over a million users
and over 60,000 customers.

00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.267
So all of these people

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:06.601
are building and using
our cloud today,

00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:10.634
but they may actually
need to talk to an application

00:07:10.634 --> 00:07:13.133
that's built
for the Google platform.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.133
So how do we connect these?

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:18.734
And what do you really gain
by connecting these clouds?

00:07:18.734 --> 00:07:21.100
So this is important
to understand.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.801
Why would you want
to combine these?

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:24.701
What are you really
gonna get out of it?

00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:28.934
Well, what we feel
is that these two clouds

00:07:28.934 --> 00:07:30.901
are non-rival.

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:33.901
We see many customers of ours

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:36.601
that use our sales automation

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:38.434
but they need Google apps.

00:07:38.434 --> 00:07:40.734
And so Google
is able to go in

00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:42.667
and sell Google apps
to those customers.

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.534
And many of Google's customers

00:07:44.534 --> 00:07:48.033
that actually use Gmail

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:51.667
and Docs and Spreadsheets
and Calendar

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:55.033
actually need a sales
automation application as well.

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:58.133
And so we can sell
into those customers as well.

00:07:58.133 --> 00:08:01.000
So now we've got customers,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.667
and Appirio knows this

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:06.033
because they build
for both platforms.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:10.400
The ability to leverage
these two clouds,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.734
working together.

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:14.100
So if you're a developer,
and the application

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.934
that you're building
on our platform

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:18.934
needs to talk to Google,
it can.

00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:20.934
And if you're
building an app

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.767
on Google App Engine,

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:25.200
and you need to talk
to a sales system

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.367
like we have
on our Force.com platform,

00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:30.200
you can do that too.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.834
So you no longer
have to choose.

00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:36.000
You can use one or the other
or both in a combination

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.767
and build this integration

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.200
and deliver enhanced value
to your customers.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.467
So today what we're
specifically gonna talk about

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:48.501
is building Java applications
on App Engine

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.167
that talk to,
that read and write

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:54.834
onto the Force.com
cloud platform.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.167
So I've got
another slide here

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:58.734
that kind of shows you

00:08:58.734 --> 00:09:01.767
what we're going
to be talking about today.

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:04.334
The rest of the day
we're going to talk about

00:09:04.334 --> 00:09:07.767
these three clouds
in the middle.

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:10.767
You can see Google App Engine
on the left there.

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:12.534
You can see
the Web Service Client,

00:09:12.534 --> 00:09:16.033
the Partner Library,
and the SOAP API,

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:19.567
and those in combination
allow you to communicate

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:21.567
across these two clouds.

00:09:21.567 --> 00:09:24.234
So let's take a closer look
at the pieces

00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:26.234
that we're going
to discuss.

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:28.300
There are three things
that we're going to talk about.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.901
Gonna go into some detail
on each of these.

00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:34.968
The first one
is the Web Service Client.

00:09:34.968 --> 00:09:38.434
So the Web Service Client
is just that.

00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:40.400
It's a client that runs
on App Engine,

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.734
and it provides two features
that we need

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:46.901
to communicate with
the Force.com database.

00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:49.667
It provides parsing
and transport.

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:52.234
Go into those in a little bit
more detail later.

00:09:52.234 --> 00:09:56.033
The Web Service Client actually
uses the Partner Library.

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.234
The Partner Library
is, again, Java code,

00:09:58.234 --> 00:09:59.567
but it's generated.

00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:01.234
So you don't have
to generate it.

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:04.601
And in our open source project,
we generated one for you.

00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:08.167
So you can get started
without generating any of that.

00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:10.934
And then
on the Force.com side

00:10:10.934 --> 00:10:12.834
is the SOAP API.

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:15.934
That's how
all of the integrations

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:19.133
that you build
for Force.com

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:21.567
communicate
with our database

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:23.467
using the SOAP API.

00:10:23.467 --> 00:10:25.701
So that's provided
by Salesforce.

00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:27.601
So you don't need
to build that either.

00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.767
So you don't need
to build any of these,

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:31.701
but I wanted
to show each of them

00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.534
in some more detail
so you can understand

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:36.834
just how they're all
gonna work together.

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:40.100
So first is the Force.com
SOAP API.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.834
And this is a standard
spaced API.

00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:45.000
It's SOAP and WSDL.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.400
It's exposed as a WSDL
on our website.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.767
So as a developer,

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:50.567
when you sign up
for the developer edition,

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.200
you'll be able
to download the WSDL,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.167
and that describes
all the methods and objects

00:10:58.167 --> 00:11:01.200
that you can interact with
on our database.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.567
And you get
basic CRUD operations,

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:07.467
like read, create,
update, delete, and so on.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.367
There's also
special operations--

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:12.000
for example, send e-mail,
convert lead,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.534
and even metadata operations

00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:17.834
that you can use to create
new tables, new fields,

00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:19.300
and so on.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.100
These are all exposed as WSDL.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.400
Today, we're going to be
talking about the partner WSDL,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.033
which is just
one of the WSDLs.

00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:28.200
There's also
an Enterprise WSDL.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.400
But the SOAP API
is standard space.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.801
So I don't want to go into
too much detail on this.

00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:38.033
You can read more about this
on developer.force.com.

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:39.901
It's called Web Services API.

00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:43.400
So it's the first thing
that we need to understand,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.100
and it's already built for us,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.868
so we're not gonna spend
a lot of time on that.

00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:50.501
On the other side
of the bridge

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.033
that we're building here

00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:54.067
is the Web Service Client.

00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:57.000
Now this is very exciting
because this is brand-new.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.834
This has just been
open sourced this week.

00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:02.767
I don't know if you saw
the press release yesterday.

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:04.667
This is an open source project.

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:09.667
It's built on a high performance
streaming interface for Java.

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:12.601
We had to make
some minor change

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:15.167
for App Engine,
but I'm going to show you

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.834
just exactly
what we had to do there

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:19.467
to get it up and running.

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:21.100
And it wasn't much,
I'll tell you.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.901
It was very exciting
to see how quickly

00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:24.267
it all came together.

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:27.067
This is available
on code.google.com.

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:31.167
The project name
is sfdc-wsc.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.767
And you can link to that

00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:37.834
from our
developer.force.com homepage.

00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:41.734
We'll have those URLs
at the end of the talk.

00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:44.334
So what does this
Web Service Client give us?

00:12:44.334 --> 00:12:47.033
Well, there's two things
that we absolutely need.

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.434
We need parsing
and transport.

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:53.067
Parsing because
we want to use a WSDL

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:55.734
that maybe generated
a rev over time.

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:58.434
So we need to be able
to parse this WSDL.

00:12:58.434 --> 00:13:00.067
And that actually--

00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:02.734
The exciting thing
about this library

00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:06.167
and Google App Engine
is that this is not specific

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:07.667
to Force.com.

00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:09.701
This could be used
with any WSDL.

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.000
So if there's one thing
that you take away

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.300
from this talk today,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.133
it's that now
with Google App Engine

00:13:16.133 --> 00:13:18.634
you can use Web Services.

00:13:18.634 --> 00:13:21.467
This client will work
with other WSDLs.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.634
Now we've only tested it
with the Force.com WSDL.

00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:27.868
But you could use it
with any document literal WSDL.

00:13:27.868 --> 00:13:32.000
And we've provided support for
several object types in there.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.968
So you can look in there
and see if the object types

00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:35.734
that you need
are supported or not.

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.000
And you can see
the source code

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.567
and see how to support
additional object types

00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:43.501
that might be more specific
for your WSDL.

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:47.400
But again, it's not specific
to Force.com.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.300
Additionally,
the Web Service Client

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.534
provides the transport methods,

00:13:51.534 --> 00:13:54.334
and this is based on--

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:55.834
Because this runs
on App Engine,

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:59.567
it's based on the native
features of App Engine,

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:01.300
the UrlFetch.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.334
And I'm sure you've seen
or heard about UrlFetch

00:14:04.334 --> 00:14:06.167
during the talks earlier.

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.601
And I'll show you
just a couple of lines of code

00:14:08.601 --> 00:14:11.267
about discussing that.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.934
So let's take a look
at the transport layer.

00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:15.734
Now I wanted
to show this code

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.734
because this is
actually the code

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:22.267
that I had to write
to implement

00:14:22.267 --> 00:14:25.267
our Web Service Client
on App Engine.

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:27.601
So of the thousands
of lines of code

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.367
included in
the Web Service Client,

00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:32.667
these are the only things
that I had to actually modify.

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:35.534
Our client uses
a streaming interface.

00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:38.634
The streaming interface
is not available on App Engine.

00:14:38.634 --> 00:14:41.133
Instead you use
a fetch mechanism.

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:44.234
So I had to write a fetch

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:47.033
that actually
exposes the data

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:50.100
as a stream.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.434
So you can see I'm calling
setPayload

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:56.734
to take all
of the chunk of data

00:14:56.734 --> 00:14:58.968
that you're asking
to be queried.

00:14:58.968 --> 00:15:04.267
Say the query string that you
want to read from Force.com

00:15:04.267 --> 00:15:06.834
or the query--
or the records

00:15:06.834 --> 00:15:10.000
that you want to write
to Force.com,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.667
and then you call fetch.

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:14.167
And I'm just checking
the response code

00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:16.000
and then getting
the content.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.100
All of these
are provided for me

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.400
by the App Engine library.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.133
So I didn't have
to write any of that.

00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:24.834
I just had to write
this one port.

00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:27.501
So if you haven't
ported your Java code

00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.634
to App Engine yet,

00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:31.934
the message here
is it's really easy.

00:15:31.934 --> 00:15:33.667
You should give it a try.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.000
Most of the Java
that I ran across

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
just dropped right in
and worked first time.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.667
So this is the heart
of the transport.

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:43.300
And again,
this is open source.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.968
I'm not gonna go into too much
more detail on the source code.

00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:49.033
You can find
the source code online.

00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:52.234
Happy to talk to you
about that process later,

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:56.467
porting that application
to App Engine.

00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:59.434
But the exciting thing
was it worked pretty quickly,

00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:00.968
and it worked right away.

00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:03.234
The other thing that we need
is parsing.

00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:06.234
So the Web Service Client

00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:09.133
has a parsing tool
built into it.

00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:10.734
And with this tool,

00:16:10.734 --> 00:16:12.601
you generate
the Java objects.

00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:15.033
So you provide a WSDL,

00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:17.234
and you run
this command line,

00:16:17.234 --> 00:16:21.234
and it generates a JAR
that has all the methods

00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:24.133
and all the objects
that were in the WSDL.

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:28.467
And that code works
on App Engine.

00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:30.234
So when I run this command,

00:16:30.234 --> 00:16:32.167
I generate
this output JAR file.

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:34.000
What does it build me?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.667
Well, it builds me
the next piece of the chain,

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:39.167
the Partner Library.

00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:40.801
And we call this
the Partner Library.

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.367
It could also be
the Enterprise Library.

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:43.901
If you're familiar
with our WSDLs,

00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:45.801
we have
a strongly-typed WSDL

00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:47.701
and a loosely-typed WSDL

00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:49.667
so that you can
write applications

00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:52.601
that work with multiple
Salesforce orgs.

00:16:52.601 --> 00:16:55.267
Or if you're writing
for your own org,

00:16:55.267 --> 00:16:57.267
you can use
the Enterprise WSDL as well.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:00.267
But basically, you generate
that JAR file,

00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:03.234
and it has
the objects and methods.

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:06.367
And the transport classes
come in the WSC JAR,

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:08.868
which is also
out on the project.

00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:12.400
And you drop those into
your App Engine project.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.267
And as soon as you do that,
you're done.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:17.067
I mean, you are ready
to build your Hello World

00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:19.667
because that's
all you need to do.

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:21.167
Inside your application

00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:24.067
it exposes
as a connection object.

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:27.200
So I think the next thing
we want to do--

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.968
So we've looked at
the Web Service Client.

00:17:29.968 --> 00:17:32.934
We've looked at the SOAP API.

00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:35.667
Any questions about
the Partner Library

00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:37.400
or any of these pieces?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.367
I'm happy to take questions
while we're going,

00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:42.067
'cause sometimes that's
when the questions come up.

00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:46.701
Or we can save
the questions for the end.

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.601
So we've looked
at all the pieces.

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:52.934
Now let's just look
at a basic Hello World program.

00:17:52.934 --> 00:17:56.868
This is Java program
that does three things.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:18:00.267
It's going to create
a connection config.

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:02.701
It's going to log in,

00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:06.067
which is calling
new connection.

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:08.434
Then it's going
to create an object,

00:18:08.434 --> 00:18:10.601
which we call an SObject.

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:13.067
It's going to populate
fields on that object.

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:15.534
And then it's gonna
call create.

00:18:15.534 --> 00:18:17.367
So this is interesting,

00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:19.634
but I'd rather
show you this one.

00:18:19.634 --> 00:18:21.901
I'd rather go in
and demo this one.

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:28.033
So let's go ahead
and switch into this now.

00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:31.868
And hope everything works
just like I like.

00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:36.167
Okay, so here
is the source code

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:37.634
for my Hello World.

00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:39.167
I know it's very simple,

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:41.734
but I wanted to show you
something simple first.

00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:43.567
So let's take
a look at this.

00:18:43.567 --> 00:18:50.033
And it's pretty--
pretty basic.

00:18:50.033 --> 00:18:52.701
But let's do this
the fun way.

00:18:52.701 --> 00:18:55.067
Let's delete everything

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.133
and build it from scratch.

00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:59.801
So I'm gonna go ahead
and show you

00:18:59.801 --> 00:19:01.534
how I build these things
from scratch.

00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:03.434
I'm gonna use snippets.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.267
And the first snippet
I'm gonna bring in

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:08.133
is the Hello World servlet.

00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:09.834
So it's very basic.

00:19:09.834 --> 00:19:12.234
I haven't done
anything here yet.

00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:15.667
I've just got
a get and a post method

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:17.033
in my servlet.

00:19:17.033 --> 00:19:21.267
And I've added these includes,
these imports.

00:19:21.267 --> 00:19:25.601
So I'm ready to go.
Nothing surprising yet.

00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:27.300
Now I need to--

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.434
When I call get
on my Hello World--

00:19:29.434 --> 00:19:31.267
Well, first let me tell you
what the Hello World

00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:32.601
is going to do.

00:19:32.601 --> 00:19:34.701
Hello World's
gonna run on App Engine,

00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:36.434
and it's gonna
create an account

00:19:36.434 --> 00:19:37.901
on Salesforce.

00:19:37.901 --> 00:19:39.868
We'll call the account
Hello World.

00:19:39.868 --> 00:19:41.534
So that's what
it's gonna do.

00:19:41.534 --> 00:19:44.734
To do that,
I'm gonna bring in a form.

00:19:44.734 --> 00:19:47.667
The form is just
going to allow me

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:50.601
to type in a name,
the name of my account.

00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:52.367
I'm gonna type in
"hello world."

00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:53.868
This is, again, basic.

00:19:53.868 --> 00:19:55.634
Nothing special here.

00:19:55.634 --> 00:19:57.100
Got a form.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.601
Now I need
to declare the connection.

00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:03.901
Now we're gonna start
to use the Partner Library.

00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:09.300
So I've just brought in
the logging method,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.434
and a user name,
and a password,

00:20:11.434 --> 00:20:12.968
and a partner connection.

00:20:12.968 --> 00:20:15.234
This is the partner connection
that I'm gonna interact with,

00:20:15.234 --> 00:20:16.767
and that's what
we're going to use

00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:18.868
to actually communicate.

00:20:18.868 --> 00:20:21.701
So there we go.
We're almost ready.

00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:23.367
We need two more things.

00:20:23.367 --> 00:20:25.167
We need to log in.

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:28.033
So I'll bring that
down here into the post.

00:20:28.033 --> 00:20:32.367
In which case, we're gonna
create a connector config,

00:20:32.367 --> 00:20:34.033
which holds
our user name and password,

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.367
and then we're going
to log in.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:38.701
That's called new connection.

00:20:38.701 --> 00:20:41.734
All right,
so nothing special there yet.

00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.767
We're just gonna log in.

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:48.400
And finally, we're ready
to create an account.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.033
So what you can see here,
as on the slide,

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:54.200
I just create a new object,
populate a few fields,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.200
set the type of object
that I want to create.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.200
This can be a custom object
or a standard object.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.801
And then I'm gonna call
connection create.

00:21:04.801 --> 00:21:06.100
So there we go.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.267
That's the entire
Hello World application.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.234
I'll save that.

00:21:11.234 --> 00:21:16.200
And now I'm going
to launch that.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.534
Okay, it's running.

00:21:17.534 --> 00:21:19.834
And it's telling me
that I need a new SDK.

00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:21.701
Actually,
it's warning me

00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:23.601
that the SDK
has been updated.

00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:25.534
So I'll take that on note,

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:28.501
and I will update that
a little bit later.

00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:31.834
But right now I want
to go to local host,

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:35.734
and we'll run this.

00:21:35.734 --> 00:21:38.300
Let's see.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.934
Got one that's ready to go.

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:43.167
Run, okay.
There's the servlet.

00:21:43.167 --> 00:21:49.767
There's the hello servlet
that I want to run.

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:51.534
There it is,
"Hello, world."

00:21:51.534 --> 00:21:53.701
Okay, so this
is an input form.

00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:54.968
Now we're just about ready.

00:21:54.968 --> 00:22:01.934
I'm gonna type
"Hello World Google IO."

00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:07.367
Okay.

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:09.167
Here we go,
I'm gonna create that account.

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:11.267
Now, I didn't put
a lot of user interaction.

00:22:11.267 --> 00:22:12.968
I didn't put a wait.

00:22:12.968 --> 00:22:16.100
It's just going to reload
that page when I'm done.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.601
So now I need to switch
into a browser

00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:22.200
and log in to Salesforce.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.868
So do I have a browser
that's up and running?

00:22:28.868 --> 00:22:31.100
Um, I don't.
What am I gonna do?

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.868
I'm gonna launch
a fresh browser

00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:38.934
just to avoid confusing
my colleagues here.

00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:41.367
They have everything set up.

00:22:41.367 --> 00:22:42.767
There's the Salesforce page.

00:22:42.767 --> 00:22:44.567
I've got a little
log in link.

00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:46.033
This is the log in--

00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:49.167
This is the application that
I inserted the data into.

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:51.200
I'll go to the accounts tab.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.701
And we should see
"Hello World Google IO."

00:22:55.701 --> 00:22:58.167
And there it is.

00:22:58.167 --> 00:22:59.767
"Hello World Google IO."

00:22:59.767 --> 00:23:01.367
If we go and visit
this account,

00:23:01.367 --> 00:23:04.767
we'll see a time stamp
from today.

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:06.434
There it is.

00:23:06.434 --> 00:23:09.133
6:09 P.M.
That must be--

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:13.667
Must be in London,
the time zone setting.

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:15.300
Okay.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.601
So that is the simple
Hello World.

00:23:17.601 --> 00:23:19.701
I know it's awfully simple,
but I wanted to show you

00:23:19.701 --> 00:23:21.367
just how quick and easy it is
to actually build something

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:24.300
that's starting to communicate
with these two clouds.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.868
Now, that was interesting,
but what's really interesting

00:23:28.868 --> 00:23:31.000
are some of the things
that you can do

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.467
if you get a little more time

00:23:32.467 --> 00:23:34.234
and you get a little more
Java experience.

00:23:34.234 --> 00:23:37.834
So what I asked Ryan to do

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:39.901
was to take the next step,

00:23:39.901 --> 00:23:42.200
say build something
really interesting,

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.300
not just a Hello World.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.133
So I got to do
the easy one.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.033
So now I think
I'd like to ask Ryan

00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:51.167
to come up and show us
the next step

00:23:51.167 --> 00:23:53.467
in this evolution.

00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:56.167
Thanks, Ryan.
Do you--Is your mic on?

00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:57.901
Marples: Uh, I believe so.

00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:01.000
I believe it is.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.801
Um, okay, so Ron showed
kind of a functional demo.

00:24:05.801 --> 00:24:07.100
What I wanted to show

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.534
was something
a little more real world.

00:24:08.534 --> 00:24:09.868
So let me set the scenario

00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:11.601
before I start
showing stuff here.

00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:13.667
The idea is
I'm gonna represent

00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:14.968
a company called
Stratus Interiors,

00:24:14.968 --> 00:24:19.100
and I'm an interior furniture
vendor.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.767
Stratus is a type of cloud,

00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:22.200
but I don't think
anybody got that.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.868
So anyway
we'll skip over that.

00:24:24.868 --> 00:24:27.100
The idea is--Now I'm
a Salesforce customer,

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.667
and I've got a lot
of data in Salesforce.

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:30.667
I manage my products,
I manage my sales reps,

00:24:30.667 --> 00:24:32.367
I manage my leads.

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:36.200
And I wanted to use
Google App Engine,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.133
and specifically
I have a developer

00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:39.467
who has Java experience

00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:41.234
who'd like to build
an application on Java

00:24:41.234 --> 00:24:43.634
to actually produce
an online product catalog

00:24:43.634 --> 00:24:45.868
and collect some leads
in from users.

00:24:45.868 --> 00:24:47.634
So that was the challenge,
and that's--

00:24:47.634 --> 00:24:49.534
This new tool kit
that Ron's just talked about

00:24:49.534 --> 00:24:50.901
helps us do that.

00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:53.100
So let's talk
about how that's gonna work.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.701
I will create
a new window here,

00:24:54.701 --> 00:24:59.033
and this is actually live
right now.

00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:01.133
stratusinteriors.appspot.com.

00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:04.801
So this is a Google Java
App Engine application.

00:25:04.801 --> 00:25:06.934
And when I come
to the catalog page,

00:25:06.934 --> 00:25:09.467
it looks like a very simple
product catalog.

00:25:09.467 --> 00:25:10.801
But actually
what's happening is--

00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:12.033
we'll look at the code
in a minute--

00:25:12.033 --> 00:25:13.667
but these products,
these chairs,

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:15.434
these various
pieces of furniture,

00:25:15.434 --> 00:25:17.767
this is actually
a data-driven page

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:19.934
that's coming
directly from Salesforce.

00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:22.467
We're actually
feeding the data in live.

00:25:22.467 --> 00:25:24.300
The other piece
of functionality we have,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.601
in addition to displaying
the product catalog,

00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:28.200
is I can come in and say,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.767
"Well, maybe
I'm interested in this,"

00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:31.701
and I can actually put in
some information here.

00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:38.000
So I will call myself
Google IO.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.567
And I'll make up
an e-mail address.

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:41.934
And I'll say maybe I'm
interested in the pricing

00:25:41.934 --> 00:25:45.067
and maybe the customer reviews
of this particular product.

00:25:45.067 --> 00:25:46.667
And I'll hit request there.

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:48.601
And that's actually
doing the opposite.

00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:50.501
Instead of reading data
from Salesforce,

00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.300
we're actually pushing
data into Salesforce

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.234
and creating an inquiry
within Salesforce.

00:25:55.234 --> 00:25:56.868
So again,
we're really displaying

00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:59.868
how we can keep the data
and kinda the business process

00:25:59.868 --> 00:26:02.400
within Salesforce
but the applications live.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.801
So if I were to want to go
and update a product,

00:26:04.801 --> 00:26:06.934
add a new product,
I would just go into Salesforce,

00:26:06.934 --> 00:26:09.234
add that product,
don't have to touch the website.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.501
And similarly,
as leads come into the website,

00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:14.133
I don't need to have anybody
e-mailing things around

00:26:14.133 --> 00:26:15.901
or exporting CSVs.

00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:18.801
It's a dynamic link
into Salesforce.

00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:21.367
Just to prove this,
let's actually go

00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:23.567
log in to Salesforce.

00:26:34.868 --> 00:26:36.534
So here we are.

00:26:36.534 --> 00:26:39.467
And this is the Stratus eStore
application that I have.

00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:41.601
And you can see these
are the catalog entries

00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.801
we just looked at
a minute ago.

00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:46.667
So if I go look
at one of these items,

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:49.133
we have the--in this case
it's a chair.

00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:51.400
We have the image URL.
We have the description.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.701
I could actually
change that

00:26:52.701 --> 00:26:55.334
and have that come up
back on the site.

00:26:55.334 --> 00:26:58.234
We have inquiries.

00:26:58.234 --> 00:26:59.634
Got a bunch in here.

00:26:59.634 --> 00:27:03.133
Apparently Bart Simpson's
interested in a lounger.

00:27:03.133 --> 00:27:05.334
And here you go.
Here's the one we just created.

00:27:05.334 --> 00:27:07.734
So similar to Ron's example.

00:27:07.734 --> 00:27:10.234
The other thing I'll do, just
'cause we showed two inputs.

00:27:10.234 --> 00:27:11.734
We haven't really
shown an output.

00:27:11.734 --> 00:27:13.234
Just to kinda prove
this is live,

00:27:13.234 --> 00:27:15.667
I'll come back in here,
and we'll change one of these.

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:20.868
We'll take chair one, which
should be the first product,

00:27:20.868 --> 00:27:25.901
and we'll edit this.

00:27:25.901 --> 00:27:27.901
And instead of saying
it's really cool,

00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:31.834
we'll say it's awesome.

00:27:31.834 --> 00:27:33.534
And we'll go ahead
and save that.

00:27:33.534 --> 00:27:34.934
And we'll come back here,

00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:37.767
and we'll come
to our catalog.

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:40.067
And there we are.
It says it's awesome.

00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:41.334
So again,
that's the power of this,

00:27:41.334 --> 00:27:43.968
is, you know, holding
the corporate data

00:27:43.968 --> 00:27:47.634
within Salesforce
but driving an application.

00:27:47.634 --> 00:27:51.167
So close these two
back here.

00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:52.634
Just a couple of things
I wanted to point out

00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:54.067
about how this was built.

00:27:54.067 --> 00:27:56.033
The first thing,
making the connection.

00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:57.834
What I did here
is I realized, you know,

00:27:57.834 --> 00:28:00.367
in some situations
users will be supplying

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:02.667
their Salesforce credentials
and logging on every time.

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:04.634
In this case,
I just have a special account.

00:28:04.634 --> 00:28:06.334
So I actually
created an account called--

00:28:06.334 --> 00:28:08.334
I think I called it
API basically.

00:28:08.334 --> 00:28:10.634
And it has the right permissions
within Salesforce.

00:28:10.634 --> 00:28:14.400
What I wanted to do was log on
as that particular user.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.400
When I realized that,
you know, a catalog is not--

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.701
I did the update now.

00:28:18.701 --> 00:28:20.167
I can change something,
and it's live.

00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:22.067
But in realistic terms,
you don't need

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.567
the product catalog to be
updated right to the second.

00:28:24.567 --> 00:28:26.667
So I've created
a little session manager,

00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:28.434
which has handled
some caching.

00:28:28.434 --> 00:28:30.534
So what it does is
it logs on to Salesforce,

00:28:30.534 --> 00:28:33.200
it takes the session ID,
and throws it in Memcache

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.701
for about an hour.

00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:36.467
So then as subsequent
requests come in,

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:38.000
it's reusing the same session.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.367
It doesn't have
to recreate that.

00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:41.033
So I just created
a little session manager class

00:28:41.033 --> 00:28:42.667
that can help you out
with that.

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:44.067
And you can find that code
if you're interested

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:47.400
in leveraging that
up on the Google Code Project.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.734
Also just to show, you know,
instead of hard coding

00:28:49.734 --> 00:28:51.167
your username and password,

00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:53.934
you can do something like
a servlet parameter,

00:28:53.934 --> 00:28:55.234
which is in the web xml.

00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:56.868
I've got that in there.

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.467
The other thing
is just the retrieving data.

00:28:58.467 --> 00:28:59.701
I don't think
we've shown this.

00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:01.300
Ron talked about
the inserts.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.000
This is just to show you
another example

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.834
of pulling data out.

00:29:04.834 --> 00:29:07.367
That conn variable,
that's that connection object

00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:10.634
that represents that API
into Salesforce.

00:29:10.634 --> 00:29:12.534
In this case,
we're calling query.

00:29:12.534 --> 00:29:14.734
Now you may look at this
and say,

00:29:14.734 --> 00:29:16.133
"Oh, it's a SQL statement."

00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:17.834
Well, this is actually
the Salesforce's query language.

00:29:17.834 --> 00:29:19.868
So if you've used
Salesforce before

00:29:19.868 --> 00:29:21.667
from a developer perspective,

00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:23.400
you'll find this
very familiar.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.367
But if you haven't,
this is actually Salesforce's

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:26.567
query language.

00:29:26.567 --> 00:29:27.801
It's a powerful query language.

00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:29.300
We can do joins,
and relationships,

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.200
and filters,
and all this kinda stuff.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.801
So I'm just doing
a simple query in this case,

00:29:32.801 --> 00:29:35.300
asking for a few fields
from my catalog entry object

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.734
and doing a simple order.

00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:38.868
And then I'm getting
my results back.

00:29:38.868 --> 00:29:41.501
And I get this getRecords,

00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:43.200
and I get this array
of the SObjects,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.167
which are effectively
Salesforce objects.

00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:47.033
And here I'm just
looping through.

00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:49.601
What I did was I created
a CatalogEntry object,

00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.868
which is just a little
plain old Java object

00:29:51.868 --> 00:29:54.968
with a couple properties
that I can pass on to my JSP.

00:29:54.968 --> 00:29:56.868
And I'm just kind of calling
from SObject,

00:29:56.868 --> 00:29:59.367
which converts it,
and that passes on to the data.

00:29:59.367 --> 00:30:01.000
So that's the gist of it.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.534
I hope that's useful.

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:04.868
Go up to
the Google Code Project,

00:30:04.868 --> 00:30:06.734
and you can see
the code for this

00:30:06.734 --> 00:30:08.133
as well as download it,

00:30:08.133 --> 00:30:09.434
and you could
even check it out live.

00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:11.934
stratusinteriors.appspot.com.

00:30:11.934 --> 00:30:16.467
I think at this point,
I'm gonna hand it over to Iein.

00:30:16.467 --> 00:30:18.167
Valdez:
Thanks, Ryan and Ron.

00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:20.267
So I'm Iein Valdez.

00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:22.634
I work in product development
at Appirio.

00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:26.801
And we help accelerate
the adoption

00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:28.734
of cloud computing
within the Enterprise.

00:30:28.734 --> 00:30:30.634
And I think it's fitting
that this session

00:30:30.634 --> 00:30:32.434
is about connecting
the clouds.

00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:36.100
And, you know, our business
is helping companies

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.434
like Harrah's Entertainment

00:30:38.434 --> 00:30:41.133
take advantage of platforms
like Google Apps

00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:43.033
and also Salesforce.com.

00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:47.167
So I'm gonna show you
a demo we built for Harrah's,

00:30:47.167 --> 00:30:49.834
which essentially
connects Salesforce

00:30:49.834 --> 00:30:52.234
with Google Apps
and App Engine,

00:30:52.234 --> 00:30:54.968
and how we used
the Web Services Client

00:30:54.968 --> 00:30:58.234
that Ron and team
put together

00:30:58.234 --> 00:31:00.067
to make
that connection happen.

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:02.767
So let me--

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:04.901
The premise here,
the background

00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:06.734
is that Harrah's
uses Salesforce

00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:08.267
to manage
their host process

00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:10.167
and reservation process
for VIPs.

00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:13.634
So you have
high stakes VIPs.

00:31:13.634 --> 00:31:15.100
They have a designated host.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.334
A host helps manage
their visits,

00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:18.868
manage their
travel arrangements,

00:31:18.868 --> 00:31:21.000
and makes sure they have
an overall excellent experience.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.167
So let me show you
what that interface looks like.

00:31:25.167 --> 00:31:29.901
And we're gonna go into, uh,

00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:32.534
Salesforce.com.

00:31:32.534 --> 00:31:36.234
And I'm gonna log in as--Oops.

00:31:36.234 --> 00:31:38.634
Salesforce.com.

00:31:38.634 --> 00:31:40.501
I'm gonna log in as Nicole,

00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:44.400
who is a host at Harrah's.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.534
So...

00:31:47.534 --> 00:31:49.467
Nicole...

00:31:58.367 --> 00:32:01.434
And we're gonna log in.

00:32:01.434 --> 00:32:07.367
And what we see here
is the demo instance

00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:09.167
that we've set up
for Harrah's Entertainment.

00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:10.667
And this is where
Nicole, the host,

00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:12.567
manages her day.

00:32:12.567 --> 00:32:13.901
So this is her home page

00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:16.234
where she can see dashboard,
reservations coming in,

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:19.667
event popularity,
also manage tasks.

00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:22.000
You can see that this
is where guests are managed.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
So her VIPs are managed here
as well as the reservations

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.267
that her VIPs
have entered into the system.

00:32:30.267 --> 00:32:32.133
The one point
I want to point out,

00:32:32.133 --> 00:32:34.901
when you see
the interface we built,

00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:39.334
is that not unlike
the earlier catalog demo,

00:32:39.334 --> 00:32:41.767
that the events,
which are the prizes

00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:43.801
in the game that I'm gonna
show you in a second,

00:32:43.801 --> 00:32:45.334
come right out of Salesforce.

00:32:45.334 --> 00:32:48.267
So you'll see here we have
a list of various events.

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:50.067
So let me actually take you

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:56.501
and show you what
the end result looks like.

00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:59.567
So here--

00:32:59.567 --> 00:33:03.200
Okay, so here is
the actual site we have,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.767
and this is
the Total Rewards program

00:33:05.767 --> 00:33:07.868
that Harrah's VIPs have.

00:33:07.868 --> 00:33:11.000
I'm logged in,
in this instance, as a VIP,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and I can see that my host
is Nicole Patterson.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.634
She's my personal concierge.

00:33:14.634 --> 00:33:16.067
I have lots of information.

00:33:16.067 --> 00:33:17.767
And I can--I have
my trip planner here.

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:20.601
And so if I want
to create a trip

00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:22.567
and enter it into this system,
I'm able to do that.

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:24.400
And I can see
events coming up.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.968
Now what we did,
at the bottom here

00:33:26.968 --> 00:33:28.901
you'll see that we have,
you know,

00:33:28.901 --> 00:33:30.434
Play to win Event Prizes.

00:33:30.434 --> 00:33:32.634
And when I click this
and expand that,

00:33:32.634 --> 00:33:35.901
this is an App Engine app
that we built

00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:39.501
which pulls prizes
out of Salesforce.com

00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:41.834
and allows you
to essentially play the game.

00:33:41.834 --> 00:33:44.634
And the logic for the game
is powered in App Engine

00:33:44.634 --> 00:33:46.033
on Java.

00:33:46.033 --> 00:33:48.634
And as you accumulate points

00:33:48.634 --> 00:33:51.234
and accumulate enough
to cash a prize out,

00:33:51.234 --> 00:33:52.901
you're able
to cash the prize out.

00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:56.801
The prize is added
to your travel reservation,

00:33:56.801 --> 00:34:00.467
and then inside of Salesforce
Nicole's able to see that

00:34:00.467 --> 00:34:02.901
and make sure you have
an overall great experience.

00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:08.234
So I'm gonna go ahead
and play the game.

00:34:08.234 --> 00:34:10.667
So let's see,
I'll roll it here,

00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:14.801
and hopefully I can
accumulate enough points.

00:34:14.801 --> 00:34:16.334
man: You're not winning!
Valdez: I'm not winning.

00:34:16.334 --> 00:34:17.667
There we go, okay.

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:19.267
So I now have 250 points.

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:21.767
And you'll see there's
three prizes I could cash out.

00:34:21.767 --> 00:34:24.067
The Price is Right Live,
Bette Midler,

00:34:24.067 --> 00:34:25.634
or Caesars Palace Comedy.

00:34:25.634 --> 00:34:28.067
So I'm gonna go ahead
and cash out The Price is Right.

00:34:28.067 --> 00:34:30.834
Now before I do this,
what this does

00:34:30.834 --> 00:34:34.067
is, at this point
when I click cash out,

00:34:34.067 --> 00:34:35.367
it's gonna go into
Salesforce,

00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:36.968
and it's gonna
pull up my record.

00:34:36.968 --> 00:34:38.734
It's gonna make sure
the prize is still available,

00:34:38.734 --> 00:34:41.367
and then it's gonna add it
to my reservation process

00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:42.734
and then alert the host.

00:34:42.734 --> 00:34:45.400
So I'm gonna go ahead
and click Buy.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.801
And we see that my prize
has been redeemed.

00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:49.133
There's my
confirmation number,

00:34:49.133 --> 00:34:50.667
the title,
the points I redeemed,

00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:53.133
and then sort of some detail
information about the prize.

00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:57.334
So let's go back
into Salesforce,

00:34:57.334 --> 00:34:59.667
and we should see
a new alert

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:04.901
where that prize
has been redeemed.

00:35:04.901 --> 00:35:06.334
Wait for this to load.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:08.167
Okay, so here we go.
Here's my dashboard.

00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:11.334
And now that I see
that James Gray,

00:35:11.334 --> 00:35:13.934
who I was logged in as,
won a slot prize, Bette Midler,

00:35:13.934 --> 00:35:16.868
and I need to update
his guest reservation.

00:35:16.868 --> 00:35:18.434
And so I'll go ahead
and click in here

00:35:18.434 --> 00:35:19.734
and give you
a little bit more detail

00:35:19.734 --> 00:35:21.200
about what that looks like.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.300
We can see that, you know,
when this was entered in.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.267
I'm not sure
what time zone this is.

00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:27.868
But I get details
about the trip,

00:35:27.868 --> 00:35:29.534
and I'm able
to kind of follow up

00:35:29.534 --> 00:35:31.601
and manage
work flow from here.

00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:35.934
So this essentially
is the process.

00:35:35.934 --> 00:35:41.000
And what I want to do now
is go back to the presentation

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.934
if I can find it.

00:35:42.934 --> 00:35:45.467
Let's see.

00:35:45.467 --> 00:35:48.033
Hmm.

00:35:48.033 --> 00:35:51.534
Here we go.

00:35:51.534 --> 00:35:53.033
Where's the presentation?

00:35:53.033 --> 00:35:56.634
I may have killed it
actually.

00:35:56.634 --> 00:35:58.434
Yeah, I'm in Firefox.

00:35:58.434 --> 00:36:00.467
Let's see,
can I pull it back up?

00:36:00.467 --> 00:36:01.801
Right there.
Here we go.

00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:04.801
Sorry.

00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:06.734
Let me go ahead
and jump to the slide

00:36:06.734 --> 00:36:10.834
that we were on.

00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:13.033
Yep, start presentation,
okay.

00:36:13.033 --> 00:36:19.300
Sorry, folks.
Technical difficulties here.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.300
Okay, so let's talk about
why we did it this way

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.167
and what are
some of the benefits.

00:36:26.167 --> 00:36:30.601
So we essentially built
this slot machine game

00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:32.300
to show how Harrah's
could really create

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.601
an engaging experience

00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:35.200
and sort of leverage
the strength of App Engine,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.567
which would allow us
to build multiple

00:36:37.567 --> 00:36:39.067
entertainment applications,

00:36:39.067 --> 00:36:41.334
take advantage
of Java libraries,

00:36:41.334 --> 00:36:42.667
and really tie those.

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.067
And, you know,
App Engine is great

00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:45.901
for large scale
and viral distribution.

00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:48.901
And it also allowed Harrah's
to target VIP gamers

00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:50.501
whenever they think
about gaming

00:36:50.501 --> 00:36:52.501
in a different context
they think about gaming.

00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:54.467
So it was important
not that this stayed

00:36:54.467 --> 00:36:56.734
just on a host reservation
web page,

00:36:56.734 --> 00:36:58.968
but that we actually
allowed this game to be played

00:36:58.968 --> 00:37:00.534
within other contexts.

00:37:00.534 --> 00:37:01.834
And so we also
built a gadget,

00:37:01.834 --> 00:37:03.167
which I'll show you
here in a second

00:37:03.167 --> 00:37:05.234
which allows the game
to be played within iGoogle

00:37:05.234 --> 00:37:09.534
or any other gadget container.

00:37:09.534 --> 00:37:11.400
So let me go ahead
and actually do that,

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.667
and let me try
not to kill--

00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:15.934
Here we go.

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:19.234
So I'm gonna go ahead
and log into iGoogle.

00:37:19.234 --> 00:37:21.434
And I'll just show you what
that same slot machine game

00:37:21.434 --> 00:37:22.801
looks like being run.

00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:25.634
I'm gonna log out
and log back in as myself.

00:37:29.434 --> 00:37:33.534
Here we go.

00:37:33.534 --> 00:37:37.033
And what we should see here
when I got to--Oops.

00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:40.567
Go to iGoogle

00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:43.701
is we have our
slot machine game right here.

00:37:43.701 --> 00:37:45.634
Now it doesn't quite
fit in this view,

00:37:45.634 --> 00:37:48.400
but I can go ahead
and expand the gadget

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.567
and get in canvas mode.

00:37:52.567 --> 00:37:54.434
And so here's
the game again.

00:37:54.434 --> 00:37:58.033
And so the idea is that
if I'm a VIP,

00:37:58.033 --> 00:37:59.367
I'm able to actually
play this game

00:37:59.367 --> 00:38:01.033
not just on that
host reservation page,

00:38:01.033 --> 00:38:02.434
but within iGoogle

00:38:02.434 --> 00:38:03.834
where maybe I spend my time
looking at e-mail

00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:05.567
and planning my trips
and so forth.

00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:07.667
So I can, again, go ahead
and play the game here

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.267
and maybe win again.

00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:10.634
There we go.

00:38:10.634 --> 00:38:12.934
I can get
the Bette Midler prize,

00:38:12.934 --> 00:38:14.234
cash it out,

00:38:14.234 --> 00:38:15.901
and if we go back
to the host reservation page,

00:38:15.901 --> 00:38:19.634
you'll see
that it shows up

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:21.901
and is recorded as another
prize that I've won.

00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:26.467
So, I mean, that's
essentially the demo

00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:28.334
that we wanted to show.

00:38:28.334 --> 00:38:31.634
I had two quick pictures
I wanted to show you

00:38:31.634 --> 00:38:33.133
about the IDE environment,

00:38:33.133 --> 00:38:36.067
which is really talking about
building Java applications

00:38:36.067 --> 00:38:38.968
and--all within Eclipse.

00:38:38.968 --> 00:38:42.968
And so I'm gonna
open this up super quick.

00:38:42.968 --> 00:38:45.667
And I have
two pictures here.

00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:47.901
So this
is essentially a picture

00:38:47.901 --> 00:38:49.334
of the Eclipse
IDE environment,

00:38:49.334 --> 00:38:50.567
which you're all
familiar with and--

00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:53.033
or most may be
familiar with.

00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:58.367
And we've installed
the Java--the Java plugin

00:38:58.367 --> 00:38:59.968
for App Engine.

00:38:59.968 --> 00:39:01.767
So we're able
to build deploy apps.

00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:04.501
And so you'll see
I've got my project here.

00:39:04.501 --> 00:39:07.033
Now the thing
I wanted to show you

00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:09.167
was that side by side,

00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:11.534
you're able to essentially--

00:39:11.534 --> 00:39:16.133
Here's my Force.com
work environment.

00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:18.868
So I'm essentially able
to build my App Engine apps

00:39:18.868 --> 00:39:21.234
and also work in Force.com
all within Eclipse.

00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:24.667
And so it makes for
a really productive experience

00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:26.133
to be able
to switch back and forth

00:39:26.133 --> 00:39:28.033
and not have to change context.

00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:30.067
So I just wanted to highlight
that it makes it

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:32.501
a easy-to-use experience.

00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:37.200
So I'm gonna go back
to our presentation.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.367
And I have
one other slide

00:39:40.367 --> 00:39:42.234
to sum up here.

00:39:42.234 --> 00:39:45.934
So coming back
to this question of--

00:39:45.934 --> 00:39:47.801
of connecting the clouds,

00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:49.501
we thought there were
very many advantages

00:39:49.501 --> 00:39:51.267
to using App Engine.

00:39:51.267 --> 00:39:52.801
Essentially we're able
to take advantage

00:39:52.801 --> 00:39:55.467
of the Java developer community
and the libraries out there

00:39:55.467 --> 00:39:58.801
when building these
slot machine-type applications,

00:39:58.801 --> 00:40:00.734
and we're able to embed it
in multiple contexts,

00:40:00.734 --> 00:40:02.067
like iGoogle.

00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:04.234
So App Engine made it
very easy to do that for us.

00:40:04.234 --> 00:40:06.033
And it was also
a pay-as-you-go model

00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:07.667
for auto scaling,
'cause we didn't know

00:40:07.667 --> 00:40:10.801
what the user utilization
of our games would be.

00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:12.968
Now obviously there are
a ton of advantages

00:40:12.968 --> 00:40:15.801
to using Force.com,
especially since Harrah's

00:40:15.801 --> 00:40:17.367
uses Force
for host management,

00:40:17.367 --> 00:40:19.000
and there are some things
we couldn't do in App Engine

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.467
that was wanted
to do in Force.

00:40:20.467 --> 00:40:22.968
So we wanted to be able
to track these prizes,

00:40:22.968 --> 00:40:24.868
make sure that the host
was aware of them

00:40:24.868 --> 00:40:27.400
so that the VIP felt like
he had an excellent experience.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.100
We were able
to trigger work flow

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.701
and manage
the guest's experience,

00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:32.634
and also track engagement
from guests,

00:40:32.634 --> 00:40:35.567
even for those that didn't
actually book a trip

00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:38.734
or actually lost the game so
that there was some follow-up.

00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:41.767
So that was essentially
what I wanted to talk about.

00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:43.601
We're very excited about
the Web Service Client,

00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:45.968
and back to Ron.

00:40:45.968 --> 00:40:48.234
Hess: All right.

00:40:48.234 --> 00:40:50.000
Make sure I've got this on.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.334
All right,
thank you very much, Iein.

00:40:51.334 --> 00:40:52.634
That was an exciting demo.

00:40:52.634 --> 00:40:53.868
And thank you, Ryan,

00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.767
for building
that Java catalog experience.

00:40:55.767 --> 00:41:00.434
You can get the source code
for the catalog demo

00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:04.501
out on--it's out on
code.google.com.

00:41:04.501 --> 00:41:08.734
It's located in this
project repository,

00:41:08.734 --> 00:41:12.601
which is called
sfdc-wsc.

00:41:12.601 --> 00:41:15.701
You can link to that from
developer.force.com

00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:18.267
where we have
an App Engine landing page.

00:41:18.267 --> 00:41:21.367
We do have support
for Python App Engine

00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:23.434
and Java App Engine.

00:41:23.434 --> 00:41:24.868
And the really exciting thing

00:41:24.868 --> 00:41:27.200
about the WSC client
for App Engine

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.634
is it really means
that you can bring

00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:32.467
any web service
to App Engine,

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:34.167
not just ours.

00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:37.434
Although we did test ours
on App Engine.

00:41:37.434 --> 00:41:39.701
So I've got time
for questions.

00:41:39.701 --> 00:41:42.100
So I want to see if you guys
have any questions

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.601
about what we've
talked about today

00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:47.567
or the tool kit
or any of these technologies.

00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:51.567
I see one question.
Go ahead and--

00:41:51.567 --> 00:41:54.234
Yeah, go ahead and approach
the microphone,

00:41:54.234 --> 00:42:00.434
and I'll repeat
your question as well.

00:42:00.434 --> 00:42:03.300
man: Biggest concern
and question we have

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.634
was we were at the Force event
down at Plug and Play,

00:42:05.634 --> 00:42:08.400
is we need
the microsecond DB

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.634
behind that
from Force to Oracle.

00:42:10.634 --> 00:42:12.367
You know,
the 11g stuff is nice,

00:42:12.367 --> 00:42:15.367
and it's commoditized,
but if I'm gonna pay--

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:17.801
and I don't mind paying--
I need the microsecond I/O

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:22.434
that times in and open source
[indistinct] DSS.

00:42:22.434 --> 00:42:25.501
Is there gonna be
a premium tier for Force apps

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:28.033
for people who need
real-time CRM?

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:30.601
Like not Memcache,
'cause if I do that,

00:42:30.601 --> 00:42:32.067
I can do it on, like,
App Engine

00:42:32.067 --> 00:42:33.734
or any other
lap stack system.

00:42:33.734 --> 00:42:36.033
I need, like,
10, 15, 30 second--

00:42:36.033 --> 00:42:41.200
Mobile-ready networks
for CRM.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.334
Hess: Okay, so let me make
sure I understand the question.

00:42:44.334 --> 00:42:45.901
You want to--

00:42:45.901 --> 00:42:47.534
Do you want
to combine the clouds or--

00:42:47.534 --> 00:42:49.033
man: Yeah, we're combining
both clouds,

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.501
but we want
the premium hardware

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:53.167
and microsecond databases that
Oracle can give you on Force.

00:42:53.167 --> 00:42:55.100
We don't want
just the 11g stuff.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.667
We can get that anywhere.

00:42:56.667 --> 00:42:59.367
If we can get that from Force,
we'll pay more,

00:42:59.367 --> 00:43:00.701
because we have
mobile customers

00:43:00.701 --> 00:43:03.901
who bring us 10 to 30
to 50 odd dollars a month each

00:43:03.901 --> 00:43:06.400
all over the world, so.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.167
Hess: You know, I don't know
the answer to that question,

00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:10.734
so let's--
check with me afterwards,

00:43:10.734 --> 00:43:12.734
and I'd like
to understand more.

00:43:12.734 --> 00:43:15.367
Using an Oracle
on-premise feature?

00:43:15.367 --> 00:43:17.234
man: No, you got Oracle
behind Force.

00:43:17.234 --> 00:43:18.767
That's what you're on.

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:21.467
Hess: Yeah, but we expose
our platform

00:43:21.467 --> 00:43:23.234
through our feature set.

00:43:23.234 --> 00:43:25.167
man: Right, but in order
to get the time performance,

00:43:25.167 --> 00:43:28.167
like, not an hour, we need,
like, ten minutes--

00:43:28.167 --> 00:43:29.934
Like, doing real CRM,

00:43:29.934 --> 00:43:32.100
trending specifically
on mobile users

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.434
go much faster than that.

00:43:33.434 --> 00:43:34.734
So we need to be able
to get ahead of it

00:43:34.734 --> 00:43:36.300
using CRM like yours,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.200
see what trending's coming,
how many--

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.667
Then we can deploy
on, like, App Engine...

00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:43.000
more instances and turn out
more of the actual use

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.834
to stay ahead of that,
'cause App Engine

00:43:44.834 --> 00:43:46.534
kinda does
a pre-caching thing.

00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:48.834
It tells by traffic
pre-caching, like,

00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:51.501
little instances ready when
we're gonna get more traffic.

00:43:51.501 --> 00:43:54.467
But Salesforce,
with a microsecond Oracle,

00:43:54.467 --> 00:43:56.534
like times ten type
infrastructure,

00:43:56.534 --> 00:43:58.334
versus, like, the 11g stuff,

00:43:58.334 --> 00:44:00.734
will let us
be able to deploy faster

00:44:00.734 --> 00:44:03.033
and see it coming faster
with CRM.

00:44:03.033 --> 00:44:04.601
So that's what we'd like if--

00:44:04.601 --> 00:44:07.000
And we'll pay more
if you can give us that.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.234
Hess: Okay, I'll be happy
to talk to you

00:44:09.234 --> 00:44:13.234
about the pricing
and availability of that--

00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:14.901
of that type of feature,

00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:16.801
but I want to make sure
I understand it more,

00:44:16.801 --> 00:44:18.667
so I'd like to talk
to your afterwards

00:44:18.667 --> 00:44:21.901
and really get
to the bottom

00:44:21.901 --> 00:44:24.701
of the inquiry.

00:44:24.701 --> 00:44:28.167
Any other questions
about the architecture,

00:44:28.167 --> 00:44:30.801
combining these clouds,

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:35.133
or anything else?

00:44:35.133 --> 00:44:36.767
All right, fantastic.

00:44:36.767 --> 00:44:39.701
So if you have time,
come and see us afterwards,

00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:41.467
ask some specific questions,

00:44:41.467 --> 00:44:43.667
and I do thank you
for sticking around,

00:44:43.667 --> 00:44:46.534
staying till the last session
of the last day,

00:44:46.534 --> 00:44:48.300
and spending it with us.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.701
Thank you very much.

00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:51.634
[applause]
