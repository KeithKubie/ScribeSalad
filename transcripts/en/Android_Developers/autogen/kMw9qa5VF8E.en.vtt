know if I'm an expert yet I'm hoping to
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.960
know if I'm an expert yet I'm hoping to
become one and this is sort of that

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970
become one and this is sort of that
 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.180
become one and this is sort of that
first foray into that so I spent a lot

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190
first foray into that so I spent a lot
 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.880
first foray into that so I spent a lot
of time with game controllers working on

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
of time with game controllers working on
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.800
of time with game controllers working on
the stuff that I work on and I've had a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810
the stuff that I work on and I've had a
 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.590
the stuff that I work on and I've had a
slew of them crossed my desk and you

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600
slew of them crossed my desk and you
 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.170
slew of them crossed my desk and you
know with that you know this is sort of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
know with that you know this is sort of
 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.100
know with that you know this is sort of
the first thing what does it mean to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110
the first thing what does it mean to
 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.690
the first thing what does it mean to
support a game controller on Android

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700
support a game controller on Android
 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.160
support a game controller on Android
because there's so many different

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170
because there's so many different
 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.500
because there's so many different
devices and they all choose slightly

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510
devices and they all choose slightly
 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.200
devices and they all choose slightly
different ways of connecting to and ER

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210
different ways of connecting to and ER
 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.580
different ways of connecting to and ER
itself a lot of them are either

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590
itself a lot of them are either
 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.400
itself a lot of them are either
Bluetooth or USB those are typically the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410
Bluetooth or USB those are typically the
 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.370
Bluetooth or USB those are typically the
only options that you're going to have

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380
only options that you're going to have
 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.230
only options that you're going to have
but one interesting thing is when you're

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240
but one interesting thing is when you're
 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960
but one interesting thing is when you're
building an application that utilizes

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970
building an application that utilizes
 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.460
building an application that utilizes
game controllers you have to factor in

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
game controllers you have to factor in
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.220
game controllers you have to factor in
that you're taking the user's ability to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230
that you're taking the user's ability to
 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.280
that you're taking the user's ability to
really touch a screen away from them and

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290
really touch a screen away from them and
 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020
really touch a screen away from them and
this is a good thing and a bad thing

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030
this is a good thing and a bad thing
 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.120
this is a good thing and a bad thing
it's it's a good thing in that it gives

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130
it's it's a good thing in that it gives
 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.310
it's it's a good thing in that it gives
you that that tactile feedback when

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320
you that that tactile feedback when
 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.290
you that that tactile feedback when
you're manipulating the controls

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300
you're manipulating the controls
 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.670
you're manipulating the controls
pressing buttons etcetera it's something

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680
pressing buttons etcetera it's something
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.560

that doesn't require you to focus your
 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.050
that doesn't require you to focus your
attention on what you're touching you

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060
attention on what you're touching you
 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.580

reading this slide now but I'll cover

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.090
reading this slide now but I'll cover
 

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.000
reading this slide now but I'll cover
the basics here what you want to do is

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010
the basics here what you want to do is
 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.469
the basics here what you want to do is
you want to take the input device class

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479
you want to take the input device class
 

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.659
you want to take the input device class
and you're gonna ask it for you can

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:40.669
and you're gonna ask it for you can
 

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.670
and you're gonna ask it for you can
basically say get all device IDs and

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680
basically say get all device IDs and
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.400
basically say get all device IDs and
you'll get back an integer array of all

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.410
you'll get back an integer array of all
 

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.680
you'll get back an integer array of all
the devices that are currently connected

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:46.690
the devices that are currently connected
 

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.750
the devices that are currently connected
to the Android system whether they're

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760
to the Android system whether they're
 

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.870
to the Android system whether they're
virtual or real what you want to do then

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880
virtual or real what you want to do then
 

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.640
virtual or real what you want to do then
is actually iterate over all those

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:54.650
is actually iterate over all those
 

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.670
is actually iterate over all those
device IDs and request again from the

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680
device IDs and request again from the
 

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.400
device IDs and request again from the
input device class get device and you're

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:00.410
input device class get device and you're
 

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.870
input device class get device and you're
going to pass in the ID that you're

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880
going to pass in the ID that you're
 

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.480
going to pass in the ID that you're
currently iterating on that will give

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:04.490
currently iterating on that will give
 

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.810
currently iterating on that will give
you an input device object and you can

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:07.820
you an input device object and you can
 

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.730
you an input device object and you can
now start to ask that input device

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:09.740
now start to ask that input device
 

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.520
now start to ask that input device
object about itself and the key here for

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:12.530
object about itself and the key here for
 

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.740
object about itself and the key here for
detecting game controllers is in fact to

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:14.750
detecting game controllers is in fact to
 

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.130
detecting game controllers is in fact to
use device get source so devices are

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.140
use device get source so devices are
 

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.710
use device get source so devices are
input device object that we created get

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720
input device object that we created get
 

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.329
input device object that we created get
sources returns a an integer value which

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:25.339
sources returns a an integer value which
 

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:29.140
sources returns a an integer value which
is actually a set of bitmaps bitmask

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.150
is actually a set of bitmaps bitmask
 

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.840
is actually a set of bitmaps bitmask
mapped values that create a large

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:31.850
mapped values that create a large
 

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.750
mapped values that create a large
integer you will logically end those

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760
integer you will logically end those
 

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.910
integer you will logically end those
with an input device source class

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920
with an input device source class
 

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.340
with an input device source class
joystick effectively what you're doing

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:39.350
joystick effectively what you're doing
 

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.450
joystick effectively what you're doing
there is you're filtering out all the

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:40.460
there is you're filtering out all the
 

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.500
there is you're filtering out all the
other bits and you're just looking at

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.510
other bits and you're just looking at
 

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.970
other bits and you're just looking at
the one that's going to tell you hey

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:42.980
the one that's going to tell you hey
 

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.310
the one that's going to tell you hey
this is a joystick device or it's not

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320
this is a joystick device or it's not
 

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.870
this is a joystick device or it's not
and if that returns non 0 then it is a

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880
and if that returns non 0 then it is a
 

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.280
and if that returns non 0 then it is a
joystick device that means there's an

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.290
joystick device that means there's an
 

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.620
joystick device that means there's an
analog stick on it that is a joystick

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:53.630
analog stick on it that is a joystick
 

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.130
analog stick on it that is a joystick
axis from there you're going to want to

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.140
axis from there you're going to want to
 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.320
axis from there you're going to want to
possibly check the the ranges that are

00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.330
possibly check the the ranges that are
 

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.500
possibly check the the ranges that are
available for that joystick device so

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:01.510
available for that joystick device so
 

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.030
available for that joystick device so
we're gonna look at that now ok actually

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040
we're gonna look at that now ok actually
 

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.790
we're gonna look at that now ok actually
sorry so going back so exercise so I

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800
sorry so going back so exercise so I
 

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.530
sorry so going back so exercise so I
actually can't tell the device like are

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:08.540
actually can't tell the device like are
 

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.930
actually can't tell the device like are

sources and you're gonna ask it yes or
 

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.660
sources and you're gonna ask it yes or
do you have the ability to provide me

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:21.670
do you have the ability to provide me
 

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.980
do you have the ability to provide me
joystick input you have the ability

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:22.990
joystick input you have the ability
 

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.260
joystick input you have the ability
provide me button input chances are if

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.270
provide me button input chances are if
 

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.280
provide me button input chances are if
it has a joystick

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:26.290
it has a joystick
 

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.530

that would have a joystick that would

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160
that would have a joystick that would
 

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.400
that would have a joystick that would
not be a gamepad I've done a lot of

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.410
not be a gamepad I've done a lot of
 

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.900
not be a gamepad I've done a lot of
tests would love it different input

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:33.910
tests would love it different input

useful for determining the number of
 

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.460
useful for determining the number of
axes that are available so if you had a

axes that are available so if you had a
 

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.530

okay now if it also had analog triggers

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:21.730
okay now if it also had analog triggers
 

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.690
okay now if it also had analog triggers
on the left and right those will also

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:24.700
on the left and right those will also
 

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.780
on the left and right those will also
show up as axes but single axes so you

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:27.790
show up as axes but single axes so you
 

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.670
show up as axes but single axes so you
could have a device or maybe I did my

don't ended up a wire for the trigger
for the triggers I was jumping ahead of

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:35.980
for the triggers I was jumping ahead of
 

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.910
for the triggers I was jumping ahead of
myself in my head that's okay so six

axes in that case and the the thing that

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.390
axes in that case and the the thing that
 

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.350
axes in that case and the the thing that
looks like a d-pad actually on game

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360
looks like a d-pad actually on game
 

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360
looks like a d-pad actually on game
input devices people think that it's a

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:48.370
input devices people think that it's a
 

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.970
input devices people think that it's a
digital input and it's not it's actually

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:50.980
digital input and it's not it's actually
 

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.390
digital input and it's not it's actually
a hat device with axes so you get

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.400
a hat device with axes so you get
 

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.310
a hat device with axes so you get
another two off of that so a d-pad looks

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320
another two off of that so a d-pad looks
 

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.820
another two off of that so a d-pad looks
like basically it looks like a almost

00:11:59.820 --> 00:11:59.830
like basically it looks like a almost
 

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.470
like basically it looks like a almost
like an analog joystick except that the

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480
like an analog joystick except that the
 

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.180
like an analog joystick except that the
numbers aren't really analog right you

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.190
numbers aren't really analog right you
 

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.330

had a you know well it returns its axes

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:06.340
had a you know well it returns its axes
 

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.790
had a you know well it returns its axes
values as floats it'll either be 0 or 1

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800

now don't get any the mil ranges whereas

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:10.870
now don't get any the mil ranges whereas
 

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.160
now don't get any the mil ranges whereas
the other more analog style inputs like

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.170
the other more analog style inputs like
 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.770
the other more analog style inputs like
the triggers in the games joysticks will

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:16.780
the triggers in the games joysticks will
 

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.260
the triggers in the games joysticks will
return an analog value range between 0

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.270
return an analog value range between 0
 

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.680
return an analog value range between 0
or negative 1 + + 1 so that's just

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:22.690
or negative 1 + + 1 so that's just
 

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.810
or negative 1 + + 1 so that's just
something to be aware of so we we check

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:24.820
something to be aware of so we we check
 

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.880
something to be aware of so we we check
the motion ranges just to get a

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:26.890
the motion ranges just to get a
 

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.640
the motion ranges just to get a
principle idea of how many axes are

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:29.650
principle idea of how many axes are
 

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.210
principle idea of how many axes are
actually on this device and from there

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220
actually on this device and from there
 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.470
actually on this device and from there
we want to take that information when we

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480
we want to take that information when we
 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.520
we want to take that information when we
restore it in the state we want to

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:35.530
restore it in the state we want to
 

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.530
restore it in the state we want to
create a class that allows us to know

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:37.540
create a class that allows us to know
 

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.260
create a class that allows us to know
how many axes we have the IDS of those

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:40.270
how many axes we have the IDS of those
 

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.170
how many axes we have the IDS of those
axes and the values associated with them

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:43.180
axes and the values associated with them
 

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.960
axes and the values associated with them
so I'm just showing really the skeleton

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:45.970
so I'm just showing really the skeleton
 

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.540
so I'm just showing really the skeleton
of a state class here you're going to

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:48.550
of a state class here you're going to
 

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.790
of a state class here you're going to
want to extend that with things to

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800
want to extend that with things to
 

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.760
want to extend that with things to
process the the axis input and normalize

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:53.770
process the the axis input and normalize
 

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.020
process the the axis input and normalize
it and all that stuff and we'll cover a

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.030
it and all that stuff and we'll cover a
 

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.240
it and all that stuff and we'll cover a
bit of that as we go forward but sort of

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:57.250
bit of that as we go forward but sort of
 

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.560
bit of that as we go forward but sort of
point out the critical things you want

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:58.570
point out the critical things you want
 

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.170
point out the critical things you want
to store number of axes the axes values

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:01.180
to store number of axes the axes values
 

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.390
to store number of axes the axes values
and you're going to want to use probably

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:03.400
and you're going to want to use probably
 

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.090
and you're going to want to use probably
a sparse array to store the number of

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:06.100
a sparse array to store the number of
 

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.180
a sparse array to store the number of
keys that you encounter the keys are

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.190
keys that you encounter the keys are
 

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.520
keys that you encounter the keys are
actually the buttons so these map as

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:11.530
actually the buttons so these map as
 

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.450
actually the buttons so these map as
keys I think it's a little weird but

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:14.460
keys I think it's a little weird but
 

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.220
keys I think it's a little weird but
buttons are keys okay correct me if I'm

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.230
buttons are keys okay correct me if I'm
 

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.010
buttons are keys okay correct me if I'm
wrong but the like in Xbox 360

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.020
wrong but the like in Xbox 360
 

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.390
wrong but the like in Xbox 360
controller for instance I believe those

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:21.400
controller for instance I believe those
 

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.000
controller for instance I believe those
buttons are actually analog is that is

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.010
buttons are actually analog is that is
 

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.770
buttons are actually analog is that is
that true and if I had something that

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:25.780
that true and if I had something that
 

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.160
that true and if I had something that
was similar is not I'm actually not

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.170
was similar is not I'm actually not
 

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.750
was similar is not I'm actually not
aware of that I didn't know get it I

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760
aware of that I didn't know get it I
 

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.190
aware of that I didn't know get it I
could be totally wrong that's that's

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:32.200
could be totally wrong that's that's
 

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.680
could be totally wrong that's that's
what I vaguely remember manufacturers

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:34.690
what I vaguely remember manufacturers
 

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.300
what I vaguely remember manufacturers
can do different things and this just

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:36.310
can do different things and this just
 

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.500
can do different things and this just
goes back to what I said earlier there

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:37.510
goes back to what I said earlier there
 

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.960
goes back to what I said earlier there
is so many different types of game

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:39.970
is so many different types of game
 

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.210
is so many different types of game
controller inputs out there it's really

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:42.220
controller inputs out there it's really
 

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.770
controller inputs out there it's really
hard to know what they all are which is

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:43.780
hard to know what they all are which is
 

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.350
hard to know what they all are which is
why you know approaching the way Android

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360
why you know approaching the way Android
 

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.940
why you know approaching the way Android
has approached it is really good lets

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:47.950
has approached it is really good lets
 

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.650
has approached it is really good lets
you query the device for what it's

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:49.660
you query the device for what it's
 

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.280
you query the device for what it's
capable of which lets you then determine

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.290
capable of which lets you then determine
 

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.600
capable of which lets you then determine
if the device is capable of providing

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.610
if the device is capable of providing
 

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.620
if the device is capable of providing
the right kind of input for your

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:55.630
the right kind of input for your
 

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.360
the right kind of input for your
application of game okay

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:57.370
application of game okay
 

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.280
application of game okay
so let's say a query device you know

00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.290
so let's say a query device you know
 

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.080
so let's say a query device you know
it's a you know kind of standard to

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.090
it's a you know kind of standard to
 

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.540
it's a you know kind of standard to
analog joystick you know a couple of

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:03.550
analog joystick you know a couple of
 

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.550
analog joystick you know a couple of
triggers and it says okay you know I've

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560

so when you get a an on motion event and
 

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.420
so when you get a an on motion event and
we'll talk about some of the score

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.430
we'll talk about some of the score

forward when you get a dispatch on
 

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.500
forward when you get a dispatch on
motion event from your activity class

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:22.510
motion event from your activity class
 

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.660

that the event object is either a motion

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:24.670
that the event object is either a motion
 

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.030
that the event object is either a motion
event or key input event will ignore the

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040
event or key input event will ignore the
 

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.710
event or key input event will ignore the
key input event so you get a motion

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720
key input event so you get a motion
 

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.940
key input event so you get a motion
event and the event object itself has

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:30.950
event and the event object itself has
 

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.330
event and the event object itself has
information about what input source on

the device is providing that particular
 

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.310
the device is providing that particular
input event so there's a couple of

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320
input event so there's a couple of
 

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.630
input event so there's a couple of

with game controllers and so you have to

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:46.430
with game controllers and so you have to
 

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.570

do a bit of experimentation my advice is

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:49.580
do a bit of experimentation my advice is
 

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.100

more or less but it's a bit of trial and
 

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.070
more or less but it's a bit of trial and

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.519
seen in certain games is something along
these lines where you know the game

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:54.529
these lines where you know the game
 

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:55.930

these controller things into the right
 

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.140
these controller things into the right
player slot and then that player could

go ahead and configure their device to
 

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.490
go ahead and configure their device to

not experienced yet so now let's get

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960
not experienced yet so now let's get
 

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.790
not experienced yet so now let's get
back to what we were talking about

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:30.800
back to what we were talking about
 

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.620

before the handling of events so there's

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:32.630
before the handling of events so there's
 

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.410
before the handling of events so there's
there's two methods you're gonna want to

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:35.420
there's two methods you're gonna want to
 

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.650
there's two methods you're gonna want to
override in your activity and that is

override in your activity and that is
 

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.299
override in your activity and that is
dispatched generic motion event and

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:40.309
dispatched generic motion event and
 

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.860

my recommendation is whatever you're

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120
my recommendation is whatever you're
 

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.910
my recommendation is whatever you're
going to write for your logic to manage

going to write for your logic to manage
 

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.430
going to write for your logic to manage
your input from a game controller you're

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440
your input from a game controller you're
 

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.840
your input from a game controller you're
going to want to feed these motion

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:49.850
going to want to feed these motion
 

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.580
going to want to feed these motion
events from your activity into that

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:51.590

it'll just blow your code and it's not a
 

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:02.080
it'll just blow your code and it's not a
good way to abstract I think so whenever

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.090
good way to abstract I think so whenever
 

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.049
good way to abstract I think so whenever
there is a axis movement or a hat

00:18:05.049 --> 00:18:05.059
there is a axis movement or a hat
 

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:07.299
there is a axis movement or a hat
movement or an analog trigger you're

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:07.309
movement or an analog trigger you're
 

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:08.890
movement or an analog trigger you're
gonna get the motion event so anything

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:08.900
gonna get the motion event so anything
 

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.230
gonna get the motion event so anything
that's analog will cause motion any

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240
that's analog will cause motion any
 

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.590
that's analog will cause motion any
button event will trigger the dispatch

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600
button event will trigger the dispatch
 

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.990

another abstraction layer so you're

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.010
another abstraction layer so you're
 

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.930
another abstraction layer so you're
going to want to pass this off to

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:43.940
going to want to pass this off to

kind of they're moved around a lot the
 

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.950
kind of they're moved around a lot the
mechanical things and so they can get a

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960
mechanical things and so they can get a
 

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.390
mechanical things and so they can get a
little off and it can report to the

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400
little off and it can report to the
 

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.460

get flat on the the motion range this

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:33.380
get flat on the the motion range this
 

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.080
get flat on the the motion range this
allows you to determine some sort of air

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.090
allows you to determine some sort of air
 

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.350
allows you to determine some sort of air
tolerance when the the joystick is is

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360
tolerance when the the joystick is is
 

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.910
tolerance when the the joystick is is
sort of released and not being touched

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:39.920
sort of released and not being touched
 

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.640

by the the player use the motion range

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:45.650
by the the player use the motion range
 

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.680
by the the player use the motion range
to of the joystick to determine the

stuff so the ones you care about or get

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.250
stuff so the ones you care about or get
 

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.220
stuff so the ones you care about or get
min get max and get flat which I just

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.230
min get max and get flat which I just
 

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.930
min get max and get flat which I just
mentioned you'll have to normalize your

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:52.940
mentioned you'll have to normalize your
 

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.390
mentioned you'll have to normalize your
access values accordingly so I actually

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400
access values accordingly so I actually
 

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.100
access values accordingly so I actually
have a bit of code here that shows this

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.110
have a bit of code here that shows this
 

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.130
have a bit of code here that shows this
off the apartment so if we would have

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.140
off the apartment so if we would have
 

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.800
off the apartment so if we would have
process and axes and we have some access

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:02.810
process and axes and we have some access
 

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.500
process and axes and we have some access
value that we've gotten from our input

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:05.510
value that we've gotten from our input
 

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.040
value that we've gotten from our input
state or controller state object so we

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.050
state or controller state object so we
 

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.330
state or controller state object so we
have motion range we have the access

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:10.340
have motion range we have the access
 

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.860
have motion range we have the access
value what we want to do is we want to

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:11.870
value what we want to do is we want to
 

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.900
value what we want to do is we want to
get the absolute value of that access

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:13.910
get the absolute value of that access
 

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.490
get the absolute value of that access
value and then we want to determine the

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:15.500
value and then we want to determine the
 

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.380
value and then we want to determine the
dead zone so we're going to go get flat

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:17.390
dead zone so we're going to go get flat
 

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.290
dead zone so we're going to go get flat
and then we want to determine if the

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:20.300
and then we want to determine if the
 

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.000
and then we want to determine if the
absolute value is less than or equal to

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.010
absolute value is less than or equal to
 

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.100
absolute value is less than or equal to
the dead zone if it is return zero that

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.110
the dead zone if it is return zero that
 

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.810
the dead zone if it is return zero that
means that it's actually within that

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:25.820
means that it's actually within that
 

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.310
means that it's actually within that
range and we shouldn't do anything with

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320
range and we shouldn't do anything with
 

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.940
range and we shouldn't do anything with
this or if the axis value is greater

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:30.950
this or if the axis value is greater
 

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.100
this or if the axis value is greater
than 0 we want to return the absolute

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.110
than 0 we want to return the absolute
 

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.650
than 0 we want to return the absolute
value divided by the minimum range which

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.660
value divided by the minimum range which
 

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.400
value divided by the minimum range which
gives us a normalized value if it's less

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.410
gives us a normalized value if it's less
 

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.160
gives us a normalized value if it's less
than 0 we're going to do absolute value

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.170
than 0 we're going to do absolute value
 

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.390
than 0 we're going to do absolute value
divided by maximum range so what I like

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400
divided by maximum range so what I like
 

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.490
divided by maximum range so what I like
what do these numbers typically look

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:48.500
what do these numbers typically look
 

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.130
what do these numbers typically look
like like you know is get flat get so

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:51.140
like like you know is get flat get so
 

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.020
like like you know is get flat get so
I'm assuming Getman is a negative value

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:53.030
I'm assuming Getman is a negative value
 

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.150
I'm assuming Getman is a negative value
oh yes okay yeah so get men is a

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:57.160
oh yes okay yeah so get men is a
 

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.070
oh yes okay yeah so get men is a
typically negative one

00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080
typically negative one
 

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.200
typically negative one
okay and get Max's it's typically

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:01.210
okay and get Max's it's typically
 

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.940
okay and get Max's it's typically
followed one yes but you can actually

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:02.950
followed one yes but you can actually
 

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.649
followed one yes but you can actually
modify this if you want to actually get

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:04.659
modify this if you want to actually get
 

00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:07.019
modify this if you want to actually get
out of let's say a method like this you

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:07.029
out of let's say a method like this you
 

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:09.419
out of let's say a method like this you
wanted to get some greater range you

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:09.429
wanted to get some greater range you
 

00:21:09.429 --> 00:21:10.710
wanted to get some greater range you
want to expand it us you're not dealing

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720
want to expand it us you're not dealing
 

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.539
want to expand it us you're not dealing
with with decimals you're instead

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:12.549
with with decimals you're instead
 

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:14.129
with with decimals you're instead
dealing with integers which is

00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:14.139
dealing with integers which is
 

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:17.970
dealing with integers which is
completely possible you could add biases

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:17.980
completely possible you could add biases
 

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.279
completely possible you could add biases
to your calculations here to actually

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:20.289
to your calculations here to actually
 

00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:23.190
to your calculations here to actually
spit out Oh a thousand or two hundred or

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200
spit out Oh a thousand or two hundred or
 

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.320
spit out Oh a thousand or two hundred or
you know and get flat here would

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:25.330
you know and get flat here would
 

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.149
you know and get flat here would
probably look like say point zero five

00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159
probably look like say point zero five
 

00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:29.100
probably look like say point zero five
or something like that oh I think it

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.110
or something like that oh I think it
 

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.389
or something like that oh I think it
would look even smaller it's like okay

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:30.399
would look even smaller it's like okay
 

00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:32.129
would look even smaller it's like okay
it's usually like from what I've seen

00:21:32.129 --> 00:21:32.139
it's usually like from what I've seen
 

00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:33.539
it's usually like from what I've seen
from when I played this like point zero

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:33.549
from when I played this like point zero
 

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:36.060
from when I played this like point zero
two or zero two zero one it's it's very

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.070
two or zero two zero one it's it's very
 

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.729
two or zero two zero one it's it's very
small okay percentage because remember

00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:38.739
small okay percentage because remember
 

00:21:38.739 --> 00:21:39.930
small okay percentage because remember
the values we're dealing with here are

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:39.940
the values we're dealing with here are
 

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.359
the values we're dealing with here are
negative one to one and zero is supposed

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:42.369
negative one to one and zero is supposed
 

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:44.940
negative one to one and zero is supposed
to be that that absolute center but it

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:44.950
to be that that absolute center but it
 

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.799
to be that that absolute center but it
you know it fluctuates a tiny bit not a

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:46.809
you know it fluctuates a tiny bit not a
 

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:49.229
you know it fluctuates a tiny bit not a
great amount but if there's a lot of

00:21:49.229 --> 00:21:49.239
great amount but if there's a lot of
 

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:51.989
great amount but if there's a lot of
wear and tear on the physical device you

00:21:51.989 --> 00:21:51.999
wear and tear on the physical device you
 

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:56.909
wear and tear on the physical device you
might see greater values okay so one

00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919
might see greater values okay so one
 

00:21:56.919 --> 00:21:58.440
might see greater values okay so one

different players which we already
 

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.989
different players which we already
covered so at this point we're gonna do

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:41.999
covered so at this point we're gonna do
 

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:45.399
covered so at this point we're gonna do
demo so we'll just go to that now

00:23:45.399 --> 00:23:45.409
demo so we'll just go to that now
 

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:49.789

screen here we've got an example of

00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460
screen here we've got an example of
 

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.940
screen here we've got an example of
using focus to your advantage so those

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:01.950
using focus to your advantage so those
 

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.049

little white yeah if I move my gamepad

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059
little white yeah if I move my gamepad
 

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:07.820
little white yeah if I move my gamepad
left and right it'll go back and forth

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:07.830
left and right it'll go back and forth
 

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.149
left and right it'll go back and forth
between by full game and choosing the

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159
between by full game and choosing the
 

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:12.739
between by full game and choosing the
level so like this is a really good

00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:12.749
level so like this is a really good
 

00:24:12.749 --> 00:24:14.389
level so like this is a really good
example of how to illustrate visual

00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:14.399
example of how to illustrate visual
 

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:15.950
example of how to illustrate visual
focus and this goes to what I was

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960
focus and this goes to what I was
 

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.419
focus and this goes to what I was
talking about before when we were

00:24:17.419 --> 00:24:17.429
talking about before when we were
 

00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:19.430
talking about before when we were
talking about the layouts and how not to

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440
talking about the layouts and how not to
 

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.799
talking about the layouts and how not to
trap the user etc so it's very important

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:21.809
trap the user etc so it's very important
 

00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:23.180
trap the user etc so it's very important
to orient the user when they're

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:23.190
to orient the user when they're
 

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.489
to orient the user when they're
navigating with like an analog stick or

are joystick noises I'm really actually
 

00:24:46.229 --> 00:24:48.529
are joystick noises I'm really actually
playing with a joystick so now you pad

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539
playing with a joystick so now you pad
 

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:51.729
playing with a joystick so now you pad
yeah it just it feels very natural

00:24:51.729 --> 00:24:51.739
yeah it just it feels very natural
 

00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:54.619
yeah it just it feels very natural
almost like you're playing a console

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:54.629
almost like you're playing a console
 

00:24:54.629 --> 00:24:57.440
almost like you're playing a console
really yeah I have to say this is uh

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:57.450
really yeah I have to say this is uh
 

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.269
really yeah I have to say this is uh
it's nice and smooth you'd actually

00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279
it's nice and smooth you'd actually
 

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:04.339
it's nice and smooth you'd actually
double jump in this uh-huh okay and you

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:04.349
double jump in this uh-huh okay and you
 

00:25:04.349 --> 00:25:06.109
double jump in this uh-huh okay and you
know for me playing platformers like

00:25:06.109 --> 00:25:06.119
know for me playing platformers like
 

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:08.330
know for me playing platformers like
this it's it just makes all the

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340
this it's it just makes all the
 

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.369
this it's it just makes all the
difference to use a controller you're

00:25:10.369 --> 00:25:10.379
difference to use a controller you're
 

00:25:10.379 --> 00:25:11.980
difference to use a controller you're
not distracted by

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:11.990
not distracted by
 

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.910
not distracted by
on screen touch needs even though the UI

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:15.920
on screen touch needs even though the UI
 

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.830
on screen touch needs even though the UI
in this case is still showing some touch

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840
in this case is still showing some touch
 

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.680
in this case is still showing some touch
commands you have the option to jump

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:20.690
commands you have the option to jump
 

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.740
commands you have the option to jump
back on touch screen which is great yeah

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:23.750
back on touch screen which is great yeah
 

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.200
back on touch screen which is great yeah
I have to say this is a lot more fun to

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.210
I have to say this is a lot more fun to
 

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:28.210
I have to say this is a lot more fun to
control using using a gamepad controller

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:28.220
control using using a gamepad controller
 

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.760
control using using a gamepad controller
it's a I don't have to kind of look to

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:30.770
it's a I don't have to kind of look to
 

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.530
it's a I don't have to kind of look to
see you know if my fingers are in the

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:32.540
see you know if my fingers are in the
 

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.150
see you know if my fingers are in the
right place I can kind of just feel that

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.160
right place I can kind of just feel that
 

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.700
right place I can kind of just feel that
and this just feels for me a lot more

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:36.710
and this just feels for me a lot more
 

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.830
and this just feels for me a lot more
natural playing a platformer game like

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840
natural playing a platformer game like
 

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.480
natural playing a platformer game like
this absolutely and one thing that

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:40.490
this absolutely and one thing that
 

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.890
this absolutely and one thing that
actually frustrates me a little bit

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:41.900
actually frustrates me a little bit
 

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.960
actually frustrates me a little bit
about the on screen controller

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:43.970
about the on screen controller
 

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.910
about the on screen controller
simulators and that's kind of what I

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:45.920
simulators and that's kind of what I
 

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.070
simulators and that's kind of what I
call them is just simulation of game

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080
call them is just simulation of game
 

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.070
call them is just simulation of game
pads sometimes when there's garbage

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080
pads sometimes when there's garbage
 

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.900
pads sometimes when there's garbage
collection going on within the app or

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:52.910
collection going on within the app or
 

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.940
collection going on within the app or
even on the platform you can get some

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:54.950
even on the platform you can get some
 

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.820
even on the platform you can get some
you know some lanky feedback from what

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:57.830
you know some lanky feedback from what
 

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.799
you know some lanky feedback from what
you're touching and it actually caused

00:25:59.799 --> 00:25:59.809
you're touching and it actually caused
 

00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:02.260
you're touching and it actually caused
the game not to do what you intended it

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:02.270
the game not to do what you intended it
 

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.580
the game not to do what you intended it
to do I don't know if you've ever

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:03.590
to do I don't know if you've ever
 

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.900
to do I don't know if you've ever
experienced that I have not engine so

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:07.910
experienced that I have not engine so
 

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.750
experienced that I have not engine so
you know just makes for me anyway the

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760
you know just makes for me anyway the
 

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.360
you know just makes for me anyway the
argument that all games really should

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:13.370
argument that all games really should
 

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.790
argument that all games really should
try and strive and support game

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:15.800
try and strive and support game
 

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.490
try and strive and support game
controllers in this way sounds good yeah

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:18.500
controllers in this way sounds good yeah
 

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.900
controllers in this way sounds good yeah
you know my only my only complaint here

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:19.910
you know my only my only complaint here
 

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.450
you know my only my only complaint here
is I'm sure this maps to a gamepad

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:22.460
is I'm sure this maps to a gamepad
 

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.710
is I'm sure this maps to a gamepad
button but I don't know which one is

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720
button but I don't know which one is
 

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.150
button but I don't know which one is
yeah actually that's that's a good thing

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:25.160
yeah actually that's that's a good thing
 

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.669
yeah actually that's that's a good thing
to point out a lot of the on-screen

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679
to point out a lot of the on-screen
 

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:30.070
to point out a lot of the on-screen
instructions in a game should if there

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080
instructions in a game should if there
 

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.020
instructions in a game should if there
is controller support they should detect

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.030
is controller support they should detect
 

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.000
is controller support they should detect
that the input is mostly coming from a

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.010
that the input is mostly coming from a
 

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.890
that the input is mostly coming from a
controller and maybe adjust the

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:35.900
controller and maybe adjust the
 

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.890
controller and maybe adjust the
instructions to match the buttons so I

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:38.900
instructions to match the buttons so I
 

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.270
instructions to match the buttons so I
think there you go your figures it as

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:40.280
think there you go your figures it as
 

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.350
think there you go your figures it as
the B button yeah like that there we go

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360
the B button yeah like that there we go
 

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.830
the B button yeah like that there we go
alright so yeah great game to play with

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840
alright so yeah great game to play with
 

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.840
alright so yeah great game to play with
a controller there's lots out there a

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:49.850
a controller there's lots out there a
 

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.360
a controller there's lots out there a
lot of the controller vendors highlight

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:52.370
lot of the controller vendors highlight
 

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.410
lot of the controller vendors highlight
the apps that support their controllers

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.420
the apps that support their controllers
 

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.450
the apps that support their controllers
in the market and you should check it

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:58.460
in the market and you should check it
 

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.350
in the market and you should check it
out for some examples cool all right

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360
out for some examples cool all right
 

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.360
out for some examples cool all right
well I could play this for the rest of

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:04.370
well I could play this for the rest of
 

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.160
well I could play this for the rest of
the video but I won't because we got

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:06.170
the video but I won't because we got
 

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.260
the video but I won't because we got
some wrapping up to do alright let's

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:08.270
some wrapping up to do alright let's
 

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.350
some wrapping up to do alright let's
let's get back into it alright alright

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360
let's get back into it alright alright
 

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.780
let's get back into it alright alright
and so we've got a few some some Q&amp;A at

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:13.790
and so we've got a few some some Q&amp;A at
 

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.040
and so we've got a few some some Q&amp;A at
the end I actually had a couple

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.050
the end I actually had a couple
 

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.410
the end I actually had a couple
questions that are not on here so I'm

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:17.420
questions that are not on here so I'm
 

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.210
questions that are not on here so I'm
getting oh yeah yeah let's do some

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.220
getting oh yeah yeah let's do some
 

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.610
getting oh yeah yeah let's do some
improv well so at the beginning you

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:21.620
improv well so at the beginning you
 

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.080
improv well so at the beginning you
mentioned you know you talked about sort

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.090
mentioned you know you talked about sort
 

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.560
mentioned you know you talked about sort
of there's two ways to

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:24.570
of there's two ways to
 

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.820
of there's two ways to
you know Bluetooth or USB does a

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:28.830
you know Bluetooth or USB does a
 

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.009
you know Bluetooth or USB does a
developer need to care like do I need to

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:31.019
developer need to care like do I need to
 

00:27:31.019 --> 00:27:33.610
developer need to care like do I need to
know how my device is connected you know

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:33.620
know how my device is connected you know
 

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.289
know how my device is connected you know
if you're developing for Android

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299
if you're developing for Android
 

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:38.659
if you're developing for Android
anything less than API level 16

00:27:38.659 --> 00:27:38.669
anything less than API level 16
 

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:42.169
anything less than API level 16
you're gonna care because well Android

00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179
you're gonna care because well Android
 

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:44.659
you're gonna care because well Android
treats both USB and Bluetooth devices as

00:27:44.659 --> 00:27:44.669
treats both USB and Bluetooth devices as
 

00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:48.200
treats both USB and Bluetooth devices as
just input devices when it comes to

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:48.210
just input devices when it comes to
 

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.789
just input devices when it comes to
monitoring their connections and

00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799
monitoring their connections and
 

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.110
monitoring their connections and
disconnections which is something you

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120
disconnections which is something you
 

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.580
disconnections which is something you
will have to do or anything lower than

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:52.590
will have to do or anything lower than
 

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.070
will have to do or anything lower than
API level 16 you're going to have to

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080
API level 16 you're going to have to
 

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.080
API level 16 you're going to have to
right to broadcast listeners one for the

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.090
right to broadcast listeners one for the
 

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.110
right to broadcast listeners one for the
USB one for Bluetooth that's the that's

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120
USB one for Bluetooth that's the that's
 

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.249
USB one for Bluetooth that's the that's
where the differentiation comes in

00:28:01.249 --> 00:28:01.259
where the differentiation comes in
 

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:01.879
where the differentiation comes in
gotcha

00:28:01.879 --> 00:28:01.889
gotcha
 

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:04.009
gotcha
okay so yeah if I'm if I'm planning you

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:04.019
okay so yeah if I'm if I'm planning you
 

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:06.049
okay so yeah if I'm if I'm planning you
know I've got a high-end game clearly

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059
know I've got a high-end game clearly
 

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.909
know I've got a high-end game clearly
only modern devices might work moving

00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919
only modern devices might work moving
 

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.860
only modern devices might work moving
forward maybe I don't have to care if I

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:09.870
forward maybe I don't have to care if I
 

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.749
forward maybe I don't have to care if I
want to reach the broadest range of

00:28:11.749 --> 00:28:11.759
want to reach the broadest range of
 

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:14.600
want to reach the broadest range of
customers as possible okay

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:14.610
customers as possible okay
 

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.999
customers as possible okay
now I've seen some game controllers or

00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:17.009
now I've seen some game controllers or
 

00:28:17.009 --> 00:28:18.560
now I've seen some game controllers or
gaming devices where you know the

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:18.570
gaming devices where you know the
 

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.869
gaming devices where you know the
essentially the controller is integrated

00:28:20.869 --> 00:28:20.879
essentially the controller is integrated
 

00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:24.080
essentially the controller is integrated
right into the device you know I've seen

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.090
right into the device you know I've seen
 

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.129
right into the device you know I've seen
a few of those myself

00:28:25.129 --> 00:28:25.139
a few of those myself
 

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:28.159
a few of those myself
quite amazing how does how is that

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:28.169
quite amazing how does how is that
 

00:28:28.169 --> 00:28:30.019
quite amazing how does how is that
represented and I guess do I need to

00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:30.029
represented and I guess do I need to
 

00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:31.399
represented and I guess do I need to
care about you barely they're

00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:31.409
care about you barely they're
 

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:34.279
care about you barely they're
disconnected well it'd be hard to

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:34.289
disconnected well it'd be hard to
 

00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:36.080
disconnected well it'd be hard to
disconnect a shield controller without

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.090
disconnect a shield controller without
 

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.529
disconnect a shield controller without
like breaking it you're probably right

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539
like breaking it you're probably right
 

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:41.330
like breaking it you're probably right
if we think about other ones that are

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340
if we think about other ones that are
 

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.060
if we think about other ones that are
similar form factor it all depends on

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.070
similar form factor it all depends on
 

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.580
similar form factor it all depends on
how it's connected if you're just

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:46.590
how it's connected if you're just
 

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.940
how it's connected if you're just
targeting one device I don't know how

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:49.950
targeting one device I don't know how
 

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.950
targeting one device I don't know how
likely a case that would be you're still

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960
likely a case that would be you're still
 

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.529
likely a case that would be you're still
going to have to detect the input device

00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539
going to have to detect the input device
 

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:59.960
going to have to detect the input device
as being there so that's a good question

00:28:59.960 --> 00:28:59.970
as being there so that's a good question
 

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.200
as being there so that's a good question
I'm not quite sure what the right answer

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.210
I'm not quite sure what the right answer
 

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.789
I'm not quite sure what the right answer
is there you get a you get a point for

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799
is there you get a you get a point for
 

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:06.799
is there you get a you get a point for
that one all right I would say just like

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:06.809
that one all right I would say just like
 

00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:08.600
that one all right I would say just like
treat it like you would any other device

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:08.610
treat it like you would any other device
 

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.039
treat it like you would any other device
don't assume that it's there you're

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:10.049
don't assume that it's there you're
 

00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:11.570
don't assume that it's there you're
gonna try and build your application as

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580
gonna try and build your application as
 

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.299
gonna try and build your application as
you said before for multiple devices and

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:14.309
you said before for multiple devices and
 

00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:16.580
you said before for multiple devices and
and form factors don't make assumptions

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:16.590
and form factors don't make assumptions
 

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.330
and form factors don't make assumptions
okay so that would say fair enough

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.340
okay so that would say fair enough
 

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.320
okay so that would say fair enough
moving forward you know the world's

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.330
moving forward you know the world's
 

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.480
moving forward you know the world's
going wireless do you think bluetooth is

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:23.490
going wireless do you think bluetooth is
 

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.720
going wireless do you think bluetooth is
basically going to be the standard I

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:25.730
basically going to be the standard I
 

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.840
basically going to be the standard I
absolutely think so if we just think

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:29.850
absolutely think so if we just think
 

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.999
absolutely think so if we just think
about what it means to have wires and

00:29:31.999 --> 00:29:32.009
about what it means to have wires and
 

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:33.629
about what it means to have wires and

now there are reasons to do that if you
 

00:30:59.709 --> 00:31:02.399
now there are reasons to do that if you
have deals with with a particular device

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:02.409
have deals with with a particular device
 

00:31:02.409 --> 00:31:03.810
have deals with with a particular device
but it means you're going to limit

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:03.820
but it means you're going to limit
 

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.049
but it means you're going to limit
yourself to just that device a lot of

usually have wireless controllers and
 

00:31:20.409 --> 00:31:24.479
usually have wireless controllers and
they all kind of have four buttons the

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:24.489
they all kind of have four buttons the
 

00:31:24.489 --> 00:31:26.310
they all kind of have four buttons the
the right-hand and they have an analog

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320
the right-hand and they have an analog

they usually have triggers so if you've
 

00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:34.619
they usually have triggers so if you've
ever played with you know any one of the

ever played with you know any one of the
 

00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:37.949
ever played with you know any one of the
popular consoles out there and you kind

00:31:37.949 --> 00:31:37.959
popular consoles out there and you kind
 

00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:40.109
popular consoles out there and you kind
of all like the same yeah

00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:40.119
of all like the same yeah
 

00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:43.829
of all like the same yeah
that said what those keys map to for

00:31:43.829 --> 00:31:43.839
that said what those keys map to for
 

00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:44.889
that said what those keys map to for
that device

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:44.899
that device
 

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:51.159
that device
it could be different so I would say see

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:51.169
it could be different so I would say see
 

00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:53.229
it could be different so I would say see
if you can take a controller from one

00:31:53.229 --> 00:31:53.239
if you can take a controller from one
 

00:31:53.239 --> 00:31:55.149
if you can take a controller from one
device and connect it to another one and

00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159
device and connect it to another one and
 

00:31:55.159 --> 00:31:56.950
device and connect it to another one and
see if it actually gives you what you

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960
see if it actually gives you what you
 

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.039
see if it actually gives you what you
expect back on like what the axes names

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:00.049
expect back on like what the axes names
