00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.750
In the last video, I drew this
grid in order to understand

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.180
better the different
combinations of alleles I

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.400
could get from my
mom or my dad.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.310
And this grid that I drew is
called a Punnett square.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.650
And I looked up what Punnett
means, and it turns out, and

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.050
this might be the biggest
takeaway from this video, that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.370
when you go to the farmers'
market or you go to the

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.840
produce and you see those little
baskets, you see those

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.370
little baskets that often you'll
see maybe strawberries

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.760
or blueberries sitting in, they
have this little grid

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760
here, right there.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.150
Sometimes grapes are in them,
and you have a bunch of

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.530
strawberries in them
like that.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.770
That green basket
is a punnett.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.590
That's a punnett.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500
Apparently, in some countries,
they call it a punnett.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.460
I think England's one of them,
and you UK viewers can correct

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.190
me if I'm wrong.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.640
And so I guess that's where
the inspiration comes for

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.300
calling these Punnett squares,
that these are kind of these

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.380
little green baskets that
you can throw different

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.640
combinations of genotypes in.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.140
And these Punnett squares
aren't just useful.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.780
If you're talking about crossing
two hybrids, this is

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.140
called a monohybrid cross
because you are crossing two

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.970
hybrids for only one trait.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.370
It could be useful for a whole
set of different types of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.000
crosses between two reproducing
organisms. It

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.450
doesn't even have to be a
situation where one thing is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.420
dominating another.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.310
Let's do a bunch of these,
just to make you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.600
familiar with the idea.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.730
So let's say you have a mom.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.910
So instead of doing two hybrids,
let's say the mom--

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.160
I'll keep using the blue-eyed,
brown-eyed analogy just

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.830
because we're already reasonably
useful to it.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.670
Let's say that she's homozygous
dominant.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.160
And let's say that the dad is a
heterozygote, so he's got a

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.020
brown and he's got a blue.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.370
And we want to know the
different combinations of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.400
genotypes that one of their
children might have. So what

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.392
we do is we draw a Punnett
square again.

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:13.550
Let me draw a grid here and
draw a grid right there.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.720
And up here, we'll write the
different genes that mom can

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.510
contribute, and here, we'll
write the different genes that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960
dad can contribute, or the
different alleles.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.770
I didn't want to write gene.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.160
I wanted to write dad.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.610
So the mom in either case is
either going to contribute

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.150
this big B brown allele from
one of the homologous

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.320
chromosomes, or on the other
homologous, well, they have

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.430
the same allele so she's
going to contribute

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.840
that one to her child.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.900
The dad could contribute this
one, that big brown-eyed-- the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.230
capital B allele for brown eyes
or the lowercase b for

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.970
blue eyes, either one.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.730
So the different combinations
that might happen, an

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.080
offspring could get both of
these brown alleles from one

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.210
copy from both parents.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.060
This could also happen where you
get this brown allele from

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.750
the dad and then the other brown
allele from the mom, or

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.820
you could get a brown allele
from the mom and a blue-eyed

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.080
allele from the dad, or you
could get the other brown-eyed

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.240
allele from the mom, right?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.240
When the mom has this, she has
two chromosomes, homologous

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.800
chromosomes.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.140
Each of them have the same
brown allele on them.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.010
They both have that same brown
allele, so I could get the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.410
other one from my mom and
still get this blue-eyed

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.000
allele from my dad.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.070
So if you said what's the
probability of having a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.140
blue-eyed child, assuming that
blue eyes are recessive?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.820
And remember, this
is a phenotype.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.330
These particular combinations
are genotypes.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.860
Well, in order to have blue
eyes, you have to be

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.250
homozygous recessive.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.440
You have to have two
lowercase b's.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.490
So what's the probability
of having this?

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.410
Well, there are no combinations
that result in

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.330
that, so there's a 0%
probability of having two

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.510
blue-eyed children.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.170
What's the probability
of having a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.850
homozygous dominant child?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.600
Let me write that.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.089
A homozygous dominant.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.860
And now we're looking
at the genotype.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.589
We care about the
specific alleles

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.740
that that child inherits.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.880
Well, which of these are
homozygous dominant?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.530
Well, you have this one right
here and you have that one

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.200
right there, and so two of
the four equally likely

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.770
combinations are homozygous
dominant, so

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.090
you have a 50% shot.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.440
And we can do these
Punnett squares.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.800
They don't even have to be for
situations where one trait is

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.240
necessarily dominant
on the other.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.630
For example, you could have the
situation-- it's called

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.880
incomplete dominance.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.650
Let's say you have two traits
for color in a flower.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.260
You could have red flowers or
you could have white flowers.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:23.170
And let's say I were to cross
a parent flower that has the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.130
genotype capital R-- I'll just
make it in a capital W.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.110
So that could be the mom or the
dad, although the analogy

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.800
breaks down a little bit with
parents, although there is a

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.170
male and female, although
sometimes on the same plant.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.680
And let's say the other plant
is also a red and white.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.490
The other plant has
a red allele and

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.020
also has a white allele.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.870
So what are the different
possibilities?

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.200
Well, we just draw our
Punnett square again.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.830
Let me draw our little grid.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.711
So the child could inherit both
of these red alleles.

00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:02.690
He could inherit this white
allele and then this red

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.720
allele, so this red one and then
this white one, right?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.050
That's that right there
and that red one

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.290
is that right there.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.190
Or it could inherit this red one
from-- let's say this is

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.810
the mom plant and then the
white allele from the dad

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.990
plant, so that's that
one right there.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.660
Or you could inherit
both white alleles.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.710
What I said when I went into
this, and I wrote it at the

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.570
top right here, is we're
studying a situation dealing

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.300
with incomplete dominance.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.660
So what does that mean?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.540
Well, that means you might
actually have mixing or

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.120
blending of the traits when
you actually look at them.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.800
So if this was complete
dominance, if red was dominant

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.330
to white, then you'd say, OK,
all of these guys are going to

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.770
be red and only this guy right
here is going to be white, so

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.260
you have a one in four
probability to being white.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.130
But let's say that a
heterozygous genotype-- so let

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.530
me write that down.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.360
Let's say when you have one R
allele and one white allele,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.150
that this doesn't
result in red.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.400
This results in pink.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.860
So this is what blending is.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.320
It's kind of a mixture
of the two.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.650
So if I said if these these two
plants were to reproduce,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.060
and the traits for red and white
petals, I guess we could

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.170
say, are incomplete dominant,
or incompletely dominant, or

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.840
they blend, and if I were to say
what's the probability of

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.650
having a pink plant?

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.580
And now when I'm talking
about pink, this, of

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.140
course, is a phenotype.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.490
So the probability of pink,
well, let's look at the

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.940
different combinations.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.550
How many of these are pink?

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.750
This one is pink and
this is pink.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.580
So two are pink of a total
of four equally likely

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:59.120
combinations, so it's a 50%
chance that we're pink.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.970
And we could keep doing this
over multiple generations, and

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.170
say, oh, what happens in the
second and third and the

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.830
fourth generation?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.830
Actually, we could even have
a situation where we have

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.180
multiple different alleles, and
I'll use almost a kind of

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.690
a more realistic example.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.690
I'll use blood types
as an example.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.526
So there's three potential
alleles for blood type.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.880
You can have a blood type A, you
could have a blood type B,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.655
or you could have
a blood type O.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.230
What happens is you have a
combination here between

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.840
codominance and recessive
genes.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.440
And I'm going to show you what
I talk about when we do the

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.260
Punnett squares.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.230
Maybe I'll stick to one color
here because I think you're

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.530
getting the idea.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.430
So let's say I have a
parent who is AB.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.820
So that means that they have
on one of their homologous

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.980
chromosomes, they have the A
allele, and on the other one,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.160
they have the B allele.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.720
That's what AB means.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.240
So the phenotype is
the genotype.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.270
They're codominant.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.230
They both express themselves.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.370
They don't necessarily blend.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.300
They both express.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.570
That's an AB blood type.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.390
Let me write this right here.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.740
This is AB blood type.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:23.200
And then the other parent is--
let's say that they are fully

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.420
an A blood type.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.050
Let's say they're
an A blood type.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.970
Let's say their phenotype is an
A blood type-- I hope I'm

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.190
not confusing you-- but their
genotype is that they have one

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.350
allele that's an A and their
other allele that's an O.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.200
So this is what's interesting
about blood types.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.220
It's a mixture.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.710
O is recessive.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.050
O is recessive, while these
guys are codominant.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.650
So if you have either of
these guys with an

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.510
O, these guys dominate.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.140
If you have them together, then
your blood type is AB.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.180
So what are all the different
combinations for these for

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.580
this couple here?

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.570
Well, you could get this A and
that A, so you get an A from

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.990
your mom and you get an A from
your dad right there.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.020
And clearly in this case, your
phenotype, you will have an A

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.000
blood type in this situation.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.960
You could get the A from your
dad and you could get the B

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.580
from your mom, in which case
you have an AB blood type.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.030
You could get the A from your
mom and the O from your dad,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.360
in which case you have an A
blood type because this

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.930
dominates that.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.770
Or you could get the B from
your-- I dont want to

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.080
introduce arbitrary colors.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.300
You could get the B from your
mom, that's this one, or the O

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.490
from your dad.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.490
No, once again, I introduced
a different color.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.920
And this is a B blood type.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:02.650
So if I said what's the
probability of having an AA

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.980
blood type?

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.460
And once again, we're talking
about a phenotype here.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.220
So which of these are
an A blood type?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.800
This one definitely is,
because it's AA.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.640
If you have two A alleles,
you'll definitely have an A

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.750
blood type, but you also have
an A blood type phenotype if

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.020
you have an A and then an O.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.430
O is recessive.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.690
So this is also going to
be an A blood type.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:36.010
So these are both A blood, so
there's a 50% chance, because

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.880
two of the four combinations
show us an A blood type.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.570
And you could do all of the
different combinations.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.950
You say, well, how do you
have an O blood type?

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.450
Well, both of your parents
will have to carry

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.520
at least one O.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.300
So, for example, to have a--
that would've been possible if

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.090
maybe instead of an AB, this
right here was an O, then this

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.380
combination would've been
two O's right there.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.660
So hopefully, that gives you
an idea of how a Punnett

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.960
square can be useful, and it can
even be useful when we're

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.110
talking about more
than one trait.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.970
So let's go to our situation
that I talked about before

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:18.040
where I said you have little b
is equal to blue eyes, and

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.790
we're assuming that that's
recessive, and you have big B

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.530
is equal to brown eyes,
and we're assuming

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.780
that this is dominant.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.346
And let's say we have
another trait.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.750
I introduced that tooth
trait before.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.780
So let's say little t is
equal to small teeth.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.290
I don't know what type of
bizarre organism I'm talking

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.310
about, although I think
I would fall into

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.830
the big tooth camp.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.330
Let's say big T is equal
to big teeth.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.330
So an individual can have--
for example, I might be

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.050
heterozygous brown eyes, so my
genotype might be heterozygous

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.740
for brown eyes and then
homozygous dominant for teeth.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.500
So this might be my genotype.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.680
And the phenotype for this one
would be a big-toothed,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.810
brown-eyed person, right?

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.820
Let me make that clear.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.160
This is big tooth phenotype.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.120
And this is the phenotype.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.760
What you see is brown eyes.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.690
A big-toothed, brown-eyed
person.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.790
Now if we assume that the genes
that code for teeth or

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.630
eye color are on different
chromosomes, and this is a key

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.160
assumption, we can say that
they assort independently.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.915
Let me write that down:
independent assortment.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.310
So this is a case where if I
were look at my chromosomes,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.230
let's say this is one homologous
pair, maybe we call

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.060
that homologous pair 1, and
let's say I have another

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.270
homologous pair, and obviously
we have 23 of these, but let's

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:23.840
say this is homologous pair 2
right here, if the eye color

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.270
gene is here and here, remember
both homologous

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.360
chromosomes code for
the same genes.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.060
They might have different
versions.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.160
Those are alleles.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:41.720
And if teeth are over here,
they will assort

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.520
independently.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.910
So after meiosis occurs to
produce the gametes, the

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.370
offspring might get this
chromosome or a copy of that

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.170
chromosome for eye color and
might get a copy of this

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.060
chromosome for teeth
size or tooth size.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.410
Or it could go the other way.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.220
Maybe another offspring gets
this one, this chromosome for

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.590
eye color, and then this
chromosome for teeth color and

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.570
gets the other version
of the allele.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.680
So because they're on different
chromosomes, there's

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.890
no linkage between if you
inherit this one, whether you

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.990
inherit big teeth, whether
you're going to inherit small

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.850
brown eyes or blue eyes.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.120
Now, if they were on the same
chromosomee-- let's say the

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.410
situation where they are
on the same chromosome.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.350
So let me pick another
trait: hair color.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.180
Let's say the gene for hair
color is on chromosome 1, so

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.250
let's say hair color, the
gene is there and there.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.060
These might be different
versions of hair color,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.950
different alleles, but the
genes are on that same

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.860
chromosome.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.520
In this situation, if someone
gets-- let's say if this is

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.200
blue eyes here and this is blond
hair, then these are

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.910
going always travel together.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.370
You're not going to have these
assort independently.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.010
And these are called
linked traits.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.560
Let me highlight that.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.730
So these right there, those
are linked traits.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.180
But for a second, and we'll talk
more about linked traits,

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.140
and especially sex-linked traits
in probably the next

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.520
video or a few videos from now,
but let's assume that

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.000
we're talking about traits that
assort independently, and

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.150
we cross two hybrids.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.350
So this is called a
dihybrid cross.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.600
Very fancy word, but it just
gives you an idea of the power

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.170
of the Punnett square.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:35.490
So let's say both parents are--
so they're both hybrids,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:41.730
which means that they both have
the dominant brown-eye

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.410
allele and they have the
recessive blue-eye allele, and

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:51.360
they both have the dominant
big-tooth gene and they both

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.570
have the recessive little
tooth gene.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.300
So this is the genotype
for both parents.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.440
Both parents are dihybrid.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.980
They're hybrids for both
genes, both parents.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.980
What are all the different

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.920
combinations for their children?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.300
And I could have done this
without dihybrids.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.490
I could have made one of them
homozygous for one of the

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.000
traits and a hybrid for the
other, and I could have done

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.200
every different combination,
but I'll do the dihybrid,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.780
because it leads to a lot of our
variety, and you'll often

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.630
see this in classes.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:29.160
So if I'm talking about the mom,
what are the different

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.930
combinations of genes that
the mom can contribute?

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.770
Well, the mom could contribute
the brown-- so for each of

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:41.390
these traits, she can only
contribute one of the alleles.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.660
So she could contribute this
brown right here and then the

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.670
big yellow T, so this is one
combination, or she could

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:59.140
contribute the big brown and
then the little yellow t, or

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.670
she can contribute
the blue-eyed

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.160
allele and the big T.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.040
So these are all the different
combinations that she could

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.000
contribute.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.210
And then the final combination
is this allele and that

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:16.370
allele, so the blue eyes
and the small teeth.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.180
So that's from mom.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.050
And, of course, dad could
contribute the same different

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.900
combinations because dad
has the same genotype.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.060
Let me write that down.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.250
Let me just write it like this
so I don't have to keep

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.130
switching colors.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.850
Actually, I want to make them
a little closer together

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.490
because I'm going to run
out of space otherwise.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.870
Nope.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.400
Let me do it like that.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.320
OK, brown eyes, so the dad could
contribute the big teeth

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.190
or the little teeth, z along
with the brown-eyed gene, or

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.510
he could contribute the
blue-eyed gene, the blue-eyed

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.710
allele in combination with the
big teeth or the yellow teeth.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.940
Not the yellow teeth,
the little teeth.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.940
That would be a different gene
for yellow teeth or maybe

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.600
that's an environmental
factor.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.270
So these are all the different
combinations that can occur

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.530
for their offspring.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.790
So let's draw-- call this maybe
a super Punnett square,

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.250
because we're now dealing
with, instead of four

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:20.030
combinations, we have
16 combinations.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:24.160
It looks like I ran out
of ink right there.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.230
It's strange why--
16 combinations.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.080
Let me write that out.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.860
Something's wrong
with my tablet.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.790
Maybe there's something weird.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.350
OK, so there's 16 different
combinations, and let's write

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.870
them all out, and I'll just
stay in one maybe neutral

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.490
color so I don't have
to keep switching.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:47.500
I could get this combination,
so this brown eyes from my

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.410
mom, brown eyes from my dad
allele, so its brown-brown,

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.510
and then big teeth from both.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.870
I could have this combination,
so I have capital B

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.830
and a capital B.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.580
And then I have a capital
T and a lowercase t.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.000
And then let's just keep
moving forward.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.630
So I could get a capital B and a
lowercase B with a capital T

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:16.070
and a capital T, a big B,
lowercase B, capital T

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.350
lowercase t.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.780
And I'm just going to go through
these super-fast

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.920
because it's going to take
forever, so capital B from

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.130
here, capital B from there;
capital T, lowercase t from

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:32.150
here; capital B from each and
then lowercase t from each.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.220
You have a capital B and then
a lowercase b from that one,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.760
and then a capital T from the
mom, lowercase t from the dad.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.070
Hopefully, you're not getting
too tired here.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.730
And so then you have the capital
B from your dad and

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.060
then lowercase b
from your mom.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.980
Two lowercase t's-- actually
let me just pause and fill

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.320
these in because I don't want
to waste your time.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.400
There I have saved you some time
and I've filled in every

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.750
combination similar to what
happens on many cooking shows.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.290
But now that I've filled
in all the different

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.850
combinations, we can talk a
little bit about the different

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.000
phenotypes that might
be expressed from

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.860
this dihybrid cross.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.990
For example, how many of these
are going to exhibit brown

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.620
eyes and big teeth?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.780
So big teeth, brown-eyed kids.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.110
Let me write this down here.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:27.190
So if I want big teeth
and brown eyes.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.480
All of a sudden, my pen
doesn't-- brown eyes.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.500
So how many are there?

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.880
Big teeth and brown eyes.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.450
So they're both dominant, so if
you have either a capital B

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.490
or a capital T in any of them,
you're going to have big teeth

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.410
and brown eyes, so this is
big teeth and brown eyes.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.820
Big teeth right here,
brown eyes there.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.700
Or maybe I should just say
brown eyes and big teeth

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.250
because that's the order that
I wrote it right here.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.780
Brown eyes and big teeth, brown
eyes and big teeth.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.370
Even though I have a recessive
trait here,

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.620
the brown eyes dominate.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.350
I had a small teeth here, but
the big teeth dominate.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.820
This is brown eyes
and big teeth.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.200
This is brown eyes
and big teeth.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.700
Let's see, this is brown eyes
and big teeth, brown eyes and

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.660
big teeth, and let me see,
is that all of them?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.360
Well, no.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.180
This is brown eyes
and little teeth.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.850
This is brown eyes and big teeth
right there, and this is

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.160
also brown eyes and big teeth.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.450
They're heterozygous for each
trait, but both brown eyes and

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.720
big teeth are dominant, so these
are all phenotypes of

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.890
brown eyes and big teeth.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.160
So how many of those
do we have?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.740
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.430
eight, nine of those.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.030
So we have nine.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.840
Nine brown eyes and big teeth.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.810
Now, how many do we
have of big teeth?

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.350
Let me write in a different
color, so let me write brown

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.880
eyes and little teeth.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.350
Something on my pen tablet
doesn't work

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.560
quite right over there.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.970
So brown eyes and
little teeth.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.500
So let's see, this
is brown eyes and

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.100
little teeth right there.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.270
This is brown eyes and little
teeth right there.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.280
This is brown eyes and little
teeth right there.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.070
So there's three combinations
of brown

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.010
eyes and little teeth.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:31.810
And if I were to say blue eyes,
blue and big teeth, what

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.900
are the combinations there?

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.750
Well, this is blue eyes and big
teeth, blue eyes and big

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.650
teeth, blue eyes and big
teeth, so there's three

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.110
combinations there.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:45.210
And if I want to be recessive on
both traits, so if I want--

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.480
let me do this.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.490
I want blue eyes, blue
and little teeth.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.090
There's only one.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.250
Out of the 16, there's only one
situation where I inherit

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.490
the recessive trait from both
parents for both traits.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.310
So if you look at this, and
you say, hey, what's the

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.920
probability-- there's only
one of that-- what's the

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.590
probability of having a big
teeth, brown-eyed child?

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.240
And these are all
the phenotypes.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.240
There were 16 different
possibilities here, right?

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.640
There are 16 squares here, and
9 of them describe the

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.860
phenotype of big teeth
and brown eyes, so

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.420
there's a 9/16 chance.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.090
So it's 9 out of 16 chance
of having a big

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.830
teeth, brown-eyed child.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.090
What's the probability
of a blue-eyed

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.700
child with little teeth?

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.080
1 in 16.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.010
So hopefully, in this video,
you've appreciated the power

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.530
of the Punnett square, that it's
a useful way to explore

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.340
every different combination of
all the genes, and it doesn't

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.560
have to be only one trait.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.440
It can be in this case where
you're doing two traits that

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.300
show dominance, but they assort
independently because

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.840
they're on different
chromosomes.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.560
You could use it-- where'd
I do it over here?

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.260
You could use it to explore
incomplete dominance when

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.870
there's blending, where red and
white made pink genes, or

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.820
you can even use it when there's
codominance and when

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.110
you have multiple alleles,
where it's not just two

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.640
different versions of the genes,
there's actually three

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.730
different versions.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.120
So hopefully, you've
enjoyed that.
