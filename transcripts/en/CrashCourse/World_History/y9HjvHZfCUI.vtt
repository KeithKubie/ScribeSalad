Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re gonna talk

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.709
about the Cold War, which actually lasted
into my lifetime, which means that I can bore

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.009
you with stories from my past like your grandpa
does. When I was a kid, they made us practice

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.849
hiding under our desks in the event of a nuclear
attack, because, you know, school desks are

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.420
super good at repelling radiation.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.000
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Right, remember in elementary
school there was this special guest who’d

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.840
defected from the Soviet Union, and he had--

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.950
Like this crazy Russian accent and he kept
going on and on about how Reagan should spit

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.470
in Gorbachev’s face instead of signing treaties
with him.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.960
And I was like, whoa dude calm down. You’re
in a room full of third graders.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.630
And then for like months afterward on the
playground, we’d play Reagan-Gorbachev and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.170
spit in each other’s faces. Those were the days.
Sometimes I forget that you’re me, Me from the Past.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.850
Yeah, it’s just really nice to talk to you
and feel like you’re lis --

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250
You’re boring. Cue the intro.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.930
[theme music]

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.360
So the Cold War was a rivalry between the
USSR and the USA that played out globally.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.690
We’ve tried to shy away from calling conflicts
ideological or civilizational here on Crash

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.350
Course, but in this case, the “clash of
civilizations” model really does apply.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.560
Socialism, at least as Marx constructed it,
wanted to take over the world, and many Soviets

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.330
saw themselves in a conflict with bourgeois
capitalism itself. And the Soviets saw American

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.450
rebuilding efforts in Europe and Japan as
the U.S. trying to expand its markets, which,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.220
by the way, is exactly what we were doing.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
So the U.S. feared that the USSR wanted to
destroy democratic and capitalist institutions.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.010
And the Soviets feared that the US wanted
to use its money and power to dominate Europe

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.330
and eventually destroy the Soviet system.
And both parties were right to be worried.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.390
It’s not paranoia if they really are out
to get you.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.880
Now of course we’ve seen a lot of geopolitical
struggles between major world powers here

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.110
on Crash Course, but this time there was the
special added bonus that war could lead to

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.710
the destruction of the human species. That
was new for world history, and it’s worth

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.780
remembering: It’s still new. Here’s the
period of time we’ve discussed on Crash

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.180
Course. And this is how long we’ve had the
technological capability to exterminate ourselves.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.520
So that’s worrisome.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
Immediately after World War II, the Soviets
created a sphere of influence in eastern Europe,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.640
dominating the countries where the Red Army
had pushed back the Nazis, which is why Winston

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.790
Churchill famously said in 1946 that an “Iron
Curtain” had descended across Europe.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.989
While the dates of the Cold War are usually
given between 1945 and 1990, a number of historians

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.400
will tell you that it actually started during
World War II. Stalin’s distrust of the U.S.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.480
and Britain kept growing as they refused to
invade Europe and open up a second front against

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.540
the Nazis. And some even say that the decision
to drop the first Atomic Bombs on Japan was

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.290
motivated in part by a desire to intimidate
the Soviets. That sort of worked, but only

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.609
insofar as it motivated the Soviets to develop
atomic bombs of their own — they successfully

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.869
tested their first one in 1949.

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.700
From the beginning, the U.S had the advantage
because it had more money and power and could

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.829
provide Europe protection (what with its army
and one of a kind nuclear arsenal) while Europe

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.829
rebuilt. The USSR had to rebuild itself, and
also they had the significant disadvantage

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.359
of being controlled by noted asshat Joseph
Stalin. I will remind you, it’s not cursing

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.379
if he’s wearing an ass for a hat. Oh, I
guess it’s time for the open letter.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.200
An Open Letter to Joseph Stalin.

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.639
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:15.040
Oh, it’s silly putty. Silly putty: the thing
that won the Cold War. This is exactly the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.510
kind of useless consumer good that would never
have been produced in the Soviet Union. And

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.379
it is because we had so much more consumer
spending, on stuff like silly putty, that

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.569
we won the Cold War. Go team!

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.870
Dear Joseph Stalin, You really sucked. There
was a great moment in your life, at your first

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.139
wife’s funeral, when you said, “I don’t
think I shall ever love again.” And then

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.129
later, you had that wife’s whole family
killed. Putting aside the fact that you’re

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.879
responsible for tens of millions of deaths,
I don’t like you because of the way that

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.439
you treated your son, Yakov. I mean, you were
really mean to him and then he shot himself

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.419
and he didn’t die and you said, “He can’t
even shoot straight.” And then later, when

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.239
he was captured during World War II, you had
a chance to exchange prisoners for him, but

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.059
you declined. And then he died in a prison
camp. You were a terrible leader, a terrible

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.360
person, and a terrible father.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.840
Best wishes,
John Green

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.980
All right, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
Europe was the first battleground of the Cold

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.499
War, especially Germany, which was divided
into 2 parts with the former capital, Berlin,

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.979
also divided into 2 parts. And yes, I know
the western part was divided into smaller

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.750
occupation zones, but I’m simplifying. In
1948, the Soviets tried to cut off West Berlin,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.990
by closing the main road that led into the
city, but the Berlin airlift stopped them.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.910
And then in 1961, the Soviets tried again
and this time they were much more successful

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.440
building a wall around West Berlin, although
it’s worth noting that the thing was up

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.660
for less than 30 years. I mean, Meatloaf’s
career has lasted longer than the Berlin Wall did.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.100
The U.S. response to the Soviets was a policy
called containment; it basically involved

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.350
stopping the spread of communism by standing
up to the Soviets wherever they seemed to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.320
want to expand. In Europe this meant spending
a lot of money. First the Marshall Plan spent

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.560
$13 billion on re-building western Europe with
grants and credits that Europeans would spend

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.840
on American consumer goods and on construction.
Capitalism’s cheap food and plentiful stuff,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.350
it was hoped, would stop the spread of communism.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.910
The US also tried to slow the spread of communism
by founding NATO and with CIA interventions

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.370
in elections where communists had a chance,
as in Italy. But despite all the great spy

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.270
novels and shaken not stirred martinis, the
Cold War never did heat up in Europe.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.400
Probably the most important part of the Cold
War that people just don’t remember these

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.910
days is the nuclear arms race. Both sides
developed nuclear arsenals, the Soviets initially

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.870
with the help of spies who stole American
secrets. Eventually the nuclear arsenals were

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.080
so big that the U.S. and USSR agreed on a
strategy appropriately called MAD, which stood

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.960
for “mutually assured destruction.” Thanks
Thought Bubble.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.900
And yes, nuclear weapons were, and are, capable
of destroying humanity many times over. But

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.590
only once or twice did we get close to nuclear
war: during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.410
and then again in 1983, when we forgot to
give the Russians the heads up that we were

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.040
doing some war games, which made it look like
we had launched a first strike. OUR BAD!

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.650
But even though mutually assured destruction
prevented direct conflict, there was plenty

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.120
of hot war in the Cold War. The Korean War
saw lots of fighting between communists and

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.780
capitalists, as did the Vietnam War. I mean,
these days we remember “the domino effect”

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.890
as silly paranoia, but after Korea and especially
China became communist, Vietnam’s movement

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.240
toward communism seemed very much a threat
to Japan, which the U.S. had helped re-make

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.470
into a vibrant capitalist ally. So the US
got bogged down in one of its longest wars

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.510
while the Soviets assisted the North Vietnamese
army in the Viet Cong.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.150
But then we paid them back by supporting the
anti-communist mujaheddin after the Soviets

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.010
invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Of course, as
we now know, nobody conquers Afghanistan

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.320
…unless you are the mongols.
[Mongoltage]

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.920
So after 10 disastrous years, the Soviets
finally abandoned Afghanistan.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.710
Some of those mujahideen later became members
of the Taliban, though, so it’s difficult

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.150
to say that anyone won that war.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.380
But it wasn’t just Asia: In Nicaragua, the
US supported rebels to overthrow the leftist

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.360
government; in El Salvador, the US bolstered
authoritarian regimes that were threatened

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.740
by left-wing guerrillas. The United States
ended up supporting a lot of awful governments,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.560
like the one in Guatemala, which held onto
power through the use of death squads. Frankly,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.080
all our attempts to stabilize governments
in Latin America led to some very unstable

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.030
Latin American governments, and quite a lot
of violence.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.780
And then there were the luke-warm conflicts,
like The Suez Crisis where British and French

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.240
paratroopers were sent in to try to stop Egypt
from nationalizing the Suez canal. Or all

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.620
the American covert operations to keep various
countries from “falling” to communism.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.420
These included the famous CIA-engineered coup
to overthrow Iran’s democratically elected

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.100
prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh after his
government attempted to nationalize Iran’s

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.240
oil industry. And the CIA helping Chile’s
General Augusto Pinochet overthrow democratically

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.500
elected Marxist president Salvador Allende
in 1973.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.180
And lest we think the Americans were the only
bad guys in this, the Soviets used force to

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.600
crush popular uprisings in Hungary in 1956
and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.270
So, you may have noticed that our discussion
of the Cold War has branched out from Europe

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.139
to include Asia, and the Middle East, and
Latin America. And in fact, almost every part

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.960
of the globe was involved in some way with
the planet being divided into three “worlds.”

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.550
The first world was the U.S., Western Europe
and any place that embraced capitalism and

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.330
a more or less democratic form of government.
The Second World was the Soviet Union and

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.990
its satellites, mostly the Warsaw Pact nations,
China and Cuba. The Third World was everyone

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.300
else and we don’t use this term anymore because it
lumps together a hugely diverse range of countries.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.320
We’ll talk more about the specific economic
and development challenges faced by the so-called

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.460
“Third World countries,” but the big one
in terms of the Cold War, was that neither

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.510
the U.S. nor the Soviets wanted any of these
countries to remain neutral. Every nation

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.260
was supposed to pick sides, either capitalist
or communist, and while it seems like an easy

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.329
choice now, in the 50s and 60s, it wasn’t
nearly so clear. I mean, for a little while,

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:36.579
it seemed like the Soviets might come out
ahead, at least in the Third World. For a

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:40.089
while, capitalism, and especially the United
States, seemed to lose some of its luster.

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:44.319
The US propped up dictatorships, had a poor
civil rights record, we sucked at women’s

00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:49.220
gymnastics. Plus, the Soviets were the first
to put a satellite, a man, and a dog into

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.329
space. Plus, Marxists just seemed cooler,
which is why you never see Milton Friedman

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:57.649
t-shirts… until now available at DFTBA.com.
I like that, Stan, but I’m more of a centrist.

00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:02.009
Can I get a Keynes shirt? Yes. That, now that’s
hot.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:07.049
But Soviet socialism did not finally prove
to be a viable alternative to industrial capitalism.

00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:11.000
Over time, state-run economies just generally
don’t fare as well as private enterprise,

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:15.670
and people like living in a world where they
can have more stuff. More importantly, Soviet

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:20.600
policies were just bad: collectivized agriculture
stymied production and led to famine; suppression of

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.000
dissent and traditional cultures made people angry; and
no one likes suffering the humiliation of driving a Yugo.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.560
But why the Cold War ended when it did is
one of the most interesting questions of the

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.629
20th century. It probably wasn’t Ronald
Reagan bankrupting the Soviets, despite what

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:37.930
some politicians believe. The USSR had more
satellite states that it needed to spend more

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.759
to prop up than the U.S. had to invest in
its Allies. And the Soviet system could never

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:45.720
keep up with economic growth in the West.
But, probably the individual most responsible

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:52.009
for the end of the Cold War was Mikhail Baryshnikov.
No? Mikhail Gorbachev? Well, that’s boring.

00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:57.360
I always thought the Soviets danced their
way to freedom. No? It was Glasnost and Perestroika?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.200
Alright.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.400
But Gorbachev’s Perestroika and Glasnost
opened up the Soviet political and economic

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.459
systems with contested local elections, less
restricted civil society groups, less censorship,

00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:12.119
more autonomy for the Soviet Republics, more
non-state-run businesses and more autonomy

00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:16.319
for state-run farms. Glasnost or “openness”
led to more information from the west and less

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.760
censorship led to a flood of criticism as people realized
how much poorer the second world was than the first.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.380
And one by one, often quite suddenly, former
communist states collapsed. In Germany, the

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:32.920
Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and East and
West Germany were reunited in 1990. In Poland,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.180
the Gdansk dockworker’s union Solidarity
turned into a mass political movement and

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.069
won 99 of the 100 seats it was allowed to
contest in the 1989 election. Hungary held

00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:47.209
multiparty elections in 1990. The same year,
mass demonstrations led to elections in Czechoslovakia.

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:52.180
In 1993, that country split up into Slovakia
and the Czech Republic, the happiest and most

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.019
mutually beneficial divorce since Cher left

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:59.149
Of course sometimes the transition away from
communism was violent and painful. In Romania,

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:03.069
for instance, the communist dictator Ceaușescu
held onto power until he was tried and put

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:08.110
before a firing squad at the end of 1989.
And it took until 1996 for a non-communist

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:13.610
government to take power there. And in Yugoslavia,
well, not so great. And in Russia, it’s

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.580
a little bit Putin-ey. Ah! Putin.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.379
But just twenty years later, it’s hard to
believe that the world was once dominated

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.949
by two super powers held in check mutually
assured destruction. What’s really amazing

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:29.180
to me, though, is that until the late 1980s,
it felt like the Cold War was gonna go on

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.889
forever. Time seems to slow as it approaches
us, &amp; living in the post-Cold War nuclear

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:38.470
age, we should remember that the past feels
distant even when it’s near, and that the

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.710
future seems assured — even though it isn’t.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.670
of the week was "Justin Bieber" Thanks for
that suggestion. If you’d like to suggest

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.800
future phrases of the week, you can do so
in comments where you can also ask questions

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.960
about today’s video that will be answered
by our team of historians. Thanks for watching

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.200
