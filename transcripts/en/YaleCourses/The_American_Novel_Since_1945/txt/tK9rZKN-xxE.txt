Speaker 1:          00:01          Today, uh, is novel Pitch Day. Uh, does everyone have a ballot? If you don't have a ballot there, some down here we have a wonderful list of six novels all brought to you by students from this class. I'll tell you, my dream is that one day someone will pitch their own novel. That's my dream. And I yell, this could happen. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Thank you. [inaudible] okay, we ready? Yup. Ballot [inaudible] without [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:50          further ado, if everybody is ready, everybody ready? Now, each of these students has been given five minutes only to make their presentation. And uh, at the end of it, you will rank your top three choices. One for your first choice, two for your second choice. Three, the tfs will take your ballots, they will leave the room. I will begin to lecture on housekeeping. And when they've added it all up, which should go pretty fast because there are nine of them and they, they're very good at adding. Um, you have to know that to get into the PHD programs here, uh, there's a little arithmetic test. Um, they will add it all up and then I will announce at the end of end of the class which book it will be. So, uh, without further ado, Emma bearish will come and talk.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Trust [inaudible] to use this training.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Yes, you can. Oh yes. Use this microphone please. So that the camera can hear you. Okay. Hi Camera.

Speaker 3:          02:02          Uh, well thank you professor. Hunger for diamond a bearish and I'm pitching Giovanni's room by James Baldwin. Uh, so what is Baldwin like? Well, Baldwin is one of the Great 20th Century American Authors and he has some really unique insights into human interaction and a shrewd sensitivity and to the internal lives of his characters. Um, his background kind of shines through his prose. He's the son of a preacher, so his words have this like really strong sort of grandness to them. And there's a really, really a unique resonance to everything he writes. Anyway, show Baldwin in my opinion, isn't read as often as she as often, excuse me, as he should and academic settings. So whew. So I chose this book because I wanted to use this opportunity to read Baldwin at Yale. And nifty little fact about Giovanni's room. It's about 150 pages and yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:00          Yeah. And it's eminently readable. So that's a, that's a big plus at the end of the semester. But also I didn't just choose Giovanni's room because it's short. I chose it because it fits seamlessly with our syllabus. So what's Giovanni's room about? Well, Giovanni's room is the story of David a 20 something man who flees America to Paris in hopes of finding himself. Milan, Paris, David Fine's, a fiance, hello. And in her absence, another lover, Giovanni on man. So the novel spirals around David's reverie on one particular evening, the evening of Giovanni's execution. I don't want to ruin anymore of the book, so I'll let you wonder what offense Giovanni has committed. Now Giovanni's room fits with the notion of the identity plot, which professor Hungerford was discussing a lot last week. But here the identity problem is founded in sexuality. A fascinating issue, which the literature we've studied so far has yet to, to explore.

Speaker 3:          04:00          Uh, so Giovanni's room complicates the identity plot further, but you have on these were Giovanni's room also explores national identity. It is an American novel of x patriotism, an American in Paris. Um, so without further ado, I want to read a passage in which David realizes his alienation from America and from Americanists. So here he is walking into the American post office in Paris to pick up his mail, yet walking into the American Express office when harshly bright mid summer afternoon, I was forced to admit that this active so disquietingly cheerful hordes struck the eye at once as a unit at home, I could have distinguished patterns, habits, accents of speech with no effort, whatever. Now everybody sounded, unless I listened hard as though he had just arrived from Nebraska at home, I could have seen the clothes they were wearing. But here I only saw bags, camera's belts, and hats all clearly from the same department store at home.

Speaker 3:          05:00          I would've had some sense of the individual womanhood. If the woman I faced here, the most ferociously accomplished, seem to be involved in some ice cold or Sun dried travesty of sex. And even grandmothers seemed to have had no traffic with the flesh. And what distinguished the men was that they seemed incapable of age. They smelled of soap, which seemed indeed to be their preservative against the dangers and exigencies of any more intimate odor. The boy, he had been shown somehow unsoiled untouched, unchanged through the eyes of the man of 60 booking passage with his smiling wife to Rome. His wife might've been his mother forcing more ointment, oatmeal down his throat and ruin might've been the movie she had promised to allow him to see. Yet I also suspected that what I was seeing was, but a part of the truth and perhaps not even the most important part beneath these faces, these clothes accents, rudeness is was power and sorrow both admitted on realize the power of inventors, the sorrow of the disconnected. Okay. All right. Here you see that miserable sense of separation, that confusion, that hopelessness, that Baldwin crafts, that loss of identity, and perhaps you can begin to see the beauty and the might of his language, which molds such a powerful story of love, of loss and most importantly of self. Okay, thank you.

Speaker 2:          06:27          [inaudible] Kelsey, where are you? Are you ready for that? Just a second. Hello, I'm Kelsey.

Speaker 4:          06:45          See and the book that I'm pitching is one flew over the cuckoo's nest by Ken Keasy. Um, it is about an a set in an insane asylum and the narrator is a six foot seven schizophrenia deaf mute Indian chief named chief Brondon, whose life is turned upside down by a brutal and hedonistic man named Randall McMurphy. And, um, Ken Qc, who I need to talk about a little bit, well, it's sort of a rock star. He was to the hippie generation. What Jack Kerouac was to the beat generation. He was the, as most pro outmost outspoken proponent of LSD. Um, he and his merry pranksters went on the road and their magic bus, um, touting it across the nation. Um, one road trip that he took in 1964 with Neal Cassady the same Neal Cassady who dean Moriarty was crafted after, um, was, um, written down in a book by Tom Wolf called the electric koolaid acid trip. So he has that sort of in common with Jack Kerouac. And, um, I'd like to play a little clip that I have from a BBC interview with Casey about Lsd effects on his writing.

Speaker 2:          07:48          Hmm.

Speaker 4:          07:50          Oh, just some background in front of just some background information. While he was writing one flew over the cuckoo's nest. He was working in a mental institution.

Speaker 2:          07:57          He should were your answers at the hospital inspiring to write a novel? One flew over the cuckoo's nest. He claims the drugs and it's just creativity. I would've have not been able to write that well without LSD. [inaudible] because right from rise to fame, how did they ask every time shortcut? Should I lighten [inaudible] for those of us who were like to go on the better realities and prescribed, let's say, okay, the door's been open this to the open. It okay

Speaker 4:          08:46          for that cheesy opens the door that Qsi opens in one flew over the cuckoo's nest reveals the inner workings of an insane asylum. Um, this of course draws attention to the one most obvious and also most complicating theme of the book. That of madness. Um, we've touched on the theme of madness before with Lolita and with, um, Franny and Zooey, but I don't think we've addressed it as explicitly as we would with this book. I'm, the book is set in an insane asylum. There is no way to avoid insanity. Um, at first glance, that might seem like a very straight forward assertion. However, the very sense of omnipresent madness and the book is the one that I think ropes this book very neatly into the argument of Professor Hungerford Syllabus. Um, I think it's an intensification of most of the things we studied so far. For example, the identity plot.

Speaker 4:          09:28          I think it's a very unique manifestation of the identity plot because the people in the insane asylum are perhaps one of the most isolated groups that you could possibly be, be a part of their isolated by their own neuroses, the tyranny of the nurses and, and barricade of concrete plexiglass and barbed wire. Um, I think if you imagine any attempt to find yourself within the confines of a sanatorium, you can sort of see how interesting a story would be crafted on that. Um, another theme that we've talked about is the relationship between language and experience. We talked about that with John Barth and I think that's really important question to focus on when you're reading a book like this because you have to think to yourself as you're reading, how does an author accurately capture the experience of insanity? And more importantly, how can we as readers trust a narrator that self diagnosed as insane?

Speaker 4:          10:13          Um, and in that same vein, what is truth and how does one portrayed truth? I like to read a passage from the book. This is at the very beginning when we're first introduced to the chief and he decides that he is going to begin telling about all this about the hospital and her and the guys and about being Murphy. I've been silent so long now it's going to roar out of me like flood waters. And you think the guy telling this is ranting and raving, my God, you think this is too horrible to have really happened? This is too awful to be the truth, but please, it's still hard for me to have a clear mind thinking on it. But it's the truth, even if it didn't happen. So I think you can see to the confusion that can arise from having an insane narrator.

Speaker 4:          10:53          Um, one of the most enticing aspects of this book is that it is funny, they're extremely hilarious aspects of this book. I don't know if any of you who've seen the movie or at least that famous clip of Jack Nicholson laughing like a maniac. Um, the movie in general doesn't do the book justice at all whatsoever, of course. But, um, I think that one moment is quintessentially kit keasy and he used it. Humor, humor is his most powerful tool in conveying his deepest, serious messages in this book. Um, one thing that I want to point out is there's this really fascinating thing that happens over the course of this book, and it's this, there's an x that frames the plot and that x one arm is the chief's ascension from insanity. And the other arm is remaking McMurphy's descension into insanity. I think if we choose this book, one of the most challenging aspects of our analysis of it will be defined where the two slopes of those intersect. Um, just to wrap up, I think that this book is absolutely phenomenal and it's completely engrossing. My own introduction to it was completely random. It was one of the books that my roommate happened to throw into her suitcase before she came to Yale. And I read it at the beginning of the year. I took it with me and my grandparents over weekend and I didn't sleep the entire weekend cause I was reading it. And, um, I think if you choose this book, each and every one of you will be equally as enthralled. So I hope you pick it.

Speaker 2:          12:05          [inaudible] hi,

Speaker 5:          12:25          I'm pitching a Joan Didion's play it as it lays. Um, Joan Didion is in my mind, one of the greatest intellectuals of the second half of the 20th century. She is perhaps best known for her journalism, particularly her collection of essays, slouching towards Bethlehem, which I believe came out in 1968 in which she Cooley confronts and sensibly analyzes the confusing cultural climate of the late 1960s. What do you think is most report remarkable about her reporting is the lack of naivete with which this literally tiny woman. I don't know if any of you seen, and I'm sure many of you seen, I've seen a picture of her. She's, she's just remarkably small [inaudible] so she is, she's clear eyed but not unsympathetic, innocent but detached and above all candidate in her assessment of her country and her time. Um, the voice that she develops in slouching towards Bethlehem serves her very well and play it as it lays.

Speaker 5:          13:18          She's able here to, to draw the same sort of precise portraits that you relied upon in her nonfiction. There's lots of the novel that is positively, undeniably seductive. The plot revolves around a sort of marginal actress Mariah Yf, who's divorced from our director, husband, and who drifts aimlessly through the Hollywood party scene of the late 1960s waiting for something to touch her, impact her emotionally and morally. She's both damaged and as a result, utterly unreachable tragedies. And there are many major and minor that sort of float blithely by slip, slip off her or appear to. It was a novel, very much about a woman who accepts everything, feels nothing, and finally resigned herself to the inevitable. The inevitable is in many cases, trivial fates dealt out at cocktail parties. It is told in several voices Mariah's and three of her closest friends. And each character is haunted by an ineffable loss of meaning and consequences that they either ignore or are ignorant of willfully or otherwise.

Speaker 5:          14:14          In many ways, these lives, these characters lives are, are coming or drifting apart and their lack of awareness of this fact becomes through Didion's, uh, pros our own. So that's the shock of the final scenes is both powerful and hopelessly hollow. And I don't mean that in a negative sense. I mean that we feel that consequences perhaps or are unimportant, that there's, there's something larger at work. Um, so play it as it lays, I think fits very nicely into the syllabus because it provides a beautiful contrast to the crying of lot 49 and that it depicts the disintegration of southern California and specifically La and a much less manic but no trial, no less troubling way Didion's language and it's flat plain tone minimums mimics the flat plain Los Angeles of her narrative as pensions convoluted, elusive language does his perplexing and intricate portrait of the city.

Speaker 5:          15:07          Also, as with housekeeping, the loss of self is imagined as a dispersal though. When did he in this dispersal is a cold, defensive and ultimately empty one slouching towards Bethlehem because the quote from Yates that includes the phrase, the center will not hold. This is become very emblematic of that era. Mariah, who in the first few pages declares that nothing applies to her is perhaps one of the most poignant examples of the personal consequences of the loosening, the loss of cultural restrictions in the 1960s a time when in fact, none of the old rules applied to her or anyone else did. Ian Proposes that the consequences of this freedom might be more than any single individual can cope with. Um, that in fact, if nothing applies, the individual center, no lessons. Societies cannot hold it. His account of the 60s that appears perhaps elsewhere, but was I think divine defined by Didion.

Speaker 5:          15:58          Um, in this novel. Uh, and I want to read a very brief paths from the beginning. Um, uh, here we go. I am what I am to look for reasons is beside the point, but because the pursuit of reasons is their business. Here she is, I believe at this point institutionalized. Uh, they asked me questions. Mariah, yes or no. I see a cock in this ink blot. Mariah, yes or no. A large number of people are guilty of bad sexual conduct. I believe my sins are on pardonable. I have been disappointed in love. How could I answer? How could it apply? Nothing applies. I print with the magnet, magnetized Ibm Pencil, what does apply? They ask later as if the word nothing were ambiguous, open to interpretation of questionable fragment of an, of an Icelandic room. There are only certain facts I say try and again to be an agreeable player of the game.

Speaker 5:          16:52          Certain facts, certain things that happened, they will misread the facts, invent connections, we'll extrapolate reasons where none exist. But I told you that is their business here and I think it would be, I think it would be wonderful to end the semester with a strong female voice that historically amusing, courageous and especially cold. And I don't mean cold in the in the negative sense, just that she approaches things in a sort of detached way that allows you to observe these characters but not attach yourselves to them in a way that, uh, the promotes is sort of self identification, uh, that makes it difficult for you to judge their actions. Um, perhaps most important. It's also fairly short, just over 200 pages fast, captivating read. Um, this is sort of stupid analogy, but I imagine it's sort of like getting on a highway in La, not during rush hour, but sort of a heading. Which way are you going? Maybe east towards the hills. Um, and

Speaker 6:          17:50          you get to your exit sort of before you realize it. Um, so that's my pitch. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          17:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          18:06          hi, my name is will, I'm pitching Jesus's son by Denis Johnson. Um, I'm actually gonna start, but without introducing it at all. I'm just going to play a clip from the movie that was made of the book and then I'm going to talk about that was a clip from the movie version of Jesus son. Um, and this is the book, it's by Dennis Johnson, who has been in the news a lot lately because he wrote, um, tree of smoke, which won the national book award in 2007. Um, and this, this book is kind of the book that established him as like a serious, great author. Um, and I, I think it's wonderful. It's a collection of stories. Um, and they're all kind of about the same character. Um, one of the characters you saw in there and uh, the kind of the same group of characters runs through all the different stories.

Speaker 6:          18:55          Um, and so it's kind of novelistic in that way. Kind of like I'm lost in the fun house, the book we read. Um, I guess, uh, the, as you might or might not have been able to tell from the clip the book kind of deals with a drug addiction and the main character is addicted to heroin. Um, but I really think the book kind of transcends that drug genre. Um, I really, uh, don't, I'm not a huge fan of drug books myself, but I think this, but I think this book is really, really beautiful and powerful and devastating and really hilarious, really funny at times. Um, I guess what else? It's short, uh, like everyone else has been saying, but this book really is short. Uh,

Speaker 2:          19:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          19:43          it's a, it's only 160 pages and there really aren't very many words then.

Speaker 2:          19:48          Um, cause it's quite, it's quite small as you can see. Um,

Speaker 6:          19:55          uh, and, and I really, I find this book, um, I mean, I don't know how much I want to describe it, but it's the main, it takes place mostly in Iowa and kind of just travels around kind of like daily things. That one, one of the stories, they, uh, the main character and his friend decided to rip scrap metal from a house and sell it, uh, to make a little money so they can get drunk that night. Um, and just different kinds of adventures that they get. One and it's really, um, and then, uh, the book kind of ends in a mercy, makes us kind of pilgrimage to Arizona. Um, it's really beautiful. I guess I'll just read you a quick passage.

Speaker 2:          20:34          That's all right. Um,

Speaker 6:          20:38          we bumped softly down a hill toward an open field that seemed to be a military graveyard filled with rows and rows of austere identical markers over soldiers. I'd never before come across the cemetery on the farther side of the field, just beyond the curtains of snow. The Sky was torn away and the angels were descending out of a brilliant blue summer. They're huge faces streaked with light and full of pity. The sight of them cut through my heart and down the knuckles of my spine and if there been anything in my bowels, I would have messed my pants from fear. Georgie opened his arms and cried out. It's the drive and man the drive in. I wasn't sure what these words meant. They're showing movies in a fucking blizzard. George screamed. I see. I thought it was something else. I said. We walked carefully down there and climbed through the busted fence and stood in the very back.

Speaker 6:          21:29          The speakers, which I had mistaken for grave markers, muttered in unison. Then there was tinkly music of which I could barely knew, very nearly make out the tune. Famous movie stars Rode Bicycles beside a river laughing out of their gigantic, lovely mouth's. If anybody had ever come to see this show, they'd have left when the weather started. Not One car remains not even a broken down one from last week or one left here because it was out of gas and a couple of minutes in the middle of a whirling square dance. The screen turn black, the cinematic summer ended, the snow went dark. There was nothing but my breath. Um, so I guess that gives you enough of an idea of it. Um, I think it's great. I think you should vote for it. It's quick reads, really riveting and enthralling and uh, I find it really incredible book. So Jesus son

Speaker 2:          22:18          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          22:31          Hi, I'm Eli. Um, uh, the book I wanted to pitch was everything is illuminated by Jonathan Safran for um, and uh, the main reason I want to pitch it of course was professor Hungerford said that she's waiting for one of us to pitch a their own book. And, um, contrary to conventional wisdom. This is actually my own book you see now, but setting side authorship issues. The other thing is you just had to introduce the seed of doubt and then the rumors percolate. So this is, um, I, uh, I love books that had outrageous characters actually hearing some of these pitches. I was like, Oh, maybe I should vote for some other boats, but I want to tell you that. But, um, this book, but this book does have outrageous characters, which is really cool. Um, and, uh, also I just thought the pitch, I would just kind of describe some of the characters and you'd be like, those characters are indeed outrageous.

Speaker 7:          23:18          There you go. I will vote for this book. So the book kind of takes place in two different worlds. One is the world of track and broad, um, which is a small shtetl in the 18th century. Um, and also Jonathan Safran for his ancestral home and the other world is kind of modern day Ukraine. Um, and it, it, it features Jonathan Safran Foer on a quest as I'm, I don't know if you Jews out there, I'm sure at some point I had done this as I have, you know, been drawn to like Slovakia, Ukraine to find the ancestral home. And that's what Jonathan said before is doing this book. So I'm in the, uh, kind of modern day world. Um, there are a number of really cool characters. The main one is the hero, Jonathan Safran for who is also referred to as the quote spoiled you and the quote.

Speaker 7:          23:59          And Genius to, um, the, uh, other characters is humble translator Alexander Shove, who learned English exclusively through the use of a thesaurus. Um, and who, uh, which produces some outrageous results and who works for the family business heritage touring, which is he, his description of it is a quote. It's for Jewish people like the hero who have cravings to leave the unknowable country America and visit humble towns in Poland and Ukraine. I will be truthful again and mentioned that before this voyage, I have the opinion that Jewish people were having shit between their brains. That is because all I knew of Jewish people was that they paid father very much currency in order to make vacations from America to Ukraine if we forgot. And then there's also a Alex's dog, Sammy Davis, Jr Jr, which is, um, heritage Turing's coat officious seeing I bitch. Um, so, and that's one road.

Speaker 7:          24:51          And then in the other world, the world of the Shtetl, we have a well regarded rabbi who speaks exclusively in capitals. We have a broad, a brilliant girl, and a magic emerges magically from a river has adopted by the disgrace user. Yankel Yankel d we have two synagogues, the congregation of the slouchers and the congregation of the upright. We have villagers including the deceased philosopher pin class t who in his only notable paper to the dust from man you came. And two man, you shall return, argues that it would be possible in theory for life in art to be reversed. We have the good gefilte fish monger bits, little bits. We'll are, we have the mad squire and village rapists. Sophia out. Can we have Harry v, the [inaudible] master logician and resident pervert who had been working for many years on his magnum opus, the host of hoists, which he promised contain the tightest of tight logical proofs that God indiscriminately loves the indiscriminant lover.

Speaker 7:          25:47          Um, I don't know how many of us that will pardon here, but anyhow, so besides these outrageous characters, I do think that the book fits well with the themes of the course. Um, it deals with identity, um, language and experience, problems of narration and remembrance. Um, as a, the New York Times Book Review, I guess you can say lauded the book I'm quoting, not since a clockwork orange, has the English language been simultaneously mauled and energized with such brilliance and such Breo. Um, so going with that, I thought I'd read as people have been inclined to do a passage from the book, I'm going to take a little risk here. Um, I've been reading the book with a Russian accent in my head. Um, so I figured I would just, you know, I would be okay. I figured that would have the added benefit of like, you're not gonna like be like, you know, if you don't vote for this book, then I'll just be the kid who made a fool of himself and red with a Russian accent in front of everybody.

Speaker 7:          26:41          So I know you don't want to do that to me unless, yeah. Okay. So here we go. This is Alex kind of introducing himself at the beginning of the book. I did Negroes, particularly Michael Jackson, I did to disseminate very much, couldn't see at famous nightclubs in Odessa. Lamborghini Countach is excellent. And so our cappuccinos and many girls want to be carnal with me and many good arrangements, not withstanding the inebriated kangaroo, the Gorky tickle and the unyielding zookeeper. If you want to know why so many girls want to be with me, it is because I am very premium person. There'll be with I am humbly and also severely funny and these are winning things. But nonetheless, I know many people with Diego rapid cars and famous disco techs that are so many, her pro who performed the Sputnik bosom deleons which is always terminated with slimy on their face that they cannot tell you them on all my hands that are even many people named Alex 30 in my house alone. That is why I was so effervescent. The goto lots and translate for Jonathan Safran Foer it would be an ordinary.

Speaker 2:          27:50          So that is said in a full, proudly made [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          28:03          well, uh, it's really unfortunate to have to go after that. But uh, hi, my name is Roger. I'm presenting for Amenas section. Um, and we're uh, doing Dave Edgars. What is the, what you can't see the one because it's 20% off plug. Plug. Um, and, uh, I guess rather than a trip to sound the book myself, I'll use a, not the authors, but the person about whom the book is written, his own words. Uh, what is the, what is the soulful account of my life from the time I was separated from my family in Mario by if I mispronounced that I'm so sorry. Um, to the 13 years I spent an Ethiopian and Kenyan refugee camps. Do you mind counter with vibrant western cultures beginning in Atlanta to the generosity and challenges that I encountered elsewhere? Um, so just add a little bit to that. What is the, what is it is a story of a Sudanese refugee in the United States.

Speaker 8:          28:53          Um, and in the course of telling it, he weeps and accounts from his life back in Africa to stories. I'm here, the United States and everything in between. Um, as for reasons why you should want to vote for it or read it. Um, I think the first thing, which many of us in the section, um, realize how the book is just that it's really engaging. It's written in a way that's, um, I get like, I would say kind of refreshing compared to some of the other more, uh, how to put it on complex, uh, authors that we've read, um, in that it's just really accessible and, you know, really just an easy read that that's, that's, that's deeply human. I mean, you feel like you're having a conversation with the guy. Um, and even though the guys actually having a conversation with David Edgars, so maybe that's why you get that impression.

Speaker 8:          29:34          But, um, at any rate, uh, it's also a book which manages to, um, address really, really serious, um, can kind of, you know, current issues such as civil war, uh, Chan aside, um, alienation in American society, but do so in a way that simultaneously really poignant and inspiring, but also actually funny. Like it's not a book that you're going to read and be depressed by, even though you will come from it. Having really felt that you're, you're, you're dealing with really significant material, which, um, I thought is really cool and we thought was really cool. Um, it's also just going on the whole like contemporary thing. It's written by one of the best contemporary authors out there. Uh, he's, uh, he was nominated for a Pulitzer prize, or here's a Pulitzer prize finalist, I think last year in 2007. I'm not sure, um, if I got that wrong and some of, here's the big Eggers fan.

Speaker 8:          30:21          I'm terribly sorry. Um, but, uh, yeah, he's great. And intercourse where we went, you know, doing from 1945 to the present. Um, I think it's good to have to have a really strong, really contemporary author, um, represented. So that's another cool thing. Um, another thing which I think is, which would be really cool I'm reading this book, is that it's not an act, it's not your standard academic book at all. I mean, you're not gonna find this book on any syllabus, but I mean, it's still really merits, um, like being read in, in that sort of context because of the, you know, the depth of the material is being covered because of the way it's written. It's really, there's some beautiful descriptions. There's beautiful language and Wealthfront and for any other reason that you'd want to read a book in the class, it can serve that function.

Speaker 8:          31:02          And yet, you know, you'd probably be more like to hear about it in a coffee shop or in a restaurant. Um, so I mean, I think that's a, that's a pretty cool opportunity, which this would give us, um, as far as like tying into the course matters. This book is a great, great study and I think, I would think, um, uh, an unprecedented study as far as that identity plot goes for our class because, um, as a black African, I'm, the protagonist is identified not by his ethnicity in the United States, but by, but by his race. Um, and as it's shown in a, in a really very, uh, you know, interesting, I guess a scene in the, in the Vat, the very meaning of the book where he's being robbed by, by black man who, uh, who says to him, Oh, well we're brothers because your f on because you're African.

Speaker 8:          31:43          And at the same time to ride's only refers to as African and actually mislabeled. And as Nigerian when he's Sudanese. Um, so it really offers some really interesting perspective into issues of, of race, issues of ethnicity, um, and just, uh, just a totally new look at American society, um, from, uh, yeah, uh, perspective that we're not really used to. Um, I guess, yeah, that basically covers that as far as some other, maybe a little bit sillier things. This is a great date book for those of you who are either are dating or are looking to be dating. If the PR, I mean visits, it's a book that people are reading all of the time. Um, and even if they aren't reading, then you know, you can really wow them with just your knowledge of contemporary contemporary literature and to say nothing of your concern for the people who are struggling in America and abroad.

Speaker 8:          32:26          So I'm really that, that's a big plug. And um, it's also one of, it's one, a bunch of awards. It was a finalist for at least one of finals towards a final finalist for the national book critics Circle Award for fiction, which I think is good. Um, and the guy from Barnes and noble would not let me leave the counter because he liked it so much and he's a good judge. So, um, those are some really good plugs. But as far as weakness, you might notice it's a little bit bigger than some of the other books that we've read. But I promise you that that's okay if you fly through the pages. And just to give you a sense of why you do that. I'll read 'em to you a section from the book. It's actually the last paragraph of the book, but this, it's not like one of those sports I like.

Speaker 8:          33:06          And then your mother died. No, it's um, this is, it actually really I think is very fitting to read now because it's kind of his plug for why you should read his book, or at least it's a description of why he tells his story. So here we go. Um, whatever I do, however I find a way to live, I will tell these stories. I've spoken to every person I've encountered these last difficult days. And every person who is an entered this club during these awful morning hours because to do anything else would be something less than human. I speak to these people and I speak to you because I cannot help it. It gives me strength, almost unbelievable strength to know that you are there. I covet your eyes, your ears, the collapsible space between us. How blessed are we to have each other. I'm alive and you are alive, so we must fill the air with our words. I will feel today, tomorrow, everyday until I am taken back to God. I will tell these stories to people who will listen and to people who don't want to listen to people who seek me out and to those who run all the while, I will know that you are there. How can I pretend that you do not exist? It would be almost as impossible as you pretending that I do not exist. Thanks.

Speaker 2:          34:11          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          35:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:58          We will see them in a moment. Well, let me say, uh, it, it's a tough act to follow you guys. So congratulations to all the people who pitched books. Um, although I have to say I'm a little hurt at the implied criticism long, long, hard, hard board. I don't recognize my own syllabus. Maybe the long, but I'm not the heart of the boring. Um, so, uh, we will see what that next book will be. Now I have exactly five minutes. So, um, what do you think I want to do is just say something very quick about um, loss in this book. I put this quote up on the board need can blossom into all the compensation it requires. That little blurb I think encapsulates this. Novels, meditation on loss. I asked you last time to think about where Ruth's voice comes from, what situation we can imagine.

Speaker 1:          37:07          And there are bunch of different theories that critics have put forward about where Ruth is in from where we hear her voice coming. One is that she's dead and she's speaking to us from the afterlife that she really somehow did die in the lake that day that she fell off the bridge or somehow the bridge is a metaphor for her passage into death or that this is an adult Ruth living who knows where or just as a transient who has written this account or who speaks to us somehow. I think that quotation from Maryland Robinson that I gave you at the end of last lecture about how she aims to speak in the voice of the consciousness of the person, not necessarily the words that they would use if they were to write their own account, suggest that what she's getting at doesn't require that kind of historical explanation to account for it.

Speaker 1:          38:12          That she doesn't want us to have to think of Ruth's speaking from a particular place, which is also a way to say that Ruth is gone. Somehow Ruth is absent from us. And this relates to my point last time about identity is imagined as voice Ruth, the historical Ruth, the character Ruth, uh, Ruth that we could situate in any concrete position in the world has vanished from the frame of this novel. What we're left with is her voice. The logic here is that vanishing makes the voice totally present, that full human presence is in the voice somehow inherent. That's why there are all these meditations on what would happen if various people either did disappear or didn't disappear. So when Ruth meditates on what it would be like for her to leave Sylvie, she says, I did not want to grow gigantic and multiple to Sylvie.

Speaker 1:          39:35          Her senses that by leaving Sylvie, her absence would become enormous and she herself in a kind of negative presence would become larger than she is. And this is how Ruth feels about her own mother's disappearance, that when her mother disappeared, what she got in return was the compensation of memory. Sharp, specific, evocative, mysterious ever present memory. And the visual metaphor for this kind of memory is of course the lake. The lake is imagined to contain hole and under Cade, all the objects of the past that have been lost in it. So memories imagined in the same terms so that you could always bring them up to the surface and there they would be whole. So the resurrection imagined if you run the film backward of the train slipping into the lake, I read that passage last time. The kind of resurrection imagined is the way memory works.

Speaker 1:          40:48          But more specifically, it's the way the language of memory works. And I want to read, um, my own, uh, favorite passage. Uh, this is at the very end of the novel. And I want you to think as I read it about the difference between this passage and the one I read from bluest eye about Pichola, that passage of negativity about her being a kind of blank or a negative against which all other virtues could be present in the world. So think about that as I read this bottom of two 17 since we are dead, the house would be hers now hers Lucile, perhaps she's in the kitchen snuggling pretty daughters in her lap and perhaps now and then they look at the black window to find out what their mothers seems to see there and they see their own faces and a face. So like their mothers so wrapped and full of tender watching that only Lucile could think of the face was mine.

Speaker 1:          41:56          If Lucille is there, Sylvia and I have stood outside her window a thousand times and we have thrown the side door open when she was upstairs changing beds and we have brought in leaves and flung the curtains and tip the bud vase and somehow left the house again before she could run downstairs leaving behind us a strong smell of lake water. She would sign and think they never change. Or Imagine Lucille in Boston at a table in a restaurant waiting for a friend. She is tastefully dressed wearing say a tweed suit with an amber scarf at the throat to draw attention to the red in her darkening hair. Her water glass has left two thirds of a ring on the table and she works at completing the circle with her thumbnail. Sylvie and I do not flounce in through the door smoothing the skirts of are oversized coats and combing our hair back with our fingers.

Speaker 1:          42:57          We do not sit down at the table next to hers and empty our pockets in a small damp peep in the middle of the table and sort out the gum wrappers and ticket stubs and add up the coins and dollar bills and laugh and add them again. My mother likewise is not there. And my grandmother in her house slippers with her pig tail wagging and my grandfather with his hair combed flat against his brow, does not examine the menu with studious interest. We are nowhere in Boston, however, Lucille may look, she will never find us there or any trace or sign. We pause nowhere in Boston even to admire a store window and the perimeters of our wandering are nowhere. No one watching this woman smear her initials in the steam on her water glass with her first finger or slip cellophane packets of oyster crackers into her handbag for the seagulls could know how her thoughts are thronged by our absence or know how she does not watch, does not listen, does not wait, does not hope. And always for me and Sylvie.

Speaker 1:          44:20          So you see in that incredibly lyrical evo cation of absence, how the very absence calls forth this lyric voice, the structure is exactly the same as the one that Morrison uses to describe what Pichola is to Claudia and Frieda and the rest of their community. It's a way in which absence calls forth the living essence of other people. But here what's called forth is a sort of living essence of imagination, a living essence of voice. So that Sylvie and Ruth's absence for Lucille becomes the very presence that they have to her. There's a passage earlier in the novel where she describes the condition of the body that matches up with this understanding of absence. She's outside in the orchard. This is on two oh three, imagining, uh, the hair, the story of a young girl in a lighted house that she sees her. Ha, uh, let's see.

Speaker 1:          45:45          It would be that kind of story of very melancholy story. Her hair, which was as black as the sky and so long that it swept after her a wind in the grass, her fingers, which were sky black and so fine and slender that they were only cold touch, like drops of rain. Her step, which was so silent that people were surprised when they even thought they heard it. She would be transformed by the gross light into a mortal child and when she stood at the bright window, she would find that the world was gone. The orchard was gone. Her mother and grandmother and aunts were gone. Like Noah's wife on the 10th or 15th night of rain, she would stand in the window and realize that the world was really lost and those outside would scarcely know her. So sadly was she changed before she had been flashed in air and clothed in nakedness and mantled in Cla in cold and her very bones were only slender things like shafts of ice.

Speaker 1:          46:47          She had haunted the orchard out of preference, but she could walk into the lake without ripple or displacement and sail up the air invisibly as heat and now lost to her kind. She would almost forget them and she would feed course food to her course flesh and be almost satisfied. And then Ruth meditates on her transformation in that time in the orchard. If I had stayed there, I might have discovered other things. For example, I was hungry enough to begin to learn that hunger has its pleasures and I was happily at ease in the dark and in general I could feel that I was breaking the tethers of need. One one, what I would, I would call this an anorexic aesthetic.

Speaker 1:          47:36          It's an aesthetic of starving the self into invisibility so that the voice can become present. So in this scene, when she imagines the girl inside the house eating all that outside, the houses lost, all she can see when she looks out her window is her own reflection. But outside the house she is starved into a kind of ethereal, full presence. So the logic of absence, to bring it back round to this question of identity and the identity of the voice, the logic of absence starves away the person so that this fullness can appear, and I think this is the dark side of a novel that so many people initially read as a feminist novel, a novel celebrating the strength and the independence of women. It turns to an aesthetic that has a kind of purchase in our culture. That sense of anorexia blends into the spiritual fullness of imagining memory as this beautiful, lyrical presence. I think this is the complexity of this novel. This is the tension. It's also in many ways it's beauty. So now I believe we have an answer. Jonathan Safran Foer that will be our novel. Eli, congratulations. [inaudible]. Thank you very much. Have a wonderful break.
