00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:04.100
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out Youtube channel, in

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.190
the video today, we’re looking at why some
pages are intentionally left blank and why

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.400
they sometimes paradoxically print this on
the pages.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.020
It's easy to dismiss the phrase, "This page
is intentionally left blank" and its usage

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.310
as an example of bureaucracy gone mad, but
it and the blank pages themselves are actually

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.660
there for good reason.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.840
To begin with, the practise of marking intentionally
blank pages some form of "intentionally blank"

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.260
goes all the way back to the dawn of automated
printing itself, where mistakes in printing

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.940
were relatively common.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.010
Like today, the main purpose of marking these
pages in this way was simply to make sure

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.879
people knew that the blank page wasn't a result
of a printing error.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.969
Given this, it's no surprise that you'll almost
always only see this text on pages that you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.140
might otherwise think shouldn't be blank given
their position in the written work.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.399
This brings us around to the much more interesting
question of why any pages are left blank in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.449
the first place.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.429
After all, this is a waste of paper and potentially
a lot of money given the print volume of some

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.640
tests, pamphlets, books, etc.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.960
As for the first on that list, in timed tests
an intentionally blank page is often used

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.890
as a shield of sorts to stop wily students
from trying to read the next section's questions

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.360
before they're supposed to.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.910
To make sure no student is confused about
a random blank page in their test, they simply

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.120
indicate on the page some form of the somewhat
contradictory statement, "This page is intentionally

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.120
left blank".

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.420
Alternatively, they might put something like
"Stop Here" instead, so the student knows

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.930
to wait until the next timed section starts
and that the page is mostly blank for a reason.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.290
Another reason to include a blank page, particularly
in certain official documents, is to avoid

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.480
ink from a pen potentially bleeding through
to another section of the document.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.080
This is also one of the reasons you may sometimes
encounter otherwise blank pages saying something

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.820
like "Do not write anything on this page".

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.280
In both cases, the page is there simply to
prevent processing errors due to ink-bleed.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.820
Blank pages in books and other bound works,
on the other hand, are generally there because

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.530
these works are often created by folding single,
large sheets of paper in very specific ways

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.300
and binding them all together.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.190
This group of pages is known as a "signature"
and might include something like 4, 8, 16,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.239
or 32 pages out of a single large sheet.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.260
Regardless of how the paper is folded, the
end result is going to be a book or booklet

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.690
with an even number of pages.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.790
If you look carefully at the spine of a book
you have lying around, you may even be able

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.090
to see this sort of grouping of pages if you
let it flair open a bit.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.390
So, for example, if the content of the book
fills 299 pages, the layout artist might choose

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.650
a signature of 4- thus a minimum of 75 folded
sheets making up 300 total pages, including

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.060
one blank page.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.200
On the somewhat extreme end, if the signature
comprises 32 pages (so 10 folded sheets making

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.670
up 320 pages), you'll have a whopping 21 blank
pages, making this signature likely a poor

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.459
choice here, though there still might be financial
or technical reasons to use it anyway.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.650
Of course, savvy editors or layout artists
tend to try to tweak formatting to help the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.760
book fit the chosen signature while minimizing
needed pages.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.109
But inevitably there's going to be times where
nothing can be done and there will be a blank

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.109
page or pages.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.290
In this case, they might resort to tricks
such as putting advertisements about some

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.519
of the other works by the author or publisher
in.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.610
Alternatively, they might put in a short biography
on the author, rather than have it somewhere

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.610
on the cover.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.069
Or, if necessary, they might move such a biography
to the cover to save a page within the book.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.069
Alternatively, they might indicate the blank
page(s) are for the reader to take notes,

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.480
particularly in works like textbooks.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.419
All of these tricks are basically ways of
avoiding a random blank page, or in some cases

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.549
needing to put something like "This page is
intentionally left blank" in the book.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.879
Nevertheless, you'll still occasionally see
this text in some bound works, again in these

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.730
cases generally only put there in cases where
the editor in question thinks the reader might

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.059
think the page was not supposed to be blank.

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.889
So, for instance, you may have noticed that
many books have a blank page at the start

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.169
or end or both; this is a safe bet not to
confuse anyone, so is a handy way to mask

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:08.079
that the book's content didn't quite fit the
signature without needing to put "This page

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.299
intentionally left blank".

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.930
Bonus Fact:
• In the Principles of Federal Appropriations

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.090
Law (Second Edition, Volume IV) printed in
2001, the Office of the General Counsel in

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.459
the US General Accounting Office switched
things up a bit on the old "blank page that

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.880
isn't blank" conundrum.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.091
Instead of stating "This page is intentionally
left blank", they wrote on one blank page

00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:29.530
"This page is intended to be blank.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.720
Please do not read it"...
