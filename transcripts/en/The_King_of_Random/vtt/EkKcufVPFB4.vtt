00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.460
In today's video we're gonna see if we can make a magnetic sand by crushing up powerful magnets in a blender

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.030
*intro music*

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.320
A while ago, I saw a video with a bunch of powerful magnets asking 'will they blend in a powerful blender?'

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.419
They had a string of those little neodymium magnets that look like bb's and they lowered it down into the blender and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.789
Blended it into powder. It was pretty cool

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.918
And we saw a lot of sparks in that video

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.459
But I was kind of disappointed that they didn't show anything about what was left

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.869
So we're gonna try blending up some magnets see if we can replicate that same effect

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.719
And then we want to take a look at that stuff. Here's the basic idea:

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.730
We've got a bunch of powerful neodymium

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.799
Magnets, and we're going to try and blend those up into a fine powder and then see what that powders like

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.649
Is it still magnetic? Will it hold itself into whatever shape we put it into can we use it to make magnetic slime?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.260
So we're gonna try breaking up and blending up a bunch of these types of magnets and see what's left

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:04.249
I'm really hoping that the blender holds up as well as it's supposed to because these things getting hit by the blades at high speeds

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.650
Hopefully we don't have it shatter on us

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.469
most of these silvery magnets I have here the really strong ones are what are called neodymium magnets and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.640
They are largely comprised of neodymium. That's an atomic element They also have iron and boron in them an interesting thing about these though is they actually can be fairly brittle now...

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.620
I don't know if this will break right now, but sometimes these magnets are powerful enough that just pulling themselves together

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.339
They can actually break on impact. So I'm gonna see if I can get that to happen

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.380
Shatter perfectly magnet absolutely shattered on contact

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.240
I wasn't sure if it was going to but it did and that's just because these magnets pull on each other so hard

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.089
Slams together with a lot of surface on surface contact the whole thing is just taking a lot of impact

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.090
It would have exploded

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.200
Except all of those pieces are still being attracted down to the magnet

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.030
So it doesn't have enough force to go anywhere as a first test to see if this will sort of powder eyes

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.539
Let's just take this over to our handle and take a hammer to it and see what that does

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.379
After going at it with a hammer this is what is left of one of these magnet squares

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.079
So we've got the same amount of material here

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.169
Clearly changed form. So it does kind of feel like sand and you can see that it's holding itself together

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.979
So is it still magnetic? I'm gonna have to say it's still somewhat magnetic because I can pull it apart easily

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.080
But like it doesn't lose pieces. There's not sand falling off of it. I can just smush it easily

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.049
I can pull it apart easily see how it compares in terms of magnetic strength. I've got a steel plate here

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.569
This magnet on its edge still strong enough to lift up the plate

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.679
If it would stay centered there we go in comparison our

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.660
magnet sand

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.609
Not even strong enough to hold itself to the plate. Even if we flat it out. So it's more like the original shape. Oh

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.970
You know what that actually helped

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.069
It's definitely still weak

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.809
but it now can hold itself up and that's probably just it has more surface area of

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.729
The sand that's actually in contact with the plate. So we have an interesting proof of concept

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.410
I think the blender is going to do a better job than the hammer and anvil of crushing this stuff into an even

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.729
Sand like powder. So we're gonna try that now and boy, is it gonna be loud?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.819
I'm gonna start off with some of these fairly small magnets

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.019
It seems like the better way to go and take magnets in the top this way when I remove these at the top

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.260
Those ones should fall down into the spinning blender blades

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.280
Well, it blended them that does not look like it was really good for our blades

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.200
That's kind of chewed up in there

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.900
it also

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.940
Stopped blending after just a few seconds and I think that the magnets are being attracted to the base just enough that it's holding down

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.809
Underneath the blades and so it's just spinning and not much is happening. So we're just gonna have to add more magnets into it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.390
Well, we've got quite a bit of blended magnets here

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.810
But it's actually in larger pieces than when we hit it with the hammer

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.999
It just ends up getting stuck down to the bottom and I think it's just too attracted to parts of the bottom of the blender

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.060
and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.250
It's not really getting pulled up by any air current created by those blades

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.690
So we're gonna keep trying to blend this up even more and see what we get out of it

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:08.328
Like this, this is how we're really getting somewhere we're getting it small and blended up

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:12.409
I'm just gonna keep doing this a few more times and see how blended this can get

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.909
Looking pretty good liking this stuff

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.909
so I've now run this through the blender five times or so and well, it's not like

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.879
100% perfectly smooth it's doing pretty well. Just feel like there's one little chunk right here

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.390
So this is what I was hoping to see

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.570
After the video of the magnets being blended up. Yes, it blends up the magnets pretty well, but I wanted to see what's left

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.029
So here we've got a larger quantity of this stuff

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.020
We smashed them up with a hammer and now we smashed it up with a blender and this is what we've got

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.619
Like it's not falling apart like a blob of sand would and this is completely dry. It's just holding itself together

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.200
So it does have some magnetic attraction to itself. Let's try our steel plate test again

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.599
Try and give it a nice flat surface that helped bond a little bit more last time I think

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.330
There we go enough attraction to hold it upside down

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.110
See how the attraction is to an actual magnet though

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.890
so the powderized magnet is attracted to the magnet so it's still

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.600
Ferromagnetic, it still can be attracted by a printed magnet but it itself has lost a lot of its magnetic power

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.889
Magnets can lose their magnetism from heavy impact and of course when you break them up

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.620
So small

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:44.030
The polarity is not going to be all uniform and just facing north and south the way they are when they're a solid piece

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.749
Even if each of these tiny little pieces still holds its own magnetic charge, they're now all jumbled up and pointing in different directions

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:57.439
So it's not acting as a single magnet and the magnetic fields can actually interfere with each other or cancel each other out to some

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.469
Degree, so for this to have the same amount of magnetic power as the whole magnets would have been very unexpected

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.840
Anyway earlier I said we might try this

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.169
I'm going to mix up a batch of slime and see if we can mix this

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.489
Magnet powder into this line and make a little bit of magnetic slime like that

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:28.100
All right, we've got ourselves a little batch of clear slime here see if we can't mix in some of our magnet powder

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.699
It's interesting because of how much the magnets and kind of likes to stick to itself

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.070
It's having a very hard time mixing up inside the slime because it doesn't like to separate out much

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.690
We've got some

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.559
Attraction to our very powerful magnet here

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:49.038
Looks like we kind of just have a blob of the sand

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.720
Surrounded by the slime. It's it's not very evenly mixed in

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.620
Of course the magnet is very attracted to the steel plate underneath it it is attracted to it

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.939
But I think it's just pulling all of the magnet stuff through that. Yep. There we go

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:10.129
This is like how to remove your magnets and from your slime rather than making magnetic slime

00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:12.870
Here's our original

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:20.269
Magnetic putty we made with some magnetite powder compare how that gets attracted to the magnet here. It's not pulling anything out

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.280
It's just pulling all of it together. I

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.519
Could watch that all day that is like the coolest thing that you can deal with magnets

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.440
I think so making our magnets and our DIY magnets and into a magnetic slime

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:43.669
It doesn't work as well as when we use the artificially created magnetite this stuff doesn't mix into the slime very well at all

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.410
So I got to say it's not as effective

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:51.500
But it's kind of cool to watch it get drawn over by a magnet and you can just pull some of the magnet dust

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.979
Right out of it. One more thing. I wanted to try. I wanted to see what happens

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.320
If we heat this stuff up, will it just turn into?

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.459
Metallics and will lose all of its ability to hold itself together

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.310
All right little torch

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.170
See what you can do

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.130
A lot of cool sparks coming off of that. I like that

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.739
Glowing orange here at the top that went really quickly

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.720
It's holding itself together quite a bit less

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.929
Any more cohesive once it cools down a bit see this is just not the same

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.890
There's before we heated it up stays together in this pile. And even if we try and separate it out into separate little

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.860
Sanded. It just doesn't do it now that we've heated it up

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.140
Nothing doesn't hold together even a little bit

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.999
Just the dust that was sparking a lot as I smashed it. So I'm gonna try heating it up again

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.489
And then while it's still hot, I'm gonna hit it with the hammer

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.150
It's now flatter and it's any contact with this steel plate

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.739
So it's not heating up as evenly or as easily as it was before you

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.559
Know what? I'm just gonna move on up to the big boy torch. Ah

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:18.989
That was great, that was a cool little shower sparks. That's a cool shower of sparks too. Holy cow that

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.360
Is so cool

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.220
Three two one

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.699
This is a cool little tool that lets you actually see magnetic fields, it's pretty neat

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:56.099
It's got some magnetic powder in this sheet and it gets attracted around and when you bring a magnet

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.939
Into the presence of it you can actually watch its magnetic field show up

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:05.249
I bring a much stronger magnet near it the effect is accentuated quite a bit

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.520
Very powerful magnetic field then when we compare that to our

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:18.239
Magnetics and it shows up a little bit very disjointed. It's not uniform at all

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:24.839
Even if it still has its magnetism it's not facing all one direction. So it's not uniform. It doesn't create one

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:30.869
Magnetic field that's just creating thousands of tiny magnetic fields that are often interfering with each other

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.659
