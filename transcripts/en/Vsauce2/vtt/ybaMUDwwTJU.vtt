00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.730
Fontus uses a solar panel and condenser attached
to a bike to convert water vapor from the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.490
air into a bottle of drinking water.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.690
And cellufoam is a wood-based, renewable,
biodegradable, shock-absorbing potential future

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.160
alternative to styrofoam.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Vsauce!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160
Kevin here.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.390
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.619
Cota wants to charge every device within 30
feet - wirelessly.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.910
In development since 2001, the transmitter,
which is made up of thousands of tiny antennas

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.390
angled slightly different from one another,
receives RF pings from a microchip receiver

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.300
embedded on your devices and reflects them
back with an increased power level of up to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.019
1 watt -- and the process is repeated 100
times per second.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.160
The charge speed is one-fifth to one-third
of USB but it continuously charges untethered

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.329
until the battery is full whether it’s in
your hand, pocket, or on the table.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.530
But the concept isn’t just for phones - it’s
for wireless door locks, smoke detectors,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.859
remote controls, video game controllers, or
electric toothbrushes.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.620
It’ll be another five years before this
becomes commercially available.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.870
A new smart pill seeks to measure the gas
inside you.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.680
The impact of gas on health is poorly understood,
in part because it's difficult to measure

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.000
inside the gut.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.180
So the new gas pills detect hydrogen, methane
and carbon dioxide, and wirelessly transfer

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.170
the results to an app.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.890
Researchers from RMIT in Melbourne believe
this could lead to a future of optimized diets

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.070
customized for all individuals.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.310
In 1781, Benjamin Franklin actually proposed
the study of farts.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.980
In an essay that was part science and part
humor, Franklin cited the same problems: that

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.220
internal gases were difficult to understand
and measure.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.130
He hoped to find a drug that made farts smell
like perfume.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.100
235 years later we may not have realized Franklin's
dream of lavender flatulence, but we're on

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.650
the path to understanding the effects of diet
on gut disorders like IBS and Crohn's disease.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.510
FGF21 is a life-extending, immune function
boosting hormone in mice.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.460
Researchers at the Yale School of Medicine
found that increasing the levels of the hormone

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.100
produced in the thymus gland led to a 40%
lifespan extension.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.000
If, and this is a big if, that were to apply
to humans someday, it would raise the average

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.390
life expectancy from about 79 to over 110
years old.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.819
They do believe the implications for improving
immune function in the elderly could help

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.670
combat illnesses such as type-2 diabetes and
cancer.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.150
Addibots are mobile 3D printing robots that
could fill potholes.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.069
It was first tested by repairing skating cuts
in ice by essentially printing ice - precisely

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.980
depositing water kept just above freezing.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.960
For roads, the additive manufacturing robots
will need to keep tar materials at a high

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.380
temperature, so further research and development
is currently underway.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.780
Spermbots.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.650
To help combat male infertility, researchers
from Germany have developed magnetically-driven

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.460
microhelices that go over the tail of sperm
and act as motors.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.510
They’ve successfully driven sperm in the
lab but are still far from beginning human

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.430
clinical trials for the cyborg sperm.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.560
Michigan Engineering is developing a full-page
braille display for the visually impaired.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.060
The pneumatic display uses bubbles driven
by air or fluid, which is much cheaper than

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.849
existing electronic displays that can cost
up to $55,000.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.780
The challenge now is to fit all 5 to 10 thousand
physically controlled dots in a compact, mobile

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.780
space.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.590
The GyroGlove aims to control tremors in the
hands of people with Parkinson’s disease.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.709
A mechanical gyroscope on the back of the
hand resists the hand movement caused by tremors

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.959
by up to 90%.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.010
They hope to launch in the U.K. by the end
of 2016 but first need to try to make it spin

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.520
silently and remain balanced.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.110
VertiGO is a wall-climbing robot.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.110
The collaboration between Disney Research
Zurich and ETH easily transitions from ground

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.230
to wall by maximizing thrust and minimizing
vehicle weight.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.099
It features two propellers for thrust and
a carbon fibre baseplate to minimize weight.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.190
Mostly I just want one.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:24.479
Finally, here’s Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot
doing some household chores.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:34.680
I’m gonna leave you with FlyAbility - a
drone with a spherical freely rotating protective

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:43.449
cage - and as always - thanks for watching.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:05:05.169
Keeping in touch by means of the amazing new
“Bellboy” is the Bell System’s answer

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.270
today for doctors, salesmen, delivery men
or anyone who must be available at all times

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.259
in the fast paced world of Century 21.

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.290
When someone calls and you are out, you can
be reached by dialing your Bellboy code number.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:29.960
When you get a signal on the Bellboy you can
go to a phone to call your office or home

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.659
to get the message.
