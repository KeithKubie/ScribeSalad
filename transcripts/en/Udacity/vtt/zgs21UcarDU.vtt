00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.570
In the last two lessons, we focused on motion problems that involve rates. The

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.506
rates were miles per hour, which is how fact an object was traveling. In this

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:13.084
lesson, we're going to focus on a different kind of rate involving work. If it

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:16.360
takes you two hours to complete a homework assignment, what fraction of the

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.922
assignment can you complete in one hour? In this case, we're talking about the

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:25.620
rate, about how fast you can work on an assignment. When you think you know the

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.590
answer, enter that fraction here.
