[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.730
SPEAKER 1: So
Sloane, you actually

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.945
did what we think is the
third talk at Google ever--

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.070
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, really?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.850
SPEAKER 1: --about--

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.810
SLOANE CROSLEY:
You carbon-dated--

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.129
SPEAKER 1: We carbon-dated it.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.815
It was 2018-- or, 2008.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:21.615
So it was 11 years ago.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:22.490
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.860
SPEAKER 1: What did you
think of going to California

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.530
and doing that first talk?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.652
And what's changed?

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.360
What's different?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.500
SLOANE CROSLEY: It was on
the Mountain View campus.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.170
There were no-- there's a very
fancy clock in front of us.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.070
There's a lot of--

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.430
that the tech is
more sophisticated.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.120
But you'd think, even in 2008,
for Google, it would have been.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.740
Feel like, oh, I just sat down
and started trashing my hosts.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.325
No, but it was great,
actually, because I

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:49.700
came from a
corporate world where

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.030
I worked for Random House,
which is very much not too

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.100
far from what you
see of publishing

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.770
portrayals in the movies,
of sort of dusty old desks

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.460
and piles of petrified
rubber bands and manuscripts.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.960
And to go to this place where it
just felt like the giant world

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.090
in "Super Mario Bros.,"
it was just incredible.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.750
And there was so much free
water, of all-- not that--

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.443
but different kinds
of flavors of water.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.110
But yeah, it was a
really nice audience.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.850
And it was just like--
it was a long time ago.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.840
But it was sunny.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.605
SPEAKER 1: And you were still
working in corporate America

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:23.980
at that time?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.800
SLOANE CROSLEY: I
was still working.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.493
Yeah, maybe that's why I
was over-impressed by the--

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:29.660
that that's what I noticed,
more than the experience

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.000
of the reading, was sort
of all the different sort

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.930
of trappings were so much
more trapping-y than at Random

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.442
House.

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:37.400
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.570
We do have good trappings.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.770
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes, you do.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.887
SPEAKER 1: When you
started, did you--

00:01:41.887 --> 00:01:43.220
you've done a lot of journalism.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.430
Did you intend to become a
memoir and short-story writer?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.200
Was that always
sort of where you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.700
thought your roots really lie?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.560
You've obviously done novels.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.790
But you keep coming
back to this format.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.280
SLOANE CROSLEY: I think
when I started my--

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.620
and I always wanted
to write fiction.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.560
And then I sort of--

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.173
I often say that I fell
backwards into non-fiction,

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:06.340
which I should really stop
saying, because it sounds

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.380
very like, oh, this old thing?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.030
It requires effort.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.210
But it is a format I sort
of gravitate towards,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.190
because it's close to
how I see the world.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.570
I think heavily in analogies.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.810
But I don't think
of it as a memoir.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.200
It's not really--

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.310
I think of them as sort
of humor pieces or essays,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.810
and not really
stories about myself,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.350
even though they of course are.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.350
SPEAKER 1: And what's it
like now, a year later?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.310
The book's been out for a year.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.065
What's it like
promoting the paperback

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:40.690
as opposed to the
hardcover, and having

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.350
lived with it for a year?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.780
What's it like the second--

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.947
SLOANE CROSLEY: Lightweight?

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:46.120
SPEAKER 1: What's it like
the second time around?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.703
SLOANE CROSLEY: It
is a little-- yeah,

00:02:47.703 --> 00:02:50.370
I guess are you driving-- is
it like, play "Free Bird"?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.050
Like you're sort of sick of it.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.910
No, it's actually
great because the thing

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.160
is, in between, I have been
working on other things.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.070
I do a little bit of
journalism, travel writing,

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.080
as well as a novel
I'm working on now.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.052
So it's actually great to
remember that I can do this.

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:07.760
This can be done.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.220
It can be bound and sold.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.710
And it will happen
again, because no matter

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.950
how successful you get, I think
part of the health of that

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.260
is forgetting that anyone
would want to read something

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.870
and having to prove
yourself again.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.362
So it is a nice little almost
lilypad to land on and think,

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:24.070
oh, that's right.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.450
I did do this.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.020
SPEAKER 1: I remember
these stories!

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.365
So I really love
female humorists.

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:32.740
And we just talked
about the fact

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.040
that you inject a lot of
humor into these essays.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.920
And a lot of the books that
you see sort of on shelves that

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.740
are female-humor-driven
are the Tina Feys and Amy

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.380
Poehlers of the world, people
who are entertainers first.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.540
What's it like approaching
it as a writer first?

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.373
And then, would you
ever think to say, well,

00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:53.410
I'm actually going to
dive into their world

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.260
and do a little bit more
entertainment because--

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.570
SLOANE CROSLEY: I mean, I
try to entertain the people.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.270
But yeah, I know
what you're saying.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.010
I mean, I think it's almost not
really an artistic distinction

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.290
to me, but a marketing
distinction, where they have

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.192
a platform or whatever
it is ahead of time,

00:04:11.192 --> 00:04:12.900
that people are going
to buy their books.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.275
And the people
you mentioned also

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.790
happen to be fantastic writers.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.790
But there are other people
who aren't as strong.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.130
But it seems to be the
sort of trendy thing,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.927
to whip up a book of essays.

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:27.260
And to that, I would just say
it's harder than it looks.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.470
And similarly, I'm sure
being an entertainer,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.510
or being a stand-up comedian,
is a lot harder than it looks,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.740
or maybe exactly as
hard as it looks.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.500
It looks hard.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.750
But I feel like I
don't really feel

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.840
compelled to sort of dip my
toe into that world that much.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.900
And I'm very happy
with where I come from,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.025
which is a tradition that's
sort of more influenced

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:49.420
by Nora Ephron, Joseph
Mitchell, Dorothy

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.740
Parker, that kind of thing.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.823
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:53.440
So who else is an
influence to you?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.760
And what else are you sort
of reading these days?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.120
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh,
well, I just finished--

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.695
I always read these
dark, terrible things.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:02.320
And it's funny.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.445
If you ask David Sedaris,
he'll say the same thing.

00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:07.670
He's always reading about
the Holocaust and taxidermy.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.650
It's very weird.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.400
Not together.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.030
Oh my god.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.088
That's a horrible joke.

00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:13.630
But I guess what
I'm saying is I just

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.255
finished reading
"Giving Up the Ghost,"

00:05:15.255 --> 00:05:18.840
which is a memoir by Hilary
Mantel, who wrote "Wolf Hall."

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.480
And it's fantastic
but very dark.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.120
And I tend to read
that kind of stuff.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.510
But in terms of who
I look to, often

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.000
it will be short-story writers.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.520
I think that we have this
concept that obviously,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.740
for narrative nonfiction,
we want to keep it pure,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.700
and you want to tell the truth.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.780
And of course that is true.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.790
But the techniques you
use to tell these stories

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.442
are not so far off from
fiction techniques.

00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:40.900
You know, there's
only so many ways

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.720
to say she sat in
the chair, right?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.360
That's going to look the
same whether you're making it

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.870
up or telling the truth.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.450
And so I do tend
to look towards--

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.800
I love-- Lorrie Moore is a
favorite, an idol of mine.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.790
And then I don't know.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.142
I mean, all of them?

00:05:56.142 --> 00:05:57.100
SPEAKER 1: All of them.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.280
SLOANE CROSLEY: Is "all
of them" a good answer?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.720
OK, go ahead.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.760
SPEAKER 1: Lorrie
Moore is a good answer.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.110
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, good.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.930
SPEAKER 1: So we'll
let that-- how

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.240
do you think you've
changed, your writing's

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.720
changed, since the first
two collections of stories?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.260
What's evolved for you?

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.050
SLOANE CROSLEY:
Yeah, it's funny.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.825
I hope that there's
been an evolution.

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:15.950
But in a way, it's almost--

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.672
I'm not really in a
position to see it.

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:19.630
It's almost not mine to
answer, in a weird way,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.947
because it's the same
thing as you get a haircut,

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.280
and someone hasn't seen you
in a while, and you're like,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.797
I guess?

00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:27.130
Yeah, I guess this is-- or I
guess I have gained or lost

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.070
weight, or I'm taller.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.830
I'm not taller, but--

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.570
that would be weird.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.410
But so I don't see it,
these sort of giant

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.050
shifts, the way it might
look from the outside.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.720
But I will say it's probably a
similar tone that I've always

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.730
had, just probably focused on
slightly more complex topics,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.410
just to keep myself interested.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.980
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.370
You have to keep yourself
interested, right?

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.380
SLOANE CROSLEY: You
[? can ?] entertain yourself.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.230
No, it's true.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.230
I feel like I will sometimes
pull out a random page.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.320
And the worst thing you
can do as a writer--

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.760
this is a horrible tip, and
it's really masochistic.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.900
But I pull out a page of a
manuscript, or a chapter.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.550
And I imagine the
smartest person

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.840
I know who doesn't
like me reading it.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.960
And if I could imagine that
person laughing or appreciating

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.892
it anyway, then I'm
like, OK, it's good.

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:16.350
SPEAKER 1: That's
a good technique.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.290
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah, it's awful
in the moment to imagine that.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.000
SPEAKER 1: Do you know these
people who don't like you?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.500
SLOANE CROSLEY: I
mean, I can guess.

00:07:24.568 --> 00:07:25.860
We live in the world, you know?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.860
I don't know.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.640
SPEAKER 1: I can't imagine that
many people who don't like you.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.973
SLOANE CROSLEY: Aw, thanks, Mom.

00:07:29.973 --> 00:07:32.790
SPEAKER 1: How do
you determine--

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.580
I mean, I'm sure part of it is,
with these story collections,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.870
it's a matter of time, right?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.000
You're collecting
them over time.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.668
How do you decide
what makes the cut?

00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:42.210
And how do you decide
what the thread

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.740
is between these stories?

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.720
And what ends up on
the chopping block?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.915
And do they get saved for later,
or do they get tossed away?

00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:50.460
SLOANE CROSLEY:
They get repurposed.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.310
It's like the Inuit.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.510
Do I use every
part of the whale?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.050
I can make a candle out
of this bone someday.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.350
Yeah, I think-- most
essays-- there's

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.270
very few essays I've
ever written that were

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.680
written for one of these books.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.055
And I work a little differently
than other essayists, who

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:10.300
tend to publish long-format
stuff in magazines,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.090
and then collect them.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.340
Most of the stuff I
publish on the regular

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.050
doesn't go into the books.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.640
The stuff is written
for the books.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.830
So therefore very
little is getting cut,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.830
because it was always
meant to go where it goes.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.290
The stuff that
gets cut is when I

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.120
feel that I'm just
complaining, which

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.380
is a real danger for a person.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.088
SPEAKER 1: It is.

00:08:33.088 --> 00:08:34.422
SLOANE CROSLEY: I once wrote a--

00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:36.299
I mean, this is years
ago, but probably back

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.870
when I was fresh
from Mountain View.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.020
I wrote an essay about
getting a parking ticket.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.010
Oh my god, who cares?

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.160
Nobody, is the answer.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.820
And if there's not
that universality,

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.040
if there's not some
sort of tentacle that's

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.780
reaching out to other
people's experience,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.020
then it's sort of a dud.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.708
So that stuff, generally
I'll save a funny line,

00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:57.750
and then everything goes.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.590
SPEAKER 1: We've all
gotten parking tickets.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.120
SLOANE CROSLEY: I
mean, yeah, but nobody

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.850
cares about your
parking ticket either.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.130
And I mean that in the
nicest way possible.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.820
But no, seriously, unless
it was something about--

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.600
you can imagine it
being about some sort

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.850
of larger frustrating
experience, or something

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.968
about living in an urban center.

00:09:13.968 --> 00:09:15.510
I'm just trying to
think of something

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.050
that would expand that at all
to it not just being like,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.860
woe is me.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.270
SPEAKER 1: What do you
like to complain about?

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:21.920
What are your pet peeves?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.650
SLOANE CROSLEY: Everything.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.192
SPEAKER 1: I know we just talked
about parades very briefly--

00:09:25.192 --> 00:09:26.098
I also hate.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.390
SLOANE CROSLEY: I hate parades.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.020
SPEAKER 1: I hate parades.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.353
SLOANE CROSLEY: Everyone-- yeah.

00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:30.810
No one likes a parade.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.860
But I feel like I always
describe it as sort of like,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.615
I walk through the
world with one eye open

00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:37.740
and one eye kind of cocked.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.530
And if I go on vacation, like,
I was recently in Mexico City

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.320
and very adamant that
the people I was with--

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.450
I'm like, let's fling
ourselves down--

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.140
within reason.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.230
I don't want to do
anything too dangerous.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.390
But let's go as much
off the beaten path

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.470
as we can, and fling
ourselves down a dark alley.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.970
And we did.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.350
We found several dark alleys
that were good for flinging.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.600
And then I just complained
the entire time.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.573
So it's like basically,
I want to do this,

00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:05.490
and then I want to be
miserable while I do it.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.232
And that's where
I find my happy.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:08.760
And that's really what
comes through in the books.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.840
SPEAKER 1: And then you
go home and you write down

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.530
all the details.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.850
SLOANE CROSLEY: And then I go
home and write down-- yeah,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.130
and I think that is the tone
that is the most pervasive

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.672
in the books, is
that it's actually--

00:10:15.672 --> 00:10:18.830
they're kind of upbeat, but
sort of snarky at the same time.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.330
SPEAKER 1: What were you doing
in this alley in Mexico City?

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:21.980
SLOANE CROSLEY:
It's not important.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.563
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.070
So to that end, and to
talking about Mexico,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.460
or you went and you
scaled a volcano.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.200
You did all sorts of
things in this book.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.130
So my question is, do you
look for these adventures,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.680
knowing hey, this is going
to make a good story?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.235
Do you just sort
of live your life?

00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:43.110
How do these things--

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.020
I mean, you complained about a
neighbor who was really loud.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.720
That wasn't something
you probably sought out.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.787
But some of these adventures,
how does your mind work,

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:53.370
in terms of being
like, you have to be

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.020
collecting interesting stories?

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.330
Getting a parking ticket you
said did not make the cut,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.865
so it can't just be things
that are super-mundane.

00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:03.240
SLOANE CROSLEY: I'm not really
collecting them that much.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.360
I don't go through
with this sort

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.510
of new kind of sensor on my head
because I do this for a living.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.360
I think it would make me
a huge pain, honestly,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.590
to be around, if I
just was doing things

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.390
for the sake of the piece.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.890
I mean, it does
happen sometimes.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.750
But usually, it's like
halfway through an experience

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.958
there'll be some sort of
moment that throws something

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.403
into a kind of sharp relief.

00:11:26.403 --> 00:11:28.320
I mean, one of the first
essays I ever wrote--

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.508
and it's in the first book--

00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:32.550
were I got locked out of
two different apartments

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.230
in the same day.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.568
I was moving apartments,
and the same locksmith

00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:38.610
came to bail me out eight
hours later, because it

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.040
was the same neighborhood.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.670
And I had this doormat
that said "deja

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.400
vu" frontwards and backwards.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.483
And you know, he's
filling out the slip.

00:11:46.483 --> 00:11:48.150
And he pointed with
his pen and he goes,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.736
that's a funny doormat.

00:11:49.736 --> 00:11:52.470
And I just knew.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.860
I was like, OK.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.320
This has now congealed
in some kind of way.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.300
So usually it happens like that.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.360
But yes, I would
obviously rather not

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.303
have thrown up on
a glacier, which

00:12:04.303 --> 00:12:05.470
is what happens in the book.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.090
SPEAKER 1: Do you want to tell
everyone a little bit about--

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.380
SLOANE CROSLEY: It'd
be great if I didn't.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.130
No, I'm kidding, I'm
kidding, I'm kidding.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.030
Basically, a friend of mine--

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.337
I was going for a piece
to Quito, Ecuador.

00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:16.420
And I had some extra time.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.795
And I was like,
what should I do?

00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:19.420
And I tried to
sort of crowdsource

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.500
through Facebook at the time.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.480
And someone
recommended a museum.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.610
Someone recommended a sort
of fun bar with good drinks.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.950
And someone said, oh, you
should climb Cotopaxi.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.280
And I could not be
bothered to Google it.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.123
Pardon me.

00:12:34.123 --> 00:12:36.040
And if I had, I definitely
wouldn't have gone.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.670
It's huge.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.650
It's not like K2,
but it's massive.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.775
There's snow on top, a lot.

00:12:39.775 --> 00:12:41.192
SPEAKER 1: Did you
learn a lesson?

00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:43.033
Would you Google it
next time, if somebody

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:43.950
recommended something?

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.992
SLOANE CROSLEY: Is that--

00:12:44.992 --> 00:12:46.450
[INAUDIBLE] the environment.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.570
The lesson is google it.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.610
SPEAKER 1: Google it!

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.740
We have tools for you.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.310
SLOANE CROSLEY: We do.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.720
We can make this
stop, although I

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.740
wouldn't have gotten the essay.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.890
SPEAKER 1: You wouldn't
have gotten the essay.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.960
So maybe not googling anything.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.322
SLOANE CROSLEY: Don't google it.

00:12:57.322 --> 00:13:01.130
SPEAKER 1: You'd be scared
to do anything that was--

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.610
and so when you have
these experiences, I mean,

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.780
I have a really bad memory.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.090
So I would have to go home
and just kind of scribble

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.380
all the details.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.380
What's your process?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.860
Do you go, OK, I got
to run home right now,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.400
and I have to write down as
much as I can possibly remember?

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.510
SLOANE CROSLEY: I mean,
it depends on the essay.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.552
So for an essay like the
one we're talking about,

00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:26.060
definitely I was sort of taking
notes as it was happening.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.210
I mean, there's another
essay in this book that's

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.710
more of an interview
format, where I

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.528
interview my uncle, who was a--

00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:35.820
there's no really good way
to say this-- a massive porn

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.330
star in the '70s.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.330
SPEAKER 1: He's awesome.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.455
SLOANE CROSLEY: He's great.

00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:41.720
And he got into
pornography to find

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.280
a girlfriend,
which is what makes

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.240
him sort of sweet and special.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.120
And so I interviewed
Uncle Johnny.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.583
But I knew-- that's an example
where I obviously knew--

00:13:50.583 --> 00:13:52.250
I wasn't interviewing
him for my health,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.250
do you know what I mean?

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.210
So I obviously knew
it was for this.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.402
But a lot of the
essays are years--

00:13:58.402 --> 00:14:00.110
I mean, they're a
lifetime in the making,

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.640
right, because
you're trying to get

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.650
at some larger point that's been
brewing for a really long time.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.760
And so I mean, the thing
to remember about them

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.740
is that they're not
being assigned to me.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.990
So if you asked me to write
an essay about what I wore

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.652
yesterday, we'd be in trouble.

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:14.610
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.120
And from a journalistic
standpoint,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.510
though, you do do a
lot of interviews.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.718
Are those generally assigned?

00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:20.690
Or at this point, do
you say, you know what?

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.898
I want to interview my uncle.

00:14:21.898 --> 00:14:25.010
And maybe it's a
better format for that

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.260
than it is for my short story.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.350
SLOANE CROSLEY: I mean,
I am lucky in that I

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.020
have-- oh, sorry.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.770
I interrupted you.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.295
SPEAKER 1: No, how do you
pick where it should live?

00:14:31.295 --> 00:14:33.170
SLOANE CROSLEY: Well,
I'm lucky that I have--

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.730
it's like having
multiple homes, right?

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.110
It's like, does this
go in the summer house?

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.830
I don't know.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.267
I mean, this could
be journalism.

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:39.350
This could be for a novel.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.495
This could be for essays.

00:14:40.495 --> 00:14:42.120
And I do a little
bit of screenwriting.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.620
It could be for that.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.280
But it's-- if you're
talking, like,

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.725
I just interviewed Laura
Dern for "Vanity Fair."

00:14:49.725 --> 00:14:50.600
And it was wonderful.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.767
But that was assigned to me.

00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:55.430
I'm not deciding what goes on
the cover of "Vanity Fair."

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.138
But yeah--

00:14:56.138 --> 00:14:56.930
SPEAKER 1: Not yet.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.930
SLOANE CROSLEY: Not yet.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.600
But it depends.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.790
It's really not a
good answer, I guess.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.300
It depends.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.670
SPEAKER 1: No, that's a
great answer, because it is--

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.080
I think the point
is, you do live

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.592
in so many different worlds,
which is really cool,

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:11.300
and the fact that so
many of these things

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.670
can translate to
different places

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.035
and find different audiences.

00:15:15.035 --> 00:15:15.650
SLOANE CROSLEY: It's great.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:16.580
Well, it's also
because sometimes you

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.413
have to-- even within
the essays themselves.

00:15:18.413 --> 00:15:20.000
So there's 16
essays in this book,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.880
and they're structured slightly
different than the last two

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.500
books, in the fact
that there are

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.130
these palate cleanser,
tiny three-pagers

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.147
between the massive essays.

00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:33.230
And they're there for a
reason, because if I tried

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.260
to make those stories
or those points larger,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.535
it would bloat and
be a crappy essay.

00:15:38.535 --> 00:15:40.160
SPEAKER 1: And I love
that, by the way,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.900
because sometimes you do
need a palate cleanser.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.233
Sometimes you-- because you
finish a chapter and you go,

00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:46.815
oh, the next one's
only a half a page.

00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:47.440
What a little--

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.090
SLOANE CROSLEY: I like to give
you a sense of accomplishment.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.590
SPEAKER 1: So nice!

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.820
So I think varying the length is
something we really appreciate,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.260
actually, especially
after you've

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.628
come off a really long one.

00:15:58.628 --> 00:15:59.420
You need something.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.878
SLOANE CROSLEY:
You need something.

00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:03.200
A soft landing.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.840
SPEAKER 1: I think part of the
reason people love you so much

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.620
is that you're--

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.880
she's beloved-- is
that you have a talent

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.690
for balancing humor with some
more serious sorts of topics.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.010
It's a hard thing to do.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.593
I don't think people
really understand

00:16:18.593 --> 00:16:22.490
how hard that is to do, because
being consistent in voice.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.200
So do you ever go
to these essays

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.870
and think to
yourself, OK, maybe I

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.210
need to sort of balance
it one way or the other?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.920
Or how does that sort of--

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.830
how do you make sure that
tone is reading consistently?

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.660
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, wow.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.160
I was about to be like, that's
a good query, political, like

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.840
filibustering.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.130
I'm like, well, it's
a good question.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.880
I'm happy you asked it.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.380
Next?

00:16:44.643 --> 00:16:46.310
This is also going
to sound a little bit

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.390
like, oh, this old thing.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:52.810
But the difficulty is in
making things less jokey.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:53.545
SPEAKER 1: It is.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:54.920
SLOANE CROSLEY:
The difficulty is

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.212
in actually not
imbuing something

00:16:58.212 --> 00:16:59.670
with pathos, or
anything like that.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.830
I think that most--

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.595
even though I'm not a stand-up
comedian, I am a comic writer,

00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:05.720
you would call me, I guess.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.359
And most people of
my ilk have some sort

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.089
of dark, desperate
sadness in their core.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.300
SPEAKER 1: Do you have that?

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.200
SLOANE CROSLEY: Sure.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.329
SPEAKER 1: That's
my next question.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.299
SLOANE CROSLEY: A therapy
couch would be great.

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:18.010
I can just lie down.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.329
But, and so I
think that the idea

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:24.460
of seeing the sort of
almost catastrophist version

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.470
of any scenario really
comes quite naturally to me.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.040
I also do see things--

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.980
and the way I talk about it
is through a funny prism.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.770
But if it's too jokey,
it can be a little

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.140
like symbol-bashing monkey.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.940
And nobody likes--
we really do not

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.800
like people to try
too hard with humor.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.270
It upsets people.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.770
It does.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.395
It's like, ugh, you're
trying too hard.

00:17:47.395 --> 00:17:49.280
And I'm like, OK, well.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.860
And so it becomes distracting
from the point of the essays.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.740
So if I have to balance, it's
usually stripping jokes out.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.900
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.450
Do you ever go back and
read some of the essays,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.870
and it helps you sort of
remember the experience?

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.170
Is it sort of almost--

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.540
can it be like a diary?

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.722
Or is that therapeutic
to go back and go, oh,

00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:09.680
that was my experience.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.660
I know two of the
essays you read

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.050
when you were here in 2008,
one was "Oregon Trail,"

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.260
and the other was finding
out that your mother had

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.350
been married before.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.370
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah,
really casually.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.870
I was like 16 and I found an
extra ring in her jewelry box.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.410
I was like, what's this?

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.270
SPEAKER 1: I had a
similar experience.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.910
So again, talking to the
universality of these things.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:27.064
SLOANE CROSLEY: Really?

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:27.141
Wow.

00:18:27.141 --> 00:18:27.600
OK.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.392
SPEAKER 1: But yes.

00:18:28.392 --> 00:18:32.710
So does that-- do
you ever go back,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.137
and it helps you sort of
remember them, because again,

00:18:35.137 --> 00:18:36.720
maybe some of these
things are clearer

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.553
in the moment, or the
way that you put them?

00:18:38.553 --> 00:18:40.590
Or do you go back and
go, well, maybe I've

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.850
changed my perspective?

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.042
What's that like, to have
this sort of collection?

00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:46.500
SLOANE CROSLEY:
The answer is going

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.670
to-- it's not going to be good.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.510
The answer is that it's the
reverse, because what happens

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.380
is you--

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.630
like anything, you don't
have to be a writer for this.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.150
You get used to telling
a version of a story.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.120
And if you've ever been
a part of a family meal,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.820
I'm sure that things
get retold all the time.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.370
And you bring in someone
new, and they're like, wow,

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.180
you really had a party that
time in high school, huh?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.880
Your parents are really
still obsessed with that.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.540
And it actually
doesn't always do this,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.573
but it often will destroy
the original memory.

00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:20.490
There's actually not a
lot of tangential stuff

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.490
I remember besides what
I wrote, after a while.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.290
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.170
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah, sorry.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.540
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
We want to know!

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.332
SLOANE CROSLEY: But
it's not even a bummer.

00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:29.610
It's just literally because--

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.470
but that's why I'm
careful with what I pick,

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.540
and not because about
exposure or what

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.060
I'm willing to sacrifice to
this or anything that noble.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.440
It's just that--

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.027
I don't mind, because I feel
like when I wrote these essays,

00:19:41.027 --> 00:19:42.360
I really took my time with them.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.902
And I thought, OK,
I'm going to get--

00:19:43.902 --> 00:19:46.170
I'm going to squeeze every
angle I can out of this one

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:46.840
experience.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.923
So I don't think there's
a massive amount of stuff

00:19:48.923 --> 00:19:49.740
I'm missing.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.980
But every once in a
while I will forget--

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.640
like, there's a
lot of stuff that

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.740
happened in Ecuador
that I vaguely remember,

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.853
before and after throwing
up on the glacier.

00:19:57.853 --> 00:19:59.520
SPEAKER 1: Were there
essays in the book

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.835
that took you a lot longer
to complete than others?

00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:03.210
SLOANE CROSLEY:
Yeah, definitely.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.987
Well, also, I mean, technically,
they're essays about childhood.

00:20:06.987 --> 00:20:08.820
So if we want to start
the firing gun there,

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.320
they've taken me 30 years.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.190
So I don't know how to--

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.383
but then there's one about--

00:20:14.383 --> 00:20:16.050
there's a pretty big
one towards the end

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.360
about the pressure for
motherhood and fertility

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.130
and freezing your
eggs and should you

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.040
have a kid and women
judging other women and all

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.720
those goodies.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.540
And that took a long time
to sort of percolate,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.930
because I wanted to be--
usually it's a topic

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.460
that I feel has been heavily
tackled by other people,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.380
and I also have
something to say.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.980
But I don't want to
dwell on it, and I

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.105
want to get in and get out.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.272
So the last essay in "How
Did You Get This Number?",

00:20:41.272 --> 00:20:43.650
which is the second book, is
really one of the only books

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.525
I've ever written about
men and relationships

00:20:45.525 --> 00:20:47.160
in this incredibly
concentrated way,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.630
because I thought, I don't
write about this stuff.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.690
I'm just going to
write the mother of all

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.860
this kind of thing and get out.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.764
[MICROPHONE FEEDBACK]

00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:56.120
Ooh, that was a little loud.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.030
Sorry.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.220
SPEAKER 1: Speaking of
the fertility essay,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.890
what do you think of
egg freezing becoming

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.210
sort of part of the zeitgeist?

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.010
And did you feel like that
had been written about a lot,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.010
and you wanted to bring
your unique perspective?

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.590
And then obviously having
a first-person perspective.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.120
What do you think
about all of this

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.660
now as it becomes
more and more popular?

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.000
SLOANE CROSLEY: I mean, I
almost have no thoughts,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.950
except for the fact
that it's a good idea

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.300
and you should do it
if you want to do it.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.800
I wouldn't say it's
like a cure-all.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.670
What happened to me--

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.500
I had no intention of--

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.580
freezing my eggs
became the locksmith

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.293
pointing with the pen in a
way, because all of the stuff

00:21:36.293 --> 00:21:38.460
had been swirling around
in my head for a long time.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.770
But I didn't think I was going
to write about it until I

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:49.890
got a tremendous amount of them
and broke the hospital record.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.178
And that's lovely in some--

00:21:52.178 --> 00:21:53.720
SPEAKER 1: Broke
the hospital record!

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.320
SLOANE CROSLEY: --in
that I am a fish.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.777
But the issue is that I had
all these complications.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:00.360
And then what became
interesting to me

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.930
is how self-conscious I
became, even now repeating it

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.680
outside of the page, that
it sounds like the worst,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.450
most obnoxious
humblebrag for people who

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.540
are desperate to have
children, to say this, and go

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.980
through the expense and the
physical commitment to do it.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.030
And that's when I really
thought about writing the essay,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.680
because I was like,
this is insane.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.340
It's arbitrary.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:23.850
It's math.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.160
I have no control over it.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.410
And yet I feel extremely
judged for either what

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.890
I do with this information.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.760
And so that was almost
like an anger essay,

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.695
to be like, all right,
everybody calm down.

00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:37.070
SPEAKER 1: Well, it's a really
unique perspective, right,

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.945
because usually all--

00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:39.528
SLOANE CROSLEY: And
it's also really--

00:22:39.528 --> 00:22:41.190
medical stuff is so
fun to write about.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.060
SPEAKER 1: Is it?

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.928
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh my god,
it's so fun to talk about.

00:22:44.928 --> 00:22:45.470
I don't know.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.790
I'm probably-- if
we were friends,

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.390
I'd come home and be
like, look at this thing.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.540
What do you think it is?

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.750
And I just find that
stuff really interesting.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.270
I find interactions with
doctors very interesting,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:02.100
because they can be so
flat, because they see--

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.840
if you go to a
specialist especially.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.590
There's an essay where
I talk about having

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.960
this weird inner ear disease.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.760
And this doctor is
so unimpressed by how

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.020
I'm spinning and falling
down and all this stuff.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.610
And I think, well, of
course he's unimpressed.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.110
The last person who
came in probably

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.740
had their nose in their pocket.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.920
There's such a strange--

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.878
I just find them so
interesting to write about.

00:23:22.878 --> 00:23:24.870
I find all medical
stuff interesting.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.310
SPEAKER 1: In some ways,
it's bittersweet when

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.390
you have an ailment because--

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.930
SLOANE CROSLEY:
Oh my god, then I

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.710
get to see some weird doctor
who has no social skills,

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.350
and I can fillet him or her.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.223
Yeah.

00:23:34.223 --> 00:23:35.640
SPEAKER 1: So
you're a New Yorker.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:35.970
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:36.440
SPEAKER 1: So that's exciting.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.150
So you talk a lot in the
book about your experience

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.350
as a New Yorker.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.650
I think we've talked a little
bit about universality.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.200
What is it like to try to
bring that into your books,

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.890
to always bring in how
you live, what living here

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.560
is like, and trying to
make that relatable?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.390
How does that
process work for you?

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.223
SLOANE CROSLEY: I mean,
maybe this is like--

00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:04.150
maybe I'm so far gone in the
sort of New Yorker solipsism

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.610
thing, but I just
don't feel like--

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.010
I mean, that is like
the one effortless thing

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.030
about all this, because
we live in a microcosm

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.600
of the entire planet.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.470
So there's also so much stuff.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.777
So it's that on one side, and
the fact that it's not like--

00:24:20.777 --> 00:24:22.360
I feel like it would
be less relatable

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.710
if I was in some sort of
really homogeneous city.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.430
But then the other side of that
is that I just feel like we

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.420
tend to flatter ourselves
into thinking that there's--

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.063
you know, the "only in New
York kids" kind of thing.

00:24:37.063 --> 00:24:37.730
That's not true.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.000
People have incredibly
awkward interactions

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.420
with their boss in Minneapolis.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.020
They hate their
neighbors in Kansas City.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.920
SPEAKER 1: Not great.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.720
SLOANE CROSLEY: We're not
that special snowflakes.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.470
You know, it's just
that there's a flurry.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.828
It's just that we're on
top of each other so much.

00:24:51.828 --> 00:24:53.620
And so I'm not saying
there's not something

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.580
very special to New York.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.530
It obviously permeates
the entire collection.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.090
But it's so funny.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.745
I never think of myself as
a New York writer, the way--

00:25:02.745 --> 00:25:05.370
let's say, I don't know, Joseph
Mitchell was a New York writer.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.037
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:07.000
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.680
SPEAKER 1: Well, we're glad
you're in the neighborhood.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.230
SLOANE CROSLEY: Thanks.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.730
I am.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.100
I live very close to here.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.590
SPEAKER 1: So another
chapter in the book,

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:19.150
you were a guest star on
"Gossip Girl," which I watched.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.080
You say you weren't
their first choice.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.460
SLOANE CROSLEY: No.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.570
SPEAKER 1: Do you know who
was their first choice?

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.850
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.300
Would you like to know?

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.130
SPEAKER 1: You
guys want to know?

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.797
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah,
there's this essay

00:25:28.797 --> 00:25:30.040
where I just quit my job.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.010
I'm just setting
up a little bit.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.040
And they basically had
a-- they needed an author

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.460
at a book party, at some
sort of fancy book party.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.120
And their first choice
was Fran Lebowitz.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.340
And she was like,
I'm not doing this.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.355
And I took it.

00:25:43.355 --> 00:25:43.620
SPEAKER 1: But you--

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.460
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, I had
no hesitation whatsoever.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.690
SPEAKER 1: Were you
a fan of the show?

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.260
Did you watch it?

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:47.770
SLOANE CROSLEY:
Not even, really.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:48.940
I just thought it
would be so fun.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:49.780
SPEAKER 1: And was it so fun?

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.980
SLOANE CROSLEY: It was so fun.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.800
Yeah, it was really fun.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.260
It was also just a-- but it
was a strange-- but again,

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.540
that's a good example, though,
of something that would be just

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.770
a cocktail party story--

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.900
hey, this thing I did once.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.233
That's a pretty good one, right?

00:25:59.233 --> 00:26:00.383
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:26:00.383 --> 00:26:02.800
SLOANE CROSLEY: If it weren't
for the fact that I had just

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.310
quit my job in publishing
to write full-time,

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:08.600
and I was playing a
writer on the show.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.860
And everybody
treated me, frankly,

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.000
like I was Fran Lebowitz.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.540
And it was so strange,
because I wasn't comfortable--

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.420
I think the first people I told
who said, oh, what do you do,

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.500
or what are you doing?

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.083
The first people I
said the words "I'm

00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:26.980
a writer" to were probably Blake
Lively, because you're testing

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.625
it out on a stranger almost.

00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:30.250
So that essay is
really about identity,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.110
because I was also
playing myself.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.003
So it becomes this bizarre
sort of Russian doll.

00:26:35.003 --> 00:26:37.420
SPEAKER 1: Did you have a
little bit of imposter syndrome,

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:37.937
where--

00:26:37.937 --> 00:26:38.770
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.970
Well, also because I was--

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.460
the line as I'm
introduced in a way

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.140
that no one at any
book party would ever

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.470
be introduced, where
an agent comes over

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.640
to a group of the cast, and
it's Chuck and his parents.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.767
And they say, this
is Sloane Crosley.

00:26:54.767 --> 00:26:57.350
She's the best-selling author
of "I Was Told There'd Be Cake."

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.000
And I'm like, oh my god, how
do I dispose of my own body?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.120
No one would ever say that.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.270
And then I actually had to say
a grammatically incorrect thing

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.350
in response, which is "Of
which I am still in search of."

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:16.380
But I didn't want to correct
them because I was a guest.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.160
So I said this thing.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.030
And then I ran off.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.180
And that was really the extent
of my acting experience.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.000
SPEAKER 1: Do you wish you
would have corrected them now?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.180
Do you wish you would've
been like, "you know what--"

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.555
SLOANE CROSLEY:
What's funny now,

00:27:23.555 --> 00:27:27.150
now knowing a little more,
having worked a little more

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.530
in Hollywood, and knowing
actors and knowing

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:34.580
how fluid that is really, yeah,
I do wish I corrected them.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.580
SPEAKER 1: What else are
you doing in Hollywood?

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.660
You mentioned you're doing
[INAUDIBLE] screenwriting?

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.618
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, no.

00:27:38.618 --> 00:27:40.920
I have a couple pilots
that are in the works.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.290
SPEAKER 1: That's exciting!

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.207
SLOANE CROSLEY: It is.

00:27:42.207 --> 00:27:44.953
But it's also-- with a book,
you sign a contract and a book--

00:27:44.953 --> 00:27:46.870
it's like, you can't be
a little bit pregnant.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.080
Book comes out the other end.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.020
But you can be a little
bit pregnant in Hollywood.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:57.860
So Universal bought the
rights to "The Clasp,"

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.040
which is a novel I wrote, and I
wrote the screenplay for that.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.040
And honestly, all this
stuff could lead nowhere.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.210
But it's fun.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.440
And frankly, it's lucrative.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.300
So it's nice.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.140
SPEAKER 1: That's always nice.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.990
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.300
SPEAKER 1: And there
were rights for "I

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.530
Was Told There Would Be Cake"?

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.550
SLOANE CROSLEY:
Yeah, there were.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.900
I mean, I don't think anything's
going to happen with it.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.010
That book came out forever ago.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.330
And now, it's also interesting.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.120
There's so much-- you sort of
watch other things and other

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.680
art forms sort of--

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.597
I mean, not surpass
it in quality.

00:28:23.597 --> 00:28:24.430
I stand by the book.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.200
But in theme, right?

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.630
It's like, OK, we've heard
of this kind of thing now.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:33.710
And so it's a very pleasant,
on to the next experience.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.885
SPEAKER 1: So being at Google,
one of the essays that I

00:28:36.885 --> 00:28:39.260
thought was most relevant--
maybe you can guess which one

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.300
it is--

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:41.810
was--

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.580
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.440
SPEAKER 1: --was-- what
do you think it is?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.430
SLOANE CROSLEY: I think
it's the domain name one.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.680
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, that's right.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.815
So you had your domain
name stolen on--

00:28:51.815 --> 00:28:53.960
I mean, the web can
be a very dark place.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.793
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:28:54.793 --> 00:28:57.320
SPEAKER 1: This is not Google's
fault or anything involved.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.150
We're making the
world a better place.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:58.942
SLOANE CROSLEY: No.

00:28:58.942 --> 00:29:00.025
This in no way reflects--

00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:04.250
SPEAKER 1: But you went-- you
had your domain name basically

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.067
held hostage.

00:29:05.067 --> 00:29:05.900
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.367
SPEAKER 1: And you decided
to go meet this person--

00:29:08.367 --> 00:29:09.200
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.933
SPEAKER 1: --and to hunt him
down and to confront him.

00:29:11.933 --> 00:29:13.850
SLOANE CROSLEY: It was
my favorite dark alley.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:14.480
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.063
Well, apparently you
like dark alleys.

00:29:16.063 --> 00:29:17.840
You just told us
about Mexico too.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.640
What did you learn
from that experience?

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.380
Do you think the
laws should change?

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.420
What ended up happening?

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.100
This seems like such
a bad thing that's

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.550
happening to so many people.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.237
How do we make this better?

00:29:28.237 --> 00:29:29.820
SLOANE CROSLEY:
There's almost no way.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.430
SPEAKER 1: There's no way.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:31.930
SLOANE CROSLEY:
Because what happens

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.953
is, if you let your
domain name expire,

00:29:34.953 --> 00:29:37.370
which sort of happened to me--
well, this is embarrassing.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.920
OK, so what happened was
that I gave GoDaddy--

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.600
so let's start there.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.850
OK.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.460
They were my host, or my
registrar, or whatever.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.510
And I mean, I started my
website in 2007, right?

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:58.377
And so in 2007, my backup
to my backup email address--

00:29:58.377 --> 00:29:59.960
so maybe this isn't
totally horrible--

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.210
was a Hotmail account.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:06.770
It was already on its way
to graveyard status then.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.070
And then what happened was,
when my domain name was going

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.410
to expire, which
I didn't realize,

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.380
GoDaddy kept sort of knocking
on the door of this abandoned

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.000
house and saying
it's going to expire.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.450
We're warning you.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.200
We're warning you.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.560
But it didn't matter to me.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.450
I didn't live there.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.252
And so they're sending all
these emails to Hotmail.

00:30:23.252 --> 00:30:23.960
I don't get them.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.940
All of a sudden, one day,
my email stops working.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.065
And that's the other thing.

00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:29.390
My email's connected to it,
which is why this happened.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.370
So basically, it turns
out that someone has

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.438
bought, in the aftermarket--

00:30:33.438 --> 00:30:35.480
which is like purgatory,
it's like the afterlife.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.300
In the aftermarket, someone has
bought, at auction, my website,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.330
and has this algorithm that
to me seems kind of nasty,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.590
because he's not searching for
traffic, which makes sense,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.360
but he's also searching for
the duration of ownership.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.970
So I look like
what I am, which is

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.590
someone who's lost the family
heirloom and wants it back,

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.040
right?

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.010
So this guy does
this for a living.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.580
His name is Wesley Perkins.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.190
I offered to change his name.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.390
He didn't want me to,
because he had a bit of a--

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:06.760
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.940
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh yeah.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.010
I think he likes the attention.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.617
And so I--

00:31:10.617 --> 00:31:12.200
SPEAKER 1: Until
they change the laws,

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.290
and then he's going
to be like, the next--

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.415
SLOANE CROSLEY: And so a
magazine actually sent me,

00:31:16.415 --> 00:31:17.427
and I flew over.

00:31:17.427 --> 00:31:18.260
I was like, I want--

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.625
I took a screenshot when
he owned my information.

00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:23.250
I wrote him-- after I paid him
a bunch of money to get it back.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.868
And I wrote him and
I said, you know,

00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:27.410
you might remember me from such
instances as five seconds ago

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.710
when I paid you
a bunch of money.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.590
And I wanted to talk to him,
to figure out why he does this.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.730
And it was really interesting.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.160
It was a really
long conversation

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.743
we had about morality,
and it ended up

00:31:38.743 --> 00:31:40.593
being a really interesting
essay to write,

00:31:40.593 --> 00:31:43.010
and one I definitely took notes
on while it was happening.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.640
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.515
Can you tell us a little
bit about the cover?

00:31:45.515 --> 00:31:48.470
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah, the
covers always are sort of tonal.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.490
I really find--

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.220
I think there's something
really graceful and beautiful

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.710
and a little sad but also a
little funny about that bird,

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.127
because I'm not
sure if it's dead.

00:31:56.127 --> 00:31:58.170
It's probably dead.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.020
And it sort of
dovetails, if you'll

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.790
pardon the pun, with the title.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.273
And so yeah, that's really it.

00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:06.440
I mean, it's the same thing.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.070
And they're all like that.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:08.060
They're all a little weird.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.602
You know, I mean,
"I Was Told There'd

00:32:09.602 --> 00:32:12.522
Be Cake" has a dirty
floral mattress on it.

00:32:12.522 --> 00:32:13.730
There's no cake on the cover.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.100
SPEAKER 1: Which is
what you asked for.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.570
SLOANE CROSLEY: Kind of.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.910
SPEAKER 1: You were like, I
want a dirty floral mattress.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.470
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah, I actually
did ask them-- it's funny.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.803
I am very happy with that cover.

00:32:19.803 --> 00:32:21.737
It's now become really
sort of connected

00:32:21.737 --> 00:32:24.320
to the title in a really great
way, because the book did well.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.260
But I remember asking them
at the time, I'm like,

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.630
can we mess it up, like,
put some stains on it?

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.560
I wanted it worse.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.418
SPEAKER 1: Because I think it's
hard, because these essays--

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.960
you know, I mean, "The Clasp,"
it's very clear what the clasp

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.080
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.190
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah, that
one's more obvious, because--

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.840
SPEAKER 1: But when you
have this essay collection,

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.757
you're first of all
trying to title your essay

00:32:40.757 --> 00:32:43.070
collection, right,
and then figure out

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.360
what visually represents it.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.000
And the title here too,
how did you sort of--

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.083
SLOANE CROSLEY: "Look Alive
Out There" is-- again,

00:32:49.083 --> 00:32:50.440
because I always try to avoid--

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.120
in fact, I have successfully
avoided titling any of them

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.697
one of the essays in the book.

00:32:54.697 --> 00:32:56.780
I just always think with
short stories and essays,

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.642
it puts a strange amount of
pressure on that one piece.

00:32:59.642 --> 00:33:00.350
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.558
SLOANE CROSLEY: So yeah,
there is a piece in the book

00:33:02.558 --> 00:33:05.217
that I think is the best piece.

00:33:05.217 --> 00:33:06.050
SPEAKER 1: There is?

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.400
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.890
SPEAKER 1: Are you going to tell
us which one you think it is?

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.300
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yeah,
it's "Outside Voices."

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.710
SPEAKER 1: "Outside Voices."

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.377
SLOANE CROSLEY: It's
about my neighbors.

00:33:11.377 --> 00:33:11.958
I go crazy.

00:33:11.958 --> 00:33:13.250
That's the one I like the best.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.910
Not like cute.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.125
Oh, that's cute!

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:17.880
But really like illegal crazy.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.850
Please buy the book.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:19.850
SPEAKER 1: OK, question.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.060
SLOANE CROSLEY: Next!

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.810
SPEAKER 1: Please.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.400
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes, please.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:22.930
Hi.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:23.930
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.980
First of all, thanks for taking
the time to come visit us.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.870
My question is, I
was wondering what

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.590
is kind of your writing process,
especially when you're working

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.500
through cases where the
essay is not coming out

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.660
the way you expect or planned?

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.050
How do you work
through that phase?

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.050
SLOANE CROSLEY: Well,
thank you for thanking me.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.675
You're welcome.

00:33:45.675 --> 00:33:48.120
Thank you guys for having me.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.910
I think that I do skip around a
little bit if I'm really stuck.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.350
I try not to do that in general.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.420
I'm not good at--

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.680
I think for fiction more,
maybe, I'll write like,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.615
OK, this chapter isn't working.

00:33:59.615 --> 00:34:01.490
I'm going to move on
and start this other one

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.660
and go back and fix it.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.989
But essays are more
one train of thought.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:12.949
I mean, generally
what I do is try

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:15.685
to go in another door
for the same topic.

00:34:15.685 --> 00:34:17.060
I just feel like
I try to rewrite

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.350
the beginning a little bit.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.400
And then if that doesn't
work, I take a walk or a nap.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.190
I eat cheese.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.639
I mean, until you
become unstuck.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:29.747
I mean, and if it's that
stuck, then again, it's

00:34:29.747 --> 00:34:31.580
almost like the parking
ticket conversation.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.869
If it's that stuck--
there was an essay that

00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:34.687
was supposed to go
into this book about I

00:34:34.687 --> 00:34:36.020
jumped off a cliff in Australia.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.062
I'm not really like that.

00:34:37.062 --> 00:34:38.000
I don't know why--

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.370
but-- there was water.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.920
But I-- yes.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.100
Very important.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.050
But it just didn't-- it wasn't--

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.570
it just didn't seem
that special to me.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.677
It just didn't seem that
funny or entertaining.

00:34:49.677 --> 00:34:50.219
I don't know.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.761
It's really hard to
actually tell you

00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:52.820
what the litmus test is.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.290
But very few times do I just
whole-stop abandon something.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.412
It usually gets repurposed.

00:34:59.412 --> 00:35:00.620
But I'm not above doing that.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.420
But mostly I rewrite
the beginning.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.980
AUDIENCE: My question is--

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:08.137
well, YouTube being
what it is today,

00:35:08.137 --> 00:35:10.220
the way people are entertained
has changed a lot--

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.260
podcasts, YouTube videos.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.075
Has your process
changed on evaluating

00:35:15.075 --> 00:35:16.700
the measurement of
how people are going

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.992
to be entertained by your work?

00:35:17.992 --> 00:35:20.187
Has that changed over maybe
the last five, 10 years?

00:35:20.187 --> 00:35:21.020
SLOANE CROSLEY: Wow.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.040
Yeah, am I sort of factoring
in people's attention spans?

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.632
AUDIENCE: Yeah, kind of.

00:35:25.632 --> 00:35:26.840
SLOANE CROSLEY: I try not to.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.520
I'm sure I am, though.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:35.510
I'm sure I am, because
I tweet, tweeted, twit.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.710
And I've even made--

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:43.820
for the novel, I made
a book trailer with--

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.407
I mean, it was a full trailer.

00:35:45.407 --> 00:35:46.740
Like, Amanda Seyfried was in it.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.270
It was not-- and her dog.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.180
And it had a whole premise,
which is that the dog has read

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.320
the book and she hasn't.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.898
And she's a bad
book club member.

00:35:55.898 --> 00:35:56.440
I don't know.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.430
It was weird.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.898
But a friend of mine who
directed it was like,

00:35:59.898 --> 00:36:01.940
no, we have to make it
shorter, shorter, shorter.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.550
I'm like, it's a
minute and a half.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:08.870
And I feel like I sort of
straddle, either consciously

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.030
or even generationally,
some sort of line

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.850
where I understand
your question.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.880
I know that it's a problem,
or that it's just different,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.520
how people digest things.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.160
But I also tend to be
super-old-fashioned

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.690
in my humor.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.090
I write about topics like--
yes, like egg freezing

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.530
and I don't know, drugs.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.350
But I tend to
approach it from a--

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.780
I have an older
fan base sometimes.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:40.550
So I tend to try to
avoid putting things

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.920
into sound bites,
as is demonstrated

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.938
by the length of my
answer to your question.

00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:46.926
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:46.926 --> 00:36:48.410
SLOANE CROSLEY: Thanks.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.210
AUDIENCE: Coming
from publishing,

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.470
I have two questions.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.970
You can pick and choose maybe.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:57.680
But first, do you feel like
you have a catbird seat of what

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.750
you need to have happen in order
for your book to be successful?

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:08.810
And also, just like, help,
how do we fix publishing?

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.540
Do you have ideas for
this dying industry

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.650
that is so important
for the world right now?

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.520
SLOANE CROSLEY: Well, it's not--

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.690
OK, so I do have a
catbird seat, but not when

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.490
it comes to the most
important part, which

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.490
is creating the book,
writing the book,

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:29.750
doing anything that could
be construed as art.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.510
That seat's dangerous to have
anyway, even if I had it.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.333
You don't want to
think about if this

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.000
will be successful
for a certain reason.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:37.760
Or maybe you do.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.090
I don't know.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.910
I mean, it depends.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.175
If you're trying to
follow some formula--

00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:42.050
you know, it's funny.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.160
I did an interview
with "The Guardian"

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.450
I remember a few years ago.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:45.825
It was more than
a few years ago.

00:37:45.825 --> 00:37:46.870
It was like 10.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.920
And they asked me if I
was trying to identify

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.180
a marketplace with essays.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.070
And I said no.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.840
If I was trying to
identify a marketplace,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.280
I'd write about Abraham
Lincoln or vampires.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.990
And this is before
the book came out.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.580
And so I'm like, wow.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.640
I really messed up.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.790
It's the pull quote
from that piece too.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:11.900
But your question about
how we fix publishing,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.390
I don't think it's that broken,
any more than the record

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.820
industry is broken or any
other industry is broken.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.410
I mean, there are
wonky things that

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.910
shouldn't work that do work.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.700
It's like how bees
aren't supposed to fly.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.310
They're not
genetically-- physically,

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.480
their bodies are too
big for their wings.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.730
They shouldn't be able to fly.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:29.840
But they do.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.850
And similarly, for
some reason, it

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.540
makes sense to send an
author on a book tour.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.260
But I mean, books,
independent bookstores

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.290
are doing extremely
well right now.

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:47.340
Online is sort of a
different problem.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.080
But I don't know.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.170
I mean, it's really hard.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.128
I mean, when I first
worked in book publishing,

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:54.723
I had this rather sort of naive
maybe idea that I was like,

00:38:54.723 --> 00:38:56.890
oh, it's so great, because
I know so many people who

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.473
are incredibly intelligent, but
they work in other industries,

00:38:59.473 --> 00:39:02.330
and they don't read, and I'm
going to get them to read.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.160
And then I realized
how hard it is

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.870
to get people who
do read to read.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:10.490
It's impossible to just
get them to buy the books.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.490
So I don't know really
what the answer is,

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.800
except for to
continue to support

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.280
the few literary breakout books
that happen that aren't just

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.570
crap, and just hope that
people think to themselves,

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.270
there's more where
that came from.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.410
Thank you.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:29.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.030
I have a question.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.480
When you're writing
nonfiction, to what extent

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.860
do you tell the
stripped-down, raw story,

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:44.180
or embellish it for the
aspect of the storytelling?

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:49.910
SLOANE CROSLEY: I mean, I
sort of lean towards hyperbole

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.060
and towards analogy.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:56.480
So obviously the first essay
in this book, there is--

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.430
I'm waiting on a street
corner for a cab,

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.070
and there's a woman in a
wheelchair and a guy standing

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:01.700
next to her.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.575
And of course, this cab
comes with the sliding doors.

00:40:04.575 --> 00:40:06.950
And I'm like, OK, even though
I was here first, I'm like,

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.710
you guys obviously take it.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.400
And they're like,
thanks so much.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.510
And the guy leans down the
wheelchair and kisses the woman

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:19.160
and hops in the cab,
and then she wheels off.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.330
And I'm like, holy shit.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.710
Sorry.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.530
And I said, I have
a line where I say,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.230
obviously this is the worst
person to have ever lived.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.330
Probably not.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:30.920
I mean, number eight, maybe.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.840
But I just feel like, I guess--

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.030
so in that sense, very much so.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.710
It's my style, right?

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.560
But in terms of
telling the truth,

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.650
I'm really close
to the hole, which

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.600
is a golf term I don't own.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.590
But I get as close
as I possibly can,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.670
because I feel like I don't
know why people are doing this

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:53.782
otherwise.

00:40:53.782 --> 00:40:54.740
And I'm not trying to--

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.160
I'm completely abstractly
shading a lot of people

00:40:59.160 --> 00:40:59.660
right now.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.270
But yeah, this is the
truth of what happened.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.800
And it's only for
technical reasons

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.565
that things tend to get shifted.

00:41:08.565 --> 00:41:10.940
So the essay I said I really
liked about my neighbors who

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.905
were these sort of hellions,
that's probably the biggest

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:16.280
lie in the book, because that
essay is in the past tense,

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.670
and I still live
in that apartment.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.140
But they graduated.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.480
And they did not go
to NYU, I don't think.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.860
But the point is that
I do it because I

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.520
feel like I-- when
I have to, there

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.520
is embellishments in that way.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.737
But otherwise, it's pretty
close to what happened.

00:41:34.737 --> 00:41:35.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.360
SLOANE CROSLEY: Thanks.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.680
SPEAKER 1: Any last questions?

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.610
I have a few.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.163
Oh, we have one.

00:41:41.163 --> 00:41:43.580
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
if I understood right, you

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.843
said you're adapting "The Clasp"
for television and whatnot.

00:41:47.843 --> 00:41:49.760
I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.500
about the kind of screenwriting
and about adapting

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.620
your own work for
a different medium.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.910
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.820
Yeah, so basically,
it's for film.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.720
And it's weird because at
first, it's unpleasant,

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.535
because obviously these came
out as essays for a reason.

00:42:08.535 --> 00:42:09.660
Like, I don't write poetry.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.493
I don't write songs.

00:42:10.493 --> 00:42:13.580
You wouldn't want to see them.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.703
But so at first, it
felt kind of weird.

00:42:15.703 --> 00:42:17.120
Like, haven't I
already done this?

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.607
And I'm not a great actress.

00:42:18.607 --> 00:42:20.190
I'm like, I already
delivered it once.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.210
I can't just do it
again, you know?

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.020
And then what happened was I got
to restructure and honestly fix

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.510
everything that I felt
was wrong in the novel.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.030
So for that reason
only, I kind of

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.900
hope it gets made one
day, just because it's

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.430
like an apology to myself for
not fixing that to begin with.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.183
Yeah.

00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:41.600
SPEAKER 1: You
mentioned somewhere

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.190
that you want people, when
they're reading your book,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.567
to feel like they'd found
their other old man Muppet.

00:42:45.567 --> 00:42:46.400
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.610
SPEAKER 1: You know
what I'm talking about?

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.890
SLOANE CROSLEY: Still
my-- what are their names?

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.172
This is horrible that I
don't know their names.

00:42:50.172 --> 00:42:50.520
SPEAKER 1: Oh, it's, um--

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.200
SLOANE CROSLEY: Something--

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.760
SPEAKER 1: Statler and Waldorf.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.260
SLOANE CROSLEY: I
love this crowd.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:54.950
Yeah.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.167
Statler and Waldorf.

00:42:56.167 --> 00:42:57.000
SPEAKER 1: Is that--

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.975
so that's how you--

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:58.850
what were you saying?

00:42:58.850 --> 00:42:59.960
Tell us what you--

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.370
SLOANE CROSLEY: Well, that
"stuck in the middle with you"

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.210
feeling, right?

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.000
I mean, that's the thing, is you
want to read essays, especially

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.420
if they're personal or they're
narrative, and connect to them

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:13.030
and think not necessarily
that you want to curl up

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:17.843
with the author, but that you're
facing the same direction.

00:43:17.843 --> 00:43:19.510
You've got the bar
seats, not the table,

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.760
where you're just sort of
facing the same direction,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.810
and that feeling you
have with someone,

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.420
whether it's a friend,
boyfriend, girlfriend,

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.455
whatever, partner, where
you meet eyes across a table

00:43:30.455 --> 00:43:32.830
when someone said something
ridiculous at a large dinner.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.400
And you almost can't look at
them because you'll lose it.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.280
And that's the goal
for the essays.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.530
SPEAKER 1: So does that make--

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.840
so people who read
your book probably

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.060
feel like they're
already your friend.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.770
They already-- you said before,
people know so much about you.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.730
And it's an uneven
playing field.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.140
SLOANE CROSLEY: It is an
uneven playing field, yeah.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.970
SPEAKER 1: That is
part of your charm,

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.830
right, is that people
think, oh, we're friends!

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:52.915
I read all of her books.

00:43:52.915 --> 00:43:54.040
I know all of these things.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.748
SLOANE CROSLEY: It
does happen like that.

00:43:55.748 --> 00:43:58.580
I will say, since we're
sort of wrapping up,

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.780
just that there is another
version of myself, which

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.580
is I was once on the subway.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.350
I'll end with a New York story.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:05.970
I have a prop.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:06.637
This is so good.

00:44:06.637 --> 00:44:07.510
I'm going to use it.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.130
I was on the subway,
and this woman

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.690
was reading my second book.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.890
And she was sitting
directly across from me.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.012
And you know, not on a
e-reader, so I can actually

00:44:15.012 --> 00:44:15.970
see what she's reading.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.320
E-readers have spoiled half
the spying in New York,

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.542
and judging.

00:44:20.542 --> 00:44:21.500
But she was doing this.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.090
And she seemed totally
just really ensorcelled

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:26.950
by the language.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.920
And I was like, this is so cool.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.920
Like, do I say anything?

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.847
What do I do?

00:44:30.847 --> 00:44:31.930
And she does one of these.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.760
And she goes, [HEAVY SIGH].

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.510
Like, the check
of the binding to

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:39.513
see how much longer she
has to slog through it.

00:44:39.513 --> 00:44:40.930
And I was like,
then I felt really

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.888
like, this is going to
be really awkward if she

00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:45.207
recognizes me and wants
to talk to me about it.

00:44:45.207 --> 00:44:46.540
SPEAKER 1: So you scurried away.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.998
SLOANE CROSLEY: So
I scurried away.

00:44:47.998 --> 00:44:49.675
It was that or trip her.

00:44:49.675 --> 00:44:50.740
But I scurried away.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.740
SPEAKER 1: And my last
question is, what's next?

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.980
I mean, you're very prolific.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.020
You're doing a lot of things,
and it takes a lot of time,

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.520
obviously.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.660
Probably your next
essay collection

00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.550
we won't see for a
while, because you

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.000
have to build up these stories.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:01.510
SLOANE CROSLEY: Yes.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:02.100
SPEAKER 1: Right?

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.040
SLOANE CROSLEY: True.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.040
SPEAKER 1: So read this
one, and read it slowly.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.030
But what's next?

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:09.970
What can we expect
to see from you?

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.492
SLOANE CROSLEY: Probably a
novel, if it ever gets done.

00:45:13.492 --> 00:45:14.950
But honestly, at
the rate the novel

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.880
is going, maybe the essays.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.380
A book.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.797
It's not going to be, like, a
diorama that I come up with,

00:45:19.797 --> 00:45:20.650
or a puppet show.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.315
It'll definitely be a book.

00:45:22.315 --> 00:45:23.440
SPEAKER 1: It'll be a book.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.010
SLOANE CROSLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:24.880
SPEAKER 1: It's a book, guys.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.040
SLOANE CROSLEY: Front to
back, bound, little price.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.420
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so,
so much for being here.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:29.920
Everyone--

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.340
SLOANE CROSLEY: Thank
you for having me,

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.715
and thank you for
your questions.

00:45:31.715 --> 00:45:33.490
SPEAKER 1: Please go
out, buy, and read

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.660
"Look Alive Out There."

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:35.950
It's great.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.230
And let's thank Sloane one
more time for being here.

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.840
SLOANE CROSLEY: Thank you.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840
Thank you for having me.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.940
This was so nice.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.790
[APPLAUSE]
