Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y Weiss,

Speaker 2:          00:05          c e n n p. R.

Speaker 3:          00:14          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:15          Hey, I'm jabbing rod and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab in the couple of days ago as in like seven we uh, we were on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the big opera house there. It's a really beautiful theater and it was full of more than 2000 people. We were part of something called Radio Love Fest.

Speaker 3:          00:32          Brilliant

Speaker 1:          00:36          radio. OFS is a big public radio broadcasting radio lovey thing that w NYC station here puts on. Basically it's a parade of all these amazing public radio shows and podcasts. We opened the festival and since it was called radio love fest, we figured we would use the opportunity to basically talk about the community of people around radio lab that we love, the producers, the musicians, we features amazing acts like so percussion who you're hearing. A lot of stuff happened and we told a lot of stories today. We're just on this podcast. We're gonna [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:08          play two stories for you. These are both stories about love and about heart. The last one, which you'll hear is a, is an exclusive interview with Oliver Sacks. Basically giving a kind of valedictory interview. It's pretty wonderful. But first we decided to do literally a look at a heart. This comes from our producer Molly Webster. It was scored live by a, so percussion, which is Eric Chubb Beach, Josh Quillin, Jason Trudy and Adams Lewinsky. Oh. And some people in the audience in the theater audience had a pretty strong reaction to what you were about to hear. And we're not so sure that that might not also be the case if you're just listening. So if you are driving or you're operating machinery, maybe this isn't the best piece to listen to because it can get a little intense, which we'll talk about a little bit afterwards. Uh, in the meantime, here's producer Molly Webster.

Speaker 2:          01:59          So this is a story about a friend, summer ash. Uh, we used to work together and I think it's fair to say that summer has a complicated relationship with her heart. You know, my heart was not beating

Speaker 5:          02:12          for three hours is a really crazy thought. Yeah, I was technically,

Speaker 2:          02:23          I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:26          So a couple of things to know about summer. She's like wicked smart. She's an astrophysicist. She uses a lot of big words, propulsion, center of gravity and moment of inertia, x and Y, Z axis. Do you remember that original like radial keratotomy like no, I don't even know what that word is. The other thing to know is she's an engineer, right? So she loves like take things apart. You sort of like coke around rewire, ratchet. You got a ratchet. And so the thing to know is when she found out she had to get heart surgery, she made sure there was someone in the operating room with a camera taking pictures of my open chest cavity and the valve and when things were cut and when things were being sown in. Yeah, I totally approached this completely as a scientist. I want to know what's happening. I want to know why.

Speaker 2:          03:17          I want to know what you're doing. I want to know what's going on around. Yeah. And in any case, to sort of back up and explain, um, summer was just following up on like a heart diagnosis that it had happened. About 15 years earlier. And so she had been diagnosed with a murmur, which is basically just like a funny sound in your heart. And that's like a wash in between the thump, thump, thump, thump. And in summer's case she had been told it's no big deal. And so this was just a followup appointment to make sure nothing had changed. And so she goes to the doctor, she, they run a few tests and then they send her on her way and a few weeks later she gets an email saying don't panic, but I think you should see a heart surgeon.

Speaker 6:          04:02          So

Speaker 2:          04:05          it turns out the situation with her heart had changed her aorta, which is like the largest artery coming out of her heart. It was larger than it should have been. So it's supposed to be about two centimeters in diameter. And in summers case it was five. Yeah. What does that mean for your bodies? So that's the thing. It's a seven dometic. It's not actively harming you, but it's a threat to your life because if it ruptures, it's your main blood vessel. And if it goes, you bleed out internally so fast that no er can help you. Her doctor says go find a heart surgeon. And in the meantime, no heavy lifting or contact sports in summers. Like, well I live in New York, like living in New York as the contact sport. Yeah, I was gonna say if people crash into you all the time. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Six months later, summer finds herself on the operating table. They actually, um, I think, I'm not sure the exact order of operations, but they cut open her sternum from the bottom all the way up to the top and then they just like, oh, the rib cage so they can get at her heart. They put some sort of fluid on it that stops it from beating and they actually sort of just inject that fluid into the heart and that short circuits it so your heart actually stops and then they hook you up to a bypass, a heart lung bypass machine. And one of the things that does is it drains the heart of all it's blood. And so it's like flat, like a pancake. And you can see pictures of all of this on her blog. You can even see pictures. It's true. You can even see pictures of the a surgeon cutting four inches out of her aorta and replacing it with a synthetic tube and the entire time summer's heart is just lim in quiet.

Speaker 3:          06:03          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:04          Eight hours later she wakes up.

Speaker 3:          06:06          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:06          What do you remember about your first conversation with your doctors? Oh, I don't remember my first conversation much, but I do vividly remember my first thought part of my friends was,

Speaker 3:          06:18          fuck, this hurts.

Speaker 2:          06:24          Just mind altering pain.

Speaker 7:          06:27          Oh my God. Eight hours ago I felt so much better than this. Can we just go back to that now? Like, no, I don't want this. You know, everything pulls on your torso and so when your sternum has been cut open and then reconnected, everything that pulls on that hurts and you can't move anything or lift anything.

Speaker 2:          06:46          It hurt to talk. It even hurt to breathe,

Speaker 7:          06:50          but literally from day one they make you stand up and start walking. Really. I was like, she was like, we're going to get you to sit and shower. I was like, no, no, we're not. What are you talking? What are you smoking? And that's just to, that's just to basically, you just got to get the heart going again, you know, just get it healing.

Speaker 2:          07:14          But here's the thing, when it came back, it came back with a vengeance. So to be fair, her recovery went really well. About two months in, she's in cardiac rehab, the pain is fading. She's thinking about sending her mother home. Her mom had been staying with her for awhile and then one day she's in cardiac rehab on the elliptical machine. And so I remember stopping and I had, um, this white tee shirt that would literally like just be fluttering

Speaker 3:          07:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:49          with my heartbeat. Like it was blowing in, in high wind or something. And I was like, well that's interesting. You mean that you could see it? Oh yeah. Yeah. Even the physical therapist there could see it. What do they do? They do. You mean like you would look down and you would see the thing, your heart beating through your chest wall, pushing your shirt? Yeah. Off your chest. Well because I'm a lady, there was a gap here. So like that sort of, there's a space for that vibration to happen, so to speak. But then she goes home and it was still happening, like just sitting on her couch, not even working out. She's like, Whoa, my heart is strong. It just felt so strong that I, part of me was like, am I going crazy? Like is it as strong as it seems like it is? Because if it is, surely this is making a noise. So one day, a few months after surgery, she goes to upstate New York, she's visiting some family friends and she's hanging out with their daughter Julia.

Speaker 8:          08:51          She walked in and we were standing in my room,

Speaker 2:          08:56          you're just chatting. And then suddenly Julia's eyes get really wide.

Speaker 8:          09:00          And I was standing there just, oh my gosh, I just to skirt it.

Speaker 2:          09:05          She could hear summer's heart out loud two feet away from her in the room. And I was like, okay, this is happening. Uh, so I guess in typical summer fashion, she's Kinda like, let's engineer that. If a friend of mine can hear it with their ear and what could a studio pick up? So she grabs her radio producer friend, they go to a studio and he sticks a Mike about six inches in front of her chest. And this is what they recorded.

Speaker 3:          09:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:46          this is not a stethoscope. This is what it sounds like. If you were standing at quiet room next to summer, God, that's strong. What does that feel like? It just feels as if my entire rib cage, my clavicle, my sternum, my whole chest cavity is acting like an amp. And it's sort of transmitting the vibrations of each heartbeat in physically in my body to feel each RP. Yeah. Do you feel it right now? Yeah. You can just feel that thump. Thump. Yep. It feels like somebody has a rubber mallet and is banging on the inside of my store and it's very staccato.

Speaker 2:          10:43          She goes back to the doctor, she's like, dude, my heart. So he sort of just did some like listening and some feeling [inaudible] you know? And his reaction to was like, yeah, that's strong. So we run some tests and he's like, listen, your blood pressure is fine. All of your stats are fine. So I guess I did a really good job. Yay. Good for you. But, but okay. I guess I have a strong heart. Yay. Strong heart. But I don't want to feel this all the time. The doctor was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I don't freak out. This will go away. It's probably just that there's scar tissue on your sternum and it's transmitting the vibration and is that goes away. The sensation should fade. He said sometimes six to nine months is when maybe the Scar Tissue Heals more thins out. So she's like, all right, nine months.

Speaker 2:          11:34          Oh, I can get to that. That's no problem. So she sorta just settled in and treated it like a scientific curiosity, like a party trick. If I went to, um, a restaurant where they had like tables for two, but they weren't like the sturdiest of tables. If we had water glasses on them and I, I sort of leaned on the table, like the water glass would look like Jurassic Park. Like my heartbeat would be like the footsteps of the Toyota Sys. Yeah. So that was like my party's drag. Do you had six months of elation party trick and then, yeah. And then it stopped being a party trick it sounds like. Yeah. What happened and I'm not really sure like you know incident wise, I think for me it was just time passing cause that nine month mark just came and went and it was still there and when she asks her doctor, he has no idea why. So 12 months still there, 15 months it's still there and she says it just started getting really annoying if it's distracting. The, the funny thing was the more active I was than the less aware of it I was. But she says when she was at her office trying to be still be still to either be writing something, writing emails, planning lectures, that's when it would be like

Speaker 5:          13:05          really loud. That's when it would become the most dominant thing. Like I, I couldn't go to work because it just kept drawing my focus and when it did it would just fill her with anxiety.

Speaker 2:          13:19          It was sort of this like automatic response, and I'll try and explain it, but it's basically like when you get scared, it goes into your brain and then the signal goes down into your body. So you step on a snake and your brain is like, oh my God, it's a snake run, body run, and then your heart pounds. In Summers case, it was just the opposite. There was no snake, but her heart was pounding. So her brain would be like, Whoa, why is my heart pounding? Oh my God, is there a snake? There must be a snake run body run in her heart would pound. My brain keeps thinking something must be wrong because we're having, we're already doing this, so something must be wrong, so I guess something's wrong. So let's freak out. She was caught in this feedback loop and then she was like rightly so, edgy and primed that any emotion on top of that, like even if it was happiness, was just too much. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Nights. It would keep me awake. I would focus on it.

Speaker 9:          14:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:16          I would get into hearing the rhythm, feeling the rhythm

Speaker 9:          14:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:21          yeah, sort of with the expectation of just

Speaker 9:          14:23          next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. Next one. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          15:00          with every beat. Our hearts are just literally tapping out time and I mean researchers have actually thought about this and there was this idea that was proposed like a right before the dawn of sort of modern heart surgery that we each get 1 billion beats in our lifetime and then that's it. And most of us don't notice them going by, but in summer's case she can't not notice it.

Speaker 2:          15:23          Yeah, I'm aware of it all. It's never not there. It's never not noticeable that maybe it's just like this constant awareness of the future that summer is endlessly meditating on. My heart takes over and I can't do the things that I want to do and not knowing if that's going to last forever or if it's going to end suddenly or if it's just going to Peter out. The not knowing gets to me.

Speaker 5:          15:56          So she stopped going out as much and she stopped returning phone calls except for like a few close group of friends.

Speaker 2:          16:03          Times were just being curled up in bed and just crying. It really wanted to yell at my heart, shut up. Stop. Which you really talk to your heart. Well, I mean I would never had conversations but I would be like shut the fuck up. But it wouldn't. And as time went on, like the constant pounding, it just became unbearable. She just

Speaker 5:          16:35          scribes it as like this alien creature. It's like trying to just claw it's way out

Speaker 9:          16:42          the bottom of my neck. [inaudible] fine.

Speaker 5:          17:17          But there was this one moment right in the middle of [inaudible], middle of

Speaker 2:          17:21          all of this. She had her two year checkup postsurgery and for that they had to take a picture of her heart. So I schedule my two year appointment and to look at her heart, they do an echocardiogram, which is basically, you know like the ultrasound like that you get for the pregnant. Oh it's like a wand. Yeah. It's like a little, a little wand and you get the jelly and they basically go all over your upper, you know, the area around your heart and from all different angles. So what ended up happening is I'm lying on my left side and I'm facing the wall and the technicians behind me and the technician is sort of like reaching around her, waving the wand over her heart and the monitor for the echocardiogram is behind summer so she can't see it, but she's wearing eyeglasses. So you know how you can sometimes like see a reflection, a peripherally on your glasses of something that's like behind you. Like if you are in a somewhat darker room, there was a window, like you would totally see the reflection. So the room's a little bit darkened. Summer's lying there on her side and she sees the reflection of the screen, um, on my glasses and it catches your eye because it's moving and then I realize what it is that I'm, I'm seeing a tiny reflection of her heart beating and I have this like moment

Speaker 3:          18:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          18:38          I have this moment where I'm like, oh my gosh your, I'm like talking to my heart and in my head going, well we had your working hard. Like you're trying your hardest, you're doing the best that you can. I'm, I'm doing the best that I can. You're in there and you're working and you are working for me and we are on the same team and I just totally like, I just silently start crying.

Speaker 3:          19:06          No

Speaker 2:          19:06          like what do you think spurred that on? Like what was it about seeing it or there's just something about physically seeing it but feeling it at the same time. Like knowing that I'm seeing what's happening inside me that somehow just like clicked this understanding into place.

Speaker 5:          19:28          She said there was something about seeing it in real time, like feeling this thing in her chest, just pulsing in rhythm with what was happening on the screen and then suddenly it just, it didn't seem separate from her anymore. And all of those worries about the future and what was going to happen and wasn't going to go away and every, she's just stopped. She was just like,

Speaker 2:          19:49          no, you are just beating and that beating is me. It was sort of, it was sort of like this moment of, of recognition of its purpose and its work and, and sort of this, so it's kind of like that whole idea of when you feel like you see somebody not just physically, like you see who they are, you see what they are, but you see who they are. Like I had that, like I felt like I see you heart, like I see what you're doing, I see what your purpose is. I see. I see you.

Speaker 5:          20:25          On the one hand, what she sees like with her engineer's brain is, oh I get you. You're just a pump. And it's that same, you know, realization that essentially led to modern medicine. Right? Like the minute we took the soul out of the heart, we were willing to touch it, to cut it open, a stitch it up to start fixing things. And now we have lifespans by some estimates are 2.5 billion beats. But on the other hand, like when you hear someone's heartbeat, your parents or your child's in that beat is an entire lifetime. It's a, it's a history of beats. It's a series of beats yet to come. And I don't know, thinking about all that, I just, I just sort of got walloped at the end of this interview. Um, when summer asked us if we wanted to try and listen to her heart.

Speaker 1:          21:20          Can we try that? Just see you. Do you want to, yeah, let's just move the mic or I'll stand up or something. So she stood up from her chair and she sort of put her chest right in front of the mic and then we all just got really quiet. Okay.

Speaker 3:          21:36          Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          21:51          Oh my God. Wow. It's this made, it makes me really emotional. Every time I hear it, it makes my eyes, well it's here. It's really amazing. I guess I still got kitchen art. You Go. Yeah. So give it up for Radiolab producer Molly [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          22:22          [inaudible] and give it up the soap for,

Speaker 10:         22:26          yeah. When you said earlier that a lot of people in the audience had a strong reactions, usually we met, I mean I don't know if you could tune this in, but like

Speaker 1:          22:34          when we were doing that story I just definitely seem like something's going on out there. I couldn't tell cause we were on stage, I couldn't, you know, this is their 20 I definitely was tuning in. There's something going on in the audience, something going on side stage, but I didn't really know what it was. We were in the middle of it walk off stage and the first thing we hear is that numerous people had fainted, even vomited during that piece. We were like, what? Seriously? I did not see a coming. No, we were really, really scared at first and I thought, oh my God, am I, am I killing people? What just happened. I'm like, like it was just like, I was like, were they old? Were they young? Like what? Like why were young, they were young and that made me like, oh okay.

Speaker 1:          23:12          They feel like weirdly a little bit better. Maybe they can handle it. And yeah, I just was, and then I, it was kind of weirdly mortified. Terrified. But after we figured out that no one was hurt, we were like, we got, we were like, we would, we do start putting out and we started making some calls cause we were like, what was that? What did we make of that? What is that good? I didn't know you. So the show is over and we all go home. This is days after this is days and you're thinking, oh my God, we're going to, yeah, cause I'm thinking we've got a podcast, this damn thing, right? We have to, we have to understand this and say something that's completely right. So the first person we called a was a psychiatrist,

Speaker 11:         23:46          Rachel Yehuda, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry.

Speaker 1:          23:51          I explained to her the basic situation that that some people had fainted and felt woozy. We weren't quite sure how many,

Speaker 11:         23:56          five or six people out of 2100,

Speaker 1:          23:59          somewhere between five and a 12. We don't have a, a clear number just yet.

Speaker 11:         24:05          That's very interesting.

Speaker 1:          24:06          Do you have any sense of what might've caused this? Just like a guess.

Speaker 11:         24:10          So my best guess about that would be that they have activated their parasympathetic nervous system in response to hearing the heartbeat.

Speaker 1:          24:19          Yeah. Just to explain. Our autonomic nervous system is divided into a bunch of different parts. You've got your sympathetic nervous system, which is sort of your fight or flight, right? Sweat turns on when you're scared and then you got your parasympathetic nervous system, which is sort of the opposite. Rather than getting you ready to fight or run, it makes you calm. And Dr you Hooda says it in certain people that parasympathetic response can actually kind of go overboard and there lud pressure can drop quickly too quickly and they end up fainting.

Speaker 11:         24:49          Now, the most common, um, stimulus for this to happen in, in real life is failing at the sight of blood. Some people just do that and it's not that common about two to 4% of the population have this kind of a response. And we don't exactly know why it happens. There is some opinion that the idea of fainting when you see blood, is it an adaptive evolutionary response

Speaker 1:          25:18          that you know, maybe back in the day when we were being chased by predators, it would have been a good idea to faint

Speaker 11:         25:22          because maybe the animal will think you're dead.

Speaker 1:          25:24          Then he'll skip you. He wants a live meat and you're dead meat. Exactly. He sees you laying there and he's like, I don't want to eat that. What he bet. Another theory is this isn't also an evolutionary one, is that if your blood pressure drops like it does when you faint, well that kind of protects you a little bit because you'll have less blood in your arms and legs. So if your arms and legs get bitten by a lion, say, then you're less likely to bleed out. Mm. Let me see. So there's nothing, there's nothing juicy to suck on if your blood is on not in your wing or your limb. Yeah. And basically, I mean, who knows, these are just stories, but going back to the two or 4% thing, we got to thinking two to 4% of our audience that night would be, what do we decide Molly was like 40 people, 44 to 88, 44 to 88, 2100.

Speaker 1:          26:12          So we put out some emails, uh, looked at the incident reports and I think now we have identified how many, what do we get to for us, we've heard of maybe 10 or 11 at this point, 10 or 11 net. But I think that based on some of the stories that are coming in that the number might actually be much higher than that cause it was, um, for example, it just manifested itself physically in a way that I could not have imagined a would be the case. This is Maria Checo who, uh, actually works the street from us, uh, for the company that makes Latino USA. I was sitting in the front, uh, against one of the walls, but not right at the wall. She says, uh, she was listening to the story. Everything was fine at first, but then she says, as the beat kept going, she began to worry, what if it never stops?

Speaker 1:          27:02          What if summer never gets away from it? And, and then the drumming got more intense and it was just like, oh no, oh no. And it was definitely the sense of being trapped that the thing that was giving her life, which was absolutely necessary, was also the thing that was tormenting her. And she says that she was thinking about that. She just kinda got short of breath. And so I looked at my husband and put my hands up like I like, I gotta go. And he, he looked at me, he was like, are you all right? And I was like, I shook my head like, no. And um, and I, and then I had the talk in my brain like, okay, this is an intimate radio moment. You are right in the front area. If you get up six people have to get up with you, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          27:47          You're ruining this for everybody. Just breathe and it'll be fine. And then the deeper I tried to breathe, the more anxious I sort of got like, oh, and I had this fantasy of like standing up and doing like a room to wiggle it out of me. But I was like, that's just to suck it up. And so Jeez, look at that. I'm having trouble breathing just thinking about it. [inaudible] I don't want to put you back there. No, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. But that's why my hunches at there might be a lot more than 10 because uh, maybe a lot of people just sort of pushed through and didn't get up. It still felt weird. In any case, one of the most interesting things that we bumped into is that Dr Yehuda told us it's very possible that the fainting and the wooziness. Okay.

Speaker 11:         28:32          He's some kind of an empathy response.

Speaker 1:          28:35          Really. In what sense?

Speaker 11:         28:37          Well, if you hear somebody's heart beating and you're aware that that's what you are hearing, it might arouse a tremendous connection within you of hearing the very source of their life. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:51          I became her. I did. I just, I was there with her

Speaker 11:         28:55          can really be a lot to take in and you feel a little faint or emotional.

Speaker 1:          28:59          I just identified so much with somebody being trapped in their own body. It's like she couldn't escape. It was beating in my chest. Wow. The drums I felt were beating in my chest and in my crazy fantasy. You know, maybe they were breathing at the same rhythm. One of the people that emailed that to the live show said that he felt like his heart was trying to match her beat and he couldn't catch his breath. I don't know. I haven't, I don't know. It's never happened to me before. No. Wow. I asked her in the end if she'd ever want to hear summer's heartbeat again and she said, oh yeah. In fact, she said she was going to listen to the story as soon as it was podcasts, which is now because now she's got all these questions like was it the acoustics of the space or the fact that she was with so many people or maybe it was the volume cause it was pretty loud and will I feel the same when I hear it, you know, with my headphones on or you know, while I'm driving we'll, I have that feeling. So I had already decided that I was definitely going to listen to it again. We'll let you know what happens.

And this next store you'll hear some references to some pictures, which obviously you won't be able to see, but we've got them for you@radiolab.org um, so we want to finish the night with a salute to a guy who's been on our program and part of our family pretty much from the beginning. I have known him for more than 35 years. Early on when Radiolab started, I asked him if he'd help us out and send us a few story ideas. He didn't send us a few. He sent us bushels, tales of chemistry and medicine, hallucinations, music

Speaker 4:          32:39          people, so many extraordinary people that he knew or found or help cause the guy just doesn't run out. Dr. Oliver Sacks.

Speaker 3:          32:55          [inaudible] is a guy who

Speaker 4:          32:56          he notices everything. He's deeply interested in. Everything that happens around him and to him. And tonight we're bringing him back on tape for what Alaska may be his final offering for us. As many of you know, Dr Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver cancer and he wrote about this in the New York Times. He said he plans to spend the time that he has, uh, left writing being with friends, not doing interviews, but he did agree to share his thoughts exclusively with, with us tonight for you gathered here. Um, cause he's one of our family. So as I've done for decades now, I went over to his house in Manhattan with my Mike and I said to him, I just need to know like what, what just happened a month and a half ago. You were fine. And then what? Um, at the beginning of the year I was fine. On the 3rd of January, I felt a little queer and I pass some dark here and I thought I had a little gallbladder attack and um, didn't pay that much attention but thought I better get things checked. And um, the extra way, which was expected only to show a couple of gallstones, showed hundreds of cysts in my liver.

Speaker 13:         34:13          Uh, although my doctor said he didn't know what the, his, what and I would need further tests, I, I knew what they were. I said, it's happened

Speaker 4:          34:23          and he was right. The doctors eventually confirmed that a cancer that had been found in his eye nine years ago had spread to his liver. Where you frightened or relieved or console or what, what? No, I,

Speaker 13:         34:41          I think my first feeling was one of of overwhelming sadness. Um, there are all sorts of things I will see. Um, and I won't do one or two people have written to me in the know consoling me and said, well, you know, we all die, but fuck it. It's not like we all die. It's like you have four months.

Speaker 4:          35:07          Has that has your pro, what is your prognosis at this moment? Cause I know you had an well it's, it gets revised. It depends on of course on how the cancer responds to treatments and or how quickly it spreads so far. Um,

Speaker 13:         35:21          the metasticies from my eye, I only in my liver I'm told they love liver actually I love liver as well and one of the magical things I did was to go and have live one on the sued often the backers and thinking

Speaker 4:          35:37          that liver looks better than mine. See this is what he's like instead of being frightened by the thing is trying to kill him. He's thinking about loving liver and liver lovers and looking for connections and wondering and he doesn't stop. He, he just notices that the case in point a few months ago, his doctor said to him, we're going to run a, a line up your liver and in effect we're going to try to shave off a starved some of the cancer cells first on one side then on the other to see if we can give you a little more time. But they warned him as the metasticies die. They um, put out various unpleasant chemicals that may exhaust you, tax your system badly. And um, at one point, shortly after the procedures, I started talking a little strangely and um, as I was talking I was also writing, um, you'll be the first person to see this.

Speaker 4:          36:27          So he showed me a notebook and we're showing it to you in just a moment and you can see they're sort of writing there on the left. It's all, he's writing a book, actually a children's book about the elementary table. But as he was writing, if you, if you look to the next page, if you can see that it gets a little bit wobbly, the letters and then, and then there was some crossing out there. Yes, I see. And then La, the dramatically, the lighting changes it actually there is, there's a large slash across it and then you, it seems a little incoherent at the bottomless. Okay. And then it turns to pure scribble that has delirium and crept up on me. All this happened over the course of 10 minutes and I see what he's doing here. He's figuring, okay, I'm riding at a constant speed.

Speaker 4:          37:17          I know pretty much how fast I right, and so I can time this out. I can figure out exactly how long it took me to slip into delirium and then out of this delirium and he's doing this very, very sick man. It's science. The time to write it out in a more medical way. I think this would form a lovely illustration. You put in a timeline of delirium just coming like that. Why aren't you more frantic? Unusual for any doctor and as a man of science, you don't seem to worry at all. When things become incoherent or strange, you're now showing it to me as if like, Ooh, how interesting. I was crazy here for a little bit. The truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind. No matter how strange it gets up there. At one time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike.

Speaker 4:          38:05          And by the way, I should show you what he looked like back then when he was driving his bike. This I think is him in New York, a kind of, you know, in the 60s he was also a champion weightlifter. They called him Dr Squat. And in this picture that you're showing you here, that's him raising 600 pounds in order to win a trophy. Like this is a, he was a champ and, and you can see more pictures like these cause we have signed copies of Oliver's new memoir out for sale in the lobby. It's pretty good book too, by the way. So in any case at this time, and then 1960s in addition to being all muscled out, Oliver was a serious recreational drug taker. And because he's Oliver, he was extremely curious about his highs and no matter how weird they were, one time, for example, he took 20 pills that he shouldn't have. And then

Speaker 13:         38:56          to my surprise, um, uh, there was a spider on the wall which said hello.

Speaker 4:          39:04          It had a voice like Bertrand Russell, the famous mathematician

Speaker 13:         39:08          and the term it asked me a while, the technical question as to where the Russell had exploded free egos paradox. And um, we had this conversation, you answered the spider a shoe I onto the spine discussed fragrance paradox with this minor, I didn't deed cause you, you trust your perceptions. Okay. Many years later when I mentioned this to an entomologist fed at Cornell and the philosophical spiders said yes, he said, I know the species.

Speaker 4:          39:39          So thinking Oliver's way, taking it all in, talking spiders, whatever the generosity of his curiosity becomes profoundly moving and transformative when he's treating his patients. I want to tell one story here really quickly too, to demonstrate what I mean. I'll ever once had a patient whom he called Mrs o c she was an old woman. She was 88 years old living in a nursing home and one night she was awakened, jarred awake by a loud,

Speaker 14:         40:08          I wish it was assault

Speaker 4:          40:17          and she thought, well, somebody's left the radio on. But when she looked, the radio in the room was off, her roommate sound asleep, which was odd because the song was really loud. [inaudible] after that there was another song.

Speaker 14:         40:34          Ah,

Speaker 4:          40:34          and then another song

Speaker 14:         40:36          who is at home

Speaker 4:          40:38          misses Mrs. She thought, well, maybe my roommate can't hear these songs because the songs are, are coming through the fillings in my teeth. I've heard that's possible. But no, her doctors told her, this is something in your head, you need to see a neurologist, which led her to Dr Sachs.

Speaker 3:          40:54          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          40:55          At when he met Mrs he, she could barely hear him. The song sung by the female voice were coming and coming. She was frightened and justifiably worried that she was going crazy. But Oliver said, no, no, no, I'm going to do some tests. And when he was done, he said he'd found a slight stroke or condition that had triggered musical epilepsy. These sudden production of music in her brain. Now a normal doctor might say, okay, we've got the diagnosis, and he thought that the songs would probably fade and it will pass. So they would be done. But Oliver did not stop. He doesn't stop

Speaker 3:          41:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          41:28          he kept talking to her. She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born. Her mother, when she was only five

Speaker 13:         41:38          often alone, she was sent to America to live for the welder for beating maison. And she had no conscious memory at the first five years of her life, no memory of her mother of Ireland. She had always felt this as a key in and painful sadness, this lack or forgetting at the earliest, those precious years of her life.

Speaker 4:          42:00          So we asked her about the songs, what are they like and Mrs. She said, well, I, I think they're lullabies. Can you sing them for me? She did. And then after checking with, I'm not sure who al ever figured out that these songs were happened to be popular Irish ballads from the 1890s when Mrs OSI was a little baby. And that gave him an idea. Now what he does next isn't science. It isn't in any traditional way medicine. He just told her a story and it goes like this. You know how nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three? Well, there was a theory once, not honored much today, but it's sad that those earliest memories get locked away, deepen our brains in a special safe, and we can never open. So let's suppose Mrs Ossi, you're stroked by some crazy chance, open the lock that none of us can break and released those first memories in you just for a little while so that the voice you're listening to

Speaker 14:         42:57          there is a home [inaudible] great. Then Mo,

Speaker 4:          43:02          maybe that isn't a radio voice. Let's thing that it's your mother's voice. That's your missing mother. And so at the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms. You get to be a baby again. And Mrs OFI thought about that and said, okay,

Speaker 13:         43:20          it sort of fits. I'm an old woman with a stroke in an old people's home, but I feel I'm a child to Ireland. The Gate, I feel my mother's arms. I see her, I hear her voice singing,

Speaker 14:         43:33          the green it clean.

Speaker 9:          43:39          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          43:41          Shortly thereafter, the songs began to fade. The pauses widened. Mrs Ossi had been so frightened by this music in her head was now sorry to see the songs go. But it was Oliver who noticed how those songs had touched her, who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does. He listens closely, he can hear another person's heart. And this is really the profound puzzle for me of Oliver because reading the new autobiography, you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life and in the relationships that really mattered, it turns out he didn't get a whole lot of affection. He was, for a long time, a lonely guy. I'd say he was very lonely. And he's talking about that now for the first time. Let me, let me talk about love for a minute. Um, in this book, you tell the story of, of your very

Speaker 13:         44:32          first love a fellow by the name of Richard Sell it. Can you just tell me what happened with him? Um, yeah. Um, he was a road scholar at Oxford and I'm a poet and handsome and beautiful beyond belief and I sort of fell for him. Um, although I didn't say anything because I was, um, uh, very haunted by my mother's accusations. But did your mother, um, well to go a couple of years back then my father had opened the conversation that I was about to go to ops for that and I've sort of father, son conversation and he said, um, you don't seem to have many girlfriends. And I said, no, wishing the conversation would stop. He said, um, something wrong with girls. And I said, no, that they're fine taps, you prefer boys. And I said, well, yes I do. I said, I've never done anything but I do.

Speaker 13:         45:37          And then you knew that then I knew that then I had known it for six years, probably since I was 12. Um, and I said, don't tell mom she will be able to take it. But my father did tell my mother and the night and the next morning she came down with them. I somehow wants to say a face of Fonda and raged at me, and among other things said, you're an abomination. I wish you would never been born. And then she suddenly shut up and said nothing for three days. And um, uh, the matter was never mentioned again in her lifetime. And then two years later I found myself for the first time in my life falling in love. And this was the gun guy, Richard Oliver at the time was in college. It was a very positive feeling where I didn't know whether it was one, which I did express, but I did say so with my heart and my mouth to each other.

Speaker 13:         46:39          But what did you, you remember what you said? Uh, I said, I'm in love with you and we should gripped me by the shoulders. And he said, I know. He said, but I'm not that way, but I love you in my own way. And I was glad I had said that. I'm glad that it had been received in such a warm, friendly way. I thought we might be friends for the rest of our lives, but then one day he came into me, he said he'd been bothered by finding a lump in his groin and he was worried could I have a look at it and I looked at it and I felt it and it was hard and tethered turned out to be a particularly malignant form of lymphoid. Timo was called a lympho sarcoma and he never spoke to me again after that. I don't know whether since I'd been the first to recognize the ominous import, I don't know whether he saw me as a harbinger of death or messenger of death, whatever.

Speaker 4:          47:41          But you were left with the, with that silence. Yeah. Yeah. A few years later I'll ever met and man named Mel, he was a young, he was a sailor like Oliver. He was into weightlifting. They became close friends and they began living together.

Speaker 13:         47:55          I adored him and was in love with him and loved physical contact with him

Speaker 4:          48:01          and they'd work out and they'd wrestle and ride motorcycles kind of tightly and they never talked about what might or might not be happening between them. But one day they were together and Oliver was giving mil a back massage, which mill often asked him to do. And uh, I love doing that. And Oliver says sometimes he'd get a little, you know,

Speaker 13:         48:19          excited. And so long as I gave no explicit indication it was okay, but, but, but one day things went a bit too far and I got sort of, um, I went over the bridge instead of just before the pink, um, mental immediately sort of got up and had a shower and said, I, I can't stay with you anymore. And um, I found that very cruel and upsetting and heartbreaking and it made me feel, I don't want to have anything to do with people. I must have fallen in love. I cannot share life's with anyone again.

Speaker 4:          48:58          And he didn't share his life with anyone for a long, long time. In fact, he told me a story about something that happened to him maybe eight years ago.

Speaker 13:         49:10          I, I was just joining the faculty at Columbia and I was having this one interview and one point the interviewer said to me, she said, I have something rather private to our school. We do like Ms Edgar, your assistant to leave. And I said, no, she's privy to all my affairs. And I then set thinking she was going to ask me about six. I said, I haven't had any sex for 35 years. I bet. In fact, when she was going to ask me my social security,

Speaker 3:          49:43          okay,

Speaker 4:          49:43          and she burst into laughter. She said, Oh, you poor thing. She said, we must do something about it. Well, the truth is Oliver didn't do anything about it because he didn't think he could. I mean, he chosen, Richard lost, Richard Chosen Mail, lost mail. It was the point he was thinking. And then finally, and who knows when or why these things happened to people. But a man came along who for the first time chose Oliver. I have made met

Speaker 13:         50:10          Billy is I meet a number of people because I'd been sent a manuscript or proof for book and I'm an intimacy group between us. I don't think I quite realized how deep it was. But then there was a particular episode Christmas

Speaker 4:          50:28          of Oh nine when he came up and in s

Speaker 13:         50:33          serious way, he has a serious careful when he said, I I have conceived a deep love for you. I have conceived the deep love for you. Yeah. Um, that isn't sort of, that's like a few extra words I have concealed. Okay. Was He scared to say I love you or um, no, she likes the English language. I think it, I think it couldn't have been put, um, more cautiously and yet more strongly. I think it was a beautiful way of putting it. And then I realized at that moment with his saying that, that I had conceived a deep love for him and I am among other things, I thought good has happened again,

Speaker 9:          51:27          two

Speaker 13:         51:28          and I'm in my 77th year. Um, and, and what next and things, um, basically have gone happily ever since.

Speaker 9:          51:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         51:47          and surprisingly look Lesley. Um, because then again I'm not dealing with a, what I'm dealing with a hoop, I'm dealing with an individual. I, I'm not dealing with a um, uh,

Speaker 4:          52:06          well a condition defined by medicine or law. So Oliver's still doesn't know how much time he has left. But for the moment, as you can hear, his mind is totally intact. He's still writing. He has two books in addition to the one you'll find in the lobby that he's writing and the children's book, bunch of New Yorkers stories in the last few months and a New York Review of book story. He's got energy to spare. So I want to do one last thing before we close. And this comes from yet another conversation I had with him and it's a story I know Oliver would hate because he's not a capital I or religious kind of guy, but he is somebody who definitely embraces mystery. And for a long time he's been mystified by a color called Indigo, indigo, which Newton had inserted between blue and violet. And no, no two people seem to agree as to what indigo was like. And so I built up a sort of chemical launchpad, meaning he took a lot of

Speaker 13:         53:07          base of amphetamine from general arouse or then some acid and a little cannabis. And when I was sufficiently stoned, I said, I want to see indigo now as if it were reply and does. It's fallen by a giant paintbrush that appeared a huge trembling, pear shaped blob of what I instantly realized was pure indigo on the white wall in front of me.
