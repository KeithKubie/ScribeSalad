00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.720
 
well there's a lot to achieve I think

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730
well there's a lot to achieve I think
 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.070
well there's a lot to achieve I think
this is a really important thing

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080
this is a really important thing
 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.160
this is a really important thing
although although the media because this

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170
although although the media because this
 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.750
although although the media because this
is all over the media these days you can

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760
is all over the media these days you can
 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.440
is all over the media these days you can
feel like it's here it's not we're still

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
feel like it's here it's not we're still
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.690
feel like it's here it's not we're still
it's very fringe it's not fringe in the

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
it's very fringe it's not fringe in the
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.420
it's very fringe it's not fringe in the
media but the reality of the actions is

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
media but the reality of the actions is
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.360
media but the reality of the actions is
very fringe you know the meme is much

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370
very fringe you know the meme is much
 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.000
very fringe you know the meme is much
larger than the reality and so if you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010
larger than the reality and so if you
 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.880
larger than the reality and so if you
look at just cars as an example you know

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
look at just cars as an example you know
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.270
look at just cars as an example you know
hybrids are a few percent like 34 % like

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280
hybrids are a few percent like 34 % like
 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.490
hybrids are a few percent like 34 % like
that like really really low so I think

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500
that like really really low so I think
 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.060
that like really really low so I think
that being that the meme is larger than

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070
that being that the meme is larger than
 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.250
that being that the meme is larger than
the reality we've there's a very long

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
the reality we've there's a very long
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.979
the reality we've there's a very long
way to go and we're really like most of

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989
way to go and we're really like most of
 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.330
way to go and we're really like most of
the way we do things is roughly similar

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
the way we do things is roughly similar
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.310
the way we do things is roughly similar
to the beginning of the Industrial

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320
to the beginning of the Industrial
 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.880
to the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution like we're very inefficient

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
Revolution like we're very inefficient
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800
Revolution like we're very inefficient
about how we do things and so it's a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
about how we do things and so it's a
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.960
about how we do things and so it's a
it's a big process of us learning to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
it's a big process of us learning to
 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.820
it's a big process of us learning to
look at the world in a different way and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830
look at the world in a different way and
 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.850
look at the world in a different way and
and and do things in a very different

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860
and and do things in a very different
 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.040
and and do things in a very different
way so we have a long way to go so I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050
way so we have a long way to go so I
 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.080
way so we have a long way to go so I
think planet green will the being planet

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090
think planet green will the being planet
 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.240
think planet green will the being planet
green and tree hugger will tree hugger

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250
green and tree hugger will tree hugger
 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.990
green and tree hugger will tree hugger
will serve to inspire and educate and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000

that's happening on a global basis
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.390
that's happening on a global basis
regularly and planet green will help to

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400

or expensive easy or difficult or quick
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.020
or expensive easy or difficult or quick
or time intensive we're going to help

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
or time intensive we're going to help
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.850
or time intensive we're going to help
people take action we're going to break

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860
people take action we're going to break
 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.130
people take action we're going to break
down for people so they can really take

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140
down for people so they can really take
 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.050
down for people so they can really take
that next step and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060
 
 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.850
 
there's a lot that week we can do so

there's a lot that week we can do so
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.880
there's a lot that week we can do so
means so part of it is just knowledge

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890
means so part of it is just knowledge
 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.300
means so part of it is just knowledge
now people understanding a big part of

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
now people understanding a big part of
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.229
now people understanding a big part of
it is is breaking it down for people so

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239
it is is breaking it down for people so
 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.020
it is is breaking it down for people so
I know people are busy and this is for

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030
I know people are busy and this is for
