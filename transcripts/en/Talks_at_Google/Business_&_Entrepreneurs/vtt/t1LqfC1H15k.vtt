00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.241
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.860
SPEAKER 1: I'm really
excited to welcome

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.520
my dear friend and mentor,
Nely Galan, to Google.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.870
NELY GALAN: So happy to be here.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.770
My god, it's--

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.724
SPEAKER 1: So
Nely's really, truly

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:19.890
a force to be reckoned with.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.690
She's one of the
first Latina producers

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.460
in Hollywood, former president
of entertainment at Telemundo.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.545
She is the Latina Tyler Perry.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:29.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.290
NELY GALAN: She's got it done.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.700
SPEAKER 1: And really excited.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.160
Today, she's a media mogul on
a mission to empower others.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.920
And so I want to take a chance.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.890
If it works, we're going to play
a little sizzle reel that will

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.420
tell us more about her journey.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.510
So really important for us to
show that because, again, I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.559
would not be able to do Nely's
journey justice in terms of all

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.600
that you've accomplished.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.964
So that collection of your
story is absolutely amazing.

00:00:56.964 --> 00:00:57.880
NELY GALAN: Thank you.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.080
SPEAKER 1: And what we're
here to talk about today

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.400
is "Self Made."

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.940
So it's entrepreneurship
manifesto

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.700
that is a "New York
Times" bestseller.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.190
So really applaud you for
that because there are,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.040
how many Latinos
that are bestsellers?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.930
NELY GALAN: Four Latinas in
history, and three of them

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.425
are dead celebrities.

00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:18.800
And I think that we have to
understand that "The New York

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.350
Times" is a big, and having
a "New York Times" bestseller

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.390
is very hard to do.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.610
You have to sell x
amount, so many books.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.920
It's a lot of books.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.400
And so we have to be able to
buy things in mass together

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.840
to reach those numbers.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.480
For me, it was like
climbing Mount Kilimanjaro

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.360
and very important to me
because how thought leaders are

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.290
made in America are through
"The New York Times" bestseller.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.440
I have to say that the day
that I met you and Iliana,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.160
who I love from
Google as well, we

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
had an event together with
women of Silicon Valley,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.470
with Sheryl Sandberg.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.680
And then I had you ladies,
because I was so proud of you,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.600
I said I felt like
a proud mother,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.770
to see you how
beautiful and smart.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.210
And I was just, I mean,
elated to have you.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.610
And that's the day that I
decided to write "Self Made."

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.419
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.120
NELY GALAN: Because
Sheryl Sandberg and I,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.470
she had asked me to do an event.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.050
She knew that I have a
big constituency of Latina

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.700
and multicultural women.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.319
She wanted to do an
event for "Lean In."

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.110
And I had a very long
talk with her before,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.550
and I said, Cheryl, I'm happy
to do this event with you,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.150
but you have to understand
that the book is not

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.940
that relatable to
multicultural women.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
So many of us have had
paths that are not linear.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.190
And she was wonderful.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.290
And you were there.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.040
We had a very feisty
conversation about it.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.160
And I'm a big fan of hers.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.120
But that day I thought to
myself, as she was speaking,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.430
I thought, who's going
to tell our stories?

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.250
Who's going to tell the
stories of women like us

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.820
that are immigrants or
the kids of immigrants

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.140
or who have had
detours or women that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.830
are Muslim or
African-American or Asian,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.770
who really come to this
country and reinvent themselves

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.180
and are emerging in
countries around the world?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.580
And I heard in my ear,
you do it, you do it.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.270
And then, of course,
sometimes our low self-esteem

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.070
shows up and goes,
[SPEAKING SPANISH],,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.870
what do you think you are?

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.320
And then I said, if you don't
do it, who is going to do it?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.750
And I did it, and I'm
very proud that I've

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.950
spent a year, 140 cities
around the country,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.890
meeting all kinds of
women and really uniting

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.150
with not just all multicultural
women but with white women.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.580
And we now know after
the whole election

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.130
that this is an incredible
year for all of us

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.040
and that we need to
talk about this issue.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.400
SPEAKER 1: We have
power, a lot of power.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.710
NELY GALAN: A lot of power,
power that we don't even

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.180
know we have.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.250
SPEAKER 1: Now tell us,
what is "Self Made?"

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.870
What does it mean
to be Self Made?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.280
NELY GALAN: So
"Self Made," it so

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.896
wonderful to be
in a tech company

00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:50.270
and talk about "Self Made"
because it doesn't mean you're

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.510
going to leave your job and go
be an entrepreneur tomorrow.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.050
It also doesn't mean, especially
all of you in Silicon Valley,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.980
that one of you is going to go
off and be the next Zuckerberg.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.010
These are one-in-a-million
situations.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.370
But the good news is
Self Made is a mindset.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.272
It begins by thinking like
an owner in what you do now.

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:13.730
You're not going
to leave your job.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.313
You're going to think every day
that you're in business school

00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:19.040
working for other people,
using other people's money,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.839
and sitting there
every day and saying,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.630
if this were my company,
what would I do?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.310
Would I spend this money?

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.670
And make sure that you let
your bosses know how you feel.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.480
You're practicing being
a founder and an owner.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.610
And if they don't listen
to you, that's fine.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.670
But you have to, every day,
come into work not thinking

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.980
victimized, thinking
like an owner.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.780
The future for all of us is to
think and behave like owners.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.250
Then we have to think that
Self Made is a mindset.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.650
And it's a mindset
of understanding

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.170
that the United States works
on a premise that most of us

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.100
don't know.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.260
The premise is that, to make
it to the end of your life,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.310
you have to make
money while you sleep,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.280
which one of my billionaire
bosses and mentors

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.100
told me that, I was like it
sounds like a foreign language.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.660
I didn't even know
what that meant.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.975
That meant that the money
you make at whatever job

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:13.850
you do, whether you work
here, whether you're

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.772
a doctor or a lawyer, if
you just count on the money

00:05:16.772 --> 00:05:18.230
you make and money
you save, you're

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.390
not going to make it to
the end of your life.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.350
So entrepreneurship isn't just
becoming a founder or a maker.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.290
It's also being someone that
makes money, saves money.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.350
Sometimes you have to do it
by starting a side hustle.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.310
And that money you save you
have to invest in, like me,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.840
real estate, which
we'll talk about.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.060
That why I say, don't
buy shoes, buy buildings.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.890
Or invest it in stock.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.260
Or invest it in buying
an existing business

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.220
and let other people run
it while you have job.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.250
Or supplier diversity,
where you understand

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.040
that there's a lot of
contracts in corporations

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.100
and in the government
that are earmarked

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.280
for women particularly
and multicultural women

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.541
specifically.

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.040
And guys, if you
want to make money,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.770
partner with a woman and a
multicultural woman and you'll

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.180
do better.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.090
That we understand that, whether
you're an entrepreneur that

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.650
leaves your company or not, you
must think entrepreneurially

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.040
from this moment on in
your life to make it.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.219
SPEAKER 1: Tell us tell
us about Nely at age 12.

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:20.260
Where did this come from?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.610
When did you become Self Made?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.710
When did you get this
entrepreneurial spirit?

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.400
NELY GALAN: I think for me, it
all began in the seventh grade.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.830
I think for so many
of us sometimes

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.170
our greatness comes from pain.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.910
I was the kid of immigrants.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.690
We had no money.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.120
My parents came
from communist Cuba.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.130
They lost everything,
including their degrees.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.840
They had to start all over.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.390
I became the hero child.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.550
I had to help them translate
for them, do everything.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.030
And in the seventh grade, we
were having a lot of struggles

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.980
financially.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.470
I was in all-girl
Catholic school.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.370
And basically, I would
overhear my parents saying,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.616
what are we going to do?

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:00.490
What are we going to
do, my father would say.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.650
And my mother would
say, [SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.270
And my dad would
say, don't worry.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.400
Jesus will help us.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.240
And I realized that I had
to go help my parents out.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.360
And a lady down the street, an
older Jewish lady, sold Avon.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.860
And she's like,
honey, why don't you

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.370
sell Avon and you get
some free lipstick?

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.630
I go, I got to
cut a better deal.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.810
And I went and said to her,
I will sell Avon in school,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.300
but I need it to be 50-50.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.860
And I started making money,
$200 a week selling Avon,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.020
paying down my entire
tuition, and then

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.840
having the nuns send home
a letter to my parents

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.240
so my dad wouldn't be upset that
I was paying down the tuition.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.760
And I brought it home and my
mother goes, what does it say?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.900
And my father goes, your
daughter is a genius

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.080
and Jesus helped us after all.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.440
And I think that was the
beginning of the aha.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.170
That, if there is a
problem, we can fix it.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.700
There's no point
in being a victim.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.420
We fix it.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.420
And I think that
life is a series

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.400
of those issues that, maybe for
someone else, is a catastrophe.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.230
And for me, it was like the
beginning blocks of my-- you

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.140
know when Beyonce talks
about her persona,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:20.050
Sasha Fierce I am a Latina
immigrant from New Jersey who's

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.400
sometimes has self-esteem issues
show up and I don't feel good,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.370
and then I created a persona.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.040
And I got my own version
of Sasha Fierce going on.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.660
I'm a beast.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.240
And it happened
brick by brick, step

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.159
by step, learning that no
one else is smarter than us,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.730
that it's a matter of
being louder and braver.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.700
This is not a country
of wimpy people.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.610
This is not a country
of not understanding

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.950
the Constitution and
the First Amendment

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.010
and not understanding
that you have rights

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.977
and that we're all very
much part of this country

00:08:56.977 --> 00:08:58.310
and our voice needs to be heard.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.070
I mean, don't you
love seeing a Latina

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.240
on mainstream TV defending
women, multicultural women

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.080
and Latinas?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.730
Why do we feel like
we can't do that?

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.500
Why do we marginalize
ourselves in small situations

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.260
when in fact we have all
the power in the world.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.410
Latinas in this country are
the number one emerging market.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.630
That means we are the
number one consumers

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.790
in America, together with
African-American women,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.360
Asian women, Middle
Eastern women.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.210
If we unite together,
there is no company

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.730
that can survive without us.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.620
So how do we not put that
information inside our bodies

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.990
and become empowered
and know that we have

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.130
all the power in the world.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.970
SPEAKER 1: We take ownership.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.855
We are Self Made.

00:09:40.855 --> 00:09:42.480
It's a mentality,
changing the mindset.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.521
NELY GALAN: That's right.

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:44.440
It's a mindset shift.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.660
SPEAKER 1: Now, there is
a moment in your journey

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.874
when you were working
for a corporation.

00:09:48.874 --> 00:09:49.540
NELY GALAN: Yes.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.790
SPEAKER 1: And you
realized at that moment

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.960
that you were
acting like an owner

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.020
but you really weren't an owner.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.400
Can you tell us a little bit?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.910
NELY GALAN: So I got into
television very early on.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.024
I was lucky because I wrote an
article to "Seventeen" magazine

00:10:04.024 --> 00:10:05.690
about why you should
never send your kid

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.652
to all-girl Catholic school,
and they published it.

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:11.110
And it was a big
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.550
in my family.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.040
And as a result,
"Seventeen" magazine

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.432
offered me the youngest guest
editorship in their history.

00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:21.890
So again, that's when I learned
it doesn't pay to be wimpy.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.380
Speak up.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.150
And I got into
"Seventeen" magazine,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.180
which led me to television,
which in my wildest

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.280
dreams I would never have done.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.510
And very early on,
in television I

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.430
was interviewing
a lot of people,

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.300
and I met a gentleman who was a
very big producer in Hollywood.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.950
And he's like, are you Latina?

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.550
What are you?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.130
And I said, yeah, I am.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.360
And he said, I just bought
the first Spanish TV station

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.930
in America.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.110
And he's like, why don't
you come and work for me?

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.040
And I go, excuse me.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.690
I work for CBS.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.070
Why do I want to work for some
rinky-dinky Spanish TV station?

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.500
And he's like, I'm rich.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.950
Are you rich?

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.930
He goes, young
lady, what would it

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.200
mean to be employee one of a
business that's going to be

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.000
a multibillion dollar business?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.250
And I was like, oh
my god, he sounds

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.130
a little smarter than me.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.970
And I think that was my first
attempt at not really thinking

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.540
any more about what
is my career path,

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.310
but who are the people
that I'm going to follow

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.570
that are smarter than me?

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.640
I went and at 22
years of age ran,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.880
I was the general manager--

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.840
the youngest general
manager in the country--

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.170
of the first Latino
TV station, which

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.380
is now Telemundo but back then
it was an independent station.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.850
I killed myself.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.680
I thought like an owner.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.160
I worked 24 hours a day.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.466
I had no personal life.

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:44.090
And three years later,
I walk into work

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.327
and they had sold the company.

00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:47.910
And I went to see
my boss, and I said,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.760
how could you do this to me?

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.370
This is my baby.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.150
And I'm crying and
bawling, everything

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.390
they tell you not to do.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.870
And he's like, stop, young lady.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.590
Those are my chips.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.360
If you want to play,
go get your own chips.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.480
And that is the
moment I had to mourn

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.460
that I was losing
my baby, and then I

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.010
said I have to start
my own business.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.270
And so I started a business
at 25 making TV shows,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.430
or that's what I thought
I was going to do.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.850
And for four years, I
did not make a penny.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.980
I would tell you the opposite.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.690
Do not leave your job.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.910
Don't just go bootstrapping
without knowing

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.140
what you're going to do.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.906
I have a whole formula
for you, but I did that.

00:12:30.906 --> 00:12:32.530
And can you imagine
the Latino parents?

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.500
Por favor, find the husband.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.410
You're losing your looks.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.850
And four years later, I
was like praying to God.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.940
Dear God, por favor,
throw me a bone.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.410
Everybody thinks I'm a loser.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.900
It was not cool to be
an entrepreneur then.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.510
All my friends were like,
dude, can you get a job?

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.310
What's your problem?

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.110
And in the fourth
year, I got invited

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.870
to a Chamber of Commerce event.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.280
And I went.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.200
And I always say, in
life, if you show up,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.430
maybe something happens,
maybe nothing happens.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.660
But if you don't show up,
nothing happens-- guaranteed.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.090
I went, and I started
asking people,

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.310
what's wrong with
my business plan?

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.370
And they said immediately,
they were like, your business

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.600
plan is wrong.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.140
There is no pipeline
for your content.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.820
There's only one station.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.310
You need to go build the
pipeline and the distribution.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.260
So I switched my business
plan to launching TV channels

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.490
around the world
for big companies.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.670
So it was supplier
diversity in a way.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:40.050
So I basically went to work
with Fox, HBO, ESPN, Sony,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.720
and I would take their brand
and launch it in Latin America.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.620
SPEAKER 1: And they would fund?

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.280
NELY GALAN: They would fund it.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.230
It was my business.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.360
So if it screwed up, they
could get rid of me easily.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.380
It was my own business.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.930
And then I launched
it separately,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.120
and I launched 10
channels that way.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.990
And then the original
TV station that I ran

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.690
was bought by an American
insurance company,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.520
and they had bought
a bunch of stations.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.980
And they didn't know how
to run a Latino network.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.330
So it went into bankruptcy.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.740
Sony bought it.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.660
Sony was my client.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.100
I had launched their
channels abroad.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.740
And I was the only
Latina that they

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.860
knew that had fiscal
responsibility

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.900
for large entities
of theirs abroad.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.830
And so they basically
offered to buy my business

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.390
and offered me the
presidency of entertainment,

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.190
which is running the network.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.127
That's the creative
job in a network.

00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:31.710
And so I ran Telemundo
for four years,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.840
and I went back
into corporate life.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.940
So I understand
very much becoming

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.500
Self Made as an
intraentrepreneur

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.560
and as an entrepreneur
outside of a corporation.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.310
And both ways is very important
because only in a corporation

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.205
do you learn how
to scale something.

00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:49.830
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.204
I think we are
all learning that.

00:14:51.204 --> 00:14:53.460
I think even myself.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.130
Myself and Iliana who's
here have coined ourselves

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.880
as the intrapreneurs, creating
and seeing opportunities

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.070
where they don't exist.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.380
Now, tell me, so you mentioned
your mom at one point

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.050
and your parents were
saying, andale, you

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.980
need to get a husband.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.200
And you mentioned in
your book that there's

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.220
no such thing as Prince
Charming or Princess Charming.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.410
NELY GALAN: Well, I
think it is a bigger

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.620
idea than even how I say it.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.270
I say there is no
Prince Charming,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.880
and I don't mean that
against guys or anything.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.490
I think there's no Prince
Charming for any of us.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:33.210
I think the idea that a mate
or a boss or a corporation

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.610
or a government or a president
is here to save us is false.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.540
I think that, when you work for
other people, you often think,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.760
whether you're a man
or woman, my boss

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.900
is going to see how great I am
and give me the big promotion.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.640
And your boss has their own
problems in their personal life

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.350
and in their business life.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.620
And sometimes the
company you work for--

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.640
I mean, you guys
are lucky like I

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.400
was-- in an emerging
field at the time,

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.230
and you're all in
an emerging field.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.300
But companies go
through ups and Downs,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.730
and they really are
not worried about you.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.520
And so it's really about
changing your mindset

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.770
from a victim and thinking that
any job is good or bad to I

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.590
have to make whatever
job I have under whatever

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.010
circumstances a lesson,
a learning lesson

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.400
to this puzzle that is my life.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.780
That little by little,
all the puzzle pieces

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.930
are going to make sense because
you are on a journey that's

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.410
going to take you somewhere
where all the puzzle pieces are

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.655
going to come in handy.

00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:34.530
SPEAKER 1: Now, speaking
of changing mindset,

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.470
so one thing that I really
related to in your book

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.800
was the notion of our
relationship with fear

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.652
and failure.

00:16:41.652 --> 00:16:43.110
Especially as the
Latino community,

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.000
I think we oftentimes
are more risk averse.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.720
So what can you say
in terms of kind

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.820
of what you've written
in your book, advice

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.660
to us to change that mindset?

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.470
NELY GALAN: So I think
my book, I really

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.996
wanted Latinos to see a Latina--

00:16:57.996 --> 00:16:59.370
and not just
Latinos, everybody--

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:04.020
to see that a woman of color was
speaking about money and power.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.460
Very important.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.060
And that a Latina woman
would say in a book,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.589
I always wanted to
be a millionaire.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.319
And not from a place of greed
because, in our culture,

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.470
it's being rich in
every way that matters--

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.210
but from a place
of knowing my power

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.960
and knowing that it's
possible and knowing

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.790
that that's why we came here.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.270
But what gets in the way of that
for all of us, at least for me,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.270
fear and fear of failure.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.930
It happens every day of my life
still, every day of my life.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.320
So what I say in the
book is that to make it

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.687
to the end of your life you
have to change your relationship

00:17:39.687 --> 00:17:40.520
to fear and failure.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.060
And for me, I've had to turn
fear and failure into my best

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.190
friends.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.096
Fear shows up every day,
and it's not a real thing.

00:17:50.096 --> 00:17:50.720
It's a feeling.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.290
And what comes up for all of
us, which is human, is run away,

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:54.950
run away.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.460
Go away.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.410
Don't do it.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.970
And for me-- and all of
you in the tech world--

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.800
know that a brain, just like
a computer, can be rewired.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.670
You have to rewire your brain.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.950
You have to tell yourself, like
I tell myself every day, OK,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.630
fear shows up--

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.370
I call her a she.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.660
And I go, OK, you're
telling me I have to do it.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.330
Do it, do it, do it anyway.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.280
When my book was
coming out, my dream

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.580
was to have Suzy Orman write
the foreword to my book.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.270
As a woman of color,
the only person

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.950
I'd ever hear as a woman talk
about money was Suzy Orman.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.780
I was obsessed with her.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.670
And I wrote her
this magical email.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.550
I barely knew her.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.480
I met her three times, but she
wasn't my friend or anything.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.580
I wrote her a magical email.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.716
And I was ready to send it, and
my low self-esteem showed up.

00:18:41.716 --> 00:18:44.000
[SPEAKING SPANISH] Who
do you think you are?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.210
Like, la Suzy doesn't
have time for you.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.060
And I was like, do it anyway
because I've wired my brain.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.220
I say it to myself every day, do
it anyway, do it anyway, do it

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:53.720
anyway.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.000
And I went click, send.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.260
And five minutes later,
Suzy said yes, I'll do it.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.060
Now, that doesn't always happen.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.360
But if you don't do it anyway,
maybe 50% chance it'll happen,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.736
50% it won't.

00:19:06.736 --> 00:19:08.360
But you've got to
keep doing it anyway.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.690
And then my other thing
was, in our culture,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.040
failing is like the worst, which
we know in Silicon Valley it's

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.130
like high five.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.970
Fail!

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.570
High five, next.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.280
You're around the
corner from the answer.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.000
But we're not raised like that.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.640
So my other biggest fear
was fear of failure.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.650
And I have failed.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.310
If I showed you my failure tape,
we'd all be crying right now.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.470
I have failed thousands
and thousands of times.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.149
To win three times in
your life, you better

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:37.940
be failing thousands
of times or you're not

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.350
going to win three times.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.690
And that's all
anybody remembers.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.270
So how did I rewire my
brain around failure

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.120
when I failed so many
times in my personal life,

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.050
in my business life,
in my financial-- fail?

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.300
I've had to say to
myself, OK, cry it out.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.080
Cry it out.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.340
Go mourn.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.840
And then get back on the horse.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.070
Get back on the horse.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.330
Get back on the horse.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.880
Because if I don't
pull myself out of it,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.730
around the corner from
my greatest failures

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.560
have been my greatest successes.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.270
And if I didn't wait, it
wouldn't have happened.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.760
So that's very important.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.426
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:13.470
I think oftentimes
I've even faced that.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.580
I call it the imposter
syndrome that we

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.800
bring with us like in
our everyday lives,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.500
us questioning if
we should be here.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.130
Especially in the
tech industry, there

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.160
is this large
conversation that we all

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.560
hear every day around diversity
and the lack of diversity.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.560
And so us killing the
imposter syndrome,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.930
and I've also said I leave
that girl out the door.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.530
NELY GALAN: Well, let's talk
about that, that diversity

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.920
and imposter syndrome because
I feel like the diversity

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.170
is such a hot potato, and I
think we need to blow it up.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.262
Because diversity,
to me, the way--

00:20:46.262 --> 00:20:47.720
and especially,
I'm older than you,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.060
so I grew up in a whole
other world of diversity--

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.590
I think diversity means
somebody is doing us a favor.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.340
And I think we need to
like blow that thing up

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.020
because the truth of the matter
is, multicultural people are

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.790
about to become the majority in
this country by the year 2022.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.630
Number two, when multicultural
women are the number one

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.720
consumer in America,
the answer is

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.460
we're doing everybody
else a favor.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.580
And if the company doesn't
look like all of us,

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.700
it will sooner or
later fail because that

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.630
means you have no relationship
to your customer, the number

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.720
one customer in the world.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.420
Period.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.010
So you really have
to take that in.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.120
So somehow, we've told ourselves
a story about diversity.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.070
Blow that word up
because they are

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.700
lucky to have us because we
represent their number one

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.370
customer.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.640
So let's not ever
think that again.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.530
SPEAKER 1: I love it.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.300
Now, how is it that
you-- in your book,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.340
you talk about in order
for you to be chosen you

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.590
have to choose yourself first.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.220
NELY GALAN: That's right.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.530
SPEAKER 1: How do
you go about that?

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.113
Tell us a few.

00:21:57.113 --> 00:21:58.880
NELY GALAN: Well,
if I ask a man--

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.440
as someone who
worked in television,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.106
has worked in television
for many years,

00:22:02.106 --> 00:22:03.860
I cast a lot of people.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.980
And let's say I'm
casting a cooking show.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.266
And I go up to a man and I
say, well, what do you do?

00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:09.890
Oh, I'm a chef.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.598
I've been a chef.

00:22:10.598 --> 00:22:11.840
I'm an award-winning chef.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.880
And maybe they just
started six months ago.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.800
If I say that to a
woman, you guys go,

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.410
oh, I kind of can
cook really well.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.870
I go, well, are you
a chef or not a chef?

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.940
If you don't declare
yourself, how

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.760
am I supposed to give
you an opportunity.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.920
I think that we have to forget
humility is a beautiful thing

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.780
except at work.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.110
You really have to
declare yourself.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.260
You have to know who you are
and know what you're good at

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.500
and say it and call it
out and raise your hand

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.132
and show up at
events and speak up.

00:22:48.132 --> 00:22:49.340
That's where Cheryl is right.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.600
You have to lean in.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.470
Right?

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.840
And I think to not
understand that we live

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.460
in a world of loud people--

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.500
this is a loud country.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.010
It does not pay
[SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.469
And that's what
I tell everybody.

00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:04.010
I'm going to just
tell you right now,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.880
I could never as a Latina
from New Jersey, immigrant

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.430
with my humble parents,
have raised millions

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.430
of dollars for my businesses
if I didn't go and take

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.530
acting lessons.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.080
I recommend everybody
take acting lessons.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.670
It's super fun.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.437
It's a great way to meet
people that you want to date.

00:23:22.437 --> 00:23:27.200
And it's going to serve
you very well in life.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.570
Because, I'm super
introverted-- you

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.220
would never know that, right?

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.680
Super, super introverted.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.600
But I've had to cultivate
my Sasha Fierce side.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.780
And I think that you do
it by pretending you're

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.000
someone else in a character.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.560
Every time I've
raised money, I made

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.300
believe I was my old Jewish
bosses that were like,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.260
if you don't give
me the money, you're

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.520
going to miss the opportunity.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.470
I can even get into their voice.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.530
And when I spoke inside their
body, I would get money.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.010
I go, man, this stuff works.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.590
So I want you all to
think that we can't all

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.270
be good at everything.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.820
Cultivate these sides of us.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.690
In order for me
to sell TV shows,

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.400
even though I was an introvert,
I had to go and pitch the show

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.930
and make people
excited about it.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:19.200
I had to cultivate
a sales persona.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.470
SPEAKER 1: Now, so it's noisy--

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.360
you mentioned noisy earlier--

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.180
which brings me to
another point is

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.340
to make an immigrant
your role model, which

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.520
I think is a really interesting
point because, in today's

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.660
political world, to say that
I think is a strong statement.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.620
It's a statement that
I think is beautiful,

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.955
but maybe some other people may
have a different point of view.

00:24:40.955 --> 00:24:44.030
NELY GALAN: I think
everything that I am

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.170
is because I'm an immigrant.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.520
I think it's my superpower.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.960
It is my secret sauce
because immigrants--

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.080
80% of CEOs in America
are immigrants by the way,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.090
so that should
tell us something--

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.190
I think that immigrants
come to this country

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.950
and are super patriotic.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.770
We've come from a place where
something bad has happened,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.270
and we are grateful to be here.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.160
And we are hard working.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.050
We're willing to do
whatever it takes.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:17.800
We're willing to still bootstrap
and do whatever it takes.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.080
And on top of that, we have
an incredible value system

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.180
that I don't think
people realize.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.280
The other day, I
spoke at the FBI.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.350
I've spoken at the military.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.070
You wouldn't think that
a Latina immigrant,

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.290
I cry at the American flag.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.750
I cry when I'm
around the military.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.330
I loved being at the
FBI the other day.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.200
I am proud to be an
American in this country.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.340
My mother always said to me, you
have the best of both worlds.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.160
You get to be Latina and
passionate and colorful

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.550
and eat Latin food, and you
get to be fully American.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.050
And I think that says it all.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.930
So in my book, I wrote
an entire chapter.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.540
Think like an immigrant.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.060
Make an immigrant
your role model.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.630
You will not go wrong
because immigrants

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.380
are leading the life, and
they are holding the values

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.665
that we've lost in this country.

00:26:12.665 --> 00:26:14.040
SPEAKER 1: And
talk to us about--

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.770
so I majored in finance
as an undergrad,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.270
so I've always been
really intrigued

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.406
because I felt like
growing up coming

00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:21.780
from an impoverished
background I

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.330
wanted to make sure that I
understood how to manage money.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.510
That was my important thing.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.593
We don't have a lot of it.

00:26:26.593 --> 00:26:29.250
Let me ensure that
I manage it well.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.280
And in your book, you talk about
the hidden money in America

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.360
and in your home.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.702
That was eye opening to me.

00:26:34.702 --> 00:26:35.410
NELY GALAN: Yeah.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.162
Thank you.

00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:39.960
I think that's the big
secret in the book.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.940
First of all, I always
say math doesn't lie.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.070
I am very blessed
because I've always

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.330
been pretty good at math,
but I didn't really like it.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.050
And when I went to
work at Channel 47,

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.550
I realized I couldn't
read financial statements.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.010
And I hired a math
tutor, and I realized

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.850
I was very good
at math but I had

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.190
been taught math incorrectly.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.580
And so I say that because so
many of us are afraid of math,

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.220
and yet math is super
creative and fun.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.660
And I believe that why I've
been successful in my TV life

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.070
is because I've had a real
math head, because math

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.620
is very important.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.080
In the book, I talk about
the hidden money in America

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.320
because this is one of
those things in this country

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.560
that we don't know.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.330
There are so many opportunities
that your taxpayer dollars

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.660
offer you, and yet it
doesn't get marketed to us.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.840
So we don't know that
there is billions

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.570
of dollars in the
federal government,

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.250
in the Small Business
Administration

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.040
and the Department of Commerce.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.540
There's IT in the
Department of Commerce

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.000
that we could apply for and
then start a business tomorrow

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.310
with their IT that they funded.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.980
There is money for not
just to fund your business,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.902
but also to buy a building,
to buy a building.

00:27:57.902 --> 00:27:59.610
Every entrepreneur
should, at some point,

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.860
try to buy the building
their business is in.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.710
The building will be worth more
than your business eventually.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.860
This real estate that
Google is in eventually

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.700
will be worth more than
Google, I promise you.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.660
So there's so much money there.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.050
There's so much money
in supplier diversity

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.890
in every corporation in America.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.950
And that means
contracts that are

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.700
designated for women- and
minority-owned businesses

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.450
first.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.460
Now, if we don't apply,
other people can apply.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.140
But why are we not
applying when there's

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.450
a million nonprofits
in America that

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.030
help you fill out the paperwork
and teach you how to do it.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.400
There are grants.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.950
People talk about how there's
no money to start a business.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:43.020
There is so much money in grants
at every nonprofit in America

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.400
for starting up businesses
that we don't even know about.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.360
And so there is all this
money that everybody

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.580
says there's no money
out there, but it's

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.950
just that the information
hasn't gotten to you.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.360
So what happens?

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.060
A lot of white guys
in corporations

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.100
find out about this
money because they

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.340
have consultants in Washington.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.270
And they go find a woman or a
minority to front a company,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.080
and they go get the money.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.970
Why are the rest of
us not doing that?

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.650
Again, lack of knowledge,
lack of understanding

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.960
the system of this
country where we have

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.292
to make money while we sleep.

00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:21.750
SPEAKER 1: I'm
still working on it.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:27.440
NELY GALAN: And becoming
Self Made and even being

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.640
millionaires is not some elite
thing that is only the lady

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.010
that started Spanx or Zuckerberg
or these one-of-a-kind unicorn

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.690
people.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.510
No.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.200
If I that started as an
intern, went to an assistant,

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.740
worked my way up, made
no money for a long time,

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:52.520
started really making money
at 32, lived beneath my means.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.290
Even at 32 when I
started making money,

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.660
I didn't go buy a
lavish car or a house.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.330
I started buying
commercial real estate,

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.070
using the tax laws
of this country.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.430
$5,000, flip the buildings.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.800
Kept flipping the buildings.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.030
1031 exchange, which is a
thing in this country that

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.340
allows you not to pay
tax on your earnings

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.410
if you keep flipping the
money forward and buying

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.880
more real estate.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.470
And by 45, I work because I
want to and not because I have

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.340
to, which means I could retire.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.680
Now, retiring is
very different if you

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.570
live in Bentonville,
Arkansas, than if you

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.520
live in San Francisco.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.740
But all of us can do it not
from a place of grandiosity,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.050
not from a place
of being a founder,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.360
not from a place of
being an inventor,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.280
but like a turtle like me--

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.920
one step at a time,
deciding you're

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.010
going to do three things
a year, every Sunday three

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.260
things every week to get
to the three things a year,

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.000
every day three things to get
to the three things of the week.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.796
Like a turtle, slowly
you win the race.

00:30:58.796 --> 00:31:00.670
SPEAKER 1: So don't buy
shoes, buy buildings.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.780
NELY GALAN: Absolutely.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.600
Do not go for
instant gratification

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.140
because you're sad or
you feel bad or whatever.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.850
No, because you're going to get
over that purchase in a week.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.500
Have a big dream.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.260
I wrote down when I was
20, I want to own a house--

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.690
not own a mortgage,
own a house--

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.120
own a building, own
a business, have

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.440
a house in my country
of origin, which

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.800
it's not going to be Cuba,
so it's going to be Miami.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.950
And I have it.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.870
I want to retire by 65.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.620
I got to my number at 45
without being J-Lo, Beyonce,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.960
an athlete, or Mark
Zuckerberg-- none of the above.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.240
And I still made it.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.940
So what is everybody
else's problem?

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.607
If I can do it, all of you
can, should, and will do it.

00:31:47.607 --> 00:31:49.190
SPEAKER 1: It's only
a matter of time.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.231
NELY GALAN: That's right.

00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:52.570
SPEAKER 1: So tell me,
did you have a mentor

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.230
in terms of real estate?

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.660
NELY GALAN: Great question.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.875
Well, I'll tell you this.

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:59.449
This is in my book, too.

00:31:59.449 --> 00:32:01.240
A lot of people come
up to me and they say,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.130
can you be my mentor?

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.255
I go, mi amor, I don't have
enough hours in the day

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.269
to be everybody's mentor.

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:07.060
I'll tell you this.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.550
I have had a lot of mentors,
but not one of my mentors

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.950
knows they were my mentor.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.700
So when I found people that
I thought were super smart,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.950
I would stay late and
hang out with them.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.330
I'd volunteer.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.940
I'd read everything about them.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.690
Everything.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.660
I would go to every
event they spoke at.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.520
I would write down
everything they said.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.900
And what I do--

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.030
and I really think this works--

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.950
for those of you that
are very young listening

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.980
that are in your 20s, go to 50
because to you that's old age.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.460
To those of us that are
older, go to 80, 85.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.670
Start looking at people that
are the oldest you think

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:47.860
they can be and start making a
composite person of everything

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.780
you love about somebody.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.655
We're all human.

00:32:50.655 --> 00:32:52.030
We have good sides
and bad sides.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.507
You can't find one
perfect person.

00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:55.090
And that's why people
get disappointed

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.170
because they think they're
going to find everything

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:56.920
in one person.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.087
Forget about it.

00:32:58.087 --> 00:32:59.670
You see this person
over here, and you

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.750
go, I like the way
they've dealt with money.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.790
I like how they live in old age.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.640
I like this person, how
they deal with family.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.920
I like this person's
spirituality.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.370
And make a composite and
make a picture of it.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.980
And write down
everything you want.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.220
And go to 85, or to 50
if you're in your 20s,

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.440
and work your way backwards.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.527
I did it to 50, and I
saw all these people

00:33:24.527 --> 00:33:25.360
that I wanted to be.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.230
And I got to 50.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.920
And now, I'm thinking
about 85 or 90 or even 100

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.090
because I plan to
live a very long time.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.670
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.830
So three pieces
of advice in terms

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.600
of making money in our sleep.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.750
NELY GALAN: Oh, easy.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.830
Number one, do not
leave your job.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.820
Number two, lower your overhead.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.320
I have to give you
more than three.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.726
Number three, start a side
hustle one hour a week.

00:33:51.726 --> 00:33:53.350
And you're not cheating
on your company

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.970
because if you're not doing this
you're not bringing anything

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.300
back to your company.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.580
You need to be out there
doing the shared economy.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.440
So ladies, clean out your
closets, the quinceanera dress,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.490
whatever you want.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.390
One hour a week sell
something in your house.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.960
Start there, and
put that money away.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.659
Everyone should have a compound
interest account in the bank.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.429
I always tell, if
you're 20-something

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.460
and you put $5 a day away
in a compound interest,

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.530
you will be a millionaire by 50.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.239
So let's just start there.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:27.080
One hour a week side
hustle, put the money away,

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.980
lower your overhead.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.280
It's really fun to
watch money grow.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.920
When you have two
years of money saved,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.139
two years of salary, one of
those years is for a rainy day.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:42.080
The other one is
your investment fund.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.610
I want you to think--

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.340
you don't all have
to be entrepreneurs

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.929
that create businesses-- what
are you going to invest in?

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:48.570
Real estate?

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.989
How much has real
estate gone up here?

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:55.530
Crazy.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.030
SPEAKER 1: It's insane, yeah.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.040
NELY GALAN: If not, look
at a little business

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.920
down your street, some old
person that's going to retire

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.570
and their kids don't
want the business.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.640
Pick something that
already exists.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.800
Don't invent something.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.110
That is for the
0.111 percentile.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.329
Franchises.

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:14.370
You know what the number
one franchise in America

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:14.920
is right now?

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.420
Tutoring.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.990
If I had to do my life over
again, I'd buy 20 franchises--

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.930
I'm going to make my kid buy
them-- of different sorts,

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.590
food, yoga, tutoring, whatever.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.960
I mean, they give you the
color-by-number how to do it.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.280
Why does everything
have to be so hard?

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.820
You save some money,
put it in, and the thing

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.510
makes money while you sleep.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.020
So there are many, many,
many ways to become Self

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.140
made, and we all
must do it, even

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.640
if you work in a corporation.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.800
You have to be an
intrapreneur and you

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:55.280
have to be cultivating your
entrepreneurial Self-Made life.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.992
SPEAKER 1: Looking
back, and I think

00:35:57.992 --> 00:35:59.450
I know the answer
to this, but what

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.782
is your most proudest
moment looking back?

00:36:02.782 --> 00:36:03.990
NELY GALAN: Well, two things.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.340
Obviously, my son that I gave
birth to, which I don't even

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.410
know how I did that because I
didn't know what I was doing.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.200
But my parents are
very happy about that.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.774
And I have four stepkids.

00:36:14.774 --> 00:36:16.190
If I had to do my
life over again,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.770
I think I'd have more
kids because I think

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.100
that's a great part of life.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.450
SPEAKER 1: When did
you realize that?

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.230
NELY GALAN: When my time clock
was ticking so hard that--

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.167
no, but I realized it now.

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:29.750
I've realized it in
the last few weeks

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.346
because my son is leaving.

00:36:31.346 --> 00:36:32.970
This is his senior
year in high school.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.870
And I'm like, why didn't I
have a few more waiting behind?

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:36.920
This is too much.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.440
I left home and left
my mother there crying.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.430
Por favor, don't leave.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.390
And I left.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.240
And now, I feel like,
man, karma's a bitch.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.050
But my other part is the moment
is that I started in television

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.530
and I started college,
and I dropped out

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.080
because I got so many
jobs in television.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.380
And really, at that
time an emerging field,

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.360
my life experience
was really valuable.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.210
But I always wanted
to go back to school,

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:07.070
and I really felt as I got
older like there was real gaps--

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.010
not just in my education
because my business education

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.330
I had gotten it in other ways--

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.300
but my emotional
intelligence and my ability

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.980
to read people and my
ability to do other things.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.160
And so my second
proudest moment is

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.080
that I took a four-year
sabbatical, which

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.870
for a type-A workaholic
is very hard to do.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:27.650
So I only did it when I
felt like I had enough money

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.610
to do it.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.260
And I went back to
school and I got

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.510
a master's and doctorate in
clinical psychology, which

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.660
I'm very proud of.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.110
So I can be all your shrinks.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:36.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:38.193
And I don't think I
would have written

00:37:38.193 --> 00:37:40.160
this book had I not
done that because I

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.660
had to go back to school.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.290
My first professor said,
you write like a rapper.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:46.790
Because, you know,
I was in TV where

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.030
there were pithy little
marketing things that I wrote.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.330
And he's like, here's
Strunk and White.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.580
Learn to write all over again.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.510
And I go, I love this.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.390
And I ended up writing
97 papers and a thesis

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.710
and a dissertation.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.930
And I don't think I would
have had the discipline

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.560
to go back and write
this book, which I

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.505
had done after going to school.

00:38:04.505 --> 00:38:06.380
SPEAKER 1: And tell us
what's on the horizon.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.550
What's next?

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.070
NELY GALAN: Well, I
have been on, as I said,

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.550
a 130-city book tour.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.230
I first need a rest.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.644
And I think my priority
for the rest of the year

00:38:17.644 --> 00:38:19.060
and into next year
early next year

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.240
is, first of all, to analyze
what I've learned on the road.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.499
I've met so many men and women.

00:38:26.499 --> 00:38:28.040
I feel like I've
been Hillary Clinton

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.690
for a year, city by city by city
meeting all kinds of people.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.850
And I really want to
analyze that and figure out

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.680
what to do with
that information,

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.150
like a good entrepreneur.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.740
But also, I want
to focus on my son.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.820
It's his last year
of high school,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.600
and I really want
to be there for him

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.130
and really help him out.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.670
And then, I'm very
open to all new things

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.520
because I think the number
one thing that I would say

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.660
is important for all of us is
to evolve and grow everyday.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.260
There's so much that I know now
and so much that I've mastered

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.020
and yet so much
that I don't know.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.870
And I think that we all have to
wake up every day understanding

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.700
that we know nothing at all.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.950
And I think when
you think like that,

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:12.200
magical things happen
to you, and you're

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.040
open to new ideas,
new possibilities.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.770
And I'm right now
sitting on two years--

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.950
and a book, where I did so
much research-- of knowledge

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.140
that I have to
now spend the time

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.110
to take all that research
and development that I've

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.930
done and figure out
what do I do with that.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.990
SPEAKER 1: And any
advice for the Latinos

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.370
here at Google and just
in the tech industry?

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.610
I know you're going to be
meeting hundreds of more

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.120
Latinos.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.120
What do you think that
we should be thinking of,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.886
and what can we
be doing more of?

00:39:41.886 --> 00:39:43.010
NELY GALAN: Well, I think--

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:44.310
I mean, I've said this before--

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.510
but you all have to
be louder and braver.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.920
It kills me to have everything
that's happened this year

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.800
and to have my
African-American friends say,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.570
why are you Latinos so quiet?

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.790
Why do you take it?

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.220
And I understand why we
take it because that's

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.130
how we were raised and
it's our parents baggage.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.880
They're afraid.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:10.609
But it's all of your jobs to
not carry that baggage with you.

00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:12.650
You have to know there's
nothing to be afraid of.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.490
No one is going to
do anything to you.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.385
It's all BS.

00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:16.510
Nothing is going to happen.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.880
On the contrary.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.040
And I think that the best advice
I can give you is sometimes I

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.410
understand that,
although I believe

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:26.870
the answer for all of
us is uniting with all

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.600
the other multiculturals
and learning from each other

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.106
because we all have different
traits and different skills,

00:40:33.106 --> 00:40:34.480
I understand that
sometimes let's

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.030
say our voice can't be the voice
of an African-American sister

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.830
who is very empowered
and very strong.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:41.780
Maybe that's not us.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.410
But one of our
super super powers

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.630
is we're very vulnerable people.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.530
And so sometimes, when someone
says something in front of you

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.471
and it's really like not cool--

00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:54.970
sometimes they don't
even mean, it's

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.190
just that it's their learned
wiring and behavior--

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.410
you have to say something
like, excuse me,

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:01.700
what did you just say?

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.140
You just stabbed
me in the heart.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.920
That was so painful to hear.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.370
That is so hurtful.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.910
And that's just as strong
as saying, excuse me.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.310
There is many ways to
skin the cat and be loud.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.110
Maybe it's not
always being loud.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.330
Maybe it's being
honest and vulnerable.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.940
But we have to speak up.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.960
I don't allow people to say
things about my culture--

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.710
not in public.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.210
And by the way,
you don't think I

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.580
was afraid to go on Fox
News knowing that they

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.610
were going to ream me?

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.390
I broke out in hives,
but I did it anyway.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.390
And I didn't die.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.140
I said a few things about
immigrants, and on social media

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.820
people were trolling
me like crazy.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.320
So what?

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.331
The next day it's over.

00:41:48.331 --> 00:41:49.330
You're not going to die.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:50.413
Nothing's going to happen.

00:41:50.413 --> 00:41:52.705
But you're going
to gain character.

00:41:52.705 --> 00:41:54.080
And there's
something that no one

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.570
can take away from you when you
speak on behalf of your family.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.880
SPEAKER 1: That's beautiful.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.520
I want to make sure that
you get any last remarks,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.890
but I also want to see if
anyone here in the audience

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.450
has questions for Nely.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.600
This has been my magic moment
at Google, having you here.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.630
It's been a while we've
been planning this,

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.720
but I'm really excited.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.345
NELY GALAN: I'm so
proud of all of you.

00:42:17.345 --> 00:42:19.670
And Iliana, I'm so
proud of you, too.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.890
Love you guys.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:22.390
Yeah.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:23.135
So I want to hear questions.

00:42:23.135 --> 00:42:25.093
Don't you guys want to
know about Donald Trump?

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:27.980
OK.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.160
So I'll just tell you a quick
"Celebrity Apprentice" story

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.620
because I think you'll enjoy it.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.160
So when I ran
Telemundo, we sold it

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.110
and NBC gave me a very
big deal to produce shows.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.260
So I produced about 700
shows in English and Spanish.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.110
That's why I say I'm
Tyler Perry Latina.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.850
And I get a call
one day from NBC,

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.308
and they said, we want you to
be on "Celebrity Apprentice."

00:42:52.308 --> 00:42:54.500
and I was like, well, I
produce reality shows.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.000
I'm not in them.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.842
And they said, no.

00:42:57.842 --> 00:42:59.300
The president of
NBC said, I really

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.020
think you would be great
because Donald Trump is tough.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.840
And we think if we put a
Latina actress or something,

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.490
he might really insult them.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.690
You've worked for
six billionaires,

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.160
and you've had them as clients.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.910
And they're a lot worse
than Donald Trump.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:15.320
SPEAKER 1: You can take it.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.730
NELY GALAN: You can take it.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.190
And the truth is, I've
had to take it, you guys.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.540
I've worked in Hollywood.

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.550
I have been yelled
at, screamed at.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:24.170
I've had people be
very disrespectful,

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:27.500
and I had to not take it
personally and put people

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.290
in their place.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.430
I had to go into
my other persona.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.380
So I said, all right.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.000
And they go, we're not asking
you, we're kind of telling you.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.320
And I was like, but
I'm not a celebrity.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.820
And they're like,
why don't you just

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.051
say thank you for millions
of dollars of publicity

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.050
for your personal brand?

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.970
And I was like, OK, thank you.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:45.910
And I went on
"Celebrity Apprentice."

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.947
And in the first episode,
Donald Trump yelled at me.

00:43:48.947 --> 00:43:50.780
And in the first episode,
I did what I would

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.905
have done with any of them.

00:43:51.905 --> 00:43:53.060
You saw me on the show.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.740
I would very
respectfully-- because I

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.800
didn't do it, as I say in
Spanish, [SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.869
I would do it very
like, I'm sorry

00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:01.160
but no, I don't agree with you.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:01.743
No, we're not.

00:44:01.743 --> 00:44:05.470
And we got into these
very feisty conversations.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.540
And after the first episode
when we were off camera,

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.230
he said to me, oh, it's so great
that you yelled back at me.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.220
How great.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:13.804
Keep doing it.

00:44:13.804 --> 00:44:15.303
We're going to get
a lot of ratings.

00:44:15.303 --> 00:44:17.400
Latinos will love you
because they don't like me,

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.370
and it will be great that
you're yelling at me.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.490
And that tells you
a lot about him.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.830
He loves to argue for sport.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.430
And he was very into the
ratings and very much

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.770
the value of his property.

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.640
But I actually had a great
time on "Celebrity Apprentice"

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.300
because I was partnered up
with Gene Simmons from KISS.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.550
And when he's not being
the guy from KISS,

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:41.810
he's like a Jewish dad.

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.280
He was very lovely.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.840
And one day, he
says to me, Galan,

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.450
you're such a smart
girl, but I feel

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.150
like you're always climbing
a mountain the hardest

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.470
possible way.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:54.320
You're struggling like an
immigrant that just arrived.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.170
And I thought it was like he
was stabbing me in the heart

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:59.210
because I thought that's true.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.890
Sometimes as Latinos
we don't even

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:03.590
know how to enjoy the
journey if it's not hard,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.350
if we're not struggling, if
it's not climbing a mountain

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.210
the hardest possible way.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.340
And so I've given a
lot of thought to that,

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.860
and I think what I need to
work on the rest of my life--

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.490
because God knows I'm
not a baked cake--

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:21.290
is achieving things with
ease versus struggling

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:24.777
so much, having to suffer so
much to make things happen.

00:45:24.777 --> 00:45:27.276
AUDIENCE: Nely, quick question
on the commercial real estate

00:45:27.276 --> 00:45:29.410
front.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.590
What's the biggest lesson
learned or the hardest thing

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.420
that you had to figure out
in commercial real estate?

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:40.580
NELY GALAN: Well, I think I
did find mentors in real estate

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.420
as well.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.870
I have a mentor in real estate.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.954
Her name is Elaine,
and she's 75 years old.

00:45:46.954 --> 00:45:49.370
And one of those people that
I met that I just thought she

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.100
was brilliant.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.070
She was developing real estate.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.950
And I started taking
her to dinner.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.810
And to this day,
she is my mentor.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.270
I don't buy a
building without her.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:00.370
I mean, at all.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.970
If she doesn't OK
the building, it

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.910
doesn't happen because, as
she has taught me very well,

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.800
in real estate it's all math.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.180
And I have to tell
you something.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.020
In my TV life, I've made five
times the money in real estate

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.420
than in my TV life.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.240
And I think it's because my TV
life is creative and emotional.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.330
Sometimes I've made
bad judgment calls

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.130
because I fall in
love with a show.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.080
I don't fall in
love with buildings.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.820
If the math doesn't work,
you don't buy the building.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.400
Period.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.000
So there's something
about mission and money,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.670
having something in your life
that you love, and there's

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:36.080
nothing wrong with that.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.980
But until you're rich,
as my boss told me,

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.800
the money part has
to take precedence

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.300
because you have so many years
of life force, of energy,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.010
where if you're doing
five things at once

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.046
I don't feel sorry
for you because you

00:46:51.046 --> 00:46:51.920
have a lot of energy.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.400
Later in your life, you're
not going to want to do that.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.770
So to me, yes, you
have to find mentors.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.010
You have to go to
events like this

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.610
because if that's something
that interests you that is

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.200
a path that works--

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.930
linearly, slowly.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:12.980
All the tax incentives and all
the tax laws are in your favor.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.810
Hence, Donald Trump.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:18.320
When he says, I don't pay very
many taxes, he's not lying.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.680
That part is true.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.200
All of us can pay lesser taxes
if we follow the tax laws

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:29.291
and invest in things that
give us all kinds of benefits.

00:47:29.291 --> 00:47:30.915
AUDIENCE: Who are
your new role models,

00:47:30.915 --> 00:47:33.097
someone in the last five years?

00:47:33.097 --> 00:47:34.430
NELY GALAN: Well, I'll tell you.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.270
My role model that I
think about most often.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.640
I have a few, but I
love Gloria Steinem

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.610
because I love
Gloria Steinem at 85.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.680
She is beautiful.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.960
She is really deep and
profound and peaceful.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.490
And yet, she's still
doing her work.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:54.650
She still shows up and
speaks and all that.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:48:00.890
I also had a professor in school
who was 80-- at the time, 82,

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:02.330
she's now 85--

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:06.410
who had gone back to school
at 50 after raising five kids,

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:10.620
had become the world's foremost
expert on Sigmund Freud,

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.950
has written six books
on Sigmund Freud.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:15.950
And now, she travels all
over the world lecturing

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.320
in her expertise,
which is Sigmund Freud.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.690
And at 82, she looked
like she was 50.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.100
And she really
inspired me in school

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.410
to find, what is my true path?

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.420
There's a lot of TV
producers, but what

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.060
I thought that I offer
the world uniquely

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.310
is from a multicultural voice.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:38.420
I really walk the walk of
an entrepreneurial person,

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.730
of a Self-Made woman.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.970
I've sacrificed what you need
to sacrifice to get to my age

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:46.980
and be Self Made and be set.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.770
And I felt like it is my duty.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:52.790
And when I saw Sheryl, it
concretely was clear to me.

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.310
It's my duty to pass that on--

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:58.040
obviously, first to my
Latinas because I love you

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.170
guys and I want you
all to succeed--

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.800
then to other multicultural
women and men,

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.670
and then to all young people
because I don't want everyone

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.860
to think that you have
to be that one-of-a-kind,

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:14.270
unicorn person that makes it
big when all of us can do it,

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.312
as I said, like a turtle.

00:49:15.312 --> 00:49:17.311
SPEAKER 1: I know we're
going to be doing a book

00:49:17.311 --> 00:49:19.810
signing after this, but I
want to thank you again,

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.570
Nely Galan, for being here,
joining us for Talks at Google

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.090
in collaboration with Hola,
Google's Hispanic Googler

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.910
network, and talking about
"Self Made," "New York Times"

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.025
bestselling book, "Becoming
Empowered, Self-Reliant,

00:49:32.025 --> 00:49:33.275
and Rich in Every Single Way."

00:49:33.275 --> 00:49:34.670
NELY GALAN: Rich in every way.

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:35.390
That's the key.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.740
And why are we doing this?

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.570
To pass the torch to the next
generation of a mindset that

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:44.090
is self-reliant, that
thinks like owners,

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.490
that multicultural
people particularly

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:49.576
think like owners
in everything we do.

00:49:49.576 --> 00:49:50.450
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.366
NELY GALAN: Thank you.

00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:54.850
