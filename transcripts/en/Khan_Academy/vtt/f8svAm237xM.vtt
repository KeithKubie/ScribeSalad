00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.170
Several videos
ago, I very quickly

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.322
went through why side-side-angle
is not a valid postulate.

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:09.780
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.450
is explore it a little bit more.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.380
And it's not called
angle-side-side

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530
for obvious reasons,
because then the acronym

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.352
would make people giggle
in geometry class.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.060
And I guess we don't
want people giggling

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.870
while they're doing mathematics.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.720
So let's just think
about a triangle here.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300
So let's say I have a triangle.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.940
Let me draw it.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.065
Let's have a triangle that
looks something like this.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.525
If I have a triangle
that looks something--

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:35.340
I have trouble drawing
straight triangles.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.220
So let's say the triangle
looks something like that.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.570
And let's say that we've
found another triangle that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.000
has a congruent
side, a side that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970
is congruent to this
side right over here.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.710
I guess any side on a triangle
is next to the other two sides.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.340
Next to that is a side that
is congruent to this side

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830
right over here.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.310
And then that side is one
of the sides of an angle.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.060
So it forms one of the parts
of an angle right over here.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.700
And that other triangle
has a congruent angle right

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.200
over here.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.740
So this is the angle that that
first side is not a part of.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.860
Only that second side
is part of this angle.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.640
So this is side-side-angle.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.180
Or you could call
it angle-side-side

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.140
and giggle a little
bit about it.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.280
Now, how do we know that
this doesn't by itself

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.447
show that this is congruent?

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:30.446
Well, we'd have to show
that this could actually

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:31.880
imply two different triangles.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.930
And to think about
that, let's say

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.550
we know that the angle-- we know
that this other triangle has

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.090
that same yellow
angle there, which

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.800
means that the blue side is
going to have to look something

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.020
like that, just the way
we drew it over here.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.500
This side down here, I'll
make it a green side.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.400
This green side down here
we know nothing about.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.576
We never said that this
is congruent to anything.

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:57.450
If we knew, then we
could use side-side-side.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.670
We only know that
this side is congruent

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.160
and this side is congruent,
and this angle is congruent.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.460
So this green side, and I'll
draw it as a dotted line,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.543
it could be of any length.

00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:08.570
We don't know what the
length is of that green side.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.880
Now we have this magenta side.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.171
We have another side
that is congruent here.

00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.670
So this thing could
pivot over here.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.670
We know nothing about this angle
so it could form any angle.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.720
But it does have to
get to this other side.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.440
So one possibility is that maybe
the triangles are congruent.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.310
So maybe this side
does go down just

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.360
like that, in which
case, we actually

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.160
would have congruent triangles.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.340
But the kind of aha
moment here, or the reason

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.290
why SSA isn't possible, is
that this side, could also

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.295
come down like this.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.910
There's two ways to get
down to this base, if you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.460
want to call it that way.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.870
It can come out that way or it
could kind of come in this way.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.660
And so that's why SSA by itself
with no other information

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.860
is ambiguous.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.590
It does not give you
enough information

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.010
to say that those triangles
are definitely the same.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.710
Now there are special cases.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.390
So in this situation
right over here,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.240
our angle, the angle in our
SSA, our angle was acute.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.185
This is an acute
angle right over here.

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.810
And when you have an
acute angle as one

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.920
of the sides of your
triangle, the other sides

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.350
of the triangle, you could
still have an obtuse angle.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.830
Remember, acute
means less than 90

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.770
degrees, obtuse means
greater than 90 degrees.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.850
So you could still
have an obtuse angle.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.750
So that's why this is an option.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.380
So one option is that you
have two other acute angles.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.270
So this could be acute.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.414
This is also acute,
also acute, also acute.

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:33.830
But then you have
the option where

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.820
this is even more
acute, even narrower,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.010
and then this becomes
an obtuse angle.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.700
And that's only possible if
you don't-- you can't have two

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.300
obtuse angles in
the same triangle.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.050
You can't have two
things that have larger

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.430
than 90-degree measure
in the same triangle.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.000
And so that's why
there is a possibility

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.120
where if you have another
triangle that looks like this,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.650
and if I were to tell you
very clearly that this angle

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.190
right over here is obtuse--
and that is the A in the SSA.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.650
So you have the angle.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.220
And I were to say I have another
triangle where this angle is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.329
congruent to that other
triangle, some angle

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.190
of that other triangle, and then
one of the sides adjacent to it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.690
is congruent, and then the next
side over is also congruent,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.000
then it's not so ambiguous.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.830
Because we could
try to draw that.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.050
So let's draw that same
congruent obtuse angle.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.274
We know nothing about
this side down here

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:37.690
because we haven't said that
that's necessarily congruent.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.120
So that could be of any length.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.650
We do know that this
triangle is going

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.430
to have the same length
for this side of the angle.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.830
So it looks like this.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.020
And then we know
that this side--

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.470
let me do that in orange.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.995
We know that this side is also
going to be the same length.

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:01.870
We haven't told you
anything about this angle

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.950
right over here.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.480
So this side could
pivot over here.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.220
We can kind of
rotate it over there.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.930
But there's only one way,
now, that this orange side

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.430
can reach this green side.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.650
Now the only way is
this way over here.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.280
And we were more constrained,
or this case isn't ambiguous,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.320
because we used up
our obtuse angle here.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.480
The A here is an obtuse one.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.820
And so then it constrains
what the triangle can become.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.050
So I don't want to make
you say, in general, SSA,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.012
you do not want to
use it as a postulate.

00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:34.720
I just wanted to make
it clear that there

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.460
is the special case where if
you know that the A in the SSA

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.224
is obtuse, then it becomes
a little bit less ambiguous.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:42.890
And then finally,
there's a circumstance

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.775
that this is an acute angle
where it would be ambiguous.

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:47.400
You have the obtuse
angle, and then you

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.740
have something in between,
which is the right angle.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.600
So where you have the A
in SSA is a right angle.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.440
So if you had it like this.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.040
If you have a
right angle and you

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.580
have some base of unknown length
but you fix this length right

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.750
over here-- if you know that
this is fixed because you're

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.830
saying it's congruent
to some other triangle,

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.380
and if you know that the
next length is fixed--

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.099
and if you think about
it, this next side

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.140
is going to be the side
opposite the right angle.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.270
It's going to have to be the
hypotenuse of the right angle.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.860
Then you know that the only
way you can construct this,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.940
and similar to the
obtuse case, and if you

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.280
know the length of this,
the only way you could do it

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.170
is to bring it down over here.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.170
So that actually does
lead to another postulate

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.810
called the right angle side
hypotenuse postulate, which

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.090
is really just a
special case of SSA

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.599
where the angle is
actually a right angle.

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.140
And here, they wrote
the angle first.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.097
You could view this
as angle-side-side.

00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:49.930
And they were able to
do it because now they

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.679
can write "right angle,"
and so it doesn't

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:54.699
form that embarrassing acronym.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.740
And this would also be a
little bit common sense.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.390
Because if you know two
sides of a right triangle--

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.640
and we haven't gone into
depth on this in the geometry

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.040
playlist, but you might
already be familiar with it--

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.160
by Pythagorean
theorem, you can always

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.690
figure out the third side.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.220
So if you have this
information about any triangle,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.610
you can always figure
out the third side.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.420
And then you can
use side-side-side.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.670
So I just wanted to show you
this little special case.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.128
But in general,
the important thing

00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:21.380
is that you can't just
use SSA unless you

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.394
have more information.
