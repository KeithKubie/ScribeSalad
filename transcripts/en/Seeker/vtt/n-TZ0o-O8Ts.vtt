00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.400
Leprosy brings to mind images of biblical
beggars, lonely leper colonies, and seems,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.760
for some, to have all but disappeared into
the history books.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
But leprosy stills haunts many parts of the
world and there’s an absurd amount that

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.510
we don’t know about the disease.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.910
Leprosy has been around since at least 2000
B.C. but, after all this time, we still don’t

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.380
really know how the disease is transmitted.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.160
We don’t know where it starts in the body.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.860
Oh, and we can’t grow leprosy bacteria in
a culture.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.289
But... maybe we should start with what we
do know.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.220
My name is Cressida Madigan.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.790
I'm an assistant professor at UC San Diego
in the molecular biology section.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.399
And I work on leprosy and other neurological
infections to try to understand how these

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.910
infectious agents are damaging our nervous
system during infection.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.449
I love micro-bacteria which is the kind of
bacteria that causes leprosy.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.339
They're very unusual organisms.

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.399
And part of what makes leprosy bacteria, or
mycobacterium leprae, so unusual is that it

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.650
is thought to only be able to replicate inside
a living cell.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.260
These bacteria can't be grown in the lab the
way that we grow other bacteria.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.300
We don't know why.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.720
We don't know if maybe we're just missing
a key component of the recipe that it needs

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.720
to grow.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.460
Could also be that leprosy simply can not
grow outside of an animal.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.680
So, scientists like Dr. Madigan study leprosy
inside living animals like mice, armadillos,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.710
and zebrafish.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.050
But this still makes the bacteria difficult
to observe and run tests on, especially since

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.940
it occupies a unique part of the body - the
nerves.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.980
It’s the bacteria invading the nerves and
the immune system’s response that eventually

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.000
causes the major symptoms of the disease.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.010
So, while we aren’t really sure how the
disease gets into the body or how it travels

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.620
to the nerve cells, we know it infects what
are called Schwann cells, which produce the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.790
protective myelin sheath that covers neuronal
axons, helping to conduct electrical impulses

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.880
along the nerves.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.550
So there's some evidence that when leprosy
infects Schwann cells, it stops those cells

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.200
from being able to make myelin which is this
sort of insulating wrapping that surrounds

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.950
the axons of our nerves.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.440
Something about the infection causes the protective
myelin to die.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.890
And this is because the bacteria is destroying
the small, but mighty mitochondria in the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.170
nerve cells.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.910
So mitochondria are sort of like the batteries
within cells.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.770
They produce the energy for the cell so that
it can function.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.640
So, as a cell, if you don't have mitochondria
you will essentially die at some point, right?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.700
Over time, the nerve axons also become damaged
by the immune system’s response to the bacteria,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.160
which is why people with leprosy can lose
feeling in their skin.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.050
But the immune system isn’t activated immediately
and that’s because leprosy bacteria is notorious

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.960
for moving at a snail’s pace.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.400
While other bacteria like e. Coli can replicate
in as short of a time as 20 minutes and disseminate

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.910
quickly, leprosy bacteria replicates only
once every two weeks or so.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.340
So someone could be infected for years and
not experience any symptoms because the bacteria

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.050
isn’t setting off any alarms.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.550
This also makes the bacteria difficult to
treat.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.349
Many antibiotics work by targeting bacteria
that are replicating.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.670
So if you're a bacterium and you're not replicating,
then you will be naturally resistant to several

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.780
classes of antibiotics.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.680
To treat the disease, you’d have to take
a cocktail of various antibiotics daily for

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.500
up to two years to make sure the drugs hit
the bacteria at the exact moment it’s trying

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500
to replicate.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.590
And you would need to take multiple antibiotics
at one time to ensure that the bacteria doesn’t

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.210
become resistant to the treatment.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.530
Which is not ideal.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.530
But the good news is, leprosy really isn’t
that contagious compared to other diseases.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.800
So part of the stigma of leprosy is that this
disease is very contagious.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.060
But that's actually not true.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.239
In fact, you need to be around someone with
leprosy for a long time to catch the disease.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.930
It also helps that 95% of people are naturally
immune to leprosy.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.209
So in order to contract leprosy you have to
be living with a family member who has the

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.230
disease who is infectious and you have to
have close intimate contact with that person

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.890
for a period of years.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.390
And while the symptoms are undesirable, leprosy
doesn’t directly cause death.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.400
In some patients, the symptoms take decades
to manifest.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.419
So… like we said earlier about the leprosy
bacteria.

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.680
They're very unusual organisms.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.340
The Byzantines knew about leprosy.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.590
They knew that it was infectious.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.600
And so to try to stop the spread of leprosy
throughout the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantines

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.130
would assign leprosy patients to leprosaria
which were like very posh leper colonies essentially

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.199
and the leprosarias were actually really nice
places for patients to live.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.370
They got free medical care, free food, housing
and so life was so good within the leprosaria

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.960
that people started trying to fake the symptoms
of leprosy in order to be admitted.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.150
Oh, to be a leper in the Byzantine era…
am I right?
