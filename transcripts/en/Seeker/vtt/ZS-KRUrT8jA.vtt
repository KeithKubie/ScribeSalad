00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.610
I’m trying to quit cold turkey.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.660
Hey there meat wads, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.919
For many of us in the United States, Thanksgiving
means putting up with our relatives long enough

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.070
to grab some of that sweet, sweet turkey and
honey glazed ham.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.350
But for someone who has dietary restrictions
or objections to eating animals, even that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.750
simple holiday pleasure is denied.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.050
Unless of course, they replace it with a turkey
made of tofu (a tofurky) or a ham made of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.769
some sort of meat analogue (a hamalogue).

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.460
On a nutritional level though, do these meat
substitutes have the chops to replace the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
real thing?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.280
It’s hard to pin down exactly how healthy
meat analogues are because there are quite

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.920
a few ways to skin a cat… or cow… or tofurkey.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.050
There’s risofu made of rice, tempeh made
of soy, and a wheat-gluten product called

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.999
seitan, so yes, some vegetarian dishes are
literally the spawn of seitan.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.149
But the one most familiar to non-vegetarians
is tofu, made from coagulated soy milk that’s

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.420
pressed into blocks.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.450
For nutritional value, tofu and meat can trade
punches all day long.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
Meat is the muscle tissue of an animal and
contains a lot more protein than tofu.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.850
According to the United States Department
of Agriculture, gram for gram 80% lean ground

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.160
beef has more than double the protein of tofu,
while chicken contains over triple the protein.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.860
On the other hand, both those meats have nearly
triple the fat as tofu, and processed meats

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.780
like sausage have way more fat, sometimes
even more fat than protein.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.970
Plus tofu’s fat is mostly unsaturated, which
is better for lowering cholesterol.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.950
Your body can happily use tofu to make proteins
because tofu contains the 9 essential amino

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.800
acids you can’t make on your own, but there
are some things faux meat can’t do as well

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.040
as the real thing.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.260
For instance, tofu is higher in iron than
chicken, but the iron in chicken and other

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.610
meat is bundled up in heme, aka the red pigment
in your blood that binds to oxygen and gives

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.990
hemoglobin its name.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.610
I think it goes without saying that plants
don’t have blood, so the iron in tofu is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.320
nonheme and isn’t as easily used.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.540
To get the most iron out of non-meat sources,
it’s necessary to supplement them with vitamin

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.550
C, which combines with the iron in a form
your body more readily absorbs.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.300
Speaking of vitamins, a meat-free diet makes
it really difficult to get enough vitamin

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.700
B12, so if you’re eating tofurky or the
Ham of Seitan you’ll need a way to supplement

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700
it.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.760
A B12 deficiency can have a host of symptoms
like tiredness, numbness, tingling, vision

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.950
loss, constipation, and diarrhea (though obviously
not at the same time for those last two).

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
A vegetarian won’t necessarily have to worry
about that because B12 is still present in

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.110
eggs and dairy products but vegans eat absolutely
no animal products.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.930
There are dairy substitutes like soy or almond
milk but they’re still missing that essential

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.150
vitamin unless they’re fortified with it.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.740
As long as they’re careful about filling
in the gaps of a meat-free diet, vegetarians

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.280
and vegans should be able to feast with their
carnivorous relatives and still have a balanced

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.280
diet.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.880
One day though, there may be meat that’s
completely cruelty free because it was grown

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.440
in a petri dish, eliminating the need for
the president to pardon a turkey ever again.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.420
Now whether or not vegetarians and vegans
will accept these meat clones because of their

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.330
“unnatural” nature is another matter altogether.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.099
So you're body can get along just fine without
the real meat but your tastebuds know the

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.099
difference.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.100
Unless we can trick them!

Have you tried the faux fowl or would you
rather talk and eat real turkey?
