00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.419
Here's an example of the need for barriers.

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.209
Say we've got an array in memory with a bunch of elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.878
and we want to shift each of these left by 1.

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:11.615
In other words, we want this element go here,

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:15.185
this element go here, this element go here and so on.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:18.223
So here's a little code snippet that should do this.

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:21.859
We first initialize the elements of array to the thread index,

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.528
and you'll see that I've hardcoded of this to 128 just to be lazy.

00:00:25.528 --> 00:00:31.201
So every thread is going to set its corresponding array element to its own index.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.946
So this should initialize things to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on.

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:39.075
And then avoiding stepping off the end of the array with this if statement,

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:43.252
every thread will set its corresponding array element

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:49.818
at its index equal to the value of the array element at the thread's index plus 1.

00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:54.155
So thread 1 will set its value to whatever is written in array sub 2.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:59.093
Thread 2 will set array sub 2 equal to whatever is in array sub 3 and so forth.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:04.803
So here's a quick quiz: How many barriers does this code need?
