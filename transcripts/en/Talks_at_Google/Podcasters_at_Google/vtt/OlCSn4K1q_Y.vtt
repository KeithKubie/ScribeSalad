SPEAKER 1: And I'm very excited
to welcome our guests here

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.710
today.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.930
This is really awesome.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.129
Quick intros-- so
we're chatting today

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.670
about "Nancy," which is WNYC
Studios' LGBTQ-themed podcast

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.890
about how we define ourselves
and the journey that we

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.510
take to get there.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.680
And my guests are
Tobin Low and Kathy Tu.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.764
And prior to "Nancy,"
Tobin was a producer--

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:35.180
I'm going to just
read this out so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.280
that, you know, I don't
mess it up, because I will.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.920
Prior to "Nancy,"
Tobin was a producer

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.260
on WNYC Studios'
"More Perfect," which

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.280
was a "Radiolab" spinoff
about the Supreme Court.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.820
His work has also appeared on
"Marketplace," "Studio 360,"

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.060
and "The Codebreaker" podcast.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.020
He is the recipient of a 2015
STEM Story Grant from PRX,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.950
and was a New Voices scholar at
the 2014 Third Coast Festival

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.360
Conference.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.480
Tobin was once a professional
cellist and attended a circus

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.567
camp as a child, fun fact.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.400
TOBIN LOW: All true.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.350
KATHY TU: All true.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530
SPEAKER 1: Kathy heads
up "Nancy's" West

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.100
Coast operations, AKA
her home in Los Angeles.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.260
Prior to "Nancy," Kathy
did production work

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.890
for a number of podcasts,
including "The Memory Palace,"

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.800
"The Mortified Podcast,"
and "Masterpiece Studio."

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.620
And she would like it to be
noted that this whole hosting

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.480
thing makes her
very uncomfortable,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.284
but she's leaning the F in.

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:36.006
So thank you so much for coming.

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:37.380
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.421
This is really wonderful.

00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.800
I know we have some fans of
the podcast in the audience.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.300
Yes?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.325
[CHEERING]

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:42.950
Yes.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.797
Great.

00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:46.130
So I'm just going to jump
right in with a few questions.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.150
I'm curious what precipitated
the creation of "Nancy,"

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.110
the podcast.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.466
KATHY TU: Where do
you want to start?

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.090
TOBIN LOW: I'm not
just pandering here.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.650
It started with a Google doc.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.486
KATHY TU: It did.

00:01:58.486 --> 00:01:59.111
TOBIN LOW: Hey!

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:02.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.432
KATHY TU: That's true.

00:02:03.432 --> 00:02:05.180
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.020
TOBIN LOW: So Kathy and I met--

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.460
I guess three years
ago at this point--

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.364
at a program called The
Transom Story Workshop.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.030
It's like a boot camp
for people wanting

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.119
to get into Public Radio.

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.160
KATHY TU: Four years ago.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.350
TOBIN LOW: Four years ago.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.520
And we just immediately
latched on to each other.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.430
And we're, like, we need
to work together somehow.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.380
And it came up that we loved
this sort of "This American

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.214
Life," "Radiolab" style
of radio storytelling.

00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:32.630
But we didn't
really see a program

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.554
that was applying that to queer
stories, like to LGBT stories.

00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:37.220
KATHY TU: Right.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.650
TOBIN LOW: So we were, like,
we should just make that.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.577
We should figure out
a way to do that.

00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:43.910
And at the time, we were just
going to do it on our own.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.480
We were going to freelance it.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.590
KATHY TU: On the side.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.410
TOBIN LOW: Right.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.580
And we did what we always did
when we were procrastinating

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.760
on a thing, which is you
start a shared Google doc,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.730
and that makes you
feel like you're

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.979
getting the ball rolling,
like we're being productive.

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:58.610
It's happening.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.985
KATHY TU: Let's
write some words.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:00.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.990
TOBIN LOW: I see you updating.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.070
I'm updating.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.660
The magic is happening.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.500
And then it just so happened
that maybe two weeks after we

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.040
decided we were going
to do this on our own,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.090
WNYC opened up an open
call for podcast ideas.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.500
So we ended up pitching to
them in a "Shark Tank" style.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.020
We had five minutes on a stage
at a journalism conference

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.290
to pitch them our idea.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.980
KATHY TU: Yeah, and there was a
clock that was counting down--

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.270
TOBIN LOW: Right.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.510
KATHY TU: --our five minutes.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.720
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.680
KATHY TU: It was terrifying.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.110
I blacked out for
the whole thing.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:36.080
TOBIN LOW: But-- so out of
that, we ended up winning.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.940
And we got a pilot with WNYC.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.390
And we developed it with them
for about a year, or like,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.530
a couple months.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.420
And then we got
greenlit out of that.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.190
And that is "Nancy."

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.750
KATHY TU: Here we are.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.174
SPEAKER 1: Amazing, that
sounds like an intense start

00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:50.715
to a podcast.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.925
So what are your goals
for the podcast overall?

00:03:56.925 --> 00:03:59.300
Do you have particular goals
in mind for putting this out

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.690
into the world?

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.770
KATHY TU: I feel like I always
say my goal for the podcast

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.300
is for people to
feel-- especially

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.230
people in the LGBT community--
to feel like they're

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.400
connected to something.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.940
They hear different voices.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.880
And they're not
stuck in their corner

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.634
of whichever part of the
community that they're in.

00:04:16.634 --> 00:04:17.300
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.925
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:22.280
TOBIN LOW: I think we talked a
lot about moments where people

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.860
see something or read something
where they feel really

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.900
seen or recognized.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.780
And so in a lot of
ways, the podcast

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.970
has a very simple
thought behind it,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.870
which is like, as
many people as we can,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.520
if we can give them that moment,
that would be really great.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.820
KATHY TU: Yeah, and you
said something recently

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.560
about the podcast.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.797
You said that you wanted it to
be the defender of queer joy.

00:04:45.797 --> 00:04:46.630
TOBIN LOW: Oh, yeah.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.120
Yeah.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.745
KATHY TU: That.

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:51.170
I think that that is kind
of what we're aiming for.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.295
SPEAKER 1: So how do you
decide which topics to cover?

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.480
KATHY TU: There are so
many topics to cover.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.615
SPEAKER 1: So many topics.

00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:01.170
And you've already
covered quite a few.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.160
KATHY TU: It's a balancing act
of what stories get pitched

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.880
to us, what stories
we find interesting,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.840
what stories are
happening right now,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.550
the opportunities
we have to capture

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.250
somebody trying to figure out
a thing which we love to do.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.690
It's a giant balancing act.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.480
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.420
I think there's a
lot of stuff that we

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.616
want to cover that's sort
of on this mental list

00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:23.990
that we keep going,
of, we really

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.970
want to cover this
and this and this.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.490
But we also made a
hard rule for ourselves

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.760
that nobody on the show
would ever just be coming on

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.925
to define themselves.

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:33.840
Do you know what I mean?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.810
We try really hard
not to have anyone

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.350
on who's just this is who I am,
and I'm defining my identity

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.270
for a larger audience.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.390
So a lot of times it's
waiting for the right story

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.360
or the right interview
that will get at things

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.740
in an interesting way.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.107
And so sometimes that's
the bar for something

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:51.940
getting on the show.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.990
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.220
SPEAKER 1: And do you feel
like that is what makes--

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.580
like, what do you feel
makes "Nancy" unique?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.990
Because there are obviously
other LGBTQ-focused podcasts.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.100
But there is clearly
a unique angle.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.250
What do you feel that that is?

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.272
KATHY TU: I think it's that we
both love narrative stories,

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.730
I don't know, more
than interviews.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.540
But there are times when I just
want to listen to a narrative

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.907
story just because I don't have
to think too much about it,

00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:22.740
if that makes sense.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.300
Like, sometimes I listen
to an interview that

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.924
does a really deep
dive into something,

00:06:25.924 --> 00:06:28.220
and that's fascinating.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.130
But that gets me a little
bit tired at the end.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.930
And sometimes it's
sort of like, I

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.620
don't know, watching
good television.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.730
You just sort of sit and
you let them entertain you.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.600
And that's what I like about
narrative-driven stories,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.000
the fact that we can
tell a story featuring

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.310
queer people living
their lives or whatever

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.330
they're going through.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.690
And I can sit back and
just let it entertain me.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.550
Does that make sense?

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.480
Did I answer a question?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.300
OK.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.340
SPEAKER 1: But you
also aside from having

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.150
folks come on and talk during
your show or be interviewed,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.550
you also share a fair
number of personal stories

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.630
and anecdotes on the show.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.570
What is your
process for deciding

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.150
how and when you share
that personal information

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.590
[? to a ?] wide audience?

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.504
TOBIN LOW: Uh.

00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:14.420
KATHY TU: Hm.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.210
TOBIN LOW: If my therapist
tells me that it's interesting--

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.360
I literally just had my
therapist pitch me on a thing.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.185
It was very bizarre.

00:07:22.185 --> 00:07:24.060
I was, like, I don't
want to talk about that.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.560
Or like, I don't know what
to talk about on the show.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.690
And she was, like,
I can think of five

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.046
things you should talk about.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:30.236
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.740
So when we first
started the show,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.760
and we were working
on our pilot,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.010
Kathy had been sitting
on this amazing tape

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.044
where she came out to her mom--

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:42.710
KATHY TU: Again.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.820
TOBIN LOW: --again.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.250
And it was this
really amazing tape

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.230
of the experience of
coming out specifically

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.370
to an immigrant mother.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.180
And how are you dealing
with both translation

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.610
in a literal sense,
but also in the divide

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.210
of what her experience is
versus your experience?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.510
So even when we didn't
know what the show was,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.330
we knew that that
was great tape.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.600
We knew that that
was a great story.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.490
So I feel a lot of us
digging into personal stuff

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.560
has tumbled out of Kathy's first
story being really personal

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.370
and people really
responding to that.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.910
And so now we have cursed
ourselves forever more--

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.740
KATHY TU: I know.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.865
TOBIN LOW: --to be spilling
things out on the show.

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:26.031
KATHY TU: Every time I feel
anxious about something,

00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.394
I feel like our boss is, like,
maybe do a story on that.

00:08:28.394 --> 00:08:29.310
And I'm, like, dammit.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.270
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.360
KATHY TU: Here we go.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.534
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:08:32.534 --> 00:08:37.100
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
Also you have started

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.825
season two, very exciting.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.154
How do you feel you shaped
season two differently from how

00:08:45.154 --> 00:08:46.070
you shaped season one?

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:50.660
Or did you shape it
differently, or is it more

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.660
of a continuation of the same?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.670
TOBIN LOW: I feel like
it's a continuation.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.360
Because we always knew that
we had sort of, like, 12

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.370
episodes in season one.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.800
And we were very
aware that you're not

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.810
going to get to 12 episodes
and be, like, we did it.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.480
We've covered all the stories

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.480
KATHY TU: All of
them have been told.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.060
TOBIN LOW: So, yeah, it
feels like season two is just

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.250
an opportunity to do
more of the storytelling

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.200
that we wanted to do.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.660
I will say the difference is
that we have an audience base,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.720
and we want to start
figuring out how

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.820
we interact with that audience.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.700
And so that was the
drive behind this project

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.100
we're doing called Out
at Work, which is, like--

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.180
SPEAKER 1: That was going
to be my next question.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.310
TOBIN LOW: Oh, cool.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.059
SPEAKER 1: Tobin's
actually a mind reader.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:36.460
Actually, another fun fact.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.780
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.090
Yeah, OK, so Out at
Work is this big project

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.670
we're doing that
has to do with some

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.980
of the big legal stuff
about what protections

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.130
we do and don't have as LGBT
workers in this country.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.950
But it also sort of boils
down to the everyday stories

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.360
of, like, are you your
coworker's token gay friend?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.040
And do they ask
you-- but we just

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.110
had a guy on this
week's episode who

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.840
talks about because
he's out at work,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.310
everyone assumes
that he just wants

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.750
to talk about sex all the time.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.958
And they're coming to him
with all their sex stories.

00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.640
And he's, like, I just
want this to be my job.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.700
But you know, there's
real stories like that,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.200
just interacting with coworkers
and that kind of thing.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.310
And I think we're really
interested in having listeners

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.950
of this show share
their stories with us

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.330
and sort of get into how
that's really fascinating story

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.815
territory for us.

00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:29.600
So yeah.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.190
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, so
this is obviously

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.680
an area that is of
interest, I think.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.410
I mean, the entire podcast is
of interest to this community.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.280
But the Out at Work piece
for many of us who are out,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.886
some of us very,
very out, super out,

00:10:44.886 --> 00:10:48.200
I think that these are really
relevant and timely stories

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.980
to be telling.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.600
So can you tell us
a little bit more

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.190
about what precipitated
the project

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.650
and how you're
thinking about it now

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.900
that you're starting to dive in?

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.792
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:10:58.792 --> 00:10:59.910
Do you want me to do it?

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.826
KATHY TU: Yes, please.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.154
TOBIN LOW: Well, truthfully
part of it was inspired by--

00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:08.570
I don't know if anyone listens
to "Death, Sex, and Money"?

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.630
It's another podcast.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.660
So they just did a big project
where they asked people

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.090
about their student
loans, and they

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.424
got an incredible
outpouring of people

00:11:17.424 --> 00:11:18.840
just being, like,
here's the thing

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.410
that I experience in my
life all the time having

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.180
to deal with student loans.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.017
But it's, like, I have to
deal with it by myself.

00:11:27.017 --> 00:11:28.600
It's a thing that
touches a lot of us,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.230
but that we don't
talk about that much.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.820
And so part of it
was thinking about,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.140
OK, we have a very
engaged LGBT audience.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.420
What's a thing that
affects a lot of them,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.850
but we don't necessarily
make the time

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.200
to talk about or dig into?

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.920
And pretty immediately,
we started joking,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.470
our jobs are bizarre,
because being gay

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.270
is like we are
professional gays.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.810
Like, it's in the
title of what we do.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.460
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.751
TOBIN LOW: But that for most
people, it's not that way.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:02.170
And most people have to
navigate being queer at work

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.790
and how much they share and
how much they don't share

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.740
and that that can be
a complicated thing

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.870
and a funny thing
and an awkward thing.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.280
And any time there's a
lot of emotions and stuff,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.545
we're, like, there's
probably stories there,

00:12:16.545 --> 00:12:19.380
and we should talk about them.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.720
And this is probably a good
moment to plug that you guys

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.050
should go to
NancyPodcast.org/Work,

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.370
and fill out our survey, and
share stories if you have them,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.920
because we are actively mining
for them now to possibly put

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.240
them on the show.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.480
KATHY TU: Yeah, and our producer
Matt will call you and record

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.740
you at some point--

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.760
probably, I don't know.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.260
TOBIN LOW: Oh, this
is a good moment

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.900
to say Matt our producer
wanted me to say a thing,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.060
and I don't know what
these words mean,

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.520
but he wants you to
bring back Google Reader.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.863
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:48.863 --> 00:12:49.404
KATHY TU: Oh!

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:52.050
Yes, I also agree.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.770
Can we talk about this?

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.900
Why did it go away?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.983
TOBIN LOW: Raise your hand
if you can do something

00:12:56.983 --> 00:12:59.510
about Google Reader.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.094
SPEAKER 1: No?

00:13:00.094 --> 00:13:00.843
TOBIN LOW: No, OK.

00:13:00.843 --> 00:13:01.470
KATHY TU: No?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.240
Nothing has replaced it.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.415
I've tried them all.

00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:06.650
OK, sorry.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.100
SPEAKER 1: No ex-Google
Reader staff in here?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.457
No, no, I'm sorry.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:11.540
TOBIN LOW: Was it like a--

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.240
SPEAKER 1: Very
sadly struck out.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.830
TOBIN LOW: It's
like a book thing?

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.650
KATHY TU: No, it allowed you
to subscribe to different blogs

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:17.860
and news and stuff.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.630
And then it just all shows
up in front on your page.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.630
And then you can just
mark the ones you've read.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.420
It was so great.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.060
TOBIN LOW: I don't need that.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.500
KATHY TU: It was a
great [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.010
TOBIN LOW: It's fine.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.200
KATHY TU: Now they just spam
you with all these emails.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.860
TOBIN LOW: I take it back.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.568
You can leave it.

00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:33.450
SPEAKER 1: Now we're all
listening to podcasts.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.350
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.050
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:46.410
SPEAKER 1: So I wanted to talk
about representation quickly.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.210
And how you go
through the process,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.784
particularly with
the folks that you

00:13:50.784 --> 00:13:51.950
choose to bring on the show.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.107
And I know that there
was a discussion, which

00:13:54.107 --> 00:13:56.190
I won't dive too deeply
in, in case anybody hasn't

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.240
heard the discussion yet.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.340
But there's conversations
about the responses

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.700
that you've received from
fans about bi representation

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:09.240
or other pieces of the
LGBTQQIAAPP acronym

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.715
that are or are not represented.

00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:13.080
So I'm curious how
you're approaching--

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.970
how you're approaching that.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.390
KATHY TU: Again, it's a
huge balancing act between--

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.681
we don't just think about that.

00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:22.260
We also think about
race and location

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.420
and socioeconomic status.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.840
There's a lot of things we
try to pack-- well, not pack.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.950
But we try to spread out our
stories as much as we can.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.080
But I feel like
a lot of times we

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.922
get pitched stories
from the coasts,

00:14:35.922 --> 00:14:37.380
and it's hard to
wade through those

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.760
to find other stories from
the Midwest, from the South,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.400
just to get more diverse
voices onto the show.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.980
And I think that's one
of the reasons why we're

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.480
doing the Out at Work project
so that we can get more people,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.240
more voices onto the podcast.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.120
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, it's
a challenge, though.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.760
Because inherently, we did
set a very wide net for what

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.880
we said the show would
be about, and so that

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.850
covers a lot of people who have
been waiting for their story

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.275
to be told anywhere.

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:11.150
You know what I mean?

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.290
Like, when somebody
comes at you and says,

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.900
I'm a fan of the show.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.400
Please do a story
about x, y, or z.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.510
You have to take that in.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.851
Because that is somebody who is
waiting for their story to be

00:15:24.851 --> 00:15:25.350
told.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.516
And that is something that
we are endeavoring to do.

00:15:27.516 --> 00:15:30.120
So there is this relationship
with the audience where

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.330
you have to take in
that kind of criticism

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.532
and be like, yep, you are right.

00:15:35.532 --> 00:15:36.990
We are going to do
our best, and we

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.630
are going to try and find a way
to do that in a smart way that

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.460
serves the story well.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.120
So yeah, it's tough.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:51.720
SPEAKER 1: Speaking of fans and
your audience, which episodes--

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.270
since you are having this
sort of back and forth

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.880
with your audience, and
they're sending you letters

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.830
and giving you feedback--

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.605
which episodes elicited
the strongest responses?

00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:02.820
TOBIN LOW: "Harry Potter."

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.069
KATHY TU: "Harry Potter."

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.860
TOBIN LOW: By far--

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.934
KATHY TU: "Harry Potter."

00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:06.600
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.734
SPEAKER 1: Can you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:09.400
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.840
KATHY TU: Well,
our producer Matt

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.420
is a giant "Harry Potter" fan.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:17.040
And he also loves going down the
rabbit holes like nerd raging.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.650
And the thing that he
enjoys nerd raging about

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.520
is the fact that Dumbledore
is not actually gay.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.980
You can't just after the
fact say that he's gay.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.050
And so he did an
episode about this,

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.144
and people were
just upset about it.

00:16:30.144 --> 00:16:31.310
TOBIN LOW: They were pissed.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.220
KATHY TU: They were mad.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.685
And they were
attacking JK Rowling.

00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:33.950
TOBIN LOW: So mad.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.460
KATHY TU: And I'm, like--

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.990
TOBIN LOW: Yeah,
and it was funny,

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.050
too, because like either one
or two episodes before it,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.450
I think before it--
we had done an episode

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.110
about gay Republicans, which
we were expecting that one

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.950
to be very controversial.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.290
And it was to a certain degree.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.600
We did get some pushback
and some tweets and stuff.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.110
But then the "Harry Potter"
came out and just blew it out

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.030
of the water.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.100
People were furious.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.750
KATHY TU: They're
like, how dare you?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.084
SPEAKER 1: How dare you
question Dumbledore's queerness?

00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:06.083
KATHY TU: How dare we
question Rowling, I think.

00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:08.280
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, well, so
I think if you actually

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.010
listen to the episode, it's
like a tongue in cheek,

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.200
but also interesting
conversation

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.780
about representation and
what does it actually

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.480
mean to tell someone's
story and not just do

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.940
like the lip service
of, like, by the way,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:22.881
this person is queer.

00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:23.380
We did it.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.665
We told a queer story.

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:25.290
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.706
TOBIN LOW: So I
think that that's

00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:28.830
what the episode was about.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.890
But there were a lot of people
who saw a headline and were,

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.860
like oh, you are
calling out JK Rowling.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.660
I'm going to tweet
at her and see if we

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.080
can get this going online.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.890
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.390
Yeah.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.960
SPEAKER 1: Get this going?

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.168
Meaning, like, start a fight?

00:17:41.168 --> 00:17:43.205
TOBIN LOW: Like have
her yell at us, yeah.

00:17:43.205 --> 00:17:43.830
SPEAKER 1: Wow!

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.200
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.741
KATHY TU: Actually that would
have been great if she had done

00:17:46.741 --> 00:17:48.120
that, but she didn't.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.710
SPEAKER 1: OK, were
there any other--

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:54.270
so you said the "Harry Potter"
episode as well as the--

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.464
I'm assuming they were
the Log Cabin Republicans?

00:17:56.464 --> 00:17:57.130
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.360
SPEAKER 1: OK, so were
there any other episodes

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.560
that elicited
surprising responses,

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.480
either positive or negative?

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.652
KATHY TU: Surprising responses.

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:07.110
I guess I wasn't
surprised by this,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.776
but when I announced
that I was watching

00:18:08.776 --> 00:18:13.830
"The L Word," people were, like,
I don't know, they freaked out.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.840
I don't know why.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.010
Because I'd never seen it?

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.035
I don't know.

00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:19.410
TOBIN LOW: Well,
I think that was

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.284
one of the episodes
where we were, like, this

00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:23.040
is going to be a niche episode.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.340
Like, some people will
stand really hard for this,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.080
and other people will skip it.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.330
But the passion that
came out, I mean,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.580
people have a lot of
feelings about "The L Word."

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.690
SPEAKER 1: So many feelings,
I have so many feelings.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.260
KATHY TU: I really [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.420
TOBIN LOW: Wait, so who
has watched "The L Word?"

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.230
Anyone?

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.940
A couple people?

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.760
She loves Jenny.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.685
She is Team Jenny.

00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:46.560
SPEAKER 1: I'm sorry.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:46.920
You need to get out.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.076
TOBIN LOW: And-- yeah.

00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:50.670
The last panel we
were on, this came up.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.377
And it ended up, like, we
didn't talk about anything

00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:54.210
else for 20 minutes.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.256
Because people were so
mad that she liked Jenny.

00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:59.130
KATHY TU: Usually there's
one Jenny supporter

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.730
in the audience.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.700
SPEAKER 1: How far through
the series are you?

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.280
KATHY TU: I finished
it, and I decided

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.704
at the end that
Team Jenny, yeah.

00:19:11.704 --> 00:19:12.870
SPEAKER 1: [DRAMATIC EXHALE]

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.592
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.592 --> 00:19:15.300
KATHY TU: I know.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.050
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.360
TOBIN LOW: Wait, are
there any "Buffy" watchers

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.026
in the audience?

00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:19.980
KATHY TU: Oh, you
want to go this--

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.610
TOBIN LOW: OK, she also
loves Faith, which is--

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.589
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

00:19:24.589 --> 00:19:25.422
KATHY TU: Thank you!

00:19:25.422 --> 00:19:26.306
TOBIN LOW: No!

00:19:26.306 --> 00:19:27.190
KATHY TU: Thank you!

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.606
TOBIN LOW: I think
that is insane.

00:19:28.606 --> 00:19:30.660
KATHY TU: He doesn't count
the Angel arc, which,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.559
like, is like, what?

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:32.600
It's the same Buffyverse.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.016
TOBIN LOW: There
have to be rules.

00:19:34.016 --> 00:19:35.044
There have to be rules.

00:19:35.044 --> 00:19:36.210
KATHY TU: Faith all the way.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.043
TOBIN LOW: You like
Faith, and that is nuts.

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:38.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.140
KATHY TU: I also like Willow.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.020
But who doesn't?

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.279
Who doesn't?

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:43.987
TOBIN LOW: It's like
saying I like bread.

00:19:43.987 --> 00:19:45.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.920
KATHY TU: What kind of bread?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.980
TOBIN LOW: Oprah bread.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.300
SPEAKER 1: Mm, bread.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.731
OK.

00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:58.170
All right, so "The L
Word," "Harry Potter"--

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.920
these are all pretty
juicy topics that

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.690
could fill many, many hours.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.900
But you have to cut them down
to 20 to 25 minutes, right?

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.194
Are there any topics--

00:20:09.194 --> 00:20:11.610
I mean, I feel like if you can
fit "The L Word" and "Harry

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.860
Potter" into 20, 25
minutes, you're super human

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.110
and can probably fit anything
into 20 or 25 minutes.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.060
But are there any
topics that you did not

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:23.040
feel you could cover in
that short of a time?

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.060
KATHY TU: I think so.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.920
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.320
I would say if there
are, we're probably

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.600
still trying to
find a way to do it

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.872
and probably
shouldn't say anymore.

00:20:33.872 --> 00:20:34.580
KATHY TU: Oh, OK.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.746
TOBIN LOW: No, I don't know.

00:20:35.746 --> 00:20:38.670
KATHY TU: I was going to say
like things that require deep,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.350
investigative journalism.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.330
I don't that we have the
capacity yet to do it,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.180
but maybe one day in the future.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.346
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, we're still
figuring that part out,

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.020
I think.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:55.650
SPEAKER 1: Awesome, so for
the pieces of pop culture

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:02.220
that you dive into, do
you feel as though these

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.940
require careful consideration,
the pieces of pop culture?

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.370
I was looking here, we've
got "The Golden Girls."

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.380
Again, "Harry Potter"
comes up pretty strongly.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.420
How do you tell stories
about pop culture?

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.760
Because often I
think that we find

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.350
that pop culture has a
particular heteronormative

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.000
skew.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.830
So how do you feel
you address some

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.130
of-- well, heteronormative
and many other normative, very

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.070
normative skew.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.610
But how do you address
issues of pop culture?

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.070
And do you find yourselves
conflicted in addressing

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.225
some of those things?

00:21:36.225 --> 00:21:38.920
KATHY TU: I feel
conflicted all the time,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.770
especially working
on these stories.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.700
Well, things like "The Golden
Girls," for pop culture

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.290
stories, I think we try to find
an angle that hasn't really

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.560
been seen before.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.786
Like, for "Golden Girls,"
we were looking at the--

00:21:56.786 --> 00:21:57.660
what did you call it?

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:03.030
Like, the fandom
around it and what that

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.880
meant to people who are queer,
even though the show wasn't

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.310
explicitly queer.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.520
And we found different
stories about how the show

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.750
itself had affected us.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.930
Instead of doing the
deep dive into making

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.080
that show and the actors
and whether or not

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.910
they liked each
other, even though I

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.410
know all of those stories, too.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.210
But we couldn't talk
about those stories,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.220
because they weren't relevant.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.350
So yeah, I feel like we try
to find an angle that hasn't

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.350
really been covered before.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.530
Do you agree?

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.680
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, well,
I think there's like--

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.200
it's funny.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.380
I think pop culture,
like any of the stories

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.140
we do, we made a very
conscious decision early

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.810
on that no one on the
show would come on

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.951
as a quote, unquote
expert of anything,

00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:49.950
that they would always
be coming from the angle,

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.280
like, this is my personal
relationship to this thing.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.370
So I think when we were
developing "The Golden Girls"

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.855
episode or "The L
Word" episode, there

00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:01.230
were moments where those
stories took the shape of, like,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.270
here is a high level look
at what this show meant.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.280
And then that felt
like kind of what

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.020
you were saying, like it
was trying to do too much.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.260
And so when we buried
down, and it was, like,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.270
oh, this episode is
actually more about

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.520
what people do with
fandom, or what

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.000
people do with something
that's not explicitly queer,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.560
but they reinvent
it for themselves

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.180
or see it through
a different angle

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.310
and find that representation.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.660
Like, that's the moment where
the pop culture episodes

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.810
sort of click for us, when it's
about something else, not just

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.850
the show, if that makes sense.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.550
SPEAKER 1: Does
anybody have questions?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.290
Does anybody want
to pop up to the mic

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.830
quickly and ask some
questions of your own?

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.240
Yeah, go for it.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.732
AUDIENCE: Kind of in the vein
of the Out at Work project,

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:53.940
we talked a lot about your
sort of audience response.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.400
I'd be curious what the
professional response has been,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.840
I'd say both from maybe other
podcasters and maybe folks

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.280
at WNYC, et cetera.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.750
TOBIN LOW: Meaning, how have
they taken to the project?

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.514
AUDIENCE: How have they taken--

00:24:06.514 --> 00:24:08.763
how have they've taken to
the podcast as a whole, sort

00:24:08.763 --> 00:24:13.200
of, yeah, sort of yes,
I guess, in general.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.630
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.120
KATHY TU: Well, WNYC has
been super supportive.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.731
And I feel like we're
very lucky to have

00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:24.480
been able to pilot
this project with them,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.570
because they let us take a
while to really figure out

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.110
what our sound was before we
released it into the wild.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.240
And ever since
it's been out, I've

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.790
heard nothing but good
things from our coworkers.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.860
Maybe they're just being
nice, I don't know.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.693
TOBIN LOW: I mean,
public radio, admittedly,

00:24:39.693 --> 00:24:41.460
is a very crunchy space.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.650
So there is sort of
that support in there,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.020
and a genuine
curiosity for people

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:52.920
to have their own space to talk
about identity and stuff that

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.080
traditionally in larger
media doesn't get talked

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.610
about or covered very much.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:02.010
So I feel WNYC Studios has
been super supportive of us

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.240
and what we're trying to do.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.580
And super supportive,
also, of the fact

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.920
that we have a very specific
audience that we're targeting.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.700
We're not that interested in
my broadening this out into,

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.310
like--

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.050
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.600
TOBIN LOW: I mean, we're not
very interested in targeting

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.690
this, like here's how we explain
queer culture to a larger

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.680
audience.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.180
They were on board
with us being,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.380
like, we are really interested
in targeting specifically

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.940
a queer audience.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.220
And in the specificity
of that storytelling,

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.530
other people will show
up, too, because they

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.460
will feel they are
getting let into a world

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.400
that maybe they don't know
about and are curious about.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.299
So that kind of support
has been really awesome.

00:25:41.299 --> 00:25:43.590
The other thing I'll say,
which we were just realizing,

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.272
is it's kind of hard
to troll a podcast.

00:25:46.272 --> 00:25:46.980
KATHY TU: I know.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:52.440
TOBIN LOW: So somebody who
disagrees with your content

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.020
or doesn't like
queer people, let's

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.570
say, to troll a podcast they
would have to actually listen,

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.920
one, and then find a quote they
don't like, and then tweet us.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.650
And then-- so the times
that that has happened

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:09.900
is lesser than people just
sort of expressing fandom.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.670
So in that sense, I think WNYC
recognizes that podcasting

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:20.100
can be a great space for people
to really express exactly

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.576
what they want to talk about.

00:26:21.576 --> 00:26:23.820
KATHY TU: Of course,
now when you say that,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.105
and the trolls will actually--

00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:26.980
TOBIN LOW: I know, I
just invited the trolls.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.960
KATHY TU: I know.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.390
But if we do get
negative messages,

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.280
it's always reacting
to some headline.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.052
Nobody's actually heard it.

00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:36.510
SPEAKER 1: Have
you had experiences

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.126
of people, the very few
who have trolled you,

00:26:39.126 --> 00:26:40.500
actually listening
to the podcast

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.090
and having their minds changed?

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.465
It sounded like the people
who are trolling you had not--

00:26:44.465 --> 00:26:46.970
it was pretty clear that
they had not listened.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:47.511
KATHY TU: Mm.

00:26:47.511 --> 00:26:49.630
TOBIN LOW: Oh, minds changed.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:54.420
Well, I will say we got an email
very early on that the person

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.080
just sort of declared up top,
I'm a 55-year-old white cis

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.590
male, and I love your show.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.510
And it helps me learn
about x, y, and z.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.270
And our reaction was kind of
like, we were not expecting

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.770
you, sir, but welcome.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.705
KATHY TU: Welcome.

00:27:11.705 --> 00:27:16.200
Yeah, yeah, we get
a few of those.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.334
SPEAKER 1: Got one more.

00:27:17.334 --> 00:27:18.750
AUDIENCE: Apologies
if you already

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.890
answered this at the very
beginning of the talk.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.790
But just wondering, how did you
guys decide on the name "Nancy"

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.767
for the podcast?

00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:26.100
TOBIN LOW: Oh, good, good story.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.310
KATHY TU: Pure frustration.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.745
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:32.760
We originally pitched
the idea as "Gaydio,"

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.940
and then decided that-- well,
number one, it was taken.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:42.360
But also we wanted our title to
be a little bit more inclusive

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.360
on the surface.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.140
If it was just
"Gaydio," I think,

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.500
we didn't want to
alienate anybody that

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.110
doesn't respond to just gay.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.680
So then we went through a
bunch of different puns, all

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.360
the queer puns.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.807
None of them were right.

00:27:58.807 --> 00:28:00.390
And then Tobin one
day was like, we're

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.930
just going to name
it after a person.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.640
TOBIN LOW: Right.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.610
There was a moment
where for a second

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.445
it seemed like a good idea to
name the show "Gay Ponies."

00:28:08.445 --> 00:28:09.070
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.200
That was great.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.710
TOBIN LOW: And so we walked
around for a day being,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.793
like, "Gay Ponies," right?

00:28:11.793 --> 00:28:12.510
This is good?

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.420
Yes?

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:13.920
No?

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.830
OK.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.459
And then we were, like--

00:28:16.459 --> 00:28:18.750
and then truly in a moment
of frustration, I was, like,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.083
let's just give it a human name.

00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:25.620
And then we landed on
this idea that "Nancy" has

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.680
like a nod to queer culture.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.230
It has this history as being a
term, like, a very old school

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.500
term for a gay man.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.070
So we liked that it had this
almost like, friend of Dorothy

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.570
nod.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.340
Like, if you know, you
know kind of thing.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.000
And then we also liked that
there was a bit of reclaiming,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.780
because I think Nancy,
historically, has

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.184
been sort of a negative term.

00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:46.600
And so we liked
that we were going

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.660
to take it, and reclaim it,
and define it as something

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.580
new and fun and joyous.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.209
So like-- and then
there was just

00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:55.000
something irreverent
about naming a fucking

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.271
show after a person.

00:28:56.271 --> 00:28:56.770
You know?

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.650
Like, Nancy, it was
kind of ridiculous.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.490
So it ticked a lot of boxes for
us, and we thought it was fun.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.990
KATHY TU: I'm not going to lie,
I wasn't on board initially,

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.820
but I trusted you.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.815 --> 00:29:07.600
I trusted you.

00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:11.256
Jenny's fine.

00:29:11.256 --> 00:29:13.130
AUDIENCE: So we touched
on this a little bit.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.200
And I think one of
the things I really

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.640
appreciate about the
podcast, and what

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.920
sets it apart from something
like "This American Life"

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.610
is the personal disclosure
piece and a lot of the things

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.000
that you've unpacked
for the world to hear.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.050
Where would you say
you've experienced

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.390
the most personal growth as a
result of that since the time

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.060
you started?

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.740
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.670
KATHY TU: Well, I
feel like that's

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.140
directed at me,
because I figured

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.930
a lot of stuff out via podcast.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:38.522 --> 00:29:39.730
AUDIENCE: Well, both of you--

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.804
I just listened to the pool
party, bathing suit episode.

00:29:42.804 --> 00:29:43.554
So there's a lot--

00:29:43.554 --> 00:29:46.390
KATHY TU: Yeah,
there's a lot of stuff.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.850
I didn't really engage
with queer media

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.140
before this podcast started.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.320
And as soon as Tobin and
I started working on this,

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.520
I was, like, oh my
god, I'm so behind.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.500
And I did a deep dive into it.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.520
But along the way, I feel
like through the podcast,

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.420
I would say, I'm coming
into who I think--

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.880
how I identify, and how I'm
presenting to the world.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.352
And that's been
super beneficial.

00:30:09.352 --> 00:30:10.810
I was driving with
Tobin in LA when

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.220
we were on vacation together.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:17.470
[LAUGHS] And I told him
that I don't think I

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.740
would be where I am now had
this project not come to be.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.900
Because I've worked
through a lot of stuff,

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.010
like coming out to my
mom, cutting my hair,

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.070
being OK with the
fact that I feel

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.370
a stigma towards a certain
word that I now don't really

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.090
anymore.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.850
It's been like a
big step for me.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.340
And then going to
an all queer space

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.170
that originally
I was very scared

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.460
to be in, because there's
too many queer people.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.310
How do I even negotiate that?

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.090
And now I love it.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.190
I'm going back [INAUDIBLE]
camp next year.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.590
So it's been a huge--

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.940
do you feel like I'm growing?

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.440
Do you--

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.760
TOBIN LOW: Oh, yeah.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.301
KATHY TU: OK.

00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:54.586
TOBIN LOW: Every single day.

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.710
KATHY TU: He does learn a
thing about me every day.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:57.376
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:30:57.376 --> 00:30:59.590
KATHY TU: [LAUGHS]
So yeah, that's

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.540
what the podcast
has done for me.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.920
Eternally grateful, Tobin.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.750
Eternally grateful.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.060
TOBIN LOW: That's good.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.101
KATHY TU: What about you?

00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:07.900
Have you changed?

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.230
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, so for
me, I think the challenge

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.070
for me has been that I came
from a radio background

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.460
where I had been used to being
in more of a reporter seat.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.670
So for "Marketplace"
or "More Perfect,"

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.420
it was like the
story is out here,

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.660
and I'm working on
it from a distance.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.380
And so the piece of the
show where we are now

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.300
sort of diving into
our personal lives

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.460
and having to navigate
doing stories about that

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.680
is very new territory for me.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.037
And something that I have
been reluctant to do,

00:31:43.037 --> 00:31:44.870
but I think Kathy has
really set a tone for.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.500
KATHY TU: Just dived
right in there.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:46.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.175
TOBIN LOW: But
like, how to do it

00:31:48.175 --> 00:31:50.350
in a smart way, where
it's not just like here's

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.160
all of my junk.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.160
But also, like, here is my junk,
and what I learned from it,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.360
and what you can hopefully
take a piece of also.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.320
So I think in that way, I
have learned from Kathy.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.090
Because she sort of set a tone
for that in how to do that.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.676
I'm still figuring it out.

00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:09.300
Still talking to my
therapist about it.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.570
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.980
TOBIN LOW: Hey, Michelle,
if she ever watches this.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.220
SPEAKER 1: And Michelle
was like your hi, mom?

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:15.719
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:15.719 --> 00:32:18.550
TOBIN LOW: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.070
SPEAKER 1: So do we have
another question coming up?

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.670
Yeah?

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.796
All right, cool.

00:32:22.796 --> 00:32:25.420
TOBIN LOW: I also just love that
this group is called Gayglers.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.570
KATHY TU: I know.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.170
TOBIN LOW: Is there-- like I
was pitching bad puns before,

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.404
so is the Swedish
Googlers called Guglers?

00:32:33.404 --> 00:32:34.820
KATHY TU: He's got
more, you guys.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.290
Wait for it.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.665
TOBIN LOW: Women who date
younger men, are they Couglers?

00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:38.950
[GROANS FROM AUDIENCE]

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.000
KATHY TU: Here we go.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.680
Here we go.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.930
TOBIN LOW: Feel free to take
any of these, by the way.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.740
KATHY TU: You had another
one that was really good.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.391
TOBIN LOW: Oh, I was, like, are
Halloween enthusiasts Googly

00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:47.890
eyes?

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.479
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:50.770
SPEAKER 1: I love all of these.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.090
I'm so glad we're
recording this,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.610
so that we can have
this for posterity.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.651
TOBIN LOW: Take them all.

00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:56.980
Take them all.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.260
AUDIENCE: I'm a big "Harry
Potter" fan, so definitely

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.670
had reactions to that one.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.310
So the way I react to a lot of
the heteronormative, like books

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.950
and series, is fan fiction.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.450
There's, like, big "Harry
Potter" and other series fan

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.070
fiction to make it queer.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.030
And I wondered if you
had any reactions to that

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:20.620
with people being, like, OK,
but some person's random idea

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.690
explains why,
maybe, Dumbledore is

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.290
gay, like gives
him a background,

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.890
and, like, talks more
about his relationship.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.560
Also "Harry Potter" and
"Voldemort" being in love fan

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.861
fiction is just, like, amazing.

00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:34.970
KATHY TU: Is that true?

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.280
I didn't know that existed!

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.970
AUDIENCE: There's,
like, lots of stories

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.910
about "Harry Potter" and
Voldemort being in love

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.830
and how they take over
the world together.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.704
KATHY TU: Recently, I've
been down the rabbit

00:33:44.704 --> 00:33:48.860
hole about Rombledore, how
Ron is actually Dumbledore.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.620
He goes back in time
and becomes Dumbledore.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.760
I wish Matt was here.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.000
He would really be into this.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.480
TOBIN LOW: He would love this.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.390
I will say, I think when Matt
was working on that story,

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.960
he did have a part of it
talking, more explicitly

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.960
talking about the really
rich fan fiction world that

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.348
has claimed "Harry Potter."

00:34:07.348 --> 00:34:09.889
And then I think it's like what
we were talking about before,

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.889
like that felt like it
could deserve its own story.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:16.489
And so to give it an
almost perfunctory nod

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.184
in this thing that was sort
of about just the books.

00:34:19.184 --> 00:34:20.600
I think we felt,
like, oh, this is

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.010
a thing we should
return to and dive

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.600
into as it's own
thing, because it's

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.562
such an interesting world, what
people do with fan fiction.

00:34:27.562 --> 00:34:28.250
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.130
TOBIN LOW: So yeah, you
should definitely direct us

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.361
to what we should be reading.

00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:33.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'll send you some.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.446
TOBIN LOW: Yeah.

00:34:34.446 --> 00:34:34.971
Please do.

00:34:34.971 --> 00:34:35.929
KATHY TU: We know Matt.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:38.641
He would love it.

00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:40.266
SPEAKER 1: Jen, do
you have a question?

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:42.250
Nice.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.305
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tobin.

00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:45.270
TOBIN LOW: Hi, stranger.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.239
AUDIENCE: So I know you from
a pretty different background

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.800
as a classical cellist.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:55.098
And I'm curious sort of about
your experience growing up,

00:34:55.098 --> 00:34:56.639
I think, thinking
that that was going

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.832
to be your life path, and the
transition that you made there.

00:34:59.832 --> 00:35:00.790
KATHY TU: Hey, hold on.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.730
First question-- do
you have a good Tobin

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.490
story from his cellist days?

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.190
AUDIENCE: I mean his cellist
days are long and varied,

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.065
so yeah, we have plenty
of stories from them.

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:10.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.312 --> 00:35:12.570
TOBIN LOW: Jenna and I
used to play together.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.330
She's an incredible violist.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.330
Does everyone know that?

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.490
She's such a good violist.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.410
And also, like,
annoyingly, somebody

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.750
who's very good at both things.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.060
Like-- your-- well, anyway.

00:35:26.564 --> 00:35:28.730
SPEAKER 1: Jen is annoyingly
good at a lot of stuff,

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.960
actually.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.934
TOBIN LOW: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:29.934 --> 00:35:30.908
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:30.908 --> 00:35:33.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.880
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, so I
started as a cellist

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.587
and did that for a
long time and then

00:35:38.587 --> 00:35:41.170
had the thing that I think a lot
of our musician friends have,

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.020
which is that the
training is very

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:48.250
different than the actual life,
the living of being a musician.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.020
And so at a certain point,
I had been gigging and doing

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.630
orchestra gigs and
that kind of thing

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.312
and just sort of had
enough awareness to be,

00:35:58.312 --> 00:36:00.270
like, I don't think this
is going to sustain me

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.280
for the rest of my life.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.580
And then the cool
thing about radio

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.770
is it's kind of an
island of lost toys,

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.260
like, there's a lot of people
who started in one thing

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.610
and sort of found
their way into radio.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.970
And I think what made
the transition easier

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.360
for me is that I feel
like radio exercises

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.840
a lot of the parts of my brain
that I used as a cellist.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.020
So you're not just
telling somebody's story,

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.260
but you are telling
it almost musically.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.900
You have to have a sense
of pacing and dynamics

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.610
and sometimes literally
working with music.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.940
And so radio kind
of felt like a--

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.520
it felt somehow like
a related jump-ish,

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.440
to feed this intellectual
part of myself

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.100
that I wanted to take advantage
of and then also still use

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.930
the musical part of my brain.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.270
That being said,
I was very aware

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.700
that I was jumping
from a niche thing

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.200
that I probably
wasn't going to make

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.110
much money in to
another niche thing

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.886
that I probably wasn't
going to make much money in.

00:37:07.886 --> 00:37:09.760
So there was a moment--
there were definitely

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.093
moments in there where I was
like, this is the stupidest

00:37:12.093 --> 00:37:14.020
fucking thing I've ever done.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.070
But it worked out OK.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.395
But Kathy also--

00:37:16.395 --> 00:37:17.270
KATHY TU: Same thing.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.390
I was in another career,
and then I quit it,

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.695
and then we became friends.

00:37:21.695 --> 00:37:23.320
SPEAKER 1: Are you
OK with sharing what

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.330
that career was before you--

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.330
KATHY TU: Oh yeah, I went to law
school, and then I graduated.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.663
And then I was, like, don't
really want to practice law.

00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:30.640
And I decided to go
to Transom, the boot

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.440
camp where Tobin and I met.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.160
But it's sort of similar
in that I've always enjoyed

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.300
detailed things.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.000
And so law was great for that.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.980
And now, the way Tobin
and I work together--

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.080
he's such a big picture
guy, about structure

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.930
and how a story
should fit together.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.260
And I'm more about the
intimate details of when

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.720
a piece of music should start.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.680
Should it move over
just a microsecond?

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.780
Or whether this cut
works because it doesn't

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.180
sound natural to my ear?

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.150
And we tend to-- we fit
together, like a puzzle piece.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:06.552 --> 00:38:07.510
SPEAKER 1: I'm curious.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.970
For a lot of us
who are exploring

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:13.169
what it is like to be--

00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:15.460
and this probably hearkens
back a little bit to the Out

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.130
at Work project, but
are sort of exploring

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.420
what it's like to be out
in one way or another

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.450
in the workplace.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.269
And I think that we're
very lucky in many ways

00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:28.060
here at Google in
comparison, particularly,

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.660
to some of the places that I've
been where I was really not

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.790
able to be out, that
we have a pretty

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.760
supportive company and a
supportive community here.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.760
I'm interested to
know if you came

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.160
into any personal
conflicts or challenges

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.170
with moving into
the space of being

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.170
sort of professionally out.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.470
Was that scary?

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.840
Were you worried about
putting yourselves

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.040
into this sort of semi or very
public space and any backlash

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.409
that you might get?

00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:00.200
KATHY TU: I mean, I
was nervous about being

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.340
a semi-public person.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.970
But that's just a
personal anxiety thing.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:05.990
I'm a privacy nut.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.880
So that was weird.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.930
Did you have any?

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.721
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, well,
I think one thing we

00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:14.020
both talked about is that we--

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.740
I don't think we ever wanted to
go into this suddenly becoming

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.250
like the voice of the gays.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.250
Do you know what I mean?

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.160
Or like, the queer voice.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.360
So I think there was a
moment where we were, like,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.340
if we do this show, and we
don't do it the right way,

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.430
it's going to come off as if
we think we know everything,

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:37.520
or like as if anyone who's on
the show is an expert somehow.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.300
And I think one of
the blessings of being

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.350
able to do stories is
that from the jump,

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.960
you're starting from
this is this person's

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.010
personal experience.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.470
They are speaking
from what they know

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.907
and sort of telling
their piece of it.

00:39:52.907 --> 00:39:55.240
And so once we sort of figured
out-- like, oh, as hosts,

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.830
we can do that also.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.714
We can say we don't
know all the answers.

00:39:58.714 --> 00:40:00.130
Part of this show
is, like, trying

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.290
to figure out some
answers, or figure out

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.110
a piece of an answer.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.000
I think that was an--

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.730
but there was a lot of fear
at the beginning of ever being

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:13.480
booked on a, like, CNN
new show as a talking head

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.550
and, like, this
queer thing happened.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.920
What do the queers think?

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.740
KATHY TU: Thoughts?

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.830
TOBIN LOW: Tobin and Kathy,
tell us what all of you think?

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.630
And that's very much a thing
we immediately moved away from.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.470
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:28.270
Yeah, no.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.000
TOBIN LOW: The other thing
is that now my mom sends me

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.400
every article she reads that has
a remotely queer thing in it.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.880
So it's, like, such and
such gay person did this.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.350
KATHY TU: On the
flip side, my mom

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.179
thinks I'm doing an
internship in New York.

00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:45.220
Because she doesn't
understand radio, and she is,

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.803
like, devastated
about this law thing.

00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:48.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.342
Very devastated.

00:40:51.342 --> 00:40:53.050
Every conversation
is, like, when are you

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.390
going to take the bar exam?

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.990
Eventually, I will.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.740
SPEAKER 1: Oh, no, she
still thinks you're

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.740
going to take that bar exam?

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.800
KATHY TU: I promised her
I would at some point.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.730
TOBIN LOW: Sometimes
you're, like,

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.050
I should just take
it to appease her.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.190
I'm, like, that is insane.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.379 --> 00:41:13.420
SPEAKER 1: On that note,
do you feel comfortable,

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.400
and you can certainly
say no, sharing

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.710
your stories about coming
out to your parents

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.281
and what that was like?

00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:21.030
KATHY TU: Do you want
to share your story?

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.940
TOBIN LOW: Sure.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.557
I came out to my parents--

00:41:24.557 --> 00:41:26.640
this is covered a little
bit in our first episode.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.760
It's covered a lot a bit
in our first episode.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.090
But if you haven't
heard, I came out

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:38.900
to my parents Thanksgiving break
of my freshman year of college.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.350
And my mom's reaction
was basically like, well,

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.912
as long as we're sharing, I
think you've gained weight.

00:41:43.912 --> 00:41:45.745
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:45.745 --> 00:41:46.890
Was, like--

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:47.360
KATHY TU: Your mom's the best.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.450
TOBIN LOW: --reaction
number one.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:49.470
SPEAKER 1: Damn, Mom.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.310
TOBIN LOW: Yeah,
yeah, she immediately

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:52.720
went back to the truth bombs.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.824
KATHY TU: Yeah, she's
still dropping them.

00:41:54.824 --> 00:41:55.990
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.990
So that was her.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.720
And then my dad, we
had this funny thing

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.030
where he at the
time was obsessed

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.460
with "Queer Eye for
the Straight Guy,"

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.794
which I had very
complicated feelings about.

00:42:07.794 --> 00:42:09.460
I didn't really see
myself in that show,

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.850
and I didn't really feel it
helped me figure out myself.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.410
But for my dad,
it was this thing

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.320
where that same year he had
seen "Brokeback Mountain,"

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.650
and I had asked him to see it.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.440
And his reaction was, like,
why did you ask me to see that?

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.510
It's a story about how that can
be hard and ultimately deadly

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.997
for some people to come out.

00:42:30.997 --> 00:42:33.580
And so it was this weird thing
where his fandom of "Queer Eye"

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.990
actually helped him a lot.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.870
Because it helped
him imagine that I

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:43.630
could be a happy adult person
who is leading a full life.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.322
Even though those guys
were, like, literally,

00:42:46.322 --> 00:42:48.030
redecorate your
apartment and then leave.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:49.154 --> 00:42:51.070
KATHY TU: Would you call
them literal fairies?

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.247
TOBIN LOW: Yeah, there
was an aspect where

00:42:54.247 --> 00:42:56.330
you don't have to engage
in their rights, just let

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.289
them paint your walls.

00:42:57.289 --> 00:42:58.580
KATHY TU: And get out of there.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.700
TOBIN LOW: Now leave.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.800
So anyway, we had this funny
thing where I hated the show,

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.550
he loved the show.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.820
But it became like a
translation tool for us.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.310
So that was kind of
my coming out thing.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.640
KATHY TU: I think I had a
more classic coming out.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.500
I came out to my mom, my
parents, both of them.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.920
And then my mom screamed
at me over the phone.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.890
And then I tried it again
later, and she didn't talk to me

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.370
at all about it.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.840
And then I went to
Burning Man, and I

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.150
had a moment at the
temple, in which I was,

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.350
like, I got to do this again.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.117
So then I came out again
to my mom, and I brought--

00:43:34.117 --> 00:43:36.200
at the time, I thought it
was a translation issue.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.650
I thought if she understood
what I was actually saying,

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.230
then she wouldn't feel
the way that she does,

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.360
which was completely wrong.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.620
She absolutely feels-- she
understood the whole time.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.542
And she was not OK with it.

00:43:49.542 --> 00:43:51.500
And we had this conversation,
and I recorded it

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.130
because I felt like every
time we talked about it,

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.900
it just went away, and it just
wasn't going to be around.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.370
And I wanted to acknowledge
that I had come out to her.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.900
So to me, I didn't
want to feel insane.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.090
So I recorded it.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.340
And then it became the
basis of our first episode.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.060
So really, the podcast came
around because of Burning Man.

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.550
TOBIN LOW: Oh god.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:20.210
If that's true,
I quit right now.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.640
But what did you use to make
sure that she understood you?

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.817
KATHY TU: Google Translate!

00:44:24.817 --> 00:44:25.442
SPEAKER 1: Hey.

00:44:25.442 --> 00:44:27.487
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:27.487 --> 00:44:30.580
Man, we've got Docs,
Translate, Reader.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.580
KATHY TU: You guys, I
don't have my phone on me.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.170
SPEAKER 1: You
should just move in.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.020
KATHY TU: I love the Google
Pixel, if anybody has--

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:36.610
TOBIN LOW: Now we're
just pandering.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:37.535
KATHY TU: --information
about Google Pixel 2--

00:44:37.535 --> 00:44:39.110
TOBIN LOW: Now we're
just pandering.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:40.610
KATHY TU: --I would
love to hear it.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.360
SPEAKER 1: Me, too.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:41.600
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.400
SPEAKER 1: Actually.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:42.960
KATHY TU: That would be great.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:43.940
Thank you.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.016
Yeah.

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:46.640
SPEAKER 1: Anybody
else have questions?

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.274
I'm taking up--

00:44:47.274 --> 00:44:48.440
KATHY TU: Also Google Fiber.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.570
I can't wait for that.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:50.570
SPEAKER 1: Google Fiber.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:51.710
I'm on the Fiber team.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:52.170
We were talking about it before.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:53.461
KATHY TU: I use Google Domains.

00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:55.350
Like, I am all over Google.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.950
TOBIN LOW: Now she's
just trying to get a job.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.120
KATHY TU: We were just
talking on the train over.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.661
You guys should
start Google Resumes,

00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:02.990
and let that be
the new LinkedIn.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.045
Anybody?

00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:04.545
Anybody?

00:45:04.545 --> 00:45:06.795
SPEAKER 1: You are giving
away all of your good ideas.

00:45:06.795 --> 00:45:07.760
KATHY TU: I know!

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.340
When this thing implodes,
like, I want to work here.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:12.072 --> 00:45:13.000
Sorry, Tobin.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.732
No, anybody?

00:45:13.732 --> 00:45:14.690
TOBIN LOW: Well, that--

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.120
OK so, I'm curious
how often people

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.170
think that you guys
have insane technology

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.420
and actually are, like, well--

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.170
that's a ways off.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.836
Probably you can't
answer that question.

00:45:25.836 --> 00:45:27.505
It's a curiosity that I have.

00:45:27.505 --> 00:45:28.880
SPEAKER 1: Is
there anything else

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.714
that you'd like to share with
all of us before we wrap up?

00:45:32.714 --> 00:45:34.880
KATHY TU: I'm not joking
about working here one day.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.170
TOBIN LOW: OK, easy.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.801
SPEAKER 1: We'll stay in touch.

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:39.135
We'll stay in touch.

00:45:39.135 --> 00:45:41.510
Yeah, anything else you'd like
to share about the podcast

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:45.500
or about your experience
with the podcast?

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.720
TOBIN LOW: I would
just, again, plug,

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.960
if anyone has interest in
filling out our survey,

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.770
we really are just fascinated
by people's stories

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.360
and want to collect
as many as we can.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.600
And it helps the project be
more representative, too.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.330
So NancyPodcast.org/Work.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.640
KATHY TU: Yeah, if you
share with your networks.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.297
SPEAKER 1: Now I kind of want
podcast to be my full-time job.

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:08.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:08.755 --> 00:46:11.760
Talking about queer things
and answering people's pitches

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.260
for stories.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.254
Does anyone have any pitches
for stories while we're here?

00:46:15.254 --> 00:46:16.670
KATHY TU: Ooh,
live pitch session.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.830
SPEAKER 1: Live pitch
session happening now.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:19.720
KATHY TU: I don't
think I could do that.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:19.970
SPEAKER 1: No?

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:20.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.990
SPEAKER 1: Can you
pop up to the mic?

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:23.030
Sorry.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.540
TOBIN LOW: Aw.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.248
SPEAKER 1: Sorry.

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:26.720
KATHY TU: But look
at that bow tie.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.010
AUDIENCE: Or
Pennywise from "It."

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.440
TOBIN LOW: And [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.340
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:31.820
KATHY TU: No, I haven't.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.960
AUDIENCE: Do you like
[? Bubble ?] [? Wise ?]

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.100
and they're dating.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.170
And they like to wear
extravagant clothing,

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.430
and, like, kill children.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.860
Like there's a whole thing
you could do on this.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.000
TOBIN LOW: So here's the thing.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.597
There are so many
gay Twitter things

00:46:45.597 --> 00:46:47.180
that I would love
to do a story about.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.590
But it moves so fast.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:49.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.506
Like, for a second
I was, like, we

00:46:50.506 --> 00:46:52.110
have to do a Park
[? Stinton ?] thing.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.276
But I don't know if anyone
is familiar with the Park

00:46:54.276 --> 00:46:58.640
[? Stinton. ?] It was
like some fake twink

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.010
on Twitter catfished
a bunch of guys.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.970
And it was, like, gay
Twitter blew up about it.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.390
And then it disappeared
within a day.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.900
Anyway, this is all to say, yes.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.820
I am hungry to do
something about it.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.770
It's a challenge,
because it moves so fast.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.530
But it's fascinating.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.030
Yeah.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:15.620
KATHY TU: So yes.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.410
TOBIN LOW: We can be quote
unquote [? "baba ?] shook."

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.742
I sounded so uncool saying that.

00:47:22.742 --> 00:47:24.200
SPEAKER 1: How long
does it usually

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.877
take you to come up with an
idea and then record the podcast

00:47:27.877 --> 00:47:28.710
and then get it out?

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.330
What is that timeline?

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:29.990
KATHY TU: Oh, it depends.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.010
SPEAKER 1: So that
we know, in case we

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.093
want to pitch any stories.

00:47:32.093 --> 00:47:33.810
We know when to look for it.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.226
KATHY TU: It really depends
on when we start working on it

00:47:36.226 --> 00:47:39.200
and then how we see it
fitting into our schedule.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.720
Like, "The L Word"
story started right

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.300
at the end of the last season.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.760
Because I was on vacation
when I started watching it.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.200
And then we had to turn it
around within a few weeks.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.310
But we've had stuff, like,
our Orlando episode took

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.430
six months, I think.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.112
Because we went there, and
then we did all the recordings.

00:47:56.112 --> 00:47:58.070
And then we came back,
and we had so many hours

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:59.160
of tape to work through.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.670
TOBIN LOW: We had
16 hours of tape

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:01.836
when we came back from that.

00:48:01.836 --> 00:48:05.150
And then that got cut down
into a 40 minute episode.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:08.480
So that one was, like,
yeah, like six months

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.722
to get that one done?

00:48:09.722 --> 00:48:11.930
KATHY TU: Maybe on average,
like, six to eight weeks.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:12.920
I'm not sure.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.134
It really depends.

00:48:14.134 --> 00:48:15.800
SPEAKER 1: So not
Twitter timeline then.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.365
That's like--

00:48:16.365 --> 00:48:17.240
TOBIN LOW: It's hard.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.890
It's tough.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:18.130
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:18.860
SPEAKER 1: There and gone, yeah.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.580
KATHY TU: Yeah.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.704
SPEAKER 1: A huge thank
you to you both for coming.

00:48:21.704 --> 00:48:24.054
A huge thank you to
WNYC Studios, also,

00:48:24.054 --> 00:48:25.970
for being amazing and
bringing these folks in.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:26.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.062
Huge round of applause.

00:48:28.062 --> 00:48:28.770
KATHY TU: Thanks.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.060
TOBIN LOW: Thank you
so much for coming.
