00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.860
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.550
AUDIENCE: Hi!

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.633
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Hi.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.180
All right.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.610
That's a lively crowd today.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.390
So let's make sure
my clicker works.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.020
Perfect.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.590
So hello, again.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.110
My name is Eitan
Marder-Eppstein,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.640
and I lead the developer,
engineering, and relations team

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.660
for Project Tango.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.500
And today I'd like to share
a bit about our projects

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.710
as well as where we're
going for the future.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.610
But before I do that, I normally
start off the presentation--

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.630
just by show of
hands, how many of you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.440
have heard of
Project Tango before?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.940
Whoa.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.260
This is probably
the best response

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.800
that I've gotten to that.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.340
I would say 3/4 of
you raised your hand.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.890
So for those of you who don't
know what Project Tango is,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.340
hopefully this will
serve as a nice overview.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.680
And for those of you who do know
about the project, hopefully

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.420
it shows the progress
we've made as well as where

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.770
we're going for the future.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.620
All right.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.090
So at a fundamental
level, Project Tango

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.800
stems from the observation
that today interactions

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.710
with our phones really ends at
the square box of the screen.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.620
And whether you're
at home browsing

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.800
the internet for a new appliance
for your kitchen, or at work

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.320
planning for a project
that you're going to build,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.860
or out at dinner socializing
with your friends at a table,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.450
your phone is with
you, but it really

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.170
lacks an understanding
of your environments.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.140
You're limited by the
boundaries of the screen.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.560
And what Project Tango hopes
to do is to break this boundary

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.080
and to bring your phone
and the world more

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.630
in tune with each other.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.300
So we want to teach phones
to see and understand

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.010
their environments.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.900
And we would like to
augment and improve

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.840
our own ability to
answer questions

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.050
about the world around us.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.380
Those questions might be things
like, how much paint do I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.450
need for a wall in
my room if I'm going

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.730
to be repainting my house?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.400
Or will the couch I'm going
to buy online actually fit

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.320
in my room?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.190
I recently bought a sleeper
sofa and made a big mistake.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.720
Or how do I get from
where I am to the laundry

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.060
detergent in a store?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.240
So Project Tango allows us
to answer these questions

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.720
and more.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.700
And we use special cameras
and inertial sensors

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.160
that we've built into phones
to make sense of the world

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.630
much like we do.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.870
And we allow the phone to build
a human-scale understanding

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.040
of space and motion.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.640
And then we expose this
understanding to application

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.800
developers by adding three core
technologies to mobile devices,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.640
and I'll talk about each
of them a little bit here.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.320
So the first one
is motion tracking,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.710
the second is area learning, and
the third is depth perception.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.710
Motion tracking allows Tango
devices to track their position

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.810
and orientation in space.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.610
As the phone is moved
through the environments,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.670
it keeps a log of its trajectory
to within centimeters.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.340
This works almost like a
mouse but in full six degrees

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.570
of freedom.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.700
Area learning allows Project
Tango devices to recognize

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.780
where they've been before.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.870
When a distinctive visual
landmark like a sign,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.720
or a poster, or a
picture is seen,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.740
the device stores
this in its memory.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.710
And the next time it or any
other Project Tango device

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.430
sees this visual fingerprint
of sorts, the device

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.720
recognizes its precise
location in the world.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.390
So I could walk into
a store and recognize

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.630
that I'm at the
checkout register

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.240
just by seeing a sign
above the cashier.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.980
And the third technology that
we expose is depth perception,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.150
and this allows
Project Tango devices

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.330
to see the world
in three dimensions

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.430
And we've done this by
adding additional sensors,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.260
special depth cameras,
to mobile phones.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.460
This allows your
phone to understand

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.130
the full geometric
structure and also

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.020
the scale-- the metric
scale-- of your environments.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.460
So to give a more
concrete idea about what

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.540
this technology enables--
it's nice to talk about it--

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.410
but what I'm going to do
is show a video giving

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.630
an overview of the
technology that we've built.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.500
And then I'm also going to
show a couple of live demos

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.430
on stage just to give you a
feel for what this enables.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.710
So I'll play the video now, and
then do demos right after that.

00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:17.694
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:36.647 --> 00:08:37.146
OK.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:47.210
So as you saw, I think that's
some pretty powerful and cool

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.900
stuff, but there's still nothing
like seeing it in action.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.550
We don't have a
ton of time today,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.570
but I'd like to run through
at least a couple of demos

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.050
to give you a better sense
of the types of applications

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.520
that we're building on
top of this technology.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.630
I will also be available after
this session at office hours.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.570
And just a little
plug-- if you come,

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.320
I'll let you play with
the device yourself

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.050
so you can handle it.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.830
So to start off with, I
always like to give insight.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.460
Can we switch to the
device, by the way?

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.351
Whoever-- oh, awesome.

00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:24.850
All right.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.120
So to start off
with, I always like

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.200
to give a little bit of
insight into what is actually

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.190
going on under the hood.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.720
So here you see an image
from a wide-angle camera

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.050
that is mounted on the
back of the device.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.790
And you'll see a bunch of
colored dots in the world

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.260
as well as some
plots on the screen,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.870
and the colored dots
are visual features

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.000
that we're tracking
across frames.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.530
So we're looking for points
that are on corners or anywhere

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.360
where there is a
change in contrast.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.050
And we're actually tracking
that in our video feed

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.160
and fusing the data
together with information

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.860
from the accelerometers and
gyroscopes on the device-- so

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.460
the inertial sensors.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.670
And here, as I rotate,
you're probably

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.390
used to seeing that even
just from a gyroscope,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.350
but I can actually start walking
around the space assuming

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.930
my cable doesn't let me down.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.030
And I can return to
roughly where I was before,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.120
so the device
understands how I've

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.310
moved through the environments.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.330
Now, we've also
got a depth sensor

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.020
on the device which allows
us to see the world in 3D.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.520
So when we combine the ability
to track the device's position

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.540
as you move through space
with the ability of it

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.970
to see in three dimensions--
this stage is mostly green,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.080
but we'll try and build
a little bit of a model.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.110
Maybe I can get some of
you all in the front.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.770
So as I move around
the world, you

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.340
can see that very
quickly I'm able to gain

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.280
a pretty nice,
geometric understanding

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.150
of my environments.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.440
And this is powerful.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.900
This ties your device
to the physical world.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.160
And when you have
this relationship,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.940
you can start
building applications

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.370
that before were not possible.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.250
So one example of
an application is--

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.370
say I want to take a basic
measurement on this wall.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:26.500
So I can measure that
that's 0.8 meters,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.080
but you're noticing that
it's not just a single frame.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.710
I can walk around
the environment.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.830
I can walk up to the
front of the stage,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.610
and I can produce measurements
that are tied to the space

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.500
that I'm in through the frame
of the device moving around.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.020
Other things that
I can do-- say I

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.380
was interested in
hanging a picture here,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:56.120
and I wanted to know roughly
the size of the wall.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.640
I can also measure area.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.640
So you can do things
very, very quickly

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.770
that would take time otherwise.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.920
I can also do things like
measure through walls.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.980
If I wanted to drill through
a wall, you can place a point,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.150
walk through to the other room,
and place in other points.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.880
I almost want to go
backstage to do it,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.780
but I feel like that
might be a bad idea.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.310
So this is really powerful.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.070
You're augmenting your world,
and you're answering questions

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:27.300
that we as humans have trouble
with through the device.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.070
Other applications
that you can use

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.920
leveraging this same
technology involve

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.050
being able to shop for furniture
or for other household items

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.360
online in a much
more practical way.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.910
So I referenced before that
I really screwed up my sofa,

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.540
but now I can drag
items into the world.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.240
I can look at them from
different perspectives.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.060
I can get right up-close.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.750
If I want to, I can
change the color.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:03.210
And the beauty of this is
that this chair is at scale.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:07.300
So if it fits in my
room, I know that I'm OK.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.170
I can also drag another
chair here and align it.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.260
I think it should snap.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.730
Well, all right--
having trouble snapping.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:26.940
But I can place furniture in
my space very, very easily

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.330
and see how it actually looks.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.430
And this application was
a partnership, actually,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.480
with Elemental Studio
who did the application

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.030
design and Lowe's
who now advertises

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.030
that if you need a new
fridge, you can check it out

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.770
in this application.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.270
All right.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.590
So that's a practical
use of the technology,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.620
but we also believe that
this technology has the power

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.470
to unlock our
imaginations and to allow

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.970
us to have a little bit of fun.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.510
So this stage was made
for this demo, I swear.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.260
So this is Mittens.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.760
He's a cat but virtual.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.590
And you can see that
I can go up to him,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.920
and he knows where I am,
and he'll paw the device.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.630
But then other
things that Mittens

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.770
can do-- he'll follow
me around the world--

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.860
is that mittens understands the
geometry of the environment.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.680
So he can actually
jump onto this surface

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.690
because we have an
underlying model

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.550
of what the surface looks like.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:36.096
And when you take augmented
reality and mix it

00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:38.470
with the ability to understand
the geometry of the world,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.710
it becomes much,
much more powerful.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:46.300
So you can change Mittens
to Rufus or to Gray the cat

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.490
who has really big
eyes-- if you like.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.180
And they can follow
you around the space,

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.280
and they'll walk
with you as you move.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.600
And then the last
fun application

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.420
that I'll show-- it's another
game that I will challenge

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.870
folks to beat me at
during office hours--

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.260
is Schell Games that
one of our workshops

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.390
decided that Jenga was a
really, really annoying game

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:22.800
to play normally, I guess.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.270
You have to stack the
blocks, they fall down,

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.380
you have to restack them.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.830
It's not so much fun.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.410
So they made virtual Jenga.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.420
You can see that
it's on this surface.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.790
And I can take a block, and
I can move it to the top

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.460
and stack it.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.460
And it's supposed to
be a two player game,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.100
but I guess I'm going
to win no matter what.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.540
And you can see that it's a
very natural interaction where

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.910
you're using the device
as a six degree of freedom

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.130
controller-- interacting
with a virtual object tied

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.430
to the real space.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.450
And then this is not
going to go well.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.040
OK.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:09.250
So I lost Jenga to myself, but
now I don't have to clean up.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:14.640
So if I wanted to, I could
just restart the application,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.300
hold tight for a second,
and have my tower

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.580
rebuilt in front of me.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.070
All right.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:30.860
So can we switch back
to the main screen?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.030
So those are all of the demos
that I have for you today.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.350
But I hope-- clicker.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.210
Oh, this went
backwards-- seconds.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.350
OK.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.910
Those are all the demos that
I'm going to show for you today,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.280
but I hope it gave an idea
of the kinds of applications

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.630
that can be built on top of this
technology and the power of it.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.840
All of the demos that
I showed are currently

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.599
running on our
Development Kit hardware.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.369
But this has actually
been a progression for us,

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:14.579
so it's taken many iterations
of hardware and software

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.579
to get to a platform stable
enough to build these apps

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.589
and to have them work reliably.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.480
And we are starting
now to partner

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.619
with OEMs and
chipset manufacturers

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.410
to bring this technology
to the masses.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.650
This is no longer
us playing around.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.900
And, in fact, at
CES last week we

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.000
announced the world's first
Project Tango smartphone.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.930
So Google, in
collaboration with Lenovo,

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.840
is going to build a
smartphone that will

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.080
launch in the summer of 2016.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.140
It'll have a mainstream
price points under $500,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.490
and it will launch globally
including in the US.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.530
And we know that with a launch
of this size and scale, just

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.540
putting the device out
there isn't enough.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.900
We really need to have
applications and compelling use

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.450
cases to make this
product a success.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.180
And to build them
we're looking for help,

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.490
so we're looking to partner
with developers in this space.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.550
And to this end,
we've launched what

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.850
we're calling the App Incubator
program for Project Tango.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.590
This is, again, a collaboration
between Google and Lenovo.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.910
And through this
program we're looking

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.650
for developers and
studios who are

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.990
passionate about
the technology, who

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.100
are passionate about
the space, and who

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.730
have ideas about what they could
build on top of this platform.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.930
And then Google and Lenovo
will work with these companies

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.510
to provide funding,
to provide supports,

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.190
and to help make your vision
and your dream of what

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.330
you could do with an
application and platform

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.640
like this a reality.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.080
There will be opportunities
to be featured on the device

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.530
as it launches,
and Lenovo has also

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.940
stated a desire to
have some of these apps

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:16.050
be preinstalled on the device--
opening up the market that will

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.350
be exposed to your technology.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:23.290
And we are accepting
proposals for applications

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.850
through February
15, 2016, so we're

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.590
looking to make decisions as
to what applications we fund

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.540
in the relatively near future.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.730
You can go to
google.com/projecttango,

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.420
and you'll find more information
on applying for the program.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.310
So if you have an
idea that you're

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.010
passionate about
for this platform,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.780
we really, really
want to hear from you.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.300
We know that this can't
happen without creative input,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.820
and we know that
we don't have all

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.390
of the great ideas that could be
built on top of this platform.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.220
I'll conclude by just saying
that we have APIs for C,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.680
for Java, and we have a
tight integration with Unity.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.160
And we are also working on
an integration with Unreal

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.260
as well.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.830
So if you use any
of those programming

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.010
platforms for
Android, Tango should

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.430
be relatively easy to pick up.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.240
I want to leave some
time for questions,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.830
so I'll take those now.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.630
I think I've been told there
are mics up front and one

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.320
in the top, so I'll
take questions.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.286
Yes.

00:20:38.286 --> 00:20:42.133
AUDIENCE: How accurate is
that IR sensor in Tango?

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:42.633
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:47.707 --> 00:20:49.290
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.510
was how accurate
is the IR sensor?

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.280
So you don't get direct
access to the infrared camera

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.360
with Tango.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.640
I can talk about the
accuracy of depth,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.690
but as far as seeing through
walls-- that's something

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.590
that's a little bit hard to do.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:11.550
But the depth is accurate to
about 3% over the distance

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.630
that you measure.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.950
Does that makes sense?

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.586
OK.

00:21:14.586 --> 00:21:15.086
Yes.

00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:17.644
AUDIENCE: How does it
deal with wacky lighting

00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:21.340
and crazy shadows like
the shadows [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.340
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Yeah, so the question was

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.340
how does Tango deal with wacky
lighting, or crazy shadows,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.630
or changes in the environment?

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.370
I think you saw in the
video Tango working

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.800
in the presence
of a lot of people

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.780
that were all moving around.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.400
And the device
has the capability

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.430
to recognize what
are dynamic obstacles

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.330
in the scene versus static.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.280
And as long as it
can see some points

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.450
that it can track over time,
it's able to keep its position.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.510
Yeah, so if you move in
front of the Tango device,

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.370
you'll actually see
the points on you.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.650
In that display I
showed, they'll turn red.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.320
And what that means is,
hey, that is not a thing

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.600
that I should be basing--

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.005
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:04.130
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yes.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.260
Yeah.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.140
And then for lighting the
camera changes its exposure

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.960
based on the lighting to try and
maximize the ability to track.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.750
And that's the other reason we
have that wide-angle camera.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.460
We want to see as much
of the world as possible

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.276
because if you take
a narrow-angle camera

00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:21.900
and you walk really
close to that wall,

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.360
you'll just see white.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.660
But the wide-angle gives
us a very wide field

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.020
of view of the world and helps
the robustness of our system.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.050
You in the-- yes-- jacket.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:33.560
Yeah.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.035
You'd put your hand down.

00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:37.034
AUDIENCE: So I'm assuming
all this processing is

00:22:37.034 --> 00:22:38.808
happening on the device, right?

00:22:38.808 --> 00:22:41.676
And all you need [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:48.100
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.890
So the question was we assume
that all the processing is

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.680
happening on the device,
which is correct.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.250
All of the processing is
happening on the device.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.300
And how easy is it to
develop a simple app?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.660
So there-- getting up
and running with Tango

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.090
is very, very easy.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.570
In Unity, it takes
less than 10 minutes

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.910
to have a basic
motion controlled

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.300
camera in a virtual scene.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.480
In C and Java-- maybe up
that to 30 minutes to an hour

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.760
just to get everything set-up.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.240
And developers.googl
e.com/projecttango has all

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.470
of the entry points
for our tutorials,

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.270
and I'm also very happy to
talk about that at office hours

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.470
as well.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.990
You standing in the back.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.316
Yeah.

00:23:34.316 --> 00:23:36.330
AUDIENCE: So does Google
or any of its partners

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:42.220
have plans for, say,
planetary scale SLAM

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.047
geospatial database-- sort of
like an Instagram for Tango?

00:23:47.047 --> 00:23:48.630
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.700
was does Google have
plans to, I guess,

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.530
map the world with Tango?

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.970
So at Google we're always
interested in mapping

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.130
the world.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.760
We do think that this technology
has a lot of potential

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.580
for indoor navigation.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.070
So we've started with some
trials where you go to a mall,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.660
and you turn on the device,
and you can do things

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.840
like get directed to a store
with turn-by-turn directions.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.850
I know I could have used this
at CES last week, actually.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.780
Vegas is not good for
indoor navigation.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.380
And you can also
do things like try

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.850
and find your
friends because you

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.500
have a shared coordinate frame.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.250
So it's an exploration
that we're beginning.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.550
We do think location-based
experiences and navigation

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.000
experiences are
one of the pillars

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.170
that we'll explore
for this technology.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:42.015
AUDIENCE: So no Google Maps
integration out of the box?

00:24:42.015 --> 00:24:44.390
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: I cannot
comment about Google Maps

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.820
integration.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.490
Yeah.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.531
AUDIENCE: Is there any
compatibility from Project

00:24:49.531 --> 00:24:51.495
Tango with Intel's RealSense?

00:24:51.495 --> 00:24:52.620
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yes.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:59.260
So Intel has announced the
availability of developer kits

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.180
that run Project Tango
integrated with their RealSense

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.550
cameras.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:12.730
And I believe they're $399, so
you can today go and preorder

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.740
an Intel RealSense device that
has Project Tango capabilities.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.130
And we're working with them
as well as our other chipset

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.440
partners.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.310
Other questions?

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.977
You in the front
row in the back.

00:25:24.977 --> 00:25:25.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.260
Do you see a future with
Project Tango and gaming

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.035
with Google Cardboard, for
example-- virtual headset,

00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:32.564
you know, [INAUDIBLE] HMDs?

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:33.730
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.480
So I think Project--
the question

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.450
was do you see a future for
Project Tango with gaming?

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.310
And I think that
there is a huge future

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.680
for Project Tango with gaming.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.860
I think there's
also a huge future

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:52.090
for using Project Tango for any
kind of positional tracking.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.170
And you can think about
extensions to that.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.540
We've played around with taking
it and putting it in an HMD.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.890
There are other problems
with that like screen refresh

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.450
latency and all of the problems
that come along with that.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.830
But I do think that people will
use the devices in that way,

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.920
and it's really
interesting to me.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.835
Yes.

00:26:14.835 --> 00:26:16.775
AUDIENCE: Can you use
that device [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:20.170
will up your-- outdoor
with a lot of trees

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.110
and wind in the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.568
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
The question

00:26:23.568 --> 00:26:25.160
was will Project
Tango work outdoors?

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.080
And the answer there is
that pieces of the stack

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.780
will work outdoors,
so the motion tracking

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.560
and area learning capabilities
will work outdoors.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.490
But depth perception--

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.120
AUDIENCE: Trees, leaves, and--

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.290
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.260
Trees and leaves are
actually great features

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.350
to track as you move
through the world,

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.430
but the problem is the sun.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.390
The sun turns out to be a
really, really strong source

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.890
of infrared light.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.690
And so for the
depth sensors that

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.390
are currently on
the Tango tablet,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.410
they get overpowered by the sun.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.370
So you would be able to do
outdoor navigation with a Tango

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.680
device but having Mittens
follow you through the trees,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.965
unless you were in a shaded
area, would be difficult.

00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:07.721
AUDIENCE: What about lenses--
special filtered lenses

00:27:07.721 --> 00:27:10.271
to filter out
overwhelming [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:11.770
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
Well, I think

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.660
the problem with using
specialized lenses to filter

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.020
out IR, which is
something that you can do,

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.290
is that the device needs to see
the IR pattern to be able to do

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.900
its depth computation.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.870
And so if you
filter out that IR,

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.390
the device doesn't
see the pattern.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.139
There are solutions to this.

00:27:29.139 --> 00:27:29.930
AUDIENCE: --sensor.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.870
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN: Yes,
it depends on the sensors.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.000
The current sensors-- no.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.080
But over time we hope to improve
the ability of these devices

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.460
to see outdoors.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.160
Other questions?

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.182
Yes, you next to
the blue-- yeah.

00:27:43.182 --> 00:27:44.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:49.427 --> 00:27:51.010
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.520
is can you share the
3D models that you

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.400
create of an environment?

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.580
Right now the
constructor application

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.940
that I showed you will
export to OBJ and PLY

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.840
files which are just
standard mesh assets.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.600
You have to give
permission to export.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.410
The user has to click a button,
but once you have the file

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.590
you're free to email
it or do whatever.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.790
And you could import it into
another Project Tango device's

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:24.620
memory space and use it
if you were so inclined.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.588
Yes.

00:28:25.588 --> 00:28:26.584
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:29.297 --> 00:28:30.880
EITAN MARDER-EPPSTEIN:
So the question

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.210
was will Tango technology
be extended into other form

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.940
factors like robotics?

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.140
I think absolutely yes.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:38.910
Well, I hope so.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.640
My background's
actually in robotics,

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.760
so I have a little bit
of an interest in this.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.140
But we've already had
interest from people

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.420
who are doing
quadrotors-- anyone who

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.360
needs a light
weight localization

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.490
solution on their device.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.810
I think there's huge
impact potential there.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.290
We're really focusing
on the smartphone space

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.610
first to drive down the
cost of these sensors

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.972
and to make the technology
more ubiquitous.

00:29:05.972 --> 00:29:08.120
We believe that that's
the best way to get it out

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.010
into the world, and then
things like robotics

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.850
can piggyback on top of it.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.140
All right.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.482
I am out of time, but I
will have office hours

00:29:17.482 --> 00:29:18.190
right after this.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.340
So thank you very, very
much for your time.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.040
Enjoy the rest of this.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.090
