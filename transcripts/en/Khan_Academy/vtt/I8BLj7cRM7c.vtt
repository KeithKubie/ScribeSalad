00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.880
In the last several videos we
talked about the difference

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.120
between the book value
and the market value

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.610
of a company's equity.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.660
And in this example here, where
I said this is some type

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.850
of a financial institution.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.170
And these are its assets.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.329
And at least on its books, it
had $1 billion of government

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.120
bonds. $10 billion of very
highly rated corporate bonds,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.790
so these are loans to
corporations that are very

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.940
likely to pay back. $10
billion of commercial

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.940
mortgages, those would be loans
for someone to buy an

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.750
office building, or build
an office building, or

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.830
something like that.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.090
And then we focused in a little
bit on this piece, this

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.990
green piece here, residential
CDOs.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.010
And I explained what
those are.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.310
Those are essentially derivative
securities that are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.950
derived from mortgage
backed securities.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.660
Which are just a bunch
of mortgages that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.760
are packaged together.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.090
And we focused on that because
this is really the crux of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.160
everything that everyone's been
focusing on since the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.040
credit crunch started.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.950
Although, I'll throw it out
there, this is just the first

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.840
wave. This is what's
deteriorated so far.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.450
Housing prices have gone down,
you had all of these people

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.290
with these liar loans where you
could make up your income

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.120
and get a million-dollar loan
with no money down.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.130
So this was just
the first wave.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.120
But you can imagine, if the
economy gets bad enough, then

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.030
a lot of these commercial
mortgages are going to to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.430
start looking not
so great either.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.740
And actually, there was an
article that I read this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.150
morning where they talked about
because of all of the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.170
turmoil in the financial system,
because of this piece,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.550
that the commercial vacancies
actually going up.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.580
And a lot of the people who
own commercial mortgages,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.170
they're actually getting a
little bit worried right now

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.550
because a lot office space
is going free.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.430
But anyway that's not
the focus of this.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.900
What we should focus on now is
well, fine, this bank has a

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.040
shady asset.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.730
And that makes it look a little
uncertain as far as

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.980
what its equity is worth.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.970
If we said this asset was worth
$4 billion, we said we

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.150
have $3 billion of
equity here.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.190
Because everything would have
added up to $26 billion.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.650
And we have $23 billion
in liabilities.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.300
And so liabilities plus equity
is equal to assets.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.330
Or assets minus liabilities
is equal to equity.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.780
So 26 minus 23 is equal to 3.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.560
And I gave you the example of
well what if the stock market

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.440
is actually valuing this thing
at an equity of $1.5 billion.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.820
And the way you get that is,
they're saying $3 a share and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.200
there are half a
billion shares.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.880
So what if the stock market is
saying no, I think that this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.970
company's equity is only
worth $1.5 billion.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.070
And a rationale for that could
be that they just think that

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.850
this asset right here is worth
$1.5 billion less.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.030
Anyway, I just wanted to make
that point because a lot of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.650
people often get confused
between book and market value.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.200
But now, let's think about
why this matters.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.010
Why is Hank Paulson, and Ben
Bernanke and George Bush, and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.970
seemingly everyone
else, so scared?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.790
The logic goes, well if this
is just one bank and maybe

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.740
these things are worth zero,
what's the problem?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.250
If these things are worth zero,
this one bank declares

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.000
bankruptcy, and it just
gets resolved in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.090
the bankruptcy process.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.300
And I'll do another
video on how the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.290
bankruptcy process works.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.670
Or, there's another scenario
where you say, oh well this

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.340
one bank, maybe this
isn't worth zero.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.040
Maybe this is worth
$4 billion.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.300
And as long as people just
continue to loan it money, it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.490
should be able to be fine and
it'll weather out the storm.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.420
And that's the crux
of the issue.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.900
Whether people will continue
to loan them money.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.740
So, corporate loans, or loans
to corporations or banks.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.090
Most of the loans we're familiar
with in our personal

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.750
lives, maybe a mortgage, where
it's a fixed term, 30 years,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.300
at the end of it you've paid all
of the interest and you've

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.660
completely paid off the loan.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.110
Corporate loans tend to be for
simplicity purposes, interest

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.620
only loans.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.530
There might be a little bit
of paying down the equity.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.690
But for the most part they're
interest only loans.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.570
So for example, this
Loan A over here.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.840
It'll have some interest rate,
let me make something up,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.120
maybe it's a 7% loan.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.850
And maybe its term, they'll give
you the money for some

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.620
period of time, let's say
it's for three months.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.240
So that says that whoever lent
this money to you, they'll

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.570
give you $10 billion.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.570
Every year you pay 7% but on I
guess a monthly basis, you'll

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.670
pay roughly 1/12.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.300
We know that that's not the
exact math, but you'll pay

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.790
it's actually 1.07 to the
1/12 power, but it's

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.390
roughly 1/12 of this.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.970
And then at the end of three
months, you pay that lender

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.840
back the $10 billion.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.450
You might say, well that's
a strange way

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.730
of financing yourself.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.630
Because every three months
you're going to have to go and

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.390
get another loan.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.310
And that's absolutely true.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.370
But in a normal credit
environment, most companies

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.870
can say, OK I'll borrow this $10
billion for three months

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.850
at an annual rate of 7%.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.890
And then when three months pass,
I'll just got another

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.190
loan, maybe from the same
lender, maybe from another

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.440
lender, that has maybe similar
terms. Pay off the old loan,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.910
and get a new loan.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.200
You can kind of say they keep
on renewing those loans.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.310
They're able to keep keep
getting new loans that can

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.120
replace the old ones.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.270
What's happening now is you have
these short term loans,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.290
let's say three months, and then
when it comes to renew,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.500
the bank or whoever lent you
this money says, I'm not so

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.130
sure anymore.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.835
Because one, your stock price
has been tanking.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.090
And if anything, we know that a
lot of these hedge funds out

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.800
there, they're doing more
homework than me, the bank, or

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.690
the lender is doing, or
at least these ratings

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.740
agencies are doing.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.770
So maybe they see
something fishy.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.020
And I know that you have some
type of assets, you have some

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.990
of these residential mortgage
backed securities, or you have

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.640
some of these derivative
assets there.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.490
And you don't really give a
lot of transparency to me.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.930
In fact, seldom you'll actually
even see this much

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.880
transparency on a company's
balance sheet.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.885
They'll often say just like a
big bucket of, they'll call

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:19.310
them level three assets.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.740
And those are assets that really
the management of this

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.080
bank can decide what
they're worth.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.090
So if I'm the person who lent
them the money, I'll be like,

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.470
you know what, I saw Bear
Stearns go down.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.530
And Bear Stearns looked
a lot like you.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.520
I saw Lehman Brothers go down
and Lehman Brothers looked a

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.940
lot like you look now.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.870
You know what?

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.210
I just want my money back.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.630
Just pay me the $10
billion loan.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.460
And then you go out, if you're
this bank, you say, OK well

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.410
let me look and find
someone else.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.950
And no one's willing to lend
you the money because

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.430
everyone's gotten a
little bit irked.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.410
And they go for another
guy for loans.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.770
And they're like look, I'm not
going to give you a loan, but

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.490
here's some advice.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.300
If you really think these assets
are worth enough, why

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.880
don't you sell these assets, and
maybe some other assets,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.990
and then you can be good
for your money?

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.920
You don't even need the loan.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.650
You don't need to hold
these assets.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.180
So what you do when this comes
due, since you can't get any

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.120
other loans, let's say
that you sell these.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.960
So you sell these AAA
corporate bonds.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.300
Those are very valuable.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.170
So you get $10 billion
for them.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.060
So now you have $10
billion in cash.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.810
And you're able to pay
off this loan.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.090
And actually, what I've just
described, this is called

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.310
deleveraging.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.340
Actually, I'll probably save
it until the next video on

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.900
what leverage and
deleverage is.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.750
But just think of it this way,
leverage is the ratio of how

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.280
much assets you have over how
much equity you have. And so

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.230
if you think about someone who
has a lot of assets, but

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.840
they're controlling it with very
little equity, they have

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.700
huge leverage.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.540
If you're controlling $10 of
assets and you only have $1 of

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.820
equity, you have
10:1 leverage.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.290
Now, I just reduced my assets,
but I didn't change my equity.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.040
So I've deleveraged.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.180
I'll do that more in
the next video.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.900
But that's fine, so I was
able to cover that.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.460
I didn't have to declare
bankruptcy or anything.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.500
But let's say when this
loan comes due,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.650
I'm in the same situation.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.420
This person, everyone's a
little scared after Bear

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.620
Stearns and Lehman Brothers and
they say, I'm not prepared

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.420
to renew this loan to you.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.900
And you go out into the credit
markets and no one else is

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.120
willing to give you this loan,
but you're like, OK fine, I

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.549
have these commercial
mortgages.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.580
And I can sell them.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.429
They're fairly liquid
securities.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.340
Liquid securities means that
there's a market in them and

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.289
that you can find buyers who
are willing to buy them.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.050
But let's say since you have
to kind of do it in a fire

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.030
sale type of situation, since
you have to do it very quickly

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.150
and everyone's a little scared,
let's say you only get

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.960
$9 billion for these.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.000
They're worth $10,
or so you say.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.970
But then when you actually try
to sell them in the market,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.220
you get $9 billion.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.530
And let's say you have to sell
your government bonds as well.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.760
So you get another billion.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.780
So that gives you $10 billion.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.670
And then you could pay off
this guy right there.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.720
So now it's getting
interesting.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.190
Notice, the book value of my
equity, well it might have

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.770
changed a little bit.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.660
Because I had $10 billion
of assets.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.120
and I had to essentially write
them down to $9 billion,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.170
because that's what
I got for them.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.900
So let's actually recalculate
our new book value.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.470
So if I'm the company, remember
this $4 billion was

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.050
what the company said it was
worth, the $2.5 billion was

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.600
what the market said
it was worth.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.410
So they have $4 billion plus
$1 billion, so we have $5

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.470
billion now in assets.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.180
And what's our liabilities?

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.760
We have $3 billion in loans.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.950
And now the book value
of our equity is now

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.640
going to be $2 billion.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.210
And just to think about it,
why did our book value of

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.840
equity go from $3 billion
to $2 billion?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.450
Well, because I actually thought
that these commercial

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.030
mortgages were worth $10
billion, but when I had to

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.950
sell them really fast, I only
got $9 billion for them.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.070
So I essentially had to write
down those assets and then

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.890
sell them and turn
them into cash.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.910
So that's why the book
value of the

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.030
equity is now $2 billion.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.950
And now notice something here,
the book value of this

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.080
residential mortgage backed
security, at least what this

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.400
bank management says the book
value is, is $4 billion.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.390
I shouldn't have crossed it out,
let me write it again. $4

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.340
billion, the $2.5 is what
the market was saying.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.300
Which is larger than
my total equity.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.400
So if this is worth zero,
then I actually

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.260
have negative equity.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.660
If this is worth $2 billion
instead of $4 billion, then I

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.340
have zero equity.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.600
So now I'm getting into a very
interesting situation.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.350
And I wonder what's going to
happen when Loan C comes due.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.300
And we'll explore that
in the next video.
