1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,371
All right.

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:10,371
So there does seem to me to be a rebirth
of a defense of free speech starting

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,100
again on the left. Possibly. I
see a little southern happening.

4
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:17,460
I did Jonathan Haidt heterodox and
some of the other organizations you're

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,510
involved in in fire.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,950
There is this group of people kind
of making a comeback on the left.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,820
I'm not so sure it can hold,
I hope it can hold. Um,

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,600
but what do you make of how this sort
of bounces back where sometimes free

9
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,750
speech is something that
the left holds more deer.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,930
Sometimes it's finding the right holes,

11
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:37,500
more deer and it kind of
switches as the decades go by

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,190
perspective. And I'm not far be it
for me to pull out the age card,

13
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,550
but I think a sign a few more
decades than you have. And,

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,650
and that it's been a constant,

15
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:51,580
that was very well summed up by Nav
handoff from you would have loved,

16
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,950
I don't know if you've ever
crossed paths with him. Um,

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,990
but he was a great free speech,

18
00:00:55,991 --> 00:01:00,991
stalwart and he wrote a book whose title
really says it all freedom of speech

19
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:02,410
for me.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,250
But not for the how the left and right.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,030
Relentlessly sensory each other.
And he wrote that decades ago.

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,330
But it's always been true that most people
being human believe in free speech in

23
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,630
general.
But yeah,

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,520
those ideas that they hate or despise
or think are dangerous should be the

25
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:28,780
exception. Let's go back to
Skokie. Where ACL, you members,

26
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,460
even 15% of these die hard
stalwart ACL you members.

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,450
I'm not surprised that the one exception
they want to make is for speech.

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,900
That's Dan and grading,
civil liberties and human rights.

29
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:45,820
But I had a friend who was the executive
director of the National Coalition

30
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,520
Against Censorship and she put
it so well, she said, Nadine,

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,750
everyone has his or her Skokie.

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,880
So at particular times,

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,450
I can tell you for every year I can tell
you this was the one exception or maybe

34
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:03,220
more than one exception that
liberals wanted to make.

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,890
And this is the one that can
serve as wanting to make.

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,700
And I would say in general,
you know, like, um, uh,

37
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,730
let's amend the constitution so that
it is a crime to burn the American flag

38
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,170
that has been supported by many,

39
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:24,870
if not most conservatives and by
a lot of liberals as well. Uh,

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,590
that and there's not been,

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I think that is the single most hated
expression in my lifetime because no other

42
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:38,041
expression has led to a constitutional
amendment coming within a hair's breadth

43
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:44,320
of being ratified more than two
thirds of the Senate. I'm sorry,

44
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,340
of the House approved.

45
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:50,341
It came within one vote short of two
thirds of the Senate and more than three

46
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:52,370
fourths of the states.
So all of it.

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,480
That's not my long. When was that?
Maybe that was mid nineties. Yeah,

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,900
something around there. Wow. That's
incredible actually if you think about it.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,090
Yeah. Where, where do you think Trump
kind of fits into the general discussion?

50
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:04,924
Cause I see,
look,

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
it seems to me that there is obviously
some sort of authoritarian bent to him.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,750
That being said, we're
not being, people are,

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,600
as far as I know people are being jailed
because of free speech at the moment.

54
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,510
Do you think our institutions let, let's
say that his worst critics, he's, uh,

55
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,470
we're write about whatever
they think about him.

56
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,730
Do you think our institutions at this
point are strong enough to ward off that

57
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,580
kind of threat? And we don't even
have to make about Trump specifically,

58
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:34,330
but if there was truly like a
real authoritarian in office,

59
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,221
do you think that the,

60
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:38,260
the way our balance of powers in
our separation of powers works?

61
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,130
And again, I would have to say,
you know, Trump has certainly, um,

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,990
done a lot of saber rattling on
free speech issues and you know,

63
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,150
said that flag burners should be deported.

64
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:52,520
But let us not forget that Barack
Obama was responsible for, uh,

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,090
the most stringent enforcement of
the espionage act and you know,

66
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,410
press pressing criminal charges against
more whistleblowers than all pre or

67
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,790
prior administrations they
added together. So, uh, again,

68
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,650
a pox on both your houses.

69
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,170
So far the courts have
been a wonderful bull work.

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,260
The flag burning example is,
is a really good one.

71
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,290
It was a a two supreme court decisions
joined by both conservatives and liberals

72
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:28,041
on the court that struck down under the
first amendment laws that criminalized

73
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,210
desecrating the American flag while the
Supreme Court doesn't have quite the

74
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:36,480
last word, a constitutional
amendment could overturn it.

75
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,750
But I have great confidence that this
court would continue to uphold what has

76
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:47,550
been called the bedrock
principle of freedom of speech.

77
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,770
And that is viewpoint neutrality.

78
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:54,450
I summarized it earlier that the mere
fact that the viewpoint is hated,

79
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,750
whether it be flag burning or
whether it be racist speech,

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,990
that is never a justification
for censorship. Again,

81
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:05,340
they unanimously endorsed that
last summer in a hate speech case.

82
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,090
Yeah. It looks slightly shift
for a second. So when you
were the head of the Acl,

83
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,370
you,

84
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,690
what are the political pressures that
you're under that maybe the average person

85
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:19,130
wouldn't know from the,
from the headlines, like
involvement with Po, you know,

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,920
politicians with lobbyists,
et Cetera, et cetera.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,180
So at the ACL you was at his,

88
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:30,070
and I was personally involved in, in
lobbying and testifying. I still do,

89
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,520
uh, testify before
Congress occasionally. Uh,

90
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,580
and I would say to me it was
a very privileged position
because we did not have

91
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:45,181
to be directly concerned about
partisan political pressures.

92
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,430
We could simply make alliances and
work with anybody that we thought could

93
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,480
support an issue that,
uh, advanced our cause,

94
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,810
even if we disagreed with on
other issues. And I remember, uh,

95
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,940
to me it was a great source of pleasure.

96
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,941
I remember on one piece of legislation
testifying before the Senate Judiciary

97
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:09,411
Committee,

98
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,411
and the chair was Orrin Hatch and the
ranking a minor minority member was Ted

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,700
Kennedy and they were both supporting
the same pro civil liberties position.

100
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,950
And I was testifying together with the
head of the National Association of

101
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,200
evangelicalism and the
head of the Mormon church.

102
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:33,830
And despite all of the differences
on so many other issues,

103
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:38,270
the fact that we could make common concern
that was on principles of religious

104
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,610
liberty and freedom of
thought and freedom of belief,

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,440
that's what I feel is
deteriorating a little bit. Uh,

106
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
so last year I testified a couple of
times on campus free speech issues and the

107
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:57,251
bipartisanship had really worn down even
though the theme was freedom of speech

108
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,381
on campus.

109
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:04,760
And even though the chair of the committee
who was Lamar Alexander Republican

110
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,490
and Patty Murray,
the ranking member Democrat,

111
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,340
they were both really solid
and great on the issue.

112
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,410
But the other members of the committee
just used it as opportunities to trot out

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,130
their own ideas of which free speech,
uh,

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,170
was bad and should be suppressed.

115
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:25,550
So some of the Republicans were saying
taking a knee by athletes should be

116
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,151
punished.

117
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:30,830
And some of the Democrats were really
saying Trump is violating free speech and

118
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,690
there's too much political grandstanding.
Right.

119
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,050
And that's why for as
critical as I am for the left,

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,480
I don't want free speech to become,

121
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,880
I don't want it to be a political
issue in the first place.

122
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
I don't want it to be that the right,

123
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,480
which at the moment I see more
tolerance related to diversity of ideas.

124
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,230
I don't want that to be the home. I
want there to be a balance. Otherwise,

125
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:55,100
we're just going to end up in that,
maybe be a little bit skeptical,

126
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:59,930
but I think that people tend to be result
oriented and that, uh, on the right,

127
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:03,860
there may be much more support for freedom
of speech on campus because they see

128
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:07,940
that it's views on the right that are
being squelched. Now, in fairness,

129
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,750
I'll give you a counter example.

130
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,140
Many years ago during this first surge
of political correctness on campus,

131
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,180
Mitch Mcconnell, um, well let me,
let me, let me put it backwards.

132
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,660
Um, it was Henry Hyde, I'm sorry,

133
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:28,661
a conservative Catholic from Illinois who
was completely on the opposite side of

134
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,780
the Aclu on abortion and gay rights.
Um,

135
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,830
he really was so strong on campus free
speech that he sponsored a bill that

136
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:46,391
would have required all
private universities to
respect the same free speech

137
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:52,520
rights that public universities
are required to observe
under the constitution.

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,300
Many people don't know this, but the
constitution only applies to government,

139
00:08:57,301 --> 00:09:00,180
including state universities,
but not private university.

140
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,570
How did you guys feel about, well, we
totally supported the ledges. Again,

141
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:06,810
that would be a difference. We train
libertarians and civil libertarian,

142
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,290
my libertarian friends would say, you
know, keep the government out of it.

143
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,330
Let the private institutions decide.

144
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,510
And there were exemptions
for religious institutions.

145
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,540
But basically I think that's where
I would fall on this. So sell me,

146
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,320
sell me your way. It's a very
interesting debate and I can understand,

147
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,240
but the person,
and you know,

148
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,660
I've had this discussion with my dear
friends at the Cato Institute for many,

149
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,530
many years now.

150
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,190
What's the difference between a classical
liberal or libertarian and civil

151
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,360
libertarian?
Uh,

152
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:38,361
I think that we are less opposed to
government regulation when it is in the

153
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:44,061
service of regulating very
powerful private sector
actors that for all practical

154
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,700
purposes,

155
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,820
the way we were talking
about civil society earlier
can exercise coercive power

156
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,780
that stifles people's
liberty. So, so what if you,

157
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,580
uh, you know, a few,

158
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,610
if we did not have the 1964 civil rights
act than even the most powerful large

159
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,660
landlord, employer, corporation,

160
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,370
private university or etc,

161
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,260
would be able to discriminate on the
basis of race or gender under federal law,

162
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,290
they still can on the basis
of sexual orientation.

163
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,570
I would view that as something that could
and should be remedied through passing

164
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,810
a statute, making that illegal. Hmm.

165
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,080
So usually report into, well I think,
well first of all, I agree with you,

166
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,120
your basic premise here,
just at the idea level,

167
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,550
it's a great place for a
rich conversation. Yeah.

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,960
The idea that the government would be
coming in and telling private schools,

169
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,060
even though I understand
what you're saying,

170
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,540
that they would have to adhere
to these codes even if I,

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,150
it being the first amendment.
Yeah.

172
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,810
I don't necessarily think of private
schools should have to do that.

173
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,280
I just think that ultimately
the market would just,

174
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,840
you'd either decide you want to go there
or don't want to go there. This one,

175
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,240
this one's definitely a tough one.

176
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,270
It's an interesting one and I definitely
can see the other side and I certainly

177
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:09,380
would insist on some exemptions.
Uh,

178
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,310
certainly for religious schools. I think
military schools were also exempted.

179
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,230
But then I want to give
you another example of a
Republican that I worked with,

180
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:20,880
Mitch Mcconnell,
uh,

181
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,110
worked very closely with
the Aclu in opposing,

182
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,170
and many people are going to
be surprised to hear this. Um,

183
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,830
the McCain fine gold law,
a campaign,

184
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:36,660
so-called campaign finance, the ACL, Ooh,

185
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,501
very,
you know,

186
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:42,501
we are the ones who argued Buckley versus
Valeo and arguing that the ability to

187
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,350
spend money in order to promote a
message is protected free speech.

188
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,580
And it should be protected even when
speech is engaged in by people who are

189
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,080
organized into a group and including
if they're organized in the form of a

190
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:05,290
corporation or a union or
not for profit corporation.

191
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,460
So some liberals are really distressed
by that position and I think it's

192
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,260
absolutely the correct one anyway.

193
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,600
Um, what, what do you say to those?

194
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,140
Those liberals are the lefties who do
get more upset about that in general,

195
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:19,230
that you're just going
to allow corporations to
endlessly pour money in the

196
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:21,720
system and manipulate the system.
And that's it.

197
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,640
Well, the track again, what
is the lesser of two evils?

198
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:30,641
Would I rather have the government
telling corporations such as the Acl,

199
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:35,090
you and planned parenthood
and the Sierra Club,

200
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:38,540
you name your favorite left wing,
so called cause.

201
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,600
And it is organized in corporate form
and the HCLU under that law was it would

202
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:49,581
have been a crime to go on the airwaves
and by name call on people who are

203
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:55,580
running for federal office and say,
you know, repeal the Patriot Act. Uh,

204
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,640
because arguing for issues over the
broadcast airwaves was a crime under that

205
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:07,871
water and spending your own money to
advance your own issue oriented message.

206
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:13,700
So I think people are shocked when they
hear what the law actually did and are

207
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:17,870
persuaded that in at least some
applications that went too far. Well,

208
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:22,871
McConnell became such a supporter of free
speech as a result of working on this

209
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,320
issue that he actually changed his
position on the flag burning amendment.

210
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,310
He had been a big proponent of it and
as having seen how important freedom of

211
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:37,310
speech was,

212
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,370
including for what to liberals is a
very controversial form of speech,

213
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,450
namely spending money in the political
process. Um, he said, well, you know,

214
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,440
I've got to stick to principles here and,
um,

215
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,620
we should not amend the constitution to
outlaw another controversial expression.

216
00:13:56,691 --> 00:14:01,070
So I thought that was a really wonderful
idea of not just being result oriented

217
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,740
toward your own ideological concerns,

218
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,890
but seeing their overarching
principle and following it.

219
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,190
It's almost like if you
actually have the debate,

220
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,910
you might change people's mind and be
surprised to your, your ally suddenly,

221
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:17,560
or is there any country that
is protecting these rights? Uh,

222
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,980
better than we are known for
as screwy as our system may be.

223
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,920
No.
Uh,

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,040
well let me make eye on sexual expression
that United States is a much more

225
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,860
repressive than a European, uh,
some many European countries.

226
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:38,020
But like in what regard? You mean
with what can be seen in magazines?

227
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:42,720
There's living, yeah, so we still have
a, I mean, not only sexual expression,

228
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:44,670
but four letter words.
I mean,

229
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:49,671
thank goodness we're not rod casting
because I still get bleeped even when I

230
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:53,620
tried it. Yeah. Say whatever want
here. All seven of them. And, and,

231
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,480
and one of them appears,

232
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,940
and I'm not even sure if
this was one of these seven,

233
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,941
but fuck the draft was upheld as of
in a very important free speech case.

234
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,260
It that by the United
States Supreme Court.

235
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:13,280
And it is a case that has
ramifications for hate speech as well.

236
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:18,260
But I cannot describe the facts
of that case on radio or TV.

237
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,830
And you know,

238
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,830
that's laughable in other countries
and we still have anti obscenity.

239
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,420
Well, I mean, let's not forget
that the Brouhaha about the,

240
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:32,250
the wardrobe malfunction
at Superbowl, I mean, it's,

241
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:36,710
so we're much more puritanical,
but when it comes to political expression,

242
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,850
there's no country that gives
as much protection as we do,

243
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:43,040
including for hateful,

244
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,980
racist speech and misogynistic speech,

245
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,650
including four diff
defamation, you know, uh,

246
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,320
defamatory falsehoods about public
officials and public figures.

247
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,510
And that's why,
uh,

248
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,950
there are so many libel lawsuits that
are brought in the UK against what would

249
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,320
be clearly protected
speech in this country.

250
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,950
But you do believe in our libel laws here.
Uh,

251
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,070
yes, I, you know, I,

252
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:13,160
I'm sure I would want to
trim them back a little bit,

253
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,160
but on the whole were quite protective.

254
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:21,161
So if it's a matter of public concern
or public official or public figure,

255
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,950
you get quite a bit of leeway.

256
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,950
You can't be held culpable unless you
have acted intentionally or recklessly.

257
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:34,310
And I think that's correct. And one of
the things, they're pretty specific. Yeah.

258
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:36,770
One of the things that Trump
wanted to do as he said,

259
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:41,510
was to reform the libel laws to make
it easier for a public official to,

260
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,470
to collect damages. And you
know, a lot of people say, oh,

261
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,760
come on to dean Britain and Germany
and France and Canada and Australia.

262
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:53,630
You know, it's not as if they are to
tell a Tarion authoritarian countries.

263
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,520
But if you read the examples in my book
of the kinds of speech that are being

264
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,400
punished,
even with imprisonment,

265
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,890
even with a criminal fines,

266
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:08,150
and that's the tip of the iceberg
because for every punishment there is,

267
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:12,440
there are countless numbers of,
of self censorship incidents.

268
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,680
It would really make your skin crawl.
I give examples,

269
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,020
no matter what your ideology is,

270
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,660
you should find something in there
that you would say, oh my goodness,

271
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:25,310
I can't believe it. So, you know,
uh, France, a couple of years ago,

272
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,770
criminally convicted,

273
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,040
they had of a gay rights organization for
calling the head of an anti gay rights

274
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:39,401
organization homophobe that was
considered to be hate speech.

275
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,930
Now, fortunately she
wasn't sentenced to prison,

276
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,560
but she was subject to a very stiff,
fine,

277
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,790
$3,500. Uh, and, and, and then you
think, what are the ripple effects of,

278
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,600
of that?

279
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,630
Yeah. Have you guys
track this case with, uh,

280
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,300
the comedian in the UK who had
the dog? Oh yeah. Salute. Yes.

281
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Then I mean, again, like it's like all
right. He, at first he was making a joke.

282
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,870
There's no, there's no exception
for humor or satire. Uh,

283
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,900
when the new online hate speech laws went
into effect in Germany on January 1st,

284
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,520
uh,

285
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,520
the first person convicted or charged
under it was one of the leaders of a right

286
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:22,990
wing party. Not
surprisingly, but the very,

287
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,200
and then maybe the first two that
were charged were from that party.

288
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,410
But the very next one was a satirical
magazine that was making fun of their

289
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,530
statements, mocking them,
ridiculing and, and, and,

290
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,590
and these laws by being so subjective,

291
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:42,500
can't make the fine distinctions between
humorous satire and straightforward

292
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,503
advocacy.

293
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,890
Yeah. So my audience knows I'm not
big on this. The globalist ideas here,

294
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,230
or even the UN I think is
mostly a farce at this point.

295
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:53,950
But do we need some sort of
Internet bill of rights? I mean,

296
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:58,120
this is a new phrase that seems to be
popping up over the last year or so that

297
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:03,121
will uniformly protect people in other
country from beer for their ability to

298
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:08,470
say things that are uncomfortable online
and be able to tweet things, uh, that,

299
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,170
you know, you can't say in Germany,
but you can say in the United States,

300
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,980
I think we have to do that on
a country by country basis.

301
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,010
And I am pleased that there are
advocates in other countries that really

302
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:25,900
strongly support freedom of speech,
including for hate speech.

303
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:30,160
And I keep putting that in air quotes
because it, as I say to that person,

304
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:34,360
and you're at the University
of New Hampshire, no, there
really is no such thing.

305
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,940
And by the way,
there a lot of what they said to you,

306
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:39,250
some people would consider
to be hate speech too.

307
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,130
So that's another argument
that you could have made.

308
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,060
Do you realize that's my one regret
is at one point when she said to me,

309
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,370
I said something about losing Holocaust,
uh,

310
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,990
family members from the
hot guys on both sides.

311
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,160
And then later she said they're rolling
in their graves over what I'm saying.

312
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,050
I mean, try to think like
this, if we're really,

313
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,960
if we're really gauging the offense meter.
Yeah,

314
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,010
I assure you there was nothing that I
said in those two hours that was more

315
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:07,440
wildly offensive than that. But do I want
her jailed because of that? I mean, okay.

316
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,121
Yeah.
So I,

317
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:14,121
I really was heartened at how much support
there is for the American approach.

318
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,620
We were, were often, uh,

319
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,630
attacked as being American exceptionalists
and it wouldn't bother me if we were

320
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,200
the only ones in the,

321
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:30,210
in the world that we're defending our
free speech principles as long as that is

322
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:34,170
the right thing to do. But it's
interesting that other people having seen,

323
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,490
despite the good intentions
of sensorium was elsewhere,

324
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:43,491
how they are leading to results that
no thinking person should accept and

325
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,090
handing over to these online.
So here we get to this question again,

326
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:49,900
and I'll put it this way,
Dave,

327
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:54,470
what's the lesser of two evils
to allow these private, uh,

328
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,700
agglomerations of power,
uh,

329
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,730
Internet companies decide,

330
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:03,940
pick and choose whose speech
is allowed and who's not,

331
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,300
and enforcing their own concepts of hate
speech or pornography or permissible or

332
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:13,180
impermissible nudity to pick just
a few examples that they enforce.

333
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,860
Would I rather have them have that
enormous power or would I rather have the

334
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,720
government say,
no,

335
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:24,670
we're gonna check your power to restrict
other people's free speech rights?

336
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:27,790
And, and to me, that's a very
difficult issue. So that's the, okay,

337
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,850
so that's exactly where we were
before with the universities.

338
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,120
That's where I would say
ultimately right now are for,

339
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,310
I don't know how many k a Internet
companies we have, let's say Comcast. Um,

340
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,500
I'm spectrum from their role one.
Yeah.

341
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:45,370
You're thinking of the net neutrality
issue and I'm thinking of the social media

342
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,240
that,
you know,

343
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:50,620
the Facebooks and the twitters having
these armies of enforcer saying that's

344
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,450
hate speech weren't going to take it down.
Right.

345
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,290
So I guess what I would say is that if
there were certain Internet companies

346
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,041
that were saying,
all right,

347
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,970
well we're not going to allow pornography
on our pipes or we're not going to

348
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,190
allow this type of speaker that was each,

349
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,550
I would still prefer that you as the
consumer would have more choice than,

350
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,160
than the government saying,
we have to enforce all these
things. He's way totally.

351
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,320
But because of the,
because of the Internet,

352
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:18,130
now I know this is a unique situation
related to free speech. That's a little,

353
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,850
I mean in my ideal world, I'm
completely with you. The question is,

354
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,070
and I'm not an economist,
my husband is,

355
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:25,750
and he tells me that
it's very complicated.

356
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,990
Have some of them amassed so much power
that we should use antitrust type tools

357
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,830
to prevent them for it because that,

358
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,930
that they are denying us choice through
their market power. Right? So this is,

359
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,720
there's a great conversation
to be had there.

360
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:44,230
This is where my friends
had Prager university who I
agree with on all sorts of

361
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:44,560
stuff.

362
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,300
They were suing Google Youtube
over restrictions to their videos,

363
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,710
which I was in for because I don't want
the antitrust stuff to be in because to

364
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:57,640
me that, that then means you just create
a zillion other problems down the road.

365
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,390
But that's a great place for a free speech
person and an economist and probably,

366
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:05,350
uh, uh, technology guide all sit down and
work this stuff out without choking each

367
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,450
other.
There was a re to me,

368
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:12,160
really frightening story in the New York
Times a few weeks ago featuring, uh,

369
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,730
Facebook's deletion center.

370
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,830
That's what it was actually called,

371
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,840
this huge building in Berlin where they
had literally hundreds of people that

372
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:27,230
are looking at individual posts and
deciding, should this be deleted?

373
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:31,300
It should it not be deleted.
And it was um, you know,

374
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:32,680
and the examples,
you,

375
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,340
you realize how inevitably
subjective it is.

376
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,140
Ultimately they took down when
they took down this, this, um,

377
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,330
comment that was posted by the politician,

378
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,540
she was calling certain
Muslim men rapists.

379
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,090
And the question was,

380
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:55,091
was she referring to the particular Muslim
immigrants who were in fact convicted

381
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:59,690
rapists? There was a horrible incident
on New Year's Eve a couple of years ago,

382
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,770
in which case one would hope that
would be protected speech cause she's

383
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:08,771
describing something factual or was she
perhaps insinuating that all Muslim men

384
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,900
are rapists? Which would not
be a generalization that I
would find objectionable,

385
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:19,760
but, and, but it would be illegal
under German law and the official,

386
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,000
you know, these people, it's their
whole job to make these decisions.

387
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,970
They couldn't agree between themselves.
And so of course,

388
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:30,971
if you're not sure which way it goes
and you're facing a 50 million euro,

389
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,440
fine. If the German government says it
is hate speech while guess what? Right.

390
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

391
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,550
What do you, what do you think right
now is our biggest censorship threat?

392
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,460
Where do you think is is
coming on the horizon?

393
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,620
I am going to be very general because
it's been the same answer I've had

394
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,570
throughout my decades of activism,

395
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,600
which is lack of public understanding
and awareness of what the first amendment

396
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,210
is, what it does, protect, what it does,
not protect what the rationales are.

397
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,420
I truly believe that the
more people understand both
what the principles are and

398
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,750
how we have evolved at
toward those principles,

399
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:18,140
through historic experience,
that people will be supportive.

400
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,410
So I'm curious,
during the whole NFL kneeling thing,

401
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,170
I've made a couple of videos about it
and obviously we talked about it on the

402
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,390
show, but I basically was saying, look,

403
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,400
this is free speech working. The
president said what? He said,

404
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:35,030
now, I would certainly prefer that the
president not call people sons of bitches,

405
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,140
right? But he's entitled to free speech.
He didn't try to enact a law to stop him,

406
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,980
so he spoke.
The players could then deal or not Neil.

407
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:47,150
So they were able to do what they
wanted. The owners could then, you know,

408
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:51,170
find the players or not. So they got to
do what they wanted. The fans could say,

409
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:55,740
I'm going to buy jerseys and attend
games or I'm not [inaudible] so everyone

410
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,210
speech, actually everyone
speech and action was protected.

411
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,370
You might have some consequences for it.

412
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:06,350
But to me it was a great example of the
whole thing working messy but working.

413
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,213
Do you think that is

414
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,300
fair estimation?
Totally agree with that.

415
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:14,301
And I had quite similar analysis myself
to the disappointment of people who did

416
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:19,391
not realize that the NFL as a
private entity has its own rights,

417
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:22,640
including its own free speech rights.

418
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:25,580
And I thought it was interesting that
some of the owners said they would allow

419
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:29,290
their players, uh, to express
their, their protests.

420
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,770
He's in that case though,

421
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:35,330
is Trump getting it as close to where
it could be an issue for the ACL,

422
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:40,331
you or other similar organizations as he
can without directly calling for a law

423
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,650
because there is some other,
I don't even know what that is,

424
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,850
but there's something else
happening there. When you,

425
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,611
he's calling,

426
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:51,611
he were threatening if he were
threatening to pass a law.

427
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,930
And he did that in one other context.

428
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:58,931
I think he threatened that there should
be some f an FCC license should be taken

429
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:03,020
away from some broadcasts or that
comes much closer to the line and the

430
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,580
principal, Dave, you're exactly right.

431
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,710
He does not give up his free speech
rights by virtue of being a government

432
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:14,560
official. But if he is speaking
in official capacity, um,

433
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,690
and threatening some adverse consequences
that could be seen as an abridgment of

434
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:25,340
free speech under which would violate
the first amendment. Exactly. Yeah.

435
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,630
So in the past,

436
00:27:26,631 --> 00:27:30,950
I think the closest supreme court case
we have is where a government commission

437
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,130
wrote a letter that threatened that it
would take some action and even though it

438
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:41,650
wasn't starting a prosecution or it
wasn't an order to seize the expression,

439
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,810
the court said, you know,
it was a very functional,

440
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,760
practical concept.

441
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It would a reasonable person feel deterred
in pursuing their free speech after

442
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,610
they hear this communication.
And again,

443
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:58,340
reasonable people can disagree
about what the answer to that is.

444
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:02,900
But that's the question we should put
in evaluating whether Trump has crossed

445
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,040
the line or not.

446
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,090
So one of the things that I saw when the
NFL released its new standard now for

447
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:11,480
next season where the players are allowed
to stay in the locker room or not.

448
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,990
And again, everyone's choice will,
will or will not have consequences.

449
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,330
I saw a lot of people that were saying,

450
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:20,780
well clearly the government involved,
you know,

451
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:24,350
interfered behind the scenes.
Now I know there's no,

452
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:27,080
I know you don't suspect you don't have
some sort of insight or knowledge on

453
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:27,914
something like that.

454
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,820
That's where there would be a problem
though if they were really, you know,

455
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:34,640
behind the scenes meetings where they
were saying you're going to institute this

456
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:38,270
new policy and that's it. But beyond that,
but short of having that information,

457
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:39,620
everything kind of works.

458
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,910
Yeah. Um, there, there's
another analogy I can think of,

459
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:48,911
which is where the government has
threatened certain businesses that if you

460
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:52,730
don't adopt a voluntary,
uh,

461
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,080
restriction on speech, then we're going
to pass legislation. So, for example,

462
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,320
the movie rating system or
a sound recording rating
systems that we think these

463
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:08,300
labels are stigmatizing and therefore
suppressing certain expression.

464
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,980
Uh, I think there's a very strong argument
that the only reason this so called

465
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:14,790
voluntary system,
uh,

466
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,710
was put in place in both businesses is
because they knew that if they didn't do

467
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:23,300
it, the government was going to
legislate it. Uh, but even that,

468
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:27,050
the Supreme Court never held that
that was a illegal censorship.

469
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,801
Yeah.
All right,

470
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:30,950
well we can't talk free speech for
an hour and not mention the cake.

471
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,500
We got to talk about the gay cake.

472
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,700
Tell me your thoughts on the gay k.

473
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,610
Okay. It's, uh, I, first of all,

474
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,670
I think it involves not expression,

475
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,380
which I would define quite broadly.
And again, let me talk about the, the,

476
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,430
the standard here.

477
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,150
Reasonable people can disagree how the
standard applies to the facts of the case.

478
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,160
Um, so the court has said, and I think
this is correct, that something comes,

479
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,280
some expression comes or
arguable expression comes
within the ambit of the First

480
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:07,471
Amendment if it is intended to and can
reasonably perceived as conveying a

481
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,120
message,
at least a general message.

482
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,880
So that's the question you
would ask about the cake.

483
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,620
I think there's at least a plausible
argument that the cake is satisfied that

484
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,830
standard. Uh, in addition to expression,

485
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,460
there's the question of religious liberty,
right?

486
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,450
Which I defend very strongly,
even more strongly than the Supreme Court,

487
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:34,270
which has a quite narrow definition now.
Uh,

488
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:38,650
but I think people should not be coerced
generally to do something that violates

489
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:42,250
their deeply held religious
or conscientious beliefs.

490
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,500
That's only one side of the equation
though, because neither free,

491
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:50,020
no speech nor religious
freedom is absolute.

492
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,980
And in general, uh, the court has
said, and I think this is right,

493
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,370
that government can restrict those
freedoms if it can show that there is a

494
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:05,191
countervailing interests of
such compelling importance
that can only be advanced

495
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,970
by restricting the
expression or the belief.

496
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,380
Uh, and the countervailing
interest is of course the dignity.

497
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:21,070
And equality of a, in
this case, gay people,

498
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:22,540
but in past cases,

499
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:27,250
it's been African Americans or women
because people have cited who are in

500
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:27,731
business,

501
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:32,731
have a cer asserted religious
justifications for not
serving members of racial

502
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:37,780
minorities or not treating women equally.
And,

503
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,541
but to be clear,

504
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:41,510
that's not what was happening here because
they could have walked in and bought

505
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,700
any cake off the shelf.
A black person,

506
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,870
interracial couple could have walked
in and bought any cake off the shelf.

507
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:50,440
This was about the specific,
uh,

508
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,130
act that was going to be paint, you know,
painted or whatever they do on the case.

509
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,480
Right. You know, it's interesting.
I, uh, and there's another,

510
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,200
um, another free speech
principle that's involved here,

511
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:08,201
which is that government may not compel
somebody to proclaim a certain message

512
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:16,091
that they don't believe in any more than
it may stop somebody from conveying a

513
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:19,490
message that they, that
they do believe in. Um,

514
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,280
so I would say I, I'm, I'm very,

515
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:25,460
I think they're very strong
concerns on both sides.

516
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:29,390
So I'm very sympathetic because, let
me finish out the other argument. Um,

517
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,130
of course, if you are in independent
artists that is, you know,

518
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:36,950
only taking assignments on commission,

519
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,600
whether it be to paint a portrait
landscape or to decorate a cake in a very

520
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,670
elaborate way,
that's one thing.

521
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:48,671
But if you are doing business with the
general public and basically holding

522
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:52,610
yourself out as what the law
would call a public accommodation,

523
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,320
we're open to all comers,

524
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,590
then you may not discriminate
on certain bases such as race,

525
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:03,800
religion. And I think even though you
still can, as a matter of federal law,

526
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:07,220
under State Law, uh, in that
state and, and, and others,

527
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:10,220
you cannot do that on the
basis of sexual orientation.

528
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,610
And so I think that very strong
countervailing equality principle,

529
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,700
I think should,
should dominate in this analysis.

530
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,820
You actually weren't thrilled
with this decision. Well, I was,

531
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,090
I was in the sense that there were so
many ways that the court could have gone

532
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,030
wrong. So many issues.
They said that it was,

533
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,900
I thought the best thing they could do
was to be very narrow. And I actually,

534
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,080
if I were writing a brief in the case,
that's what I would do too.

535
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:41,780
Because all of these
principles are so important.

536
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:44,720
I deeply care about freedom of expression,

537
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:49,400
including the freedom not to be compelled
to affirm a message that that violates

538
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:53,660
your beliefs, whether they're religious
or conscientious, doesn't matter.

539
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,650
Um,

540
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,650
but I also deeply believe in equality
in the public sphere and the facts were

541
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,550
murky. So I think, you know,

542
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:06,551
as I think what happened in past
situations with a race and gender,

543
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,360
I think, you know, once things,

544
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:16,090
once the immediate
resistance died down to uh,

545
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,900
the 1964 civil rights act,
um,

546
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,310
that it sort of worked its way out
in a way that is maximally respective

547
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,210
respectful of all the competing rights.

548
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:34,211
So I think it's very good to avoid really
broad brush holdings that might have

549
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:39,350
unanticipated adverse consequences
for other factual situations.

550
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,260
That's an interesting take because
I saw some people saying, well,

551
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,420
they're just sort of kicking
this down the road now.

552
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,030
But basically you're
saying in a weird way,

553
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,160
that's the way a functional society
works at times. I think, you know,

554
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:56,000
the court sets them general
goalposts and then as time goes by,

555
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:58,220
the controversy may die down.

556
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,220
People may figure out how they can live
their own lives in ways that they're not

557
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:07,760
going to be bothered by, by the government
and not being treated disrespectfully.

558
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,170
One of the things that I
really liked about the um, uh,

559
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,370
opinion in that case and uh,

560
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:17,720
it's so contrasting to what's happening
in the European countries that I discuss

561
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:22,721
in my book is that the court talked very
strongly about equality and neutrality

562
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,100
in many different,
sorry,

563
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,750
in many different contexts.

564
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:37,751
So not only that you should be treated
with equal dignity regardless of who you

565
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,220
are,
but also regardless of what you believe.

566
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,530
So the fact that the court was respectful,

567
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:51,531
both of the equal dignity of the gay
couple and have the equal dignity of their

568
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,150
religious beliefs and the free
speech rights of the baker.

569
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,990
I really liked that.
I'm,

570
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
one of the things that bothers me very
much about what a is often paraded as

571
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:09,360
diversity on campus is that it
only looks at one dimension.

572
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:13,050
It looks at demographic diversity
in terms of who you are,

573
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,660
but not in terms of of what you believe.

574
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,440
And in these European countries
that are enforcing hate speech laws,

575
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,130
you see them going both ways
depending on who's in power.

576
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,430
So certain religious beliefs are being
punished and criminalize as hate speech

577
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:34,071
if they run against what is a dominant
secular orthodoxy in those societies.

578
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,350
Uh,
whereas in other communities,

579
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,650
a certain criticism of religion is treated
as hate speech and criminalized when

580
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:47,610
it's the religious, uh, belief that
is held by those in dominant power.

581
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,020
I think the main takeaway
here is that freedom is messy,
