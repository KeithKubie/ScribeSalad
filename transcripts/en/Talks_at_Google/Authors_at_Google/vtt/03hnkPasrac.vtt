&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Thanks for everyone for coming
to today's AuthorsGoogle talk. Today, we have

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.490
Rainn Wilson, co-author and one of the founders
of the site soulpancake.com here to talk about

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.130
his book, "Soul Pancake: Chew on Life's Big
Questions."

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.260
We're very excited to have him and we're looking
forward to a great hour. We're gonna start,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:32.890
though, by watching just a couple of videos
on the site. Go ahead and roll clip.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.620
[pause]

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.820
[plays video clip]

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.290
[rock music]

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.970
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Where is sound?

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:04.110
[video clip â€“ music and group singing: Ooh]

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:23.189
Can we start that one more time, guys, with
the sound?

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:33.590
[rock music and group singing: Ooh]

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.060
[end clip]

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:55.409
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: While they queue up the next
video, here's also a reminder. It's not only

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.820
in bookstores. It's also at the back of the
room. So feel free to pick up a copy before

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.079
or at the end of today's talk.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.369
[plays video clip]

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.310
&gt;&gt;Man #1: Life's biggest questions. Well.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.310
[music playing in background]

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.310
[Man #1 sighs]

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.310
&gt;&gt;Man #2: Umm.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.310
&gt;&gt;Man #3: Umm.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.310
&gt;&gt;Woman #4: Umm.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.310
&gt;&gt;Man #5: Umm.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.310
&gt;&gt;Woman #6: Umm.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.310
&gt;&gt;Man #7: Umm.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.310
&gt;&gt;Boy #8: I got a good question.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.310
&gt;&gt;Woman #6: Why am I here? What is my purpose?

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.310
&gt;&gt;Man #7: What is God?

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.709
&gt;&gt;Man #9: Why does white milk turn to yellow
butter?

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.470
&gt;&gt;Man #10: Will I be successful?
[whistling along with music in background]

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.520
&gt;&gt;Man #11: Is all of this worth it?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.000
&gt;&gt;Woman #12: Why doesn't racism die?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.980
&gt;&gt;Woman #13: Can religion make us better people?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.129
&gt;&gt;Man #14: Is love all that matters?

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.800
&gt;&gt;Boy #8: Why are girls so weird?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.860
[end clip]

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.860
[laughter]

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.231
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Nice. So welcome to the stage
of NBC's "The Office," Rainn Wilson.

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:45.350
[applause and cheering]

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.709
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Hi everybody.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.450
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Welcome, welcome. And for
those of you who don't know, this is actually

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.490
a bit of a tour enjoying that chair a little
too much.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.000
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You can't afford better chairs
at Google?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.320
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Those are the better chairs.
Those, actually,--

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: those are the better chairs.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.540
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: All right. I'll make do.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.850
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: But, yeah. You got a chance
to visit our New York office, as well. I appreciate

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.739
you stopping on the Best Coast. You know,
the West Coast, whichever.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.030
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You know, this campus kicks
New York's ass.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.030
[cheers and applause]

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.550
New York. I mean, don't even go to New York.
Don't even bother. It's like, it's in the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.650
meat packing district. It's depressing. It's
boring. Obviously, the best, brightest minds

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.659
and the best looking--

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.060
[laughter]

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.440
people are here at Google. Where are we? Which
town is this?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440
[laughter]

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.720
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: San Francisco.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.550
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Silicon Valley.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.830
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: The valley.
[laughter]

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.319
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: This is really cool. I know
a lot of you have your little camera phones

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.080
working now. So, I'd thought we'd take this
time for a photo opportunity. Ready? Get your

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.640
cameras out. Ready? Five. Four. Three. Two.
And here we go.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.640
[laughter]

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.129
Now, when you show these pictures, it's like
I'm a motivational speaker.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:12.209
[laughter]

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.920
Get it? This side of the room? Good. OK.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.209
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Very nice.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.750
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Thanks for having me, Google.
It's a pleasure to be here. Larry and Sergey,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.460
are they here? Larry?

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.860
[laughter]

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.050
They'll probably show up later.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.561
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: They have a private box office.
They're like the two grumpy old men from the

00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.810
Muppets. They just sit and judge.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.980
[Rainn Wilson laughs]

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.550
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Very good.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.800
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well thanks again for coming.
"Soul Pancake". I got a chance to breeze through

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.280
this a little bit, but, as well as your site.
I'd love to hear your synopsis of what went

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.720
into the start of this project and your thoughts
on how successful the site has been so far.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.889
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Great. Well, when I started
getting well-known for doing "The Office,"

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:04.880
I just, I realized that I had a great opportunity
to do something really special and unique

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.639
on the web, just because of my celebrity and
stuff.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.841
And I really thought long and hard and consulted
about it with--. The co-founder of the website,

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:20.990
soulpancake, is here. Devon, do you want to
stand up? Devon Gundry. Here's here. Stand

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.150
up.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.310
[applause]

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:32.210
Stand up. And my co-authors are here. I'll
introduce them later. But we just talked about

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.680
things that I was passionate about. And I
really wanted to do something unique and special

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.860
on the web that wasn't there.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.830
I think that the web has progressed a lot
since we started having these conversations

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.930
about four years ago. But at the time, there
wasn't very much positive on the internet.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:57.150
There wasn't very much that was uplifting,
or that was actively working to make the world

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.301
a better place. I mean, granted of course,
there's charity websites and stuff like that.

00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:13.390
But so, the thing that we came up with was
looking at life's big questions because I

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.979
didn't want it to be like, "Oh, I have the
answers," or anything like that. 'Cause I

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.979
don't have the answers. But this is something
that I've been passionate about. I grew up

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.039
in a kind of crazy, Bohemian household.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:31.690
And we would have long debates about philosophy
and religion and art and go to galleries and

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.550
museum openings. And the intersection between
art and philosophy and spiritual belief, was

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.450
just always very vibrant in our household.
It was really totally fucked up in every other

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:51.530
way, but that was a real positive thing that
we had going on. And then I got into school

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.180
and continued that interest.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.020
And I took Great Books classes through high
school. They had a Great Books course in my

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.840
high school where we didn't write papers.
We just debated the great authors. And you

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.449
were tested on your ability to break down
"Les Miserables" by Victor Hugo and talk about

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:18.580
the ideas of social justice in there and really
present your case.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:26.380
And then when I moved on to college and took
philosophy classes. I've also been--. Spirituality

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.370
is an important part of my life and investigating
the world's religions and stuff like that.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.430
And art has always been an important part
of my life and moving to New York and being

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:41.620
kind of a crazy Bohemian, doing plays in downtown
theaters and doing weird clown shows off off

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.220
Broadway and stuff like that.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.500
I always was intrigued by all of these things
and how they intersected, because I think

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:59.560
that in our culture, we're very compartmentalized.
We have our -- you have your work life, here,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.120
and then maybe outside of your work life you
have your social life. And maybe your friends

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.090
are from college or high school, or people
that share hobbies.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.800
And then you have your romantic life and your
family life. And maybe there's a little bit

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.211
of a spiritual life here, or maybe there's
your exercise here, or whatever it is that--.

00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:23.940
There are all these different boxes. And I
think that this is a -- there's a lot of great

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.910
things about the modern world. But I think
there's one of the difficulties of the modern

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.389
world is how fractured all of that is.

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:37.800
And I, personally, believe that it's all really
one and the same thing. We can talk more about

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.320
that later, but, see, I'm talking too much
already. So why we founded it. We just wanted

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:52.350
to build a cool place, to make it cool for
people to talk about what it is to be a human

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.600
being, to continue the discussion that started
really with the ancient Greeks, but it really

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:04.120
started before them. Just to continue that
same discussion about love and justice and

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.570
life and the soul.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.060
And this is the best way we could think of
to do it was to do the website. And then,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.350
as soon as we finished our version, our current
version of the website that's up there, we

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:22.959
moved on to--. We're shooting these webisodes
for the Oprah Winfrey Network. And we did

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.070
this book.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:32.270
And we really want Soul Pancake to be a brand,
or a platform, to have a fresh, irreverent,

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:39.490
unique way of looking at the world and what
it is to be a human being. Does that make

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.490
sense?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.230
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: It does. It does. And the
structure of the site, for those of you who

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.700
haven't visited it, I recommend it again.
soulpancake.com. The structure of the site

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:57.410
is very conversational in nature. And so,
there's a lot of banter between commenters.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.921
So, you post a question--if I'm not mistaken--you
post a question and people just respond as

00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:02.921
they will.

00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:06.820
Some long form, some short form. But then
you have the ability to respond to specific

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:13.660
comments as well. So, as a platform, were
you trying to recreate something similar to

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.920
this class, or what were you going for when
you were actually thinking about the structure

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.920
of Soul Pancake?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.959
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I think the--. It was a lot
of guesswork. Like, we just wanted to get

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:29.380
something up and running. And none of us had
really built a website before with any kind

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.709
of traffic. So, we also, besides the-- we
call it the "question collective"--we also

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:39.720
have challenges on there that we post every
day. There's content.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:46.330
And a lot of it is about not just talking,
but doing-- creating art and responding with

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:52.310
visual images and responding with poetry and
not just saying, "Well, I believe that blah,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:58.370
blah, blah, blah," you know? That kind of
thing. But yeah. The point was to create a

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:09.120
community of people that are just searching
and interested in discussing something a little

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.779
bit deeper.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:16.649
I found that it just, it had become so--.
It was one of the personal things. It was

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:25.290
so rare to be able to find people to have
a really deep conversation with. Not a pretentious

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:33.290
one, but just to--. It isn't done much in
our society. And I think that it should be.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:41.140
I think that the rich, soul-filled conversations
need to be part of our daily lives.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:47.540
There's nothing to be scared of. But the reason
that we're scared is usually that those discussions

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.040
are either people have an agenda, like they
wanna convert you to a way of thinking or

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.360
religious belief, or an atheism belief or
whatever.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.600
But there's an element of like, "I wanna convert
you to how I think". Or else, it's really

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.709
New Age-y and airy fairy and hippie dippie
and lovey dovey in a way that makes me wanna

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:11.070
vomit. So we just wanted to find something
that was in-between that. And there's a share

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.200
of--. There's New Age hippies on Soul Pancake
and there's also born-again Christians and

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.510
born-again Atheists on Soul Pancake. But it's
for everyone.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.790
And that's the great thing of what we've done.
I would say the single greatest success from

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:34.170
this version of Soul Pancake is that we have
created something where there are--. There's

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:45.029
no other website where there's Muslims, Buddhists,
Judists, Christians, and atheists and agnostics,

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:53.279
all talking civilly to each other in one place.
And that's a really cool thing and a real

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.279
unifying thing.

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:57.680
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Judists. For those of you
who didn't catch that reference, that's Jewish

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.200
Buddhists, not an interpretation of the Jewish
faith.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yes, Judists. Exactly.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.810
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: You made an interesting point,
though, that it's not--. We don't talk about

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:11.010
these deep subjects as much either in current
society. I have a hard time believing it was

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.120
ever really done that frequently.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.983
But I mean, do you feel like there is something
about the nature of the internet, or maybe

00:13:17.983 --> 00:13:22.220
about your site specifically, that allows
people to talk about these. Or, do you think

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.570
most people would be willing to talk about
them if only these subjects came up more often?

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:33.130
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You know, I think it's a little
all of the above. I think thatâ€”yeah, I think

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:42.290
that â€“ [pause]. I don't know. It's easy
to just get, it's easy to get doors shut in

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:50.250
your face if you wanna talk about them, I
think. And I don't know. I don't know why

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.329
that is. I don't know why that is exactly.

00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:55.970
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Do you find yourself bringing
up these kinds of subjects? I mean, these

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.389
are fairly, not just thought-provoking questions,
but they're very like blisteringly honest

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:05.170
questions where you have to be true to your
own beliefs to really have a good conversation

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.170
about them.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.170
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.170
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Do you find [ ]?

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.110
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah, I do. I do all the time
and it clears the room like a mo-fo.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.110
[laughter]

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:19.769
It's crazy. Like, you bring up just the big
question, "Do you believe in God?" And people

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:26.260
are like, "Uh-oh. Here it comes." And then
they're like, "No," or, "Yes." Or whatever.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.850
"Why? How do you believe that?"

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.000
Or, "What do you think's gonna happen when
you die? Really? Do you think that just your

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.930
body starts to decay? That's it? No more consciousness?
That's what happens?" "Yes," or, "no," or,

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:45.470
"I don't know." Or whatever, but I think that
Thoreau--. I think that Soul Pancake is really

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.880
inspired by the transcendentalists.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.829
And one of the things I realized in writing
this book is like, "Wow, I really came back

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:53.779
around." Like, oh yeah, I used to read all
those transcendentalists in high school. I

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:55.209
was like, "I really am a transcendentalist."

00:14:55.209 --> 00:15:01.290
I believe that art and spirituality and the
expression of being human is -- transcends

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:09.339
just our normal pooping and fucking and shitting
and eating lives that we all live, that we're

00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:12.300
longing for something more and something deeper.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.130
And Thoreau said. 'The unexamined life is
not worth living' and it's just about examining

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:22.779
our lives a little bit, a little bit deeper,
just to get "Who are you? Who are we? What

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:29.490
do I stand for? Where's my integrity? What's
my legacy? What is my relationship to the

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:35.610
earth and to other people and to a higher
being, or to nature?" Whatever it is.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:41.130
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: The Thoreau quote, "The unexamined
life," that definitely came to mind when I

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.850
was looking at this. And the feeling that
I've always gotten--. I was growing up, I've

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.330
always wanted to have conversations, found
it as difficult, is that it's--

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.510
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You can talk to me, Jesse.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.510
[laughter]

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.880
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: it's really difficult. It's
really difficult to examine, right? You have

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.160
to be honest and you often realize is this
disconnect between what you'd like to think

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.759
you believe and what you actually do. And
so, these conversations get, like I said,

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:04.639
very honest and sometimes depressingly so.

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:09.759
Do you feel like that your site is an effective
conduit, though, for people to be honest,

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:12.560
or they constantly putting out there what
they think they'd like to believe?

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.950
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You know, it's a lot of it
is -- we'd like to do a lot more with the

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:22.370
site than what's up there, to be really honest
with you guys. I think it's a good start.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:28.730
And we need funding and we need a development
team and we need a lot of things to be able--

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.180
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Wink.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.600
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: to do that.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.600
[laughter]

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.329
But, Larry, Sergey.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.329
[laughter]

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:43.920
But I think that, yeah. I think it's a good
start towards that. I think ultimately, a

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.550
bunch of anonymous people saying, "Well I
think blah, blah, blah," is not necessarily

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.750
the best way to go about it.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:57.670
And sometimes, the site devolves into that.
And we're figuring out a lot of other ways

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:02.510
that we wanna really, especially, bring the
arts into the site, and creativity and have

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:11.720
the people be able to have more artistic challenges
and people to post videos and express themselves

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.880
beyond just text writing and saying, "Well
I think this, that, and the other thing."

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.430
So, it's partially successful, I would say.
It's a good stab at it. And I think it's really

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:28.010
the only place on the web that is trying to
do that. I think there's not really much to

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:35.290
compare it to. I think that belief.net may
be, but that's a really fractured thing. If

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.520
you're a Buddhist, you go to this page of
belief.net. And if you're a Christian, you

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.520
go here.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.679
And if you're Catholic, you go here. And you
know what I mean? It's all very fractured.

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:49.130
We're trying to just bring people together.
It's about the human experience. It's not

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.120
about your little belief box.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.150
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: I really like the idea of
engaging your visitors. I'd like to ask about

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.309
how much response you feel like you've had
to when you put out these challenges? But

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:04.350
certainly, in this book, you've challenged
your readers to do things.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.890
One of the things you challenge to do often
is create lists, these pros and cons lists.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.789
And this has happened over and over and over
again in the book. Could you give me five

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:16.620
reasons why you think lists are a good idea,
or is there a specific reason why you've chosen

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.410
that approach? It seems to be pretty common.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.260
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Lists, we do it a lot on the
site and we did a lot in the book. We do "list

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.179
the five things that you blah, blah, blah."
Or, 'write down the three things," or "the

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:30.510
ten most important things," or something like
that.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:35.340
And I think it's just an easy way to get the
conversation going. I don't think the lists

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:42.140
are the be-all and the end-all. I think that
lists make it--. It's just an easier way to

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.390
just start that conversation.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:49.520
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: And when you start that conversation
the harder way, which is create art, do poetry,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.080
paint a picture or something like that--

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.160
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: do you feel like you've had
a good response from your community? Or has

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160
it been pretty tough to get that going?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.260
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Oh, very much so. I mean,
we have--. You guys can help me more with

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:06.500
the content stuff that we've done, but we've
had such incredible artistic challenges. What

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.789
are some of the ones that you think that have
been really good with like, people sharing

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:13.640
their art specifically for Soul Pancake that
they've created?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.330
&gt;&gt;Woman #1: Photos are nice. We did a photo
on capturing light that reflects your soul

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.380
and that got a ton of photos.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.560
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Like a photo challenge that
capture light with a camera that reflects

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.419
your soul and get hundreds of responses. I
mean, it's a really beautiful gallery when

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:33.419
it's done.

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:34.970
&gt;&gt;Woman #1: We did a Haiku on--

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.270
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Haiku's are always good.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:42.209
&gt;&gt;Woman: We did a Haiku on [ ] what things
can happen when you die.

00:19:42.209 --> 00:19:45.610
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Haiku and what you think happens
to you when you die. That kind of thing. So

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.220
those artistic social interactions.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.310
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Haiku's are particularly
nice--

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.310
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.240
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: because they're short, fairly
non-committal. You can get someone to write

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.240
something like that--.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.520
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah, you can dash one off,
but then you start to dash it off and then

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.200
you go, "Oh, this is trickier than it seems."
And you start to retool it and retool it and

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.539
strip it away and pare it down and think about
it and find the right word. And it's interesting

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:13.580
'cause it's like a little Rubik's cube.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.040
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, yeah. But it has a
really great hook for engagement. So, have

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.950
you found other ways to--. I mean when you
present something like "paint a picture" or

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.991
"do something large-scale" that expresses
X, Y, Z, again, you're gonna weed out a lot

00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:29.510
of people just because of the amount of effort.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.790
Have you found ways to almost trick people
into getting to think more deeply, which I

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.230
find is probably the best way to get these
conversations started, is don't let them know

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.730
that you're getting the conversation started.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.360
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Well, I think--. And that's
what the whole thing of Soul Pancake and with

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.510
our content is. And a little bit of what we
do in the book is exactly what you're talking

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.760
about. It's like, tricking people into ways
of getting the conversation started.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.300
And I think that's what we do. I think that's
what lists do. I think that's what Haikus

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.700
do. I think that if something is really simple
like, what's the most, what's the happiest

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.809
you've ever been, or something like that.
People can go, "Oh, that's this. It's that."

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:08.510
It's easy, but it gets you putting yourself
out there and engaging in them, in the mush.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:14.080
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: You take that into what is
real happiness and all of a sudden, next thing

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080
you know, you're quoting more and--.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: There you go.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.200
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: It's great people.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.200
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.471
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, I find, I found a lot
of the comments rather fascinating on some,

00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:27.929
at least the more recent conversations. I
didn't go tremendously far back. But do you,

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:29.770
or your team, ever read through the comments?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:35.390
Do you ever comment yourself? I know it's
a loaded question I'm asking, but do you ever

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.390
join that discussion, or at least monitor
it?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:41.190
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I do, sometimes. But I read
the site every day. And I read the--. I get

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:46.210
up and I check it and I read what the challenges
are and look at the responses and stuff like

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:52.590
that. I don't read every single one, but I
like to see where it's going and where it

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.860
needs to be going and stuff like that.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.049
So, I'm very engaged in it. I just think it's
like a dream come true. It's really cool that

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:07.580
there's teenagers from Dubuque, and there's
college students in Namibia and there's born-again

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:16.000
Christians in Athens, Georgia. And they're
all just digging into the stuff of life and

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.860
into the intersection of creativity and spirituality
and philosophy.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.591
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well I find it very genuine,
too. It's not, to be honest--

00:22:25.591 --> 00:22:26.591
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Right.

00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:27.591
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: with something like--

00:22:27.591 --> 00:22:28.591
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I find you very genuine.

00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:29.591
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Oh, well. You know, it's
because I mean it. It's because I care.

00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:30.591
[laughter]

00:22:30.591 --> 00:22:34.020
That's what it's about. But with something
like this, you could easily expect it to go

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:40.039
into what's known as a flame war, or where
the comments just become inane. If you look

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:45.610
at the comments of a lot of very popular social
sites, they just get ignorant or racist or

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.740
just extremely hyperbolic.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.740
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: The people that use Soul Pancake
regularly and it's not a ton of them, but

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:59.720
however 20 thousand people that congregate
there, they are very protective of the site.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.659
And they really don't like trolling.

00:23:01.659 --> 00:23:08.830
And they really don't like assholes just posting
stuff. And they'll kick 'em out. They'll flag

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:14.860
them and get rid of them. They're very--.
They really want it to be a special place.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.200
You see that a lot in the comments. And that's
another very successful thing about it.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.809
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: When I signed up for an account,
it was fairly non-invasive. There wasn't a

00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:30.970
lot that you were asking from me. But you
also -- so which again, made the cost of entry

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.400
very low. But do you monitor at all the, or
do you have a sense of the demographics that

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.110
play around this site? Do you have a sense
of who your audience is composed of?

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.919
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Oh, we track every user.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.980
[laughter]

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:52.530
We know everything. We know their buying habits.
We know how often they defecate, their regularity.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.380
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: You follow their Twitter
feed, is what you're saying.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.530
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yes.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:56.690
[Rainn Wilson laughs]

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.730
Very good. Boom.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.730
[laughter]

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:03.610
I'm doing Twitter tomorrow. Any messages you
want me to pass on to the folks over at Twitter?

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.010
[pause]

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.410
[laughter]

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.970
Get a life? What? Anything?

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.020
[laughter]

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.590
Your site will be obsolete in three years.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.679
[laughter]

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:13.679
And ours won't.

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:16.640
[laughter]

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:23.280
Anything? Umm, umm no. What was the question?
I don't know.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.710
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, I mean do you monitor
the demographics, the profiles, the types

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.050
of people, where they're coming from?

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:32.770
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: No. We haven't. We may. We're
trying to get some funding. So, that's gonna

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:37.730
require us to figure out the ages and demographics
of who's using the site regularly and stuff

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.880
like that. So, but we haven't to this point.
No.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.870
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, there's not any advertising
on the site now, is there?

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:44.870
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: There's not. No.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.160
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: So, would you ever consider
this a profit, a profitable venture? I thought

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.590
it was more of a non-profit--.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.929
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: It is not--. It is a for-profit
venture with a non-profit heart.

00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:54.929
[laughter]

00:24:54.929 --> 00:24:55.929
And uh--.

00:24:55.929 --> 00:24:56.929
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: The best of intentions.

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:58.710
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: But we haven't figured out
how to make any money off of it yet.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.710
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: That's fair.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.140
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: But the book is doing well.
The book was in the New York Times bestseller

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.610
list for the last six weeks. So, that's been
pretty cool. And--.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:06.610
[applause]

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:12.730
Yeah. Yeah. New York Times bestselling author.
What?

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.169
[laughter]

00:25:14.169 --> 00:25:17.410
Who are those people on that TV screen having
a conference room meeting?

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.570
[laughter]

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.570
Who are those people?

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.340
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: It's a bit magical. We have,
literally, people all around the world.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.240
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Wait. Now they're waving at
me. How are you hearing?

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.890
[laughter]

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.710
But they're talking to each other like they're
having a meeting. Who are those people?

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.010
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: They're definitely talking
about you. That's for sure. They're actually

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.159
in San Francisco. So, we have video-conferencing
abilities to bring in--.

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:37.320
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Why don't they come out here?
Why are they in San Francisco?

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.630
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, you know, it's a packed
house. We wouldn't wanna make this a little

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:45.770
bit too crowded. It's already getting warm
in here. They would only add to it, really.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.230
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: How you doing? You in the
striped shirt. What's your name?

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.230
[laughter]

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.460
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: They're good people.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.620
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I'm serious.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.280
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: They're good people.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.690
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: OK. They're good people?

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.460
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: You can trust them.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.230
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I don't like them.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.600
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, I don't know about
that.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600
[laughter]

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.360
Well, in any case, [laughter] the book is
doing well. The book is doing well. It's [ ].

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.549
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: The book is doing well. So
we made a little coin off the book. And now

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:15.440
we're doing these Oprah webisodes, which some
day we hope to turn Soul Pancake into a little

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.771
bit more of a TV format as well.

00:26:17.771 --> 00:26:25.110
So, it can be books. We've even talked about
like a Soul Pancake music label, supporting

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:32.650
artists that just share our vision. And that
doesn't mean like, wimpy--. I'm not talking

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.450
about Sarah McLachlan kind of music. I mean,
to me--.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.450
[laughter]

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.330
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Nothing against Miss McLachlan,
I'm sure.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.260
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Is she here, or what?

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.260
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Great.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:51.409
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: She'd kick my ass. But nothing--.
Well, 'cause to me, the most spiritually and

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:57.559
philosophically uplifting music in my mind
is Radiohead, or Sigur Ros. You know what

00:26:57.559 --> 00:27:00.480
I mean? There's people that can be making
music about--. And that's what I think is

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.260
so interesting about the arts is that, what
was I just talking? This is way off topic,

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.929
but I'm gonna say something interesting.

00:27:05.929 --> 00:27:08.299
[laughter]

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:10.970
Write this down. Where you going?

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.970
[laughter]

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.970
Seriously.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:13.970
[laughter]

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:20.610
What did she say? All right. Get outta here.
Go on.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.610
[laughter]

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.490
It's a stupid scarf.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.490
[laughter]

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.590
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Ooh.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:36.531
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I am the Don Rickles of authors.
The, what was I saying? Oh.

00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:37.820
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: I think of a label.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:43.650
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: There's an interesting theater
game that I used to play back in theater school

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.440
and doing improv and stuff like that. And
it was where you would, it's a fascinating

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.900
thing. You guys should do it when you're doing
like you're group mime classes down in the

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.080
courtyard, or whatever you do here.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.740
[laughter]

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.470
You, everyone writes down an emotion and you
stick the emotion in a hat. And then, every

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.740
group of like three or four people picks an
emotion out of the hat. And then that's the

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:11.020
emotion that they need to try and make the
audience feel. So you come up with a scene

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.980
to make the audience feel that emotion.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.490
And it's really interesting because if it's
like, anger, it's like, how do you do a scene

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:23.390
in front of people to make them feel angry?
Like, you do an angry scene, you might get

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.299
laughs. And it might actually be really entertaining.
'Cause at the end, you say, "What did you

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:29.940
guys feel? What did you actually feel?

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:35.470
Not what did you think you were supposed to
feel, but what did you actually feel?" And

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:40.880
it's fascinating. 'Cause the anger one, like
there was a famous scene that was done when

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.160
I was in school, where people pretended to
be like these sweet, little, old ladies who

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.470
started using the "n" word all the time. And
it was just like--.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:55.020
And I mean, people were just outraged, but
it really worked. It really made them feel

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.380
anger, but it's interesting how that works.
And you can also make people feel angry by

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:07.270
boring them. So, just doing a really bad scene
can really make people feel angry.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.270
[laughter]

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:13.120
But it's interesting because we talk about
like, what is art that inspires, or what is

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:21.419
art that uplifts, that makes you feel connected,
that it feels like soul-enriching. 'Cause

00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:28.850
a lot of times for me, that's stuff that the
artist, that was not their intention. It's

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.120
not what they set out to do.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:39.630
Radiohead sets out to write these weird, jarring
soundscapes that all are about human alienation.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:49.799
But nothing makes me feel more like, euphoric
and connected and loving and just transported

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:54.429
and transcendent than their music. You know
what I mean? So it's an odd thing. So that's

00:29:54.429 --> 00:29:58.580
just a little interesting thing. Wasn't that
interesting? OK.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.549
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: [laughs] Something that--.
Especially that you mentioned you were going

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:07.230
to Twitter. You have a very large Twitter
following. And I think there are aspects of

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.920
the comments on your site that remind me of
Twitter.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:16.090
The little tidbits of information, especially
the banter back and forth. But in an age where

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:22.179
I think a lot of the communication online
is very brief and oftentimes without a lot

00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:25.419
of justification, do you really feel like
you're able to make significant progress on

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:32.370
any of these questions without long form answers,
or more of an academic approach to answering

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.370
these questions?

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:38.559
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah, no. No. I mean, I think
it's--. I don't think we ever really will.

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:44.070
I think that ultimately, what Soul Pancake,
like I said, aimed to be, this is a brand

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.950
and there's gonna be a number of different
platforms from it.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:51.760
And I think ultimately, what we're starting
to see now, which is really cool, are Soul

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.210
Pancake Meetups. 'Cause I think that talk
is cheap and anyone can get on a message board

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.679
and say, "Well, I think this, that, and the
other thing." I think the harder thing is,

00:30:59.679 --> 00:31:04.679
and the most important thing, is putting it
into practice in your life.

00:31:04.679 --> 00:31:12.630
So, this is what I believe. This is what I
stand for. And getting people together in

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:17.000
rooms. There have been people springing up
all over the country, like Soul Pancake breakfasts

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.409
and stuff like that where they use the book
as a tool and talk about life's big questions

00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:24.679
and do some of these challenges together and
take it out in the real world.

00:31:24.679 --> 00:31:31.269
So, we're just trying to figure out new and
interesting ways to do that. So, that's where

00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:32.710
our--. That's where we're headed.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.690
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well we're gonna start taking
questions since we've got about 20, 25 minutes

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.690
left.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.690
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Awesome.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:38.940
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Please feel free to line
up. The people in the aisle might wanna make

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:45.630
a little bit of room for those who are gonna
line up and take questions. There are some

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.300
of the questions on these books are very interesting.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.669
Some of the questions on the site are very
interesting. I actually saw a user post a

00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:56.300
question, though, that said, "Why don't we
hear anything from the authors?" And, "I had

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.070
to go to Wikipedia to look up your religious
beliefs." Or something like that. Are there

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:05.360
any of these questions that you'd like to
present some sort of philosophy on?

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:14.059
I mean, there are questions on there about
regrets and guilt over taking chances, rather

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:21.130
than regrets over not. There are questions
on faith versus reason. Any question that

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.850
you'd like to particularly share your philosophy
on? We'll get the front of the line.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:28.240
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Well, but this is the great
thing, I think, is like no one cares. Look.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.039
I'm a weird-looking comic character actor
from a TV show. No one cares what I think.

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:34.240
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: With the microphone though.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.730
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: With an awesome microphone.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:36.730
[laughter]

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:42.409
And, but really. No one cares what I think.
And I think that's important. That's the last

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:46.990
thing I wanna be doing is pontificating or
saying, "Here's what I believe." I think that's

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.970
what celebrities do way too often.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:58.000
And it's just like, "Shut up, man." So this
is a place for--. This isn't what I believe.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.169
What I believe is that we're human beings
and we all have a lot of the same thoughts

00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:09.740
and feelings and emotions. And when we experience
death in our families, or illness, or trouble,

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:15.559
or beauty, like, we share things. Our neurons
fire in the same ways and there's a collective

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:17.210
transcendent consciousness to that.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:23.019
And let's explore that realm. It's a little
bit underexplored. That's what I believe and

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:29.769
that's what Soul Pancake's about. So, my specific
beliefs about my faith, or regrets, or this

00:33:29.769 --> 00:33:34.700
or that, like, I don't know. I don't think
anyone really cares. I mean, if you care you

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.670
can ask me what I think about something.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.130
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: I'll ask after the talk.
It'll be--.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.160
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You're very loyal wearing
a Google t-shirt.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160
[laughter]

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.519
Is that your only clean t-shirt, or what?

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:46.519
[laughter]

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:47.519
Yeah.

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:48.519
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: That's not true.

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:49.860
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: That's cool.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.360
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Oh, man.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.500
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Here's a brave soul. [pause]
Hello.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:59.649
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Hi. Uhh, OK. First
of all, thank you so much for coming. I appreciate

00:33:59.649 --> 00:34:05.070
it. So obviously, everybody knows you from
being on TV and acting and doing all those

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:10.380
types of things. And so, my question is do
you ever find that there's space to have these

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:15.300
types of conversations with the people that
you work with in that setting? Or, is it all

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:21.500
so busy and so preoccupied with getting the
product out?

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.560
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: So you're really talking about
the set of "The Office", or just in show business

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560
in general?

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.659
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: We could say the
set of "The Office", just to clarify.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:36.099
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah. We, sure. We have a
really great loving family on The Office.

00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:41.669
We're really lucky. I'm gonna burp.

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:43.750
[laughter]

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:54.349
And we talk about a lot of things and share
a lot of things. And it's really open to that.

00:34:54.349 --> 00:35:01.060
And people come to the Soul Pancake site and
the book signing and stuff like that, and

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:07.130
are really interested in it. But we're a really
unique situation in that way. We've been together

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.560
and had our ups and downs and stuff.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:16.030
And we've been working together for seven
years now. So, but we'll get together in Carell's

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:22.359
trailer and say, "What would you cut your
pinky toe off for?" You know, some of these

00:35:22.359 --> 00:35:23.359
challenges.

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:24.359
[laughter]

00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:25.359
Not really, but you know what I mean.

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:26.359
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Thank you.

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:27.359
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: OK.

00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:33.150
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Well, actually that's, so--.
Your character on The Office, Dwight Schrute,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:37.220
is actually at times fiercely ethical, or
fiercely philosophical at the very least,

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.150
almost to the point of sociopathic, where
he doesn't care what the ramifications of

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.720
his beliefs are. He just believes them. And
at other times, he's--.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.890
At times, he's devoted and loyal and ethical,
and other times, malicious and a little bit

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:55.430
evil. Does this character come from somewhere?
Do you feel like there's a reflection of the

00:35:55.430 --> 00:36:00.771
way that you approach problems in a way that
tend to push out to your character? I'm not

00:36:00.771 --> 00:36:05.200
calling you a bad person. I think you're great.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.200
[laughter]

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.510
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: No, that's interesting. Yeah,
Dwight has a very specific philosophy that

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:17.820
is sometimes really warped and sometimes really
right on. And it's a subject of his own little

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:29.960
weird petri dish of his strange Amish family--clannish,
Nazi family, and his survival of the fittest,

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:38.660
Darwinist theories. But he is definitely a
person of principles that are just really

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.710
messed up principles. Yeah. Yes.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.230
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: I wanted to present
a gift for your trip to Twitter tomorrow.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:53.260
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Thank you. A gift to my trip
to Twitter. Thank you. [pause] Oh, thank you.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.260
[laughter]

00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:00.700
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: That is the Gmail bow tie,
if you couldn't, didn't recognize that one

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.850
right off the bat.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:02.850
[laughter]

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.119
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: And I will wear this tomorrow
at Twitter.

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:07.119
[laughter]

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:08.670
Yeah.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:15.119
[applause and cheering]

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:24.240
My son is down there, cackling like a weird
little demon. And he's [laughter] six years

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.321
old and he can't stand that I'm the center
of attention right now. [laughter] It's a

00:37:29.321 --> 00:37:32.470
very competitive thing. He's a little natural
performer.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:35.900
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: I could probably
get him one, too.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.900
[Rainn Wilson laughs]

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.141
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: He just did a pratfall. [laughter]
Very good. Thank you so much for that t-shirt.

00:37:41.141 --> 00:37:42.141
Yes.

00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:43.141
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Sorry, I don't
have a gift, but I do have a question.

00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:44.141
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah.

00:37:44.141 --> 00:37:45.141
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: So you said earlier
in your talk that we have all these areas

00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:46.141
of our life that are fragmented, family, work,
friends. Yet we hear in our professional life,

00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:47.141
that it's really important to separate, if
you wanna be most professional, separate work

00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:50.070
and your personal life.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:58.510
It sounds to me like what you're saying is
that the best way to live is to meld all of

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:15.200
these things together. And if that's not the
case, could you clarify, or tell us, how you

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.390
think we could remedy having all these fragmented
bits of our life, other than what you've talked

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.390
about just coming together and talking about
kind of important questions?

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:28.030
Or, are there other things we could do to
unify our existence, for lack of a better

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.030
words?

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:34.400
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah. That's an excellent
question and very specific. I appreciate it.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.640
I think that what I'm talking about is not
necessarily melding them and bringing them

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:47.960
all together, but viewing them all as a whole.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:54.260
I think that just earlier this morning, it
was interesting. We took my son over to park

00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:00.250
over here, Shoreline Park, to play around
on a playground and there was this dad there

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:05.250
with a Bible. And he was reading the Bible
and he had two kids there. And I'm not meaning

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:11.820
to mock on anyone who reads the Bible or Christians
at all, 'cause I really love the Bible and

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:12.820
I respect it greatly.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:19.020
But he was reading the Bible and his kids
were running around and one kid had his shoes

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.462
off and was running around in the dew grass
and his feet were all muddy and weird and

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:27.410
he didn't even notice. And sometimes the kids
would come over and they'd wanna talk to him,

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.710
but he would like shrug them off and he was
just reading his Bible.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:35.589
And it was like, "Wait a minute! Dad, you're
missing the spiritual moment. The spirituality

00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:43.740
is with your kids in the sunshine, experiencing
life and taking in each breath and seeing

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:53.480
them grow and socialize." And if you're looking
for something, what would Jesus do? Jesus

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.240
would play with the kids. You know what I
mean?

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.420
So it's, in a way, that's what I'm talking
about. It's a fragmentation where things are

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:06.160
viewed as very separate, but it's all one
expression of what it is to be human. When

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.760
people talk about spirituality and religion,
they get a really bad rap in this day and

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.460
age. And I think really what we've done is
just thrown the baby out with the bathwater.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.330
It's like, "Well, religions are stupid and
people kill each other in their name and it's

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.750
a stupid superstition. So we throw it out.
And it doesn't exist." You know what I mean?

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:29.810
It's like, well, wait a minute. There is something
to--. It's interesting that most Americans

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.339
describe themselves as spiritual, but not
religious.

00:40:32.339 --> 00:40:38.810
But spirituality is very important to Americans.
So I'm talking about is that spirituality

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:43.520
is your work, your occupation, and being of
service and providing the tools that Google

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.200
provides for the world community. I mean,
it's free. You get to use a search engine

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.690
and you have this great email and do all this
really cool stuff, including the Wave and

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.040
Chrome that no one ever uses.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.570
[laughter]

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:03.310
You get to, you do all this stuff for free
and it's a great service. And that your occupation

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:08.160
is the same as worship. And your family and
being of service to them is the same as worship.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.839
And your friends and fostering friendships
and bringing people together is worship. And

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:14.640
being in the park with your kids is worship.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:21.960
And it's all a human expression. So rather
than thinking of it in these compartments,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:27.730
"This is what I do for this, this, that, and
the other thing", that it's all one greater

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:35.410
transcendent social human need. And you don't
even have to believe in God to think that.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:42.380
You know what I mean. I don't know if that
clarified it, but that's my thoughts.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.900
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: It does. Thanks.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.900
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: OK. [pause] Do-do-do-do-do-do.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:47.900
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Sorry. Hi.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.900
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Right. Hi.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.900
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So, earlier you
mentioned--.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:56.140
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I wanna say that New York,
there were like, three microphones. They had

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:00.420
lines of people up at each microphone. And
they were like, "And this, what about this?

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.560
What about this?" And they were grilling me.
I don't know. I may have to take back my thoughts

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.930
on New York versus Cupertino, or wherever
we are.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.930
[booing]

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:10.930
[laughter]

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.280
I don't know. Alta Vista.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.920
[laughter]

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.920
Ask Jeeves.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920
[laughter]

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.000
I wanna ask Jeeves whatever happened to Ask
Jeeves.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.330
[laughter]

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:26.160
I'm trying internet jokes out. It's not working
very well.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.160
[laughter]

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160
Yeah, go ahead. What's your question?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.450
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So earlier you
mentioned your sort of Bohemian everythingâ€™s

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:39.070
interconnected upbringing and I was wondering
if you had carried that forward with your

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:44.070
son. And if so, how do you find these deeper
conversations to go with someone so young?

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:49.589
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yes. Well, that's an excellent
question. For my wife and I, and she's sitting

00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:57.290
right over here, the beautiful Holiday Reinhorn.
We believe very strongly in the, I'll call

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:06.329
it the "spiritual education" of our son. And
that doesn't mean like, indoctrination into

00:43:06.329 --> 00:43:12.920
a certain way of thinking, or rote memorization
or something like that. But we do classes

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.579
with local parents that are virtues-based.

00:43:16.579 --> 00:43:22.710
It's virtues-based education. So that you
learn--. So the child learns about compassion,

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:34.000
humility, honesty, and all of these kinds
of virtues, qualities. And that's just as

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.700
much an important part of his education as
arithmetic and stuff like that. We also believe

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.180
in emotional education, really, like we did
ever since he was really young.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.170
Like, if he'd throw a tantrum or something
like that, we'd be like, "Oh, what are you

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:53.089
feeling right now? Oh, you're feeling disappointment.
Oh, what's that like to feel disappointment?"

00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:59.050
And he'd be like, "I feel disappointed." And
it's like, "Oh, that's cool. I know what that's

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:04.990
like. I feel that, too." But I think that
emotional and virtues-based spiritual education

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.369
is something very missing in our schools.

00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:12.350
And I do think that's ultimately the responsibility
of parents or their faith community, or whatever

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:16.100
community you cull together of like-minded
people.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.310
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Awesome. Thanks.
[pause]

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:19.890
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Hey.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.890
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Hey.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:21.890
[laughter]

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.840
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: So, you make your
living as a comedian.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.840
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yes.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.670
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Do you have a philosophy
on comedy? Or, do you just go out there and

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:31.829
do what you think's funny?

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:38.850
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Do I have a philosophy in
comedy? I have a number of things. I mean,

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.920
it's hard to sum it up. I mean, it's been
like, I was acting a long time before I did

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.800
any TV or film. I did ten years of theater
in New York.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:55.490
And I did a lot of â€“ I did clowning and
improv, physical theater and just Shakespeare

00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:02.940
clowns. And so, exploring comedy from a number
of different things. But I would say that

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.849
the most important thing that I think of with
comedy, that I think Dwight aligns with, is

00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:14.470
that the actor can never think that it's funny.
I hate comedy movies where you can tell that

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.470
the actors think it's hysterical what they're
doing. And--

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.119
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: So you don't like
Will Ferrell?

00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:22.150
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: No, I mean--.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.680
[laughter]

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.849
That's a tricky one. I don't like "Anchorman."
But there's other Will Ferrell movies that

00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:31.770
I love. I love "Talladega," and I just saw
"The Other Guys" and I thought they were great.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.839
And I think that, 'cause I think that there's
stories there and characters there, and even

00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:42.310
when they just go and riff and the improv
stuff, I do think that they're able to keep

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.700
it on story and keep it in character and stuff
like that.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:53.430
So, I mostly believe--. I'm not really a comedian.
I don't do stand-up stuff, but I believe in

00:45:53.430 --> 00:46:01.190
really great characters with really high stakes,
pursuing what they want and having no idea

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:07.600
how ridiculous they look. And I think that's
the origin of most great comedy. Yeah.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:13.500
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Thank you.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.510
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: OK. Go away. [laughter] Right
now. Hi.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.511
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Hi. So, you're
earlier answer about integrating all the different

00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:19.511
parts of your life--

00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:20.511
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Mm-hmm.

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:21.511
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: made me think
about some of the things that prevent people

00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:22.511
from doing that is just a general pettiness
and fleshiness and monkeyness of being human.

00:46:22.511 --> 00:46:23.511
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Ahh.

00:46:23.511 --> 00:46:24.670
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: I think Dwight
expresses that, like the philosophy and the

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:25.670
principles that he abides by, but also how
petty he is.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.670
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Uh-huh.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.550
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: And it made me
think of this quote from "The Adventures of

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:40.589
Baron Munchausen", where he goes, "I'm busy
running the universe. I don't have time for

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:48.130
orgasms and flatulence." So I'm just wondering
how you, how do you integrate these parts

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:51.310
of your life along with the pettiness of humanity,
or just being human?

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:52.310
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: How do I do it?

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.550
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Yeah. How do
you do it?

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.720
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Really? Do you really care
how I do it?

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.720
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Well, we're--

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.609
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: I think we should ask this
guy how he does it.

00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:00.609
[laughter]

00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:04.871
I mean, it doesn't--. I will say that it doesn't
really--. Thank you for the question. I don't

00:47:04.871 --> 00:47:17.160
mean to be disrespectful. How do I do it?
I have a set of spiritual beliefs and philosophical

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:29.849
beliefs that I try and set my sail toward
and that enrich my soul.

00:47:29.849 --> 00:47:36.300
And I try and make all aspects of my life
a soul, heart-centered, soul-enriching, parts

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:43.730
of my life. I don't view my work as playing
Dwight is any different than worshipping or

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:51.130
being devotional. I think it's a service that
I do. I have the ability to look weird and

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:56.550
make people laugh in a weird haircut. And
so, but it's hard.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:01.040
It's hard to integrate the stuff. And it's
hard to bring people together. So I struggle

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:08.710
with it and fail a lot. You could ask my wife,
daily. But that's what I try and do. What

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:09.710
do you try and do?

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.900
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Meditate. I try
to do the same thing, but I definitely find

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.940
that I fail more often than I succeed.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.861
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah, me too. Totally. And
meditation is something that I try and do

00:48:19.861 --> 00:48:25.830
every day, but it's something I really love.
And it's really cool. And I kinda need it

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.180
for the way my mind works.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.369
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Thanks.

00:48:28.369 --> 00:48:32.450
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Can I introduce the other
authors of my book? They're all up here. Devon

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.099
and Golriz and Shabnam. Will you come up and
wave hello to everyone?

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:39.680
[applause]

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:46.190
Where'd the guy in the striped shirt go?

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.080
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: I think you scared him away.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:54.410
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Where'd he go? Tell him to
get back in there. I'm serious. I'm gonna

00:48:54.410 --> 00:49:00.970
kick his ass. I'm going in to Twitter tomorrow,
in San Francisco. Not out here in the 'burbs.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:08.119
[laughter] I want his name. You know, just
come up here you guys. Just say hi. What?

00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:10.730
[laughter]

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:15.020
Hi. These are my co-authors. They're awesome.
They help run the site and the company and

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:20.140
they just shot these webisodes. And they're
awesome and I just wanted to--. Please shower

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.511
them with loving applause right now.

00:49:21.511 --> 00:49:23.340
[applause]

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:32.079
All right? Right. Now, now, now I'd like you
to shower them with urine.

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.079
[laughter]

00:49:33.079 --> 00:49:42.510
No, sit down. You guys wanna sit down? Sit
down. Thanks, Jesse. Thanks. [pause] Do you

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:47.010
guys have anything to say at this point? Do
you have any thoughts? Do you have any questions

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.270
for the Google people? [pause]

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.970
&gt;&gt;Golriz Lucina: He has a question.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:56.431
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: We need help with our website.
All of you. You know, if you have any ideas

00:49:56.431 --> 00:49:59.950
or anything, if you guys see the website--.
I know there's some of the brightest minds

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:06.000
in the whole world in here. So, if you have
any ideas, send it to wehavegoodideasfromGoogle@soulpancake.com.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.280
I'm gonna make that address right now. And--.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.280
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: For real?

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.030
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: Yeah. I'll make it right now.
Well, five minutes from now.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.820
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: wehavegoodideas--.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.091
&gt;&gt;Devon: wehavegoodideas@Google. No, that
doesn't work.

00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:21.091
[laughter]

00:50:21.091 --> 00:50:23.910
There's too many at's in there.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.010
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Googleideas?

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:26.010
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: Yeah, googleideas@soulpancake.com.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:27.010
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Googleideas.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.010
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: You can all send us.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.150
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: So you guys are like the most
brilliant collective of brains outside of

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.550
Facebook, and--

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:34.550
[laughter]

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:35.550
[groaning]

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:42.309
that. No. Outside of just a few. Facebook
and Yahoo, Twitter--

00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:43.309
[laughter]

00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:44.490
and a few of these places.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:50.300
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: We're just a small start-up.
So we're working on it.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.890
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: And that's pretty good. Fourth
or fifth best.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:56.829
[laughter]

00:50:56.829 --> 00:51:06.220
So, Microsoft. What? The, so, googleideas?
If you have ideas, just look at the website.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:12.690
And if you have an unemployed developer friend,
'cause we will hire. We'll pay like, not very

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:18.970
much, but. Or, if you have ideas how to make
the site better and stuff like that, googleideas@soulpancake.com.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:24.300
Yeah, I like it. OK. Good. Thanks. And your
resident hippie is here. Yes.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.420
[laughter]

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.821
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: I thought I was the resident
hippie.

00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.819
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: What did you just
say about haircuts a second ago? So, thank

00:51:32.819 --> 00:51:36.550
you for coming, though. I think a frequent
criticism of younger people these days is

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:41.520
that we're self-absorbed and fundamentally
unserious and don't have the attention spans

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.500
for anything longer than say, a YouTube video
or 140 characters.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:50.780
And so, as an artist encouraging people to
make art, do you think we're past the days

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:57.070
where a symphony can cause a riot? Or, to
what extent do you think art still has consequences?

00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:00.839
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: That's an awesome question.
You're smart.

00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:01.839
[laughter]

00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:05.090
What do you work on? You work on Maps?

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:06.671
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Facebook.

00:52:06.671 --> 00:52:07.671
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Facebook?

00:52:07.671 --> 00:52:09.700
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: I could work on that.

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.480
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: That's a good question.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.020
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: [ ] you got?

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.100
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Devon, you're smart, too.
Do you want--?

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.100
&gt;&gt;Devon Gundry: No.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.100
&gt;&gt;Golriz Lucina: [ ]

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.250
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: You talk. OK, take this one.
Take it. You take it.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.250
&gt;&gt;Shabnam Mogharabi: Well look at what happened
in Denmark with the comic illustrations of

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.250
Muhammad. I mean, that was serious consequences
of art. I think that, of course, art has consequences.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.250
It just comes in different formats now.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:33.530
I mean, you can look online and see videos
that move you more than the Mona Lisa did

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:41.030
a hundred years ago. But it's just taken a
different format. I think it still does.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:48.839
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: That's a very good point.
I think that the reason there were riots in

00:52:48.839 --> 00:52:57.579
the theaters when Ubu Roi was performed back
in the turn of the century in Paris and is,

00:52:57.579 --> 00:53:02.329
there's--. Society had so many constraints
and arts were always butting up against those.

00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:06.750
Ever since you had the--what is it?-- the
cup girls, the three girls in the cup kind

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.750
of thing--.

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:08.750
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: [ ]

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:09.750
[laughter]

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.680
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: No. Ever since that, you can't
do anything worse than that. You know what

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:17.940
I mean? [laughter] Like, humanity reached
its low point. We had literally like--. Everything

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.900
had become totally, it was just the worst.
[laughter]

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:27.130
I see a bunch of people like, "What's he talking
about?" It's like, "Oh, don't." [laughter]

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:32.059
Do not--. Do not Yahoo search that, OK?

00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:33.369
[laughter]

00:53:33.369 --> 00:53:43.670
Don't, don't. But that's an interesting thing.
I think that everything is--. You can't really,

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:47.040
Shabnam makes an excellent point. There are
certain sectors of the world, I think, that

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.270
still can be, that has great ramifications.

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:54.270
But in this day and age, everyone has seen
everything. And it's all so fractured and

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:59.609
dispersed. I think that when the systems continue
to break down, our political system is breaking

00:53:59.609 --> 00:54:05.990
down more every election cycle. I think when
our economic system is breaking down, environmental

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:11.230
systems are breaking down, flocks of birds
are falling from the sky, all of these systems

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:12.230
are gonna break down.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:19.110
People are gonna start going like, "Holy shit.
The whole thing is starting to unravel. Holy

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:26.020
shit. What the fuck do we do?" And they will
try and pull together in communities and be

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:31.370
like, "We've gotta make the world a better
place and we gotta take it on ourselves."

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:35.431
Obama's not gonna do it. Or John Boner, whoever,
is not gonna--.

00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:42.520
They're not gonna do it for us. The United
Nations isn't so, we have to do this ourselves.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:48.660
So, I think art will be an expression of that.
So, the power of art, I think, is to ultimately

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:55.390
in the future, to bring people together to
unite and to bring a cause and a mission and

00:54:55.390 --> 00:55:00.510
a movement. So, that's a good question. I
don't know. That's a long discussion. You

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.670
should post it on Soul Pancake. Yeah. Yes.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:03.730
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: So you talk about
how we have trouble talking to each other

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:19.849
about deeper questions. And I think your website
is really interesting in a way because I feel

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:22.470
like with the onslaught of social media, a
Twitter, Facebook, iPods, everything. I feel

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:28.890
like, in a way, we're a lot more disconnected.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:29.890
Like, you go sit next to someone on public
transportation, they've got their iPod on

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:30.900
and this like, "Fuck you" look, "don't talk
to me." And how do you think that affects--.

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.490
Do you think that affects how we deal with
each other and why, maybe, we're not talking

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.490
about these things?

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:46.650
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Yeah. I think that communities
of people used to go to dances, square dances,

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:54.130
and then they used to go bowling. And now,
they play Call of Duty in their own world.

00:55:54.130 --> 00:56:02.680
So I think that--. I do think that it's an
issue that humanity will have to face because

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:09.350
we're social beings. And being social is a
need of ours. And it's drifting away. I'm

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:11.119
losing the audience rapidly. Bye, everybody.

00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:14.620
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: As we approach the end of
the hour, we actually have time for one more

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:16.329
question. But we have to wrap this.

00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:21.119
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Did I answer, I didn't answer
that. Well, is that clear? What am I thinking?

00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:26.650
Yeah. It's a problem. Yeah. It's a problem.
We need to bring people together and be social

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:33.069
beings again. And I have that problem, too.
I'm always checking my phone and my emails.

00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:40.040
And I play Call of Duty, too. So, it's balancing
it. Thanks.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:43.900
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: All right. I
don't know if my question is worthy of being

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.069
the last one, but this is an actor--.

00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:46.079
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Get out of here. You. Yeah.

00:56:46.079 --> 00:56:47.079
[laughter]

00:56:47.079 --> 00:56:48.079
OK, go ahead.

00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:49.079
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: This is an actor
question. Since actors portray different types

00:56:49.079 --> 00:56:53.030
of characters, depending on what their role
is, do you think that actors are, in some

00:56:53.030 --> 00:57:02.859
way, more in touch with the human experience
to be able to bring themselves to those different

00:57:02.859 --> 00:57:11.280
types of characters? And if so, how do you
think they gain that ability?

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.790
Is it something that's natural? Is it something
that can be learned or developed upon?

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:23.930
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: That's a good question. I
think that acting--. I don't think that actors

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:32.180
are smarter or more in touch or anything like
that. I really don't. I mean, it's just a

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:37.460
weird, it's a weird thing. It's definitely
a skill that can be learned. Like, when I

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.700
started, I was not a very good actor and I
had to--. And I think I'm a pretty good actor,

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.700
now.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.280
But I had to work really hard at it. I had
to go to three years of grad school and do,

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.290
be a spear carrier in Shakespeare plays.

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:49.450
[laughter]

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:58.040
I had to really work at it to gain my confidence
and figure out what I was doing. But I've

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:03.710
worked with kid actors that have never taken
a lesson and they just do it. And they're

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:13.480
like, incredibly facile and brilliant at what
they do. And it's a weird mystery. I mean,

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:18.520
why do some kids pick up the guitar at age
9 and then all of a sudden they're just writing

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.440
albums on their, what's it called? Band camp?
The thing on the--?

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.440
&gt;&gt;Devon: GarageBand.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:30.270
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: GarageBand. And they're composing
symphonies. It just, I don't know. It's one

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:34.400
of the mysteries of the arts. So, I wish I
had a better answer. Any thoughts on that?

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.400
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #5: Thank you.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.810
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Any of you guys? I think that's
all the time we have. So, I'm sorry my man.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.490
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #11: No, it's all right.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:44.170
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: If you see him later, give
him a hug.

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:47.180
&gt;&gt;Jesse Nichols: Yeah, well. We do have a
table back there. So please make sure you

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:53.309
pick up a book. And, again, Soul Pancake,
the book. Buy it. Soulpancake.com. Visit it.

00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:54.309
Rainn Wilson.

00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:55.441
&gt;&gt;Rainn Wilson: Thank you, Google. Thanks
for having me.

00:58:55.441 --> 00:59:00.300
[applause]
