when I started thinking about this

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790
when I started thinking about this
 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.570
when I started thinking about this
almost all my associations with aging or

is that it is in no way typical of aging

the statistics the latest statistics

this statistic has dropped significantly
 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.889

just in the ten years I've been studying

just in the ten years I've been studying
 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.729
just in the ten years I've been studying
is it is that one out of ten of the

age is the biggest risk factor so the

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160
age is the biggest risk factor so the
 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.520
age is the biggest risk factor so the
percentage increases as you get older

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530
percentage increases as you get older
 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.490

anything aging related is that as we

grow older we acquire more experiences

think right now and probably way better

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200
think right now and probably way better
 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.920

the better because then we can see a

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
