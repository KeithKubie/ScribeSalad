00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:02.110
JERRY MARCH: Hi, everybody.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.880
Thank you for coming.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.250
My name is Jerry March.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.560
I am the chief operating officer
and a partner at KenKen Puzzle

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.130
Company.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.960
And actually, before I
start, I just wanted to know,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
how many of you folks
know what KenKen is?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.550
OK.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.000
So most of you do.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.240
That's great.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.370
Just a little background.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.170
You know, KenKen is a
logic and math puzzle

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.230
that was brought to the United
States a number of years ago,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.790
but was originally
developed in Japan.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.304
We're currently in over
150 newspapers worldwide.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.970
We have hundreds of
thousands of puzzles

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.430
played every day on
our website, on our iOS

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.270
and our Android apps.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450
And it's really the
fastest-growing puzzle

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.560
since Sudoku.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.960
However, as we like to say,
it's really Sudoku on steroids.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.200
It's a much deeper, and as far
as we're concerned, a much more

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.410
fun and addicting puzzle.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.920
And it's done by
adults worldwide.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.150
But KenKen was brought
the United States

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.940
a number of years ago by
my partner, Bob Fuhrer,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.970
but it was invented in
a Japanese classroom

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.350
by our guest today,
Tatsuya Miyamoto.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.000
Mr. Miyamoto has a
very unique style

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.250
of teaching, which he
calls the art of teaching

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.910
without teaching.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.090
And he used KenKen and other
similar logic types of puzzles

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.060
to teach children and to
have them achieve in math,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.760
to teach them reasoning,
creativity, perseverance,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.390
and develop their
self-confidence.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.990
But the way he did
it was very unusual.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.420
And rather than
me go into it, I'd

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.350
rather him explain
to you how he used

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.361
KenKen and his other puzzles and
how he developed his teaching

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:47.860
method.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.430
So rather than
listen to me speak,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.490
I will introduce Mr. Miyamoto.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.080
And actually, before
I do, I forgot,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.900
I was asked by the powers that
be for you to all make sure

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.980
that you turn off your personal
embarrassment devices, whatever

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.600
types of devices you have, to
make sure it doesn't go off

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.470
in the middle.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.925
So without further ado,
here is Tatsuya Miyamoto.

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:14.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.270
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Hi, everybody.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.740
Why must we learn and study?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.760
For what?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.210
It's for happy life.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.390
Happy life-- what is it?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.980
Entering a high-level
university?

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.260
Working with a good
company like Google

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.620
and getting a high
salary, like you?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.230
Is it always a happy life?

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.590
I don't think so.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.240
Happy life is a life that
you live who you truly are.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.390
Nobody can teach you about that.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.530
You have to find it by yourself.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.170
And self-knowledge and
experiences are necessary.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.000
And you have to think with
your own brain, long and deep.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.520
I run a mathematics class
for primary school students

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.950
since 1993.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.830
My math class is unique.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.400
I am a teacher, but I
don't like teaching.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.100
In fact, I don't teach.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.690
The art of teaching
without teaching is my way.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.090
I had thought, how can
I make students smart?

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.530
Do you think that
students become smart

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.360
after a careful explanation?

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.630
No, not at all.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.380
If this is true, my
job is a piece of cake.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.140
After a careful
explanation, students

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.370
have an illusion that
they can understand.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.570
But they cannot solve the
problem by themselves.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.350
When I was young, I liked to
teach and thought too much.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.060
My poor students could not
think with their own brains.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.720
It's my mistake and sin.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.550
I changed my mind.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.710
Then, how can I
make students smart?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.360
I found the answer at last.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.400
The essence of
learning mathematics

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.710
is to keep thinking.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.780
It doesn't matter whether
you can solve or not.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.990
It doesn't matter whether
you can understand or not.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.680
Do not want the answer.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.690
Just enjoy trial and error.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.660
Then, someday, the correct
answer will come up to you.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.310
Reason three, I
have many chances

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.970
to drink with my
former students.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.310
Of course, they're
over 21 years old.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.630
All of my former students I
reunite with spend happy life.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.030
They enjoy challenges in life
as they enjoyed trial and error

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.500
in my math lesson
in their childhoods.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.940
It makes me happy, because
they're living evidences

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.180
that Miyamoto's method, the art
of teaching without teaching,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.465
is really working.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.630
By the way, do you know KenKen?

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.310
KenKen is a math puzzle.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.970
It looks like this.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.450
You may see it in "New
York Times" or "LA Times."

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.500
KenKen is now over 150
newspapers or magazines

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.180
all over the world.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.875
And I am the inventor of KenKen.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.410
Now I'll tell you my
KenKen invention story.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.480
First two years after
I founded my class,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.270
I had only math lessons
for fourth grade

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.810
to sixth grade of
primary school students.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.970
Do you know that there are
four kinds of math problems,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:02.990
easy and fun, easy and no fun,
difficult and fun, difficult

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.500
and no fun?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.660
I make only
interesting problems.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.030
I believe that only
interesting problems

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.930
can make students smart.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.520
They can catch students' hearts
easily and never release.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.525
I had an interesting experience
related to that belief.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.060
Do you remember we
had a heavy earthquake

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.480
in Japan, March 11 in 2011?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.950
It was Friday afternoon.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.270
I was walking on my way to home.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.450
The ground began
to move suddenly.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.610
It was the biggest earthquake
I've ever experienced.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:04.270
And I had lessons on the
next day and two days later.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.860
Transportation network was
not recovered completely,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.510
but surprisingly,
most of the students

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.100
came to attend classes.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.600
A lot of aftershock
occurred during lessons.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.490
I felt clearly,
and I was scared.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:34.380
But no student laid their head.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.240
They didn't even
recognize aftershocks,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:47.630
because they were devoted into
my program very, very deep.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:53.400
I was so surprised and
impressed-- how great.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.790
All of my students
are not so smart,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.060
because I don't select students.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.470
I accept my students
first come, first

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.170
served basis without an exam.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.530
So this miracle is
something caused

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.260
by the force of my problems.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.720
Almost all math problems for
fourth grade to sixth grade

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.530
were made by me in
the first two years.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.960
I wanted to start something new.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.430
Some parents who
had third graders

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:41.000
asked me, please set up a
class for third graders.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.560
I considered it for one week.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.100
I didn't want to give
them math problems.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.040
Rather, I wanted to
give them material which

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.680
they enjoyed trial and error.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:05.500
And I searched good materials
for thinking, and I found it.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.190
It's a puzzle.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:14.130
I started puzzle class
for third graders in 1995.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.420
They were absorbed in
puzzles day by day.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.850
They became to think
longer and deeper.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:28.380
I made many kinds of
puzzles almost every day,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.470
but they were not enough.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:38.710
I needed puzzles that
required all four operations,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.010
and I invented KenKen in 2003.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:51.370
First, KenKen was a four-by-four
grid size, as is shown, only.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.550
And I created KenKen with
addition only, four-by-four

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:01.080
to nine-by-nine grid size.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.640
Then I created KenKen with
a variety of combinations

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.830
of operations, such as addition
and subtraction, multiplication

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.410
only, multiplication and
division, and all four

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.990
operations with symbols.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:24.130
I continued to make
KenKen one after another.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.420
Finally, I deleted
math operations,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.080
which added an additional
challenge that made

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.420
students think even harder.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.420
All trials were successful.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.510
At last, one KenKen
was completed.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.450
I did it.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.090
I couldn't stop
screaming and dancing.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:51.640
I did it.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.400
I did it.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:01.210
Like Archimedes, I have
made many kinds of puzzles.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:07.550
KenKen is one of them, but
KenKen is a special one.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.190
KenKen could make my
students strive dramatically.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.870
They never give up.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.080
They never compromise.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.020
My teaching method, the art
of teaching without teaching,

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.460
where students have to
struggle to figure out answers

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.680
by themselves, has
made them successful in

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.380
many different areas in life.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.810
They become successful medical
doctors, bankers, scientists,

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.430
teachers, farmers, and artists.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.180
One of them even
became a ballerina

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.050
in a famous ballet
theater in Europe.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.380
Recently, I went to drink
with my former student who is

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.450
the first generation of KenKen.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.990
He goes to the best
medical school in Japan.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:05.980
He looked focused and determined
forward the goal of his life.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.970
To me, KenKen clearly
supports my students

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:16.070
to have happy lives, so I'm
looking forward to drink

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.760
with more KenKen generations.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.900
Not only to my
students, but KenKen

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.800
also gives me many benefits.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.390
KenKen made me famous.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.760
KenKen made me rich.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.630
Now I have classes in
Manhattan and Tokyo.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.900
I live in Manhattan
eight months and live

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.020
in Tokyo four months in a year.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.360
It's exciting and interesting.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.290
Before I came to
Manhattan, I was already

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.060
having a happy life
in Tokyo, so I didn't

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.330
need to do something new.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:11.555
But two experiences changed
my thoughts in 2013.

00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:17.140
The first experience
began from one email.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:23.440
I previously was interested
in only my classroom, and only

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.430
my students.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.370
I received an email
from a math teacher

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.330
in Paris American
school, Melissa.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.510
She said, we are going to
Japan with 18 the students

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.032
next April.

00:14:40.032 --> 00:14:44.150
Can we visit to your
classroom with my students?

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.930
I'd like you to give a
lesson to my students.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.800
I know your classroom
is near Tokyo Station.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:58.210
I was surprised that she knew
about me and my philosophy,

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.650
very much.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:07.940
I thought about it for one week,
because I cannot speak English

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.675
very well.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:17.770
It's my serious weak
point, even now.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.110
But I decided to accept them.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.480
I believed it must be
a beautiful experience

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.170
for me and for them.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.820
Melissa and I exchanged
emails quite often.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.100
A few months later, three
teachers and 18 students

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.340
came to Tokyo.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.990
The students were
14 to 16 years old.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:51.700
As a first stage, I put 30
kinds of my books on the table.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.270
And I told them,
I'll give you a book.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.550
Pick one.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:04.470
But be careful, because you
will try to solve it later.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.190
Including the three teachers,
everyone took a book

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.290
and went back to their seat.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.020
Then I said, I'll
give you 50 minutes.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.680
Do as you like.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.150
Everybody began to solve.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.110
Nobody gave up.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:27.820
Melissa said to me,
it's really amazing

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.505
to see my students continue
thinking such a long time.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:43.240
I answered, it's the
power of my books.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.810
Interesting problems can
catch students' heart easy

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.750
and never release.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:54.540
The students of Paris wanted
to meet Japanese students,

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.180
so I sent an email to my
former student in [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.865
and 17 students joined
the event that day.

00:17:04.865 --> 00:17:10.079
The second stage was a puzzle
contest with my new puzzle

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.200
that no one had
ever seen before.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.510
Three talented former students
had a fierce dead heat,

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.190
and one of them
became world champion.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.530
It was really exciting.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:33.560
The third stage was an
exchange meeting of one to one.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.940
The students at Paris talked
slowly in the beginning,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.570
but a few minutes
later, they began

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.710
to talk with normal speed.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.540
I thought my former students
could not understand,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.330
but I let them [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:54.330 --> 00:18:01.490
After that, most of my former
students who joined the event

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.316
went to study abroad.

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:07.267
The final stage was karaoke.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:18.020
We moved to a karaoke box, and
we sang only one song, "You've

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.520
Got a Friend" by Carole King.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.530
Do you know that?

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.960
(SINGING) When you're
down and troubled

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:35.080
and you need some loving
care, and nothing, nothing

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.080
is going right--

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.870
That song.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:47.900
I love that song very
much, but nobody knew it.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:55.670
So I sent an email, the
YouTube URL of the song,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:01.540
and asked them, practice
more than 100 times.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.550
We will sing this song
at the end of the event,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.300
and we could sing
aloud, together.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.080
After that, I sent off the
Paris team at the station.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.940
It was one of the most
beautiful days in my life.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.490
It was also the day
I had the first time

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:31.310
interested in students
other than my own.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:36.550
Five days later, Melissa
gave me a heartwarming email.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.460
She said it was the most
memorable day, like a dream,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.190
visiting Japan this time.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:50.970
I appreciate you and all staff
from the bottom of my heart.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.940
After reading this
email, I thought,

00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.200
all students in American
schools come to Japan.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.100
I will entertain you.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.680
This was an eye-opening
experience to me.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.610
Here is a group of
fashionable students

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:22.270
who seemed completely
uninterested in math,

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.520
loved and benefited
from my puzzles.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.700
And I wondered whether
or not the same

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.380
would hold true
in another country

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.650
where students have
less opportunity.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.490
I had the chance to visit
a primary school in Chiang

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.840
Rai, Thailand, a month after
Melissa and her students

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.720
came to see me.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.450
I had a plan to teach
how to solve KenKen

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.930
and how to make KenKen.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:07.500
I would tell them, if you can
make more than 100 KenKen,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.390
I will bring them to
the publishing company

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.170
to publish the book.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:20.270
All the royalties of the book
will be donated to your school.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:26.960
So I went to Thailand, and
I had 90-minute lessons

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.720
to fifth graders
and sixth graders.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:39.080
Before the trip, I was warned,
they can not even calculate,

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.630
so I was very nervous.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.160
But it was not true.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.160
They enjoyed KenKen,
just like my students.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.750
Some of them were much
smarter than I expected.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.600
They could solve KenKen,
and they could make KenKen.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.400
I thought that, the schools
all over the world, call me.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.560
I will go to entertain you.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.750
These two experiences changed
my thoughts dramatically.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.930
I wanted to have lessons with
students in foreign countries.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:29.130
I was waiting and waiting,
but nothing happened.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:35.210
I needed to grow myself,
and I needed a challenge.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.720
What should I do next?

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.750
Where should I go?

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:45.070
Next to the center of
Japan, near Tokyo Station,

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.640
one idea came to me.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.310
It's Manhattan, New York,
near Grand Central Station.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:23:02.070
I decided to move my classroom
from Tokyo to Manhattan.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:07.350
Only five months later,
this event happened.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:12.020
The biggest benefit
from KenKen was

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:17.520
the-- the biggest
benefit from KenKen

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:23.130
was that KenKen brought
me to New York City.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:33.020
I moved to New York in February
10, 2015, with a green card.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.840
[CLAPPING]

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.590
Thank you very
much-- category E11.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:47.140
Before that, I had an interview
in the United States embassy

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.240
in Tokyo.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:55.390
The counselor says to me,
your visa is wonderful.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.460
I couldn't understand at all.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.060
I checked up category
E11 on the internet.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.420
The Immigration
Department said, it's

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:11.690
for individuals in
extraordinary abilities

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:19.900
in the arts, science, education,
business, or authority.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.590
Unbelievable-- it's
because of KenKen.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.830
I'm an ordinary man.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.920
I don't have any talent.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.060
Thank you, KenKen.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.920
KenKen was originally
handmade by me,

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.480
but the mass market, a
KenKen-generating program

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.170
was required.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.090
KenKen Puzzle Company
contracted with a pioneer

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:53.500
in computer chess development
and long-time president

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.660
of the Computer
Games Association.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:04.970
AI expert Dr. David Levy
interviewed me extensively

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.870
and applied this
knowledge in engineering

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:14.540
to help design the algorithm
that is known as "Kenerator."

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.510
The Kenerator verified
that there is only one

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.420
solution in each puzzle.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.670
Sometimes solvers
contact us believing they

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.110
have found a flaw in a puzzle.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:38.190
But up to now, no puzzle
generated by Kenerator

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:46.700
has ever been found to have an
error or alternative solution.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.636
I feel KenKen has
unlimited possibilities.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:59.790
It's a dream of mine to
create an online head-to-head

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.580
competition platform
where students

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.280
from Thailand or Paris
or the United States

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.380
can create their own KenKen,
solve each other's KenKen,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:21.750
and compete in the way where
language isn't a barrier.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:28.550
Then, KenKen will be a true
international learning tool.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:34.770
Now I'll show you
how to make KenKen.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:42.110
Before that, let's go
over the rules of KenKen.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.990
This is four by
four, addition only.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.380
You can use 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.680
Every row, every column
has 1, 2, 3, 4 once.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.330
Do not repeat the same
number on the same line.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.500
OK?

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.844
You can use 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:27:04.844 --> 00:27:10.320
And the small numbers
mean some of the numbers

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.380
in the heavy line.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.200
Two numbers make 7.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.870
What are these two numbers?

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.163
Only one combination.

00:27:21.163 --> 00:27:21.788
AUDIENCE: 4, 3.

00:27:21.788 --> 00:27:22.746
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4, 3.

00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:23.360
4, 3.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.180
4, 3 or 3, 4.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.060
Next, two numbers make 6.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.530
What are these two numbers?

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.660
2, 4.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.900
3 and 3 is against the rules.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.400
2, 4 or 4, 2.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.706
Anyway, what is this?

00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:44.520
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.380
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3 and?

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.930
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.870
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Good.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.840
3, 2, 4 or 3, 4, 2.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.490
Anyway, what is this?

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.027
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:27:55.027 --> 00:27:55.860
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.120
Two numbers make 3.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.820
What is this?

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.890
AUDIENCE: 1, 2.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.480
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Great.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.060
Here is 7.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.450
Here is 4.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.150
What is this?

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:05.920
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3 and?

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.660
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.460
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.410
2, 4, 4, 2-- here is 4.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.350
Then, what is this?

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.940
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.026
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2 and?

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:15.980
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.980
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.160
4, 3, 2, then 1.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.703
Two numbers make 3.

00:28:21.703 --> 00:28:22.367
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.200
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.571
4, 1, 2-- then?

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:26.070
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.903
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.

00:28:26.903 --> 00:28:27.830
Two numbers make 4.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.329
Then?

00:28:28.329 --> 00:28:29.560
1.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.730
Two numbers make 7.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.280
Here is 4.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.850
What is this?

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:32.460
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.621
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3 and?

00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:34.120
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.030
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.631
4, 1, 3-- then?

00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:37.130
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.143
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.

00:28:38.143 --> 00:28:39.110
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.290
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Perfect.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.850
Well done, but it's not the end.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.500
Let's check the answer.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.570
Every row, every column
has 1, 2, 3, 4 once.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:29:00.370
3 plus 4 equals 7, 1 plus 2, 3,
3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 6, 3,

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.620
4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.470
Perfect.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:15.390
Next, I'm going to show
you how to make KenKen.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.960
I usually make KenKen
from the answer.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:36.260
I'm going to make
the first block here.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.970
Sum of 1, 2, 1 equals 4.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.420
Second block here.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.200
Sum of 1, 2, 3.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.510
Then, 6.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:57.340
Next, 4 plus 3 equals 7.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.420
Next, 3 plus 4 equals 7.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.890
4 plus 2 equals 6.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.260
1 plus 2 equals 3.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:13.230
3 plus 4 equals 7.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.450
It's a KenKen problem
and its answer.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.460
I deleted the answer numbers.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.610
I will delete the
answer numbers.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.900
Then, one KenKen baby
has just been born.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.690
My baby, how cute you are.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.230
Let's solve it.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.166
Three numbers make 6.

00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:48.290
What are the three numbers?

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:48.990
AUDIENCE: 1, 2, 3.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.073
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1, 2, 3.

00:30:50.073 --> 00:30:51.800
1, 2, 3.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.081
Anyway, what is this?

00:30:53.081 --> 00:30:53.580
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.290
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4, 3.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:01.216
Three numbers make 4,
only one combination, 1--

00:31:01.216 --> 00:31:01.872
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:31:01.872 --> 00:31:02.746
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2--

00:31:02.746 --> 00:31:03.420
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.200
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: That's right.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.840
Next, two numbers make 3.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.450
Here is one.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.091
What is this?

00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:10.590
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.610
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2 and?

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.110
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.943
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.

00:31:12.943 --> 00:31:14.860
1, 2-- then?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.360
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.200
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.950
Here is 1.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.430
What is this?

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.630
2, 1.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.215
3, 2, 1-- then?

00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:23.715
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.396
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4 and?

00:31:24.396 --> 00:31:25.110
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.943
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.

00:31:25.943 --> 00:31:27.248
1, 4, 2-- then?

00:31:27.248 --> 00:31:28.140
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.310
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3, 4--

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.140
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.973
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.080
Perfect.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.046
Let's check the problem
by KenKen solver.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:57.420
[INAUDIBLE] Every KenKen
has only one solution.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:02.080
If it has more than two
solutions, it's failed.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.380
Let's check this problem.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.715
This solver is only for me.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.950
Three numbers make 6.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:28.570
Two numbers make 7.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:35.530
Three numbers make 4.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:43.020
Two numbers make 7.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.688
Two numbers make 6.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.930
Two numbers make 3.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.574
Two numbers make 7.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.210
Let's check the answer.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.030
Only one solution-- perfect.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.310
Is there anybody who
wants to make a KenKen?

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
these markers?

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.980
That's OK.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.229
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:34.229 --> 00:33:40.120
AUDIENCE: OK, cool So I like
to start with ones that there's

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120
only one solution.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.941
So I might box off
this and make a 9.

00:33:49.024 --> 00:33:56.691
And then I might
make-- oh, thank you.

00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:57.190
Sorry.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.230
OK-- 8.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:08.300
And then I would probably
make this, here, a 5.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.416
And then I'd probably
make this an 8.

00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:18.810
Sorry.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.881
And then, make that a 7.

00:34:25.108 --> 00:34:34.440
And then I'd probably
make this a 5.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:40.040
And then, I'd probably make
this a freebie, with just a 3.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.560
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
One moment, please.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.318
Does your KenKen have
only one solution?

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.667
Do you guarantee?

00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:54.730
AUDIENCE: I'll have
to see in a second.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.650
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3, 4, 3.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.822
AUDIENCE: That's a freebie.

00:34:57.822 --> 00:34:58.321
Is it OK?

00:34:58.321 --> 00:34:58.790
Or should I make it--

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.081
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Ah, only one.

00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:01.960
Hai, hai, hai.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.321
Only one 3.

00:35:04.321 --> 00:35:04.820
3.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:11.127 --> 00:35:12.177
5.

00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:13.635
AUDIENCE: Oh, wait,
I think it's 5.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.258
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: There you go.

00:35:18.258 --> 00:35:33.510
[INAUDIBLE] The 3 there-- 7.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.514
7 and?

00:35:36.514 --> 00:35:37.180
AUDIENCE: Oh, 8?

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.013
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 8.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.760
8.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.006
Let's check the answer.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.200
Congratulations.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.200
Well done.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.520
Thank you.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.000
AUDIENCE: Should I take it off?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.041
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Mm-hmm.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.870
There are three ways
of enjoying KenKen,

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:25.630
to solve, to make, and
to serve to somebody.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:29.610
The most important thing
is to continue thinking,

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.980
long and deep.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:37.150
The toughest rival is not
the person next to you,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.340
it's yourself yesterday.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.620
Sometimes people ask for
my autograph in my book.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:53.540
I always write this, "Renew
your best record day by day."

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.035
I believe math is a puzzle.

00:36:57.035 --> 00:37:00.230
A puzzle is fun.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:04.450
Then, math is fun.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:09.490
It's the best entertainment
to progress yourself.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.860
Let's learn and study.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:16.510
Let's enjoy trial and
error with your own brain

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.490
for your happy life.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:20.360
Good luck.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.630
Thank you for listening.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.004
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.660
AUDIENCE: What does
the name "KenKen" mean?

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.215
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
"Ken" means wisdom.

00:37:37.215 --> 00:37:39.950
"KenKen" is wisdom squared.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:52.210
This kanji called Ken, it is
used as a boy's name-- Kenta,

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.720
Kenji, Kenjiro-- wisdom.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.600
And here is a small 2.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.180
It's squared.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.850
SPEAKER: Is there anybody else?

00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:11.620
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.289
Are your classes
available to the public?

00:38:15.289 --> 00:38:16.330
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Public?

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.538
SPEAKER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.350
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
Yes, of course.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:26.530
I have class only on Saturday,
third grade to fifth grade.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.530
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:28.030
Thank you.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.196
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Thank you.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.120
AUDIENCE: Do you teach-- like,
how do you teach the student

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.340
to do the KenKen?

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.830
According to the examples
you showed during your talk,

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:46.050
it's all like, you can
use logic to just solve

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.820
the problem once without trial.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.400
So is there a lot
of-- instruction book

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.080
you give kids to solve
your KenKen puzzle,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.074
or it's like, just
explore yourself?

00:38:57.074 --> 00:38:58.282
SPEAKER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:38:58.282 --> 00:38:59.615
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Ah, of course.

00:38:59.615 --> 00:39:04.460
In the first lesson, I tell
them the rule, every row,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.700
every column has 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.115
Do not repeat the same
number on the same line.

00:39:09.115 --> 00:39:09.720
That's all.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.140
Do it.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.100
Do it or go home, as you like.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.052
Up to you.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.765
Learning English and learning
mathematics are very different.

00:39:22.765 --> 00:39:27.630
And for the beginner, like
me, the English beginner

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.310
has to memorize so many things.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:36.031
But mathematics, addition,
subtraction, multiplication,

00:39:36.031 --> 00:39:38.020
division, that's all.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.080
After that, it's a
problem of combination.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.929
It's not my business, yours.

00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:45.470
That's right.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.710
AUDIENCE: Did you teach
your class just doing that

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.890
for a whole year?

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.610
I mean, there must
have been more.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:02.090
Did each day, they come
and just get puzzles?

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.810
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Ah, puzzles
are only for third grade.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:11.120
Fourth grade and fifth grade
learn mathematics problems.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.940
And now, I run a math
class at the corner

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:21.930
of 39th Street and 6th Avenue.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.310
It's only on Saturday,
so everybody is welcome.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.440
SPEAKER: So this is
the end of his speech.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.020
And thank you so much
for participating today.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.710
And if you have
any more questions,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.170
please feel free to
ask him a question.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.100
So thank you so much
for participating.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.637
Thank you.

00:40:44.637 --> 00:40:46.220
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
Thank you very much.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.570
