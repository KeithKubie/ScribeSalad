&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: Boy,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.460
we've had a wonderful
turnout here today.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.040
So, just want to
introduce Ron Charles.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.910
He's book critic at
The Washington Post,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.600
but I have a personal
observation

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.550
that there is no better friend

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.470
of the National Book
Festival outside

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.320
of the Library of
Congress than Ron.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.020
I mean, he's-- we've been
together, how many years, Ron?

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.680
And he is just-- he's a
cheerleader for us in addition

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320
to all his great observations

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.930
about the writers
and everything.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.030
So we're always glad
to see you in fiction.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you
very much, [inaudible].

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.180
&gt;&gt; All right, and just stay
seated, go ahead and start.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.480
OK.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.080
&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: All right.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.380
Thank you.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I
did not expect that.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.980
Thank you very much.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.280
It's very kind of you.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.580
First, a word of thanks to our
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.880
David Rubenstein, and the other
generous sponsors who've made

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.180
this event possible.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.480
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.780
there's a note in your program.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.080
We'll have time after this
conversation for your questions

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.860
and I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.720
through the microphone, you will
be included in the videotape

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.190
of this event and become a part

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.060
of the permanent
collection of the library.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.320
So you're in like a witness
relocation program or something.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.320
Just stay in your seat OK.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.040
My guest today is Jennifer Egan.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.190
She's the author of several
books including "Look at Me"

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.310
and "A Visit from the
Goon Squad", and--

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.030
which is a widely
inventive novel

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.940
which won the 2011
Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.740
Also a journalist--

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.790
[ Applause ]

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.320
-- also a journalist,
she's written frequently

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.930
for The New York Times
Magazine and her new novel,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.750
"Manhattan Beach", was
published last fall.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810
Let's start with that moment.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.980
After the success of "A
Visit from the Goon Squad",

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.250
Pulitzer Prize, rave reviews,
how do you summon the courage

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090
to write something else?

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well, I
wish we're only a moment

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.310
when I have to contemplate that.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.680
It was many moments
drawn together.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.690
I think initially, I
didn't feel too intimated

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.090
because I thought
reasonably, look,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.680
I didn't promise everyone
would love everything I do.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.840
I just got lucky that time
and now I'm proceeding.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.660
And for about a year of
working in the first draft

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.630
that I felt excited by what I
was doing and good about it.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.490
But then I began to feel how
hard it was going to be to make

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.920
"Manhattan Beach"
work and I began

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.450
to really recognize how far
outside my comfort zone I had

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.620
moved with that book.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.770
Not really because it's
not structurally wacky

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.070
like "Goon Squad" is.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: But more

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.970
because since I don't
really write about myself

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.860
or people I know ever,
the real points of contact

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.620
between my life and my work
are always times and places

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.070
that I remember, and
I hadn't realized

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.590
that those are actually kind
of essential to what I'm doing.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.900
But in "Manhattan Beach", I
moved outside of my lifetime

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.640
and I found that I had really
no times in places to pull

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.800
from in my memory at all.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.450
And, I felt really
unqualified to do that.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.410
And I thought it was
going to be a disaster.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.760
And at that point,
I freaked out.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.010
I really thought, wow,
I can't believe it.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.540
I can't believe I'm writing
a disastrous book, you know,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.140
after having this other
one turn out so well.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.440
What should I do?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.530
I thought about abandoning it.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.790
And I really was pretty
serious about that.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.880
I thought, OK, you have
permission to leave

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.020
that book aside but then
the question was, OK,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.740
so what do I want to do?

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.700
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And the
answer was I wanted to do this.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.860
I wanted to stick with
"Manhattan Beach", that was sort

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.760
of where my mind was going.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.060
So I hang in there.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And this is
the first historical novel

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.660
you'd written?

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.960
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yes.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.450
Well, the first one takes place
outside of my lifetime, yes.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, 50 years.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.050
This is your parents' lifetime?

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.350
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Why 50 years?

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.210
Why didn't you write for the
12th century, the 17th century?

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
Well, don't tempt me.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.690
I think really it was
specifically New York during

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.150
World War II that interested me.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.100
So even though it was not a time
and a place from my own memory,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.490
it was a time and a
place specifically

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.450
that drew me into this material.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.850
I wanted to know what New
York was like during the war,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.280
what it felt like to be there

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.310
and also just in
America generally.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.600
I had kind of-- I had
notions about the way

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.900
that the country
pulled together.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.170
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: The way
that women were invited

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.210
to do things they've been
told they couldn't do.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.040
You know, various sort of almost
cliched ideas, but I wanted

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.920
to really know what
it felt like.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.820
And that may have started with
9/11 and having been living

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.250
in New York when that happened
and experienced the sort

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.380
of transformation of my
landscape into a kind

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.320
of war zone overnight.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.170
That may have been
it, I don't know.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And how did
you go about that research?

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.910
I mean, some of the
people were still alive.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.210
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well, they--

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.380
when I first started having
these inclinations toward New

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.230
York during World War II,
it was actually about 2005.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.800
So I had-- I was working on
"The Keep", I wasn't even--

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.510
I hadn't even started "A Visit
from the Goon Squad" yet.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.630
And in a way, that
timing was really lucky

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.390
because I got involved in
interviewing a lot of people

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.440
in those years between 2005 and
2010 who were in their 80s then.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.460
So, I collaborated an
oral history project

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.020
with the Brooklyn Navy Yard and
the Brooklyn Historical Society.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.630
And our goal was to interview
everyone we could find

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.120
who had worked at the navy yard.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.100
And I was especially
interested in women

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.030
who had worked there during
the war and I was lucky enough

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.820
to be present for-and to help
interview about 20 ladies.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Who had this
experience or something like it?

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.830
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yes, who did
all kinds of things at the yard,

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.720
ranging from office work to
actual welding and riveting.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.830
These were amazing
stories to hear.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm sure.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.870
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And they've
impacted the story that I ended

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.310
up writing fairly directly not

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.080
in that I used anyone
that I had met.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.680
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Because,
again, that's something I--

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.980
not only don't do,
but I sort of can't.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.540
I'm really bad at that.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.540
But the little details that they
gave me and coupled with a lot

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.880
of reading that I did over the
same period, in a certain way,

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.940
it was almost like I amassed a
sort of alternate memory bank--

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.540
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- to
give me something to draw

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.250
from since I didn't
have my own memories.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.090
Can you tell us about a
moment of particular discovery

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.220
that was surprising
or delightful?

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.120
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well,
I'm always drawn to this--

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.180
I don't know exactly-- this is--
it wasn't really a discovery

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.510
about the period but I want to
mention a woman whose collection

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.700
of letters was very,
very important to me,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.420
her name was Lucille
Kolkin and she

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.360
and her husband, Al Kolkin, met.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.020
They both worked
at the Navy Yard.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.820
He was a machinist and
she was a ship fitter.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.050
And they had a kind
of Navy Yard romance

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.760
and they married precipitously.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.650
And in one of her
letters, she referred to it

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.760
as from maidenhood to
marriage in three easy months.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.220
So, that she was
crazy in love with Al

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.510
and he then joined the navy
and went to booth camp.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.040
And so she wrote him these
wonderful letters every day

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.120
that were fantastic
from my point of view

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.680
because she wrote a lot about
her specific work at the yard

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.290
since he knew what
she was talking about.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.870
And she also, you know,
just flirted with him

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.420
and told him all kinds
of little anecdotes.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.140
She was very interested
in unionization.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.610
She talked about race.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.980
She really talked about all the
things you hope someone will

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.280
talk about--

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, it's a
historian's dream, isn't it?

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- from
that particular time, exactly.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.540
And then there was one letter
when she fantasized about--

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.230
and she had had a dream
that they had had a son

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.550
and that Al was changing the
baby's diaper and she said, oh,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.600
butch, that's what
she call them,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.160
what will our lives be like?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.940
You know, where will we live?

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.900
What-- How many children
will we have?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.960
And I thought, yeah, I wondered
what will happen to Lucy.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.450
And then I thought, wait
a minute, that was 1944,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.460
there are answers
to these questions.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.070
So I, of course, did what we
all do when we have a question,

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.160
I walked directly to the
nearest computer terminal

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.190
and I Googled her and within 30
seconds of reading this dream

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.800
in her handwriting, I
was reading her obituary.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh my gosh.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.230
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And
it was so shocking.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.750
It was-- It felt like a mind
should not be able to do both

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.420
of those things in
that amount of time.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Were you close
or had she died long before?

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.870
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: No, she had
just died a few years before.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh my gosh.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.470
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And she had
actually lived down the street

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.880
from where I had lived at
the time that she died.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.620
She had had two daughters
and it was over.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.640
And, I returned to
the letters and I felt

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.340
so strange reading
them at first.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.910
I felt like I knew more than
I should be allowed to know.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.740
And she was kind of prattling
about getting a sunburn

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.510
at Coney Island and putting
bicarbonate of soda on it.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.540
I was thinking I know something
terrible that you don't know,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.200
your life is going to end.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.670
So it was very strange but,
ultimately, I kind of forgot

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.180
about it and got back
into her wonderful voice.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.580
And then she went and joined
Al and so the letters ended.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.990
She was-- They were together.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.960
And I found that I
really missed her.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.800
I felt like I had lost a pal
that I was used to hanging

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.520
out with a couple
of times a week

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.560
at the Brooklyn Historical
Society.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.700
So I wrote an essay
called "Reading Lucy",

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.860
which was about the
uncanny power of letters

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.500
to make someone feel alive.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.900
And I published in a
little collection of book--

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.830
of essays about Brooklyn
by various writers.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.020
And about three months later
on my public email address,

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.110
I got an email and
the subject line was,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.240
I am Lucille's daughter.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.610
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Incredible.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.320
So, she had two daughters as
I had learned in the obituary.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.650
Judy and Marj and all of-- they
and their families and I and Al

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.460
who was then in his
80s all took a tour

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.910
of the Navy Yard together.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's great.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.510
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I mean,
you can't make this stuff up.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.280
I mean, these were the kinds
of adventures I was having.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.470
This was all before "Goon
Squad" even came out.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.220
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: So-- And I'm
in touch with them to this day.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's so sweet.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.950
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I accompanied
Al with his walker back

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.420
into the machine shop
which was now empty,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.280
but there were still
a lot of the war left

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.550
at the Navy Yard back in 2008
and I could hardly look at Al.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.270
I knew way too much
about Al [laughter].

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.030
And I mean, these lines
from her letters would float

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.810
through my head like, just
a few more little kisses

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.820
and an incy wincy
pinch on the ass end.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.120
I'm like--

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
so romantic.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- yeah.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.810
Well, they were working
at a ship yard.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.000
And so, anyway, Al actually
only passed away two years ago

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.830
in '98, and we ended
up interviewing him

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.400
for the oral history project.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.130
It was really-- it
enriched my life in such a--

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Great.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.730
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: --
deep way, this research.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's amazing.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.330
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: It
stopped feeling like research

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.630
and it just felt like living.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Friends,
that's great.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.700
It seemed to me that if
you go back 300 years,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.000
you could get all
kinds of stuff wrong

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.660
and hardly anybody would know.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.310
I mean, some scholars
would know.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.720
But if you go back 50, 60 years,
there are a lot of readers

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.270
out there who will
know and all of the--

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.660
it seems to me there
are infinite number

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.980
of things to get wrong.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I'm
finding that [laughter].

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So
how do you check?

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.340
How do you do that sort
of historical checking?

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: You know,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.940
readers are kind
enough to share--

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh--

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.540
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: --
their discoveries.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: --
that's too late.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.140
That's too late.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.440
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: No, it isn't.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.740
Not if you keep going
into more printings.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.040
No, I've fixed a lot.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.340
It's interesting-- there's a
lot of technology in the book

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.340
because there is so much
about people at work.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.640
So there is--

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- people
who work at the Navy Yard.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.540
They're deep sea divers.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.390
There's a lot of mob activity.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.770
And there's-- you know,
there's a lot of ship building.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.210
So interestingly, in those
areas where I had to know a lot,

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.300
I tended to get things right
because I had worked so hard

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.600
to understand the technology--

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Research thing.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.200
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- correctly.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It was the
casual references that--

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.800
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And I
had people to help me.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.100
So I had an expert usually
in each of those fields,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.360
but it was other things that I
didn't know and it's amazing,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.070
people catch everything.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.050
You know, it turns out the
Second Avenue elevated trucks

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.510
were dismantled the year before
I had them casting a shadow

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.160
on my characters [laughter].

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.590
So there are a lot-- there
were a lot of things like that.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.370
Oh, and actually, there was
kind of a big one which is

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.910
that I have a deacon in the
novel who does various things.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.720
And it turns out that there
was no really official deacon

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.490
in the Catholic Church
at that time,

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.310
so that definitely
had to be fixed.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:26.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: There are
still some outstanding errors

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.050
that I've just heard about
that I have to still fix,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.380
apparently there were
no funerals on Sunday

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.610
in the Catholic Church and I
have my funeral on a Sunday.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.910
So--

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: My gosh.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.510
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- yeah.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.810
So it's ongoing, I kind
of love having the chance

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.110
to correct these things--

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.710
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- overtime.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And paperback
reprints and things like that.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.310
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Or the e-book.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Just every
time I keep putting them in

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.210
and if there's ever a
chance they run them

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.510
through with the next iteration.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice, nice.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.110
I was talking to Deborah
Harkness, a historical novelist,

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.410
and she was talking about
how hard it is to leave stuff

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.990
out because you find out so much
and it's so interesting to you.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.260
How do you keep the
book from reading

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.650
like a big research project?

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.530
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well,
I hope I achieved that.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.900
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I think--
I mean, it's interesting,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.210
I always thought
the reason put--

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.120
people put too much in was
that they were showing off.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I
think the real danger is

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.850
that I found I was so in love--

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.450
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- with
those technical details

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.950
that I was a bad judge of how
much other people might love

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.250
to know about some
of these things.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.600
I think for me, what really
helped was just multiple

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.920
readers, layers of readers
who said to me, you know,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.510
I'm going to sleep here
in chapter whatever.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.260
So, no, that is really,
really a danger.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.320
The other thing is
that it's, you know,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.410
action and people are the
only things we're ever really

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.710
reading for.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.500
You know, no one
is reading to learn

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.020
about how people
adjusted their air supply

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.870
in a Mark V diving suit.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.170
You can--

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.770
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
-- there are lots

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.070
of sources for that information.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.940
So, I guess one standard I tried
to set with myself is just do,

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.600
is this-- I mean, is
this part of action,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.460
is this actually necessary, is
something really happening here.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.950
And if you revise enough,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.440
a lot of that extraneous
stuff falls away.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just falls away.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.570
Now, this-- Anna Kerrigan is
your wonderful protagonist here.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.250
She doesn't call
herself a feminist,

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.380
probably doesn't even think
of herself as a feminist.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.680
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
I'm not sure that--

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.980
I don't even know
if that word was--

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.280
I had never encountered in my--

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Exactly.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: --
research from that time.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
she clearly is, right?

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I mean, she
believes that she should be able

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.410
to do what a man can do and --

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- as
far as I'm concerned,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.310
anyone who believes
that is a feminist.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Because that's
what the word means, really.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.330
And this tells about
this job I'd never heard

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.840
of that she takes on
and how dangerous it is.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.320
How did you discover that?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well, Anna--
so there are three protagonists

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.620
in the book and Anna is a
19-year-old, I want to say girl,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.510
but really she's an
adult and at that time,

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.460
I think a 19-year-old was
something closer to an adult.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.830
She begins doing industrial work

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.550
at the Navy Yard as
so many women did.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.420
Although her work is
actually sort of dull,

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.470
she's measuring small parts.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.230
She sees someone in
a Mark V diving suit,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.910
which is the iconic sort of
suit that we would all picture,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.050
I think, although that's
not really current anymore.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.590
And she becomes fixated
on the idea of diving.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.580
In a way, it happened very
similarly for me what--

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.700
the fixation I'm wanting
to write about diving.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.170
I was researching the
Brooklyn Navy Yard

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.490
and I found a little
reminiscence in a naval journal

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.650
by a guy who had been a
civilian diver at the yard.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.910
And he talked about how the--

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.280
you know, the air supply
was manually produced,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.860
so think about that, you know,
you're 30 feet underwater

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.260
and two guys going like this,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.830
are all that is providing
oxygen to you.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you're in
like what we would think of more

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.830
of the space suit, right?

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.150
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: It looks very
much like a space suit, yeah.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.570
It's the spherical
hat as they call it,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.870
the very heavy rubberized
canvas,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.610
the lead boots, it
weighs 200 pounds.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.900
First-- Looking at a
photograph of this gentleman

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.770
in that outfit, I felt a kind
of thrill that I have learned

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.550
to watch very closely, because
it means not that I'm going

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.340
to dive, which I
have never done and--

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You've
never been scuba diving.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.940
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
-- afraid to do.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.580
No, but that this is sort of a
portal into something fictional.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.650
And it just-- it-- my
fascination with it only grew

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.000
as I fell in with a bunch
of army diving veterans.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.070
Early on, again, this is
before " Goon Squad" came out,

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.360
I went to a reunion in Virginia

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.060
of this army diving
veterans organization.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.930
They meet every other
year, they're wonderful.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.150
Most of them are Vietnam vets.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.690
There were a couple
from the Korean War

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.730
and there was actually one
diver there from World War II.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.950
He dove in Cherbourg and the
Harbour, helping to clear

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.240
out debris that the
Germans exploded there,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.460
a guy named Jim Kennedy.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.320
Anyway, I attended this
and interviewed a lot

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.400
of these people which was really
fun and one of the attractions

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.550
of this reunion is
that anyone who wants

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.680
to can wear the old
equipment and dive in a tank.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.400
And most of even-- oddly,
this Mark V was current

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.980
into the Vietnam War

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.950
so it actually had a
very long period of--

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This 200-pound--

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.980
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- thing?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.580
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yes.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.880
And many, and even people--

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.180
so another person who helped me
a lot was the first female army

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.040
diver, a woman named
Andrea Motley Crabtree,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.290
who was a marvelous human being.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.990
And she even wore and
trained the Mark V

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.670
and she didn't dive
until the '80s.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.080
So it's still used
in various ways.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.820
Anyway, I was dressed
in it, my sources,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.880
my two wonderful diving sources

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.460
who both dove during the Vietnam
War dressed me in the Mark V,

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.890
needless to say, I did not
dive, because that would be--

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.950
had been surely the end of me.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.210
But, I watched people
dive in the tank

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.210
in that old equipment
which was amazing.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Gosh.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.810
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Anyway, I--

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.110
it became a tremendously
important part of the book

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:15.720
and also a real source of sort
of mystery and excitement for me

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.020
in the writing process.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's very
exciting in the book too.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.560
I mean, when you realize how
dangerous it is, it's dark.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.860
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Explain
to me a little bit more

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.460
about what they're-- what
are they doing down there?

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.250
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
Well, civilian divers

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.470
at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard were both patching

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.410
and repairing ships
from underneath

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.970
because there were
only six dry docks even

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.650
in that huge ship yard, so a lot
of things could be done while

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.400
in the water, it was a big deal

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.920
to bring a ship into
the dry dock.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.760
A lot of times also, what they
were doing was just examining

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.320
the ships to see what
exactly was wrong.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.740
They also did a lot of salvage
works that they brought things

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.190
up from the bottom of the
bay, of Wallabout Bay,

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.890
which is where the Navy Yard--
the Brooklyn Navy Yard is right

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.180
on the east river in New York.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.680
And so they did a lot of
that, they did various things.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.410
Basically, they're
underwater engineers.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.330
And another thing that
civilian divers did that's kind

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.620
of amazing in New York
was that the SS Normandie,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.380
which was a French ocean liner
that we seized when France fell

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.760
to the Nazis, was docked
alongside Manhattan

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.400
on the Hudson River
and it caught fire.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.940
And so the firefighters
poured water

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.080
in it-- into it and it sank.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.220
So it was a bit of
a screw up really

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.650
on the firefighters' part and--

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.410
which was following a screw
up on the part of the people

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.720
who were trying to convert
it into a troop ship.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.250
Anyway, there were--
sabotage was suspected

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.560
but it wasn't that, it
was just human error.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.540
Anyway, here is this huge
ocean liner lying at the bottom

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.950
of the Hudson River

00:19:54.950 --> 00:20:00.300
and a civilian diving program
was initiated to raise the ship,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.570
which consists of making
it airtight, first of all,

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.730
then pumping out all the
water, it floats to the top.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.090
They then brought it to the
Brooklyn Navy Yard to turn it

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.420
into a troop ship at
which point they learned

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.170
that it was too damaged for
them to actually do that.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.280
But, basically, New York was
crawling with civilian divers.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.940
And it was a very
little documented program

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.330
which worked very
well for my purposes,

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.810
because while no women dove
for the navy until the '70s

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.640
and the army until the
'80s, no one really knows

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.530
who these civilian divers
were, so that gave me my window

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.340
of opportunity to get Anna,
one of my protagonists,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.840
underwater in a diving suit.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.880
Now, there is this whole
gangster plot running

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.230
through the novel, too.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.530
That must have been fun.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.000
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: It
was amazingly fun.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You've got
this kind of noir tone,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.180
you've got cliffhanger endings,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.140
well-dressed killers say things
like, one more word like that

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.750
and I'll toss you off the
pier myself and you'll tell it

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.470
to the fishes [laughter].

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.400
What was that like to sort
of mimic and even sometimes,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.770
I think, parody those old
gangster films or stories?

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.360
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: It
was incredibly fun.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.100
I mean, crime is just
an inherently rich realm

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.870
for the fiction writer,
you know,

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.440
the stakes are immediately high.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.450
There is the sense of danger.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.560
And so that automatically
is of interest.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.380
My grandfather was a cop in
Chicago on the south side

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.040
and ultimately became
a commander.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: So I
would listen to his stories

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.070
when I was a little girl.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.740
And so I think that kind of
adds to my love of that stuff.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
that was in the '30s?

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.580
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So this
was some great times--

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.370
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- in Chicago.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.970
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
Oh yes [laughter].

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.930
Yes, there's a famous
anecdote my uncle tells,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.950
where my grandfather
was with his Fedora.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.360
He was a very sharp
dresser and, in fact,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.010
he was one of Truman's
bodyguards whenever he would

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.310
come to Chicago.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.360
There are great pictures of
Truman and my grandfather

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.030
and my grandfather's partner
all in their Fedoras, amazing.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's great.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.630
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: But
my grandfather was sort

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.930
of watching people walk

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.960
by on the street
looking kind of dower.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.310
And my uncle said, "What
are you doing, dad?"

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.640
And he said, "Trying to
separate the good guys

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.550
from the bad guys [laughter]."

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.010
So I guess I grew up
hearing stuff like that.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.390
But in fact, the real reason
that I ended up writing so much

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.480
about gangsters in
this book was suggested

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.690
by the research I was doing
before I had a plot or anything

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.340
like it back in 2005 to 2010.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.680
Because one thing I found in
not just the conversations

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.230
with people who worked
at the Navy Yard,

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.770
but also just elderly New
Yorkers with good memories.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.170
I interviewed anyone I
could find who can talk

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.300
about New York, you know,
in the '30s and '40s.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.830
A lot of people seem
to encounter gangsters

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.850
in the course of
their normal lives.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.370
To a degree, that seems
very odd to us now.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.970
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I
think, certainly to me.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
becoming more normal now.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
Yes, [laughter].

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.210
You might say so.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:07.540
But-- So, for example, there
was a guy that I interviewed

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.750
who was part of a very wealthy
Jewish manufacturing family

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.110
and they lived in a
fancy apartment building

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.080
that had a name on Central Park.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.710
And Frank Costello, a known--
a very famous crime boss lived

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.720
in the apartment building also.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.200
So, my source was
mentioning, well, we got--

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.300
there was a movie star,
there were these bankers,

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.720
there was Frank Costello,
he was a gangster.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.870
And I was picturing, you know,
a co-op board in New York now,

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.380
you know, contemplating someone
whose job title basically

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.260
was gangster.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.090
I don't think that that person
would end up in the building.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.550
So-- But this would
come up again and again.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.110
You know, people
who were musicians,

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.770
we talk about playing
at gangster clubs.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.370
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
There were many--

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.080
there was a lot of
talk of gangsters.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.450
And, as I did more research,
I learned that, of course,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.460
that had to do with
prohibition and the fact

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.850
that the organized
crime got organized

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.380
to run the liquor
business for a country

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.180
that still wanted to drink.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.710
And therefore, it became--
they became sort of folded--

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.960
so-called gangsters became
folded into mainstream life

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.190
in a way that seems
very odd to us now.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.340
And that really held on even
after prohibition, of course,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.680
that ended in '33, it was
still true in the '40s.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is amazing.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.940
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
So, it seemed to come

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.880
about really more that way.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.030
But I had a ball writing about--

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I have that.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.630
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: --
Dexter Styles, my--

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:34.930
well, actually, in a way,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.340
the two male protagonists
are Dexter Styles

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.500
who was clearly a gangster and
a sort of night club impresario.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.830
And then Eddie Kerrigan, who's
Anna's father, who comes--

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.200
who's a part of a sort of
different criminal realm

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.020
which is the Irish Waterfront
which was a very corrupt area.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.240
And that corruption was
immortalized in the movie

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.420
"On the Waterfront", which
is derived from a series

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.620
of newspaper exposes of the
corrupt Irish Waterfront.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.930
The ethnicity was kind
of removed for the film,

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:10.680
but it really was this
very sort of clannishly,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.910
Irish and Irish-American bunch
of very corrupt union bosses

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.440
who did not look out for the
interest of their membership.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.380
And were incredibly very
capricious about who worked

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.540
and who didn't, and usually the
ones who worked were the ones

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.300
who were giving them kickbacks.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.490
So Eddie Kerrigan, Anna's
father, is part of that world

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.200
which was-- and then
Dexter Styles is more part

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.760
of what was known
as the syndicate

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.250
which had a more
Italian feeling,

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.520
although in no way
were they all Italian.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.630
And in fact, you
hear funny things

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.950
about Irish man calling
themselves, you know,

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.720
Genosa and Italian guys
calling themselves O'Brian.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.060
Everyone trying to
fit in with the group

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.360
that they are, you know--

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.960
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- it's the
American reinvention was--

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.270
it was going on all
the time there.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could you
read a passage from that--

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.190
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Sure.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: --
part of the novel?

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:06.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: So
this is just a little bit

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:12.740
about how Dexter ended
up becoming a gangster.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.210
For Dexter Styles, the existence

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.380
of an obscure truth recessed
behind an obvious one,

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.090
and emanating through it
allegorically, was mesmerizing.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.310
It was what had first intrigued
him, at age 15, about two men

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.780
who came every third
Monday to see his father

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.170
and at his Coney
Island restaurant.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.750
Another man came less often,
always in brand-new spats,

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.490
a red handkerchief gushing
from his breast pocket.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.780
Dexter's father always
went behind the bar

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.310
to pour this man's brandy rather
than have the barkeep do it.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.000
The blank face his pop wore

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.120
after these visitations
betrayed humiliation and anger,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.000
and Dexter knew better than
to ask what they meant.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.350
But he was drawn to
the man, a smoldering

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.930
of dim feeling behind their
eyes, a heaviness to their hands

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.010
when they gave him
a pat or a swat.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.230
He curried their favor,
refilling their glasses,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.760
lingering at their tables when
his father wasn't watching.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.960
They took notice
of him gradually

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.060
with a mute animal awareness.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.920
Later, when men who'd fought
the Great War returned,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.190
Dexter recognized, in
their fractured gazes

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.180
and somnolent movements,

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.920
something of what he'd first
admired in Mr. Q.'s men.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.790
By then, he knew what it
meant, intimacy with violence.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's nice.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.890
Very nice.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:50.610
[ Applause ]

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.540
I had no idea, the novel --

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.920
that you've worked in the
novel for so long that it--

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.220
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well--

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: --
predated other novels.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.000
I have yours that I'd read.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.210
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- well,
definitely, the research did.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.810
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I didn't
really start writing this

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.110
until 2012.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: OK.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.000
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: But that
period from 2009 to 2010,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.080
when I was interviewing a
lot of people in their 80s

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.200
and those are interviews,
obviously, you can't postpone.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.130
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: In fact, Jim
Kennedy, the World War II diver

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.660
that I interviewed at
the-- at that reunion,

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.590
had wonderful stories to tell
about his time in Cherbourg.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.430
And I asked him if he had
ever met of female diver.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.730
And he said, he had met--

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.740
he had dived in Cherbourg
with a female Russian woman.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.300
I mean, obviously,
a female Russian.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.720
And of course, the Russian
woman did everything.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.750
And I felt like there
might be more to the story

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.150
than what he was saying
to this large group

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.840
of people who are-- of men--

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.440
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- and
then me all listening to him.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.390
So, we had a plan to
speak again on the phone

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.960
and I thought maybe
I would learn more

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.350
about the Russian lady.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.790
But Jim Kennedy, in perfect
health in our conversation,

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.890
passed away very suddenly
and we've never able

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.410
to have that conversation.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.230
So, there was a certain
urgency but, yes, I was working

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.150
in "The Keep" and
then on "Goon Squad".

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.140
And I would go so far as to say
that my preoccupation with time

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.400
in "Goon Squad" to some
degree came from this research

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.980
and talking to so many people
toward the ends of their lives.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.580
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: But
also that experience

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.010
of reading Lucille Kolkin's
letters knowing the end

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.310
of her story--

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:26.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- I think,
became a kind of technique

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.210
that I brought to "Goon Squad".

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.970
I wondered how-- if I could
write a whole narrative

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.120
in which we more often than
not know the end before we know

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.420
the beginning.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I
think it really came

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.320
from that moment in part.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Fascinating.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.390
When you work on a book or
an issue or a story so long,

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.580
how do you know when it's done?

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.160
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well, in
a certain way, it isn't.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.300
I mean, I'm still correcting
mistakes and I can promise you,

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.150
if I sat down and read this
book, I would edit heavily.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.450
I know I would.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.320
That's why I'm very
careful not to do that.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So when does
your editor finally just rested

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.520
away from you?

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.030
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I mean,
you know, there are various--

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.310
and I'm sure just like with
writing for a newspaper, it's--

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No,
the deadline comes

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.910
and you're done, that's it.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.210
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well,

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.510
that's kind of the
same thing in a way--

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really?

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.110
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- in
that, ultimately, if you've--

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.410
if you're going to
publish at a certain time--

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- you have
sets of page proofs but finally,

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.750
you have to-- they
have to take them away.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Stop.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.140
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: But in a way,

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.670
those are about little
refinements.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.270
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I
mean, as I was working

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.530
in the first draft during the
kind of bad year and a half

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.060
where I felt really pessimistic.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.440
One of the things that was
troubling me was that I felt

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.980
like I couldn't seem to-- I kept
writing and writing but instead

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.610
of feeling the sort
of compression

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:44.910
that I'm hoping for was--

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.510
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- fiction

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.810
which really is an
active compression--

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.410
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: --

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.340
at its base, I kept feeling like
things just kept getting bigger.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.470
And that was really a worry.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.290
But it turned out, and part
of that is just the crazy way

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:04.540
that I write first draft by hand
and very blindly, I was just--

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.460
I needed to sort of
cast out a very wide net

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.170
to find the elements that
I needed for my story.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.980
And then, once I knew where
it was going to end and sort

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.690
of what the end would be

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.260
by the time I began
the big second draft.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.600
But in terms of, you know,

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.950
knowing that every sentence is
right, I got us close to that

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.860
as I could that particular
time, but I'm sure

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.030
if I read it now, I
would make changes.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow, wow.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.060
Who do you read for inspiration?

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.360
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Oh, gosh.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.450
Well, I mean, every book has
its-- has sort of, I find,

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:42.460
a kind of constellation of
books that it's part of.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.440
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And so
for this book, that was kind

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.480
of free-ranging base, in a way,
I combined two genres here.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.880
One is the noir, as
you've pointed out.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.300
So, that, obviously, exists
in film but also in a lot

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.670
of cheesy detective fiction--

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:57.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.270
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- and some
really good detective fiction.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:00.570
I mean--

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
a lot of fun ones.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.170
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah,
Raymond Chandler, I think,

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.470
was really important for me.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.690
Partly because his protagonist,
Philip Marlowe, is so--

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.210
I feel like he just captures
the kind of bleakness and sense

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.660
of existential threat in the
noir that's so compelling.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.260
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And then the
other genre that I'm working

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.630
with is really the sea story.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.000
And I thought, can
I really do that?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.850
Can I actually fuse these two?

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.150
But what I realized is

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.040
that actually they
have so much in common.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.390
They're almost identical.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.730
It's just that one is
in the natural world

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.840
and one is in urban world.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.190
Their realms were a sense

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.850
of existential threat
existed all times.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.260
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And where a
pocket of humanity is surrounded

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.580
by a kind of darkness which
in a sea story-- and a threat.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.240
In a sea story, it's
obviously the sea.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.350
And in the noir,
it's urban life.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:33:00.880
It's the solitude and
the kind of vague menace

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.950
that we associate or that
that genre associates

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:05.880
with an urban landscape.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: So, I read
a lot in both of these genres.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.890
I revisited "Moby-Dick"
which I absolutely--

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
really good, isn't it?

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.490
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: It is amazing.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I know, I wish
people would read it again.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And the
whale parts are great.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
it's really exciting.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.430
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I mean, I
never thought I would love

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.520
to hear about whale
blubber at that length.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.040
But I did, it was
amazing, amazing.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And then--

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.620
But also like I read a
lot of Patrick O'Brian.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.920
Those are fantastic.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
those are fun.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.520
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
They're like catnip.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Very fun.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.120
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: So lots

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.420
of great sea stories
and also great noir.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.530
And a lot of cheesy
detective fiction

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.060
that you really couldn't
publish now, it's--

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Sexist.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.260
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- sexist,
it's racist, it's impossible.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.750
But, for sort of
lingo and elements

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.620
of daily life, very useful.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right,
the tone that you--

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.760
that you've get of with
off in the book, yeah.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.060
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Yeah.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Very
nice of them.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.660
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
And I also read a lot

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.960
of non-fiction, of course.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.560
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I
mean, and one genre

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.860
of that are just
sea survival stories

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.330
of which there are many, many.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.020
I mean, so many ships were
torpedoed during World War II.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.390
And there were people
who were torpedoed more

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:15.050
than once in a day.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.350
And, you know, if they wrote--

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.650
if they lived to
tell their story,

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.170
they did better than
a lot of people.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.280
But these are amazing
stories of incredible heroism

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.630
and just bravery, and
strength and leadership.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.830
And then also stories of
absolute disarray and kind

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:38.360
of the way madness can come so
quickly to-- if you don't feel,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.330
you know, the sea
in its enormity--

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.930
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
-- can really play

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:45.870
in a bad way with,
you know, the mind.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Insanity, yes.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.830
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And so there
are a lot of those stories, too.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.240
So, all of that.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.390
I think, you know,
at a certain point

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:55.280
when I realize I wasn't
going to be doing a lot

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.270
of structural innovation here
which I tried for early on

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.070
and discovered was dead on
arrival, I thought, you know,

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.580
this is really a story where the
extremes are not going to happen

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.500
in the structure
but in the action.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.470
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And so, it
was really fun to write about,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:17.080
you know, a shipwreck, survival
at sea, murders and, you know,

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.150
in a way, when I realize that
that was the world of this book,

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.450
I thought, it's not surprising

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.840
that I'm not using
fragmentation and irony.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.440
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I mean,
what place does that have

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.740
in a shipwreck, really?

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, right.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.590
So the whole PowerPoint
shipwreck got taken out.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: [Laughter]
Well, at the beginning,

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.230
I thought I would have a sort of
ironic narrator kind of winking

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.850
at the reader about the fact

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.630
that we all know this
is a long time ago.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.500
I mean, I have a writing group
that luckily exists to kind

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.860
of slap me out of
certain bad ideas.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.070
And the first time I
brought in something

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.370
that had that, they
were like, oh.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.800
But it really takes
us out of it.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: And the
second time, they said, "Yeah,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.940
still really not enjoying this."

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.410
And then the third time,
they said, "You know,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:05.170
I find that it makes me really
angry when you do that."

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They did?

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:07.770
[Laughter] Just tell
the damn story.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: This is really
not what I want my readers

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.700
to be feeling.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.410
So I think I'm going to
have to move away from that.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:13.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Exactly.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.010
Let's hear from some
of your readers.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:16.910
Would you take some questions?

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.000
There are two mics,
one here and one here.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.990
Please just come up to the mic
and Jennifer will point to you.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.540
&gt;&gt; Hi, my favorite work of
yours is "Black Box" actually,

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.910
and I just wondered if you'd
ever thought about making

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.270
that into a book,
expanding that.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.440
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
So "Black Box" is--

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.740
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- is a
novella that I wrote in tweets

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.470
about a female spa--

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.160
it's actually a character from
"Goon Squad", a minor character

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.880
who is functioning
as a civilian spy.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:55.230
I hope that will be part of my
next book which I, you know,

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.790
may or may not work out.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.800
But if it does, it will
be a sort of a companion

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.050
to "Goon Squad" using
various peripheral characters

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.270
and hopefully creating
out of that something

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:09.790
that is not just a
tepid echo but something

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.720
of interest unto itself.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.020
So we'll see.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.510
&gt;&gt; That's fantastic, it's
compelling read even aside

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:18.300
from the reading it as,
you know, 140 characters--

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.600
character, I just loved it.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.900
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
Thank you so much.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.080
Well, keep your fingers crossed.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.400
&gt;&gt; I also love that story,
because that'd be awesome.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.310
I was going to ask you a
possibly specific question,

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.090
but my friend told me that'd
be unfair to the audience so--

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.740
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: If you
ask it in veiled terms--

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.340
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: -- without
using names, I've gotten kind

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.640
of good at answering
those questions.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.940
&gt;&gt; Great, I can do that.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.740
So, "A Visit from the
Goon Squad" is one

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.040
of my favorite books.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.630
And I know this is sort of
sliding door effects feeling

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.710
with the characters, the
choices they make and then kind

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.970
of reflecting back on what if,
which kind of scared the hell

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.650
out of me when I read it.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.270
It was thrilling as well.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.120
And then, but "Manhattan Beach"
is a little bit different.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.000
But at the end of the book,
maybe I was reflecting for Anna

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.520
because she makes a big decision
towards the end of the book.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.080
And I admit, I felt a little bit
cheated by it, when I read it.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.160
I was a little-- I
guess a little upset

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.070
because I was feeling, what if,
what if it had gone differently

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.370
or she made a different choice.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:14.670
And I was wondering, freedom

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.500
as a writer how you
approach this sort

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.800
of the responsibility
to these choices.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.780
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: OK, that's a
good challenge for me to figure

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.930
out how to answer this
without you guys knowing what

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.710
on earth we're talking about.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.380
But I'm going to answer
generally so that--

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.160
which is actually
the true answer

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.510
and also doesn't
give anything away.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.880
I think I know what choice
you're talking about.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.790
And what I can say to you
is that my goal always is

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.480
to find the thing I
haven't thought of.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.190
So if there are few
obvious courses of action

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.790
for a character, those
had better not be any

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.770
of the choices that
character makes.

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:49.680
I'm not interested in
something I can think

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.050
of as I'm moving toward it.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:55.200
I want to think of the thing
that didn't pop into my head

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.600
until the moment it actually
happened on the page.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.770
Trying to access that kind

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.530
of unconscious spontaneity is
the whole reason that I slug

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:09.340
through writing a
1,400-page first draft by hand

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.640
for "Manhattan Beach".

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.070
It's-- There are
many reasons not

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.860
to do that, I can promise you.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.910
One of which is just
having to read it

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.660
because my handwriting
is eligible.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:24.560
The reason to do it is to try to
weave my way among the choices

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.040
that I can imagine ahead
of time to find a path

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.710
that I hadn't thought of.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.470
The choice that that
character makes is the one

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.040
that seems not to exist.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.330
And that's why she doesn't.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.220
Because to me, narratively,
that is what's interesting.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:45.410
I'm not-- you know, my goal is
never to make a political point

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.250
of any sort in my work.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.000
I'm also a journalist and
I feel like that feels

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.690
like the more appropriate
realm for that sort

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.540
of thing to me with fiction.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.660
My concerns are really
aesthetic, what is going

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.490
to be surprising
and what is going

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:03.980
to be unexpected for the reader.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.350
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan:
You're welcome.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.860
&gt;&gt; So, "Look At Me",
"Visit from Goon Squad"

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.780
and "Manhattan Beach" all
feature multiple protagonists

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.080
as opposed to just one.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.100
What would you say drove you to
that story telling device over

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.750
and over and what advantages
do you think it gives over just

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.440
to seeing your limited
narrative?

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: I'm
assuming everyone hear that.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.830
So, why multiple plotlines?

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:33.540
I mean, I think part of it is
just a kind of general wish

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.380
to do as much as possible.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:40.070
I just feel like if-- and
actually that also has a kind

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:43.650
of aesthetic quality to it in
that if I feel like we sort

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.810
of get someone if there's
a way in which I feel

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.800
like a character is sort
of clear in some way,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.250
my goal is not to
just stay there.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.600
My goal is to now do
something different.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.190
Because if you think about
the complexity of life

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.940
and of perception, I mean, all
of us are sitting in this room,

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.830
each of us has our
own individual history

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.180
and we're here sharing
this moment together

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.470
and we're all preceding
it in our own ways,

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:13.470
that's just exponentially
complicated.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:18.440
My goal as a fiction writer
is to try to suggest as much

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.510
of that complication as
I can in a compelling,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.130
hopefully, entertaining way.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.400
So, complication is the goal.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.750
And if I've established
something, my impulse is

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.880
to move away from it and try
to bring more into the picture.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.180
And I would have to say,

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.320
my models here really are
the 19th century novelists,

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.600
who did a tremendous amount
in single books and had a kind

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.930
of fluidity that is sometimes
hard for us to even remember.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.280
I think when we think
of those books,

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.570
we think of 19th century
fiction as being kind

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.860
of conventional but
it's really not.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.560
I mean, they-- or at least not
by our contemporary standards.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.880
They switch points of view.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.180
They move among characters.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:10.410
They fly through time and that
kind of freedom to do as much

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:14.330
as possible while still
remaining compelling

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.430
and hopefully entertaining is
the whole job, in my opinion.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Here,
let's try this side and then.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.140
&gt;&gt; So you mentioned that
for "Manhattan Beach",

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.390
you found a lot of errors
and will fix new printing,

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.410
you want to make corrections and
I found that very refreshing.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.220
I was wondering, if you
reprint, do you have any sort

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.990
of acknowledgment's page
addressing those changes,

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:43.330
and also, would you consider
making creative changes

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.330
with a new round of
printing as opposed

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.600
to just technical changes?

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.050
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Well,
I love the thought

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:50.350
of making creative changes.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.610
There is one that I want to
make actually on my list.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.260
But the problem is that
the publisher does not want

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.560
to hear that.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.090
And then the danger is
that you start to seem

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.670
like you're sort
of-- what's the word,

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:06.270
or being a little
bit unreasonable

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.970
or even a little bit unstable.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.610
Like if I suddenly
said, you know,

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.360
I don't like the way this
character is coming off,

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.650
I need to revisit
this whole thing.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:20.110
They would say, Jenny, you
should maybe see a therapist.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.540
I mean, this is--
the book is published

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.960
and it's time to move on.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.260
But I have-- so that--

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.310
but that's one reason I do
not reread my own books.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.750
I mean, first of
all, why would I?

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.840
But really, I know that it
would put me in a position

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.350
of feeling unhappy
because, surely,

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.700
I would find things
that could be better.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.650
That said-- And oh, your
question about what I put

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.090
in in acknowledgment stating
the changes, not really,

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.580
it's not a newspaper where
I need to acknowledge that--

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.630
through an editing
error, through--

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.840
you know, through operator error
as which is always the case

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.300
when it comes to my fiction.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.050
You know, I got X,
Y, or Z wrong.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.450
I feel more like, no, let's--

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.190
let that go and now you're
reading the corrected version,

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.090
great.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.770
So-- But this one thing I
might want to change has to do

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.190
with shoring up something

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:16.140
that many readers have
questioned whether it was

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.000
actually plausible.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.350
And in fact, very much is.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:22.610
And so I feel like
there may be an easy fix

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.030
where I can somehow establish
that at another point.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.300
But I haven't even broached
this with my editor yet.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.600
We'll see.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.900
I'm looking for the
right moment.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
one last question.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.170
&gt;&gt; Do you have any tips,
suggestions, or advice for how

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.830
to form like a writing
group with people who kind

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.690
of nourish you and look
over your writing and people

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.590
who inspire you with
their own writing

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.040
and like how would you suggest
forming with that network?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.700
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: That's
such a great question.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.270
I mean, being part of a writing
group has really been a very

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.100
important part of
my writing life.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:59.010
I wrote one book in a vacuum
and it was dead on arrival.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:00.530
So I don't want to make
that mistake again,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:04.290
and I had been working at
it for two or three years.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:09.390
So, I think the key is, first
of all, taking any sort of class

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.310
or workshop is-- and
our writing group began

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:13.970
as a paid workshop, actually.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.470
Some of us were paying
one of the people there

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.930
to lead the writing group.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.630
And after a few years, she
wanted to bring work in so,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.130
you know, needless to say, it
was time to stop paying her

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.790
if we were also going to
be workshopping her work.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.920
I don't think it matters whether
you're working in the same genre

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.690
or even whether you necessarily
adore each other's work.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:37.270
What really matters is a sort
of an agreement on an approach

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:41.930
and a kind of goodwill that
means that everyone that is

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.450
on your side, they
genuinely want you to succeed,

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.710
which is really important
and can't be taken

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:51.620
for granted but will be honest.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.370
And so, how to find
those people?

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.670
There's trial and error.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.290
We've had some chemistry that
didn't work at times and,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.670
you know, we tend to stay small.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:03.110
There are only six
or seven of us.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.410
One Skypes in from California,

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.600
it's only one guy,
I'm sorry to say.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.900
I'd love to have more.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.150
So it's finding that
chemistry, but I think a couple

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.980
of things I would say
is we only read aloud.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.020
So there's no homework, there's
no pretending you've read a

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.910
little more carefully than
you really had time to.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:25.110
We have the experience
all at once and I find

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.180
that to be a great method.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.830
It's-- We-- There's a natural
triage that happens when you--

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.210
all you have time to do
is make a few little notes

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.920
about what's really important.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.780
And I find that it's-- you know,
the most important things rise

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.860
to the surface and it's less
likely that you get caught

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.970
up in the details that
don't really matter.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.880
The, you know, story telling
began as an oral tradition

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.540
and there's nothing like
reading your work to a group

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.830
to remind you of that.

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.070
Sometimes that's a
happy experience.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.930
Sometimes it's really bad.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.560
You know, I'll come
in there with things

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.720
that I think are going to
work and I can feel this kind

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.350
of lead, glazed feeling coming
over the room and I think,

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.660
oh my god, this is--
it's not working at all.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.180
But it's important to know that

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.730
and reading aloud is a great
way of finding that out.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.680
But I would-- I think I would
suggest taking a workshop,

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.590
taking a class, and
trying little by little

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:27.030
to pull together some people
that can meet and be this kind

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.330
of support for each other.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.520
I highly, highly recommend it.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And thank you.

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.420
Such a pleasure to talk to you.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.720
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Thank you.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.020
Thank you all.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Great.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Egan: Fun.
