00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.570
Time for a little honesty, I quit piano lessons
when I was a kid.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.970
And my dad always said I would regret it.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.059
Well dad, this me, admitting you’re right.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.041
Science has known for a while that learning
to play an instrument is good for kids.

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:22.260
Kids who take music lessons have higher grades
and graduation rates than their non-musical

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.260
peers.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.700
Some researchers even claim that it can boost
IQ as well as academic performance.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.210
A recent study from researchers at the University
of Vermont College of Medicine added another

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.809
reason to the list of why I should not have
quit piano lessons.

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.989
Learning an instrument can help grow the young
and changing brain.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.410
The study looked at brain scans of 232 kids
ages 6-18 over a few years to see what playing

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.379
an instrument would do.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.730
The researchers looked one region in particular,
the cortex.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.070
This part of the brain changes in thickness
as kid’s brains grow.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.479
This recent study found that the more a child
practiced an instrument the faster their brains

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.760
organized and the faster their cortical lining
thickened.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.720
These physical changes in the brain led to
important changes in the kids behavior.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.120
They were better at paying attention, managing
anxiety, and controlling their emotions and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.120
impulses.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.180
This isn’t the first study to toot the horn
of musical training.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.400
Previous studies show that learning an instrument
boosts memory and grades.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.070
Researchers from Northwestern University studied
a group of kids from The Harmony Project,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.500
a music education program in inner city LA.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.610
Not only did the participants in the program
do better in school, they had higher grades

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.920
and graduation rates, but the study showed
that kids who play an instrument for two years

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.640
can distinguish the difference in sounds like
Pill and Bill better than their non-musical

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.840
peers which develops important skills like
communication and reading.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.030
But the benefits aren’t just for kids, learning
to play an instrument can create neurological

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.310
connections that can last a life time.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.590
Playing an instrument involves many parts
of the brain, visual and auditory regions,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.170
motor control and even emotional processing
centers are activated.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.950
And this leads musicians to have better neuroplasticity,
which means their brains are better at changing

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.060
and rewiring themselves over time and helps
when old age brings a decline in cognitive

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.060
function.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.640
But these cognitive benefits aren’t necessarily
unique to musicians, really any kind of specialized

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.990
training can boost the brain in different
ways.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.690
Now the real question is, does this work for
grown ups?

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.670
Could learning an instrument later in life
confer the same benefits? because I could

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.530
seriously use a brain boost.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.330
Most research indicates the strongest effects
occur when learning takes place in childhood.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.700
While there’s not a lot of research right
now on how learning an instrument later in

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.280
life affects adult brains, one researcher
from the University of Zurich says that adults

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.990
over the age of 65 who pick up an instrument
had important changes in regions of the brain

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.950
that control hearing, coordination and memory.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.760
Learning any skill at any age helps new neuron
growth, so maybe there’s some hope for me.
