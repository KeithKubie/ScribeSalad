00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.587
During the nineteenth century, Greek mythology

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:08.601
acquired renewed significance when both poets and

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.755
painters turned to the ancient myths for subject matter.

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:14.835
And we have no error.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.234
So let's just read this a little bit carefully.

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.758
The first time I read through it, my brain really didn't pick up something that seemed weird.

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:24.389
So, during the nineteenth century, Greek mythology

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:28.468
acquired renewed significance, that seems reasonable so far

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:34.358
when both poets and painters turned to, turned to

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:37.000
the ancient myths for subject matter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.560
Yeah this all seems pretty good.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.897
I would say no error.
