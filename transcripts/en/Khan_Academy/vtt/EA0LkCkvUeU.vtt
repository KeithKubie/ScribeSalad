00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:02.510
But what I wanted to do in
this video is talk about what

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.560
a bitcoin is in
more general terms

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.850
and what differentiating
characteristics

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.970
they have compared
to other approaches.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.670
So for starters, bitcoin is just
an electronic payment system.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.550
By electronic payment
system, I mean

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.940
it's just a vehicle, a conduit,
by which two parties can

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.322
transact over the internet.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.780
I call these parties
Alice and Bob.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.960
And let's say Alice
for whatever reason

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.560
wants to give money to
Bob over the internet.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.570
And this may be because
she owes Bob money,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.220
or maybe Bob is a
merchant and Alice

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.960
is buying something from Bob.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.030
Or maybe Bob is
a not-for-profit,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.820
and Alice is making
a donation to Bob.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.236
So there could be
many reasons why

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:44.775
Alice is trying to pay Bob over
the internet in some capacity.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:47.620
Now, if Bob is willing
to accept bitcoins, which

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.810
are a form of
electronic payments,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.300
then Alice can go ahead and
send Bob some value in bitcoins.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.170
And really, a
bitcoin transaction

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.380
between Alice and Bob amounts
to a specially constructed

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.800
sequence of numbers that
Alice will basically

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.459
send over to Bob.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.770
And this will be done
entirely over the internet.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.830
These numbers will have certain
mathematical properties.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.350
They make it hard for someone
to really defraud the system

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.874
or to conduct some type of
nefarious action on the system.

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:18.290
And the way that
Alice is actually

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.480
going to conduct this
transaction in practice

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.750
is either by installing a
special piece of software,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.210
which we call a
bitcoin client, or she

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.830
can work with a
third-party service that

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.460
can handle these
mechanics for her.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.170
But in either case, either
the client or the service

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.440
is going to generate
these numbers for Alice.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.730
And on the flip side,
Bob will also typically

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.880
either have a piece
of software installed

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.890
or he'll use a
third-party service

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.657
that will take these
numbers and allow

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:45.490
him to do something
else with those numbers.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.429
For example, Bob can in turn
buy something on his own

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.470
with those numbers, or he
can trade those numbers

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.530
in for real money and
so on and so forth.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.090
Now, one of the first
questions you might have--

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.240
and I kind of alluded
to this earlier--

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.369
is why would Bob even
want to accept bitcoins

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.160
in the first place?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.050
After all, a bitcoin is
just a bunch of numbers.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.780
What intrinsic value
would it conceivably have?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.260
And it turns out,
quite surprisingly,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.100
that bitcoins actually
have real-world value.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.680
There are more and more
merchants popping up

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.410
each day who accept
bitcoins for transactions.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.830
There are also
bitcoin exchanges,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.860
places where you
can go and exchange

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.730
bitcoins for more
mainstream currencies.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.080
And some of exchanges include--
the major one is one called Mt.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.190
Gox.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.835
And at Mt.

00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:37.770
Gox you could exchange a bitcoin
for a euro or yen or dollar

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.520
and so on and so forth.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.410
Now the current
price of a bitcoin,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.370
the current value of a bitcoin
in US dollars as of this video,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.430
is approximately US$100.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.710
per bitcoin.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.060
That number is fluctuating.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.912
This is a new
currency, and there's

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:53.120
going to be some fluctuation.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.350
But as people understand
the currency better,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.779
the hope is that that
fluctuation will decrease.

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.820
But I think ultimately,
the thing to keep in mind

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.110
is that the value
of a bitcoin is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.910
going to be derived
from the faith

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.080
that you have in
the value of what

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.725
you can procure
with that bitcoin.

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:12.190
It's just like you would
for a dollar, a euro or yen.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.820
The faith that you have
in that currency's value

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.872
is how you value that currency.

00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:19.330
Now another question
you might have

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.480
is why do people even
bother with bitcoins

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.580
in the first place.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.880
Aren't there other
more standard ways?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.644
Why couldn't Alice
and Bob use Paypal?

00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:28.935
Why couldn't they use a credit
card number to transact?

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:33.100
Why couldn't Alice just sent
Bob an electronic check?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.550
Why not use one of these
other approaches that

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.937
are more well understood,
that are more mainstream,

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:39.020
that are more established?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.952
Why on earth would you possibly
want to mess with a good thing?

00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:44.410
So it turns out that there are
a few properties of bitcoins

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.460
that are worth noting.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.950
For starters, there's privacy.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.510
It turns out that within
the bitcoin ecosystem,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.170
within the bitcoin
network, people

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.089
can transact without divulging
who they are in the real world.

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.130
From the perspective of
bitcoin, Alice's identity

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.969
is just going to be a
sequence of numbers.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.760
And that sequence of
numbers is effectively

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.480
going to function like
a pseudonym for Alice.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360
And that sequence of
numbers has nothing

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.010
to do with your
real-world identity.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.222
Nobody needs to know this
is Alice transacting.

00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:14.180
All they need to worry
about is their pseudonym

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.590
within the system.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.880
And this is kind of
but not quite like what

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.220
you would get if you bought
something using cash.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.380
In that capacity, when you
buy something using cash,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.180
then you don't have to provide
any details or proof regarding

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.130
who you are in the real world.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.890
And that's different
from, let's say,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.377
using a credit
card, where you have

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:35.710
to provide your name and your
billing address and so on.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.760
Or let's say providing an
electronic check, where

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.470
you need to tie that
electronic check,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.710
typically your bank
account details.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.240
Now, I do want to
also mention here

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.010
that sometimes when you have a
cash list or a transaction that

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.560
uses cash, there is
now the possibility

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.600
that people might try to
use these transactions

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.230
for malicious purposes to buy
illicit goods and services.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.950
That definitely is
a risk that occurs

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.621
when you provide
anonymity and privacy.

00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.370
But there are certainly
legitimate reasons

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.740
why somebody might want to
conduct a transaction privately

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.920
and not have the whole world
know what they're transacting.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.260
Another property of
bitcoin is that it's open.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.432
Literally anyone
can get involved.

00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:19.390
Literally anyone who was
an internet connection

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.195
can make a bitcoin transaction.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.445
And all you need to do to
get started is, as I alluded

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:25.970
to earlier, is download
this special bitcoin client.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.490
And the bitcoin client,
or for that matter

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.310
you can use a service like Mt.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.670
Gox which will effectively
do the same work

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.230
as a client for you.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.940
But the short of
it is that anyone

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.640
who has a bitcoin
client or who has

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.370
an account with an
exchange like Mt.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.650
Gox can engage in
bitcoin transactions.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.040
That transaction, the details
of it, the mechanics of it

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.620
will be transparent to the user.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.030
All the user has to worry
about-- all Alice needs

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.130
to worry about-- is
how much money she has

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.060
and whether she can
give that money to Bob.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.820
The actual software
underneath will

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.600
take care of all the
underlying mechanics

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.780
of making that transaction work.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.750
Now, this is different.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.541
When you think about
a traditional currency

00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:05.070
like a dollar, if I want to
transact something online,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.160
typically I need a bank
account, I need a credit card,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.200
and so on and so forth.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.770
Then we often take it for
granted that there are people

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.817
out there who may
not have access

00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:15.900
to a credit card, who may
not have a bank account.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.900
For example, in the United
States alone it turns out--

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.900
and I just looked this up--
the number of households

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.160
without a bank
account, I read it,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.542
is somewhere north of about 8%.

00:06:26.542 --> 00:06:27.250
It's pretty high.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.110
There are a lot of
people out there

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.360
who wouldn't be able to
conduct a traditional internet

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.980
transaction, but who can conduct
a transaction using bitcoin.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.120
And by the way, there
are people using bitcoin

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.110
all over the world.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.399
And literally it doesn't matter
where you are in the world,

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.190
as long as you have an
internet connection,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.057
you can start
transacting bitcoins.

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:47.390
Now, another property of
bitcoin that's worth mentioning

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.140
is that it's decentralized.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.540
There's no bank or
centralized entity

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.400
that can really control what's
happening in the bitcoin

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.360
ecosystem.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.400
It's all done in this
kind of ad hoc fashion.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.050
And what that means is that
when you do a transact--

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.170
or when Alice transacts
with Bob over the internet,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.970
that transaction doesn't have
to go through a third party.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.069
There's no bank that gets in
the way of that transaction.

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:14.860
And that can have
certain benefits as well.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.080
For example, that means that
no one entity can directly

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.970
control the money
supply of bitcoins.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.890
That also means that no one
entity can see your assets.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.010
Or for that matter,
no one entity

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.447
can reverse a transaction,
which is definitely

00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:31.780
desirable for certain merchants.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.250
Some merchants might
not be able to conduct

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.250
business online because
of fraud concerns.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.280
And if you have a system where
the transactions cannot be

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.360
charged back easily, then from
the merchant's perspective,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.210
they may be able to inhibit
fraud and thereby that might

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.292
enable their business
entirely online.

00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:52.250
Now I want to point out
that this last property

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.010
of decentralization
definitely causes concern

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.400
among some people or not
in bitcoin after all.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.270
When you think about it, a
central authority like a bank

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.090
does perform an
important function

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.900
in the context of a
traditional currency.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.570
For example, banks might
validate currencies.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.940
They might validate
transactions against fraud.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.940
Now, in bitcoin, this
validation is basically

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.050
done in a decentralized
way by the other parties,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.050
the other nodes, in
the bitcoin network.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.220
Now, the goal of the remaining
videos in this series

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.850
is to walk through the
underlying mechanics of bitcoin

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.330
transactions and really
how they're validated,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.540
even though the system
is decentralized.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.190
And there are some
pretty amazing techniques

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.600
that are used to
make all this work.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.100
So I suspect that
at this point, you

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.850
may have a ton of
questions about bitcoin,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.659
and that's entirely
to be expected.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.355
Bitcoin is a very
complex protocol.

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:45.339
It has many moving parts.

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:46.880
And I think it's
critical when you're

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.720
trying to understand
something as complex

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.270
and wrap your head around
something as sophisticated

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.600
as bitcoin, it's important to
get exposed to all the parts

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.590
first so that you
can ultimately get

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.440
a flavor for how
they fit together.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.720
And hopefully the other
videos in this series

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.430
will help you to understand
these different parts

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.675
and along the way address
many of the questions

00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:07.860
that you might have.
