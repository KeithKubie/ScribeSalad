00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.650
In the last lecture we looked at point processes of an image that allowed us to

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.300
do simple arithmetic, addition,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
subtraction of pixels from one image to the other.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.420
Let's now look at the whole concept on how we can take a pixel and

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.490
look around the neighbor of that pixel and

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.200
use that information to improve the quality of an image.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.630
For example, by looking at and averaging around a pixel, we can blur an image.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.160
We can also do other things like, if there is noise in the image,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.390
we can look at the neighborhood and again, get rid of the noise in an image.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.520
So those kinds of processes let us now look at

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.920
neighborhoods of pixels within the single image of multiple images, and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.450
use that to enhance the quality of images.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.490
That's the kind of stuff we're going to look at in this series of lectures.
