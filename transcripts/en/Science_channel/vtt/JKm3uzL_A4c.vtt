00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.810
At the beginning of the 20th century, an

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.330
asteroid the size of the White House was

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.880
moving past Earth on its way to nowhere

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.799
in particular. But as it had done for

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
billions of years, with a billion other

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.800
space rocks, our earth reached out and

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.980
began pulling it toward us. Best guesses

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.010
put that asteroid at between 30 and 50

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.109
meters across. If you had to walk all the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.349
way around it it would have taken you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.320
about eight minutes. For months, it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.840
continued toward us, gaining speed. By the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
time it hit our atmospherem it was doing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.200
at least 40,000 kilometers per hour... but

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.950
probably a lot more. At that speed and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.920
size, it pierced our atmosphere. It was

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.559
moving so fast that the air became an

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
impenetrable wall. The massive meteor

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.840
smashed into this wall of air and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.420
exploded like a hydrogen bomb. Imagine

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.840
what that would have looked like from

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840
the ground.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.060
The debris cloud from the Tunguska event

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.910
eventually destroyed an area over 2,000

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.510
square kilometers of forest. That's an

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.820
area as large as the City of London. It's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.010
estimated that an event as large as Tunguska

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.690
happens roughly every 500 years

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.590
It WILL happen again.
