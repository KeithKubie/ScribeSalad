solve the problem I think it's
 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.930
solve the problem I think it's
that in a way there is a piece on making

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940
that in a way there is a piece on making
 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.020
that in a way there is a piece on making
sure that education or being involved in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030

an education career is cool again and
you know in a way if you look at the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190
you know in a way if you look at the
 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.340
you know in a way if you look at the
faculties of education that we have in

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350
faculties of education that we have in
 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.990

many parts of the Arab world they
 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.970
many parts of the Arab world they
usually accept students who are not able

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980
usually accept students who are not able
 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.910

to get into other schools and there are
very few who would really think that

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440
very few who would really think that
 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.320

having a career in education in school

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330
having a career in education in school
 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.900
having a career in education in school
so there is one element around promoting

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910
so there is one element around promoting
 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.660
so there is one element around promoting
that and I'll making sure that we're

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
that and I'll making sure that we're
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.120
that and I'll making sure that we're
going to get really really good people

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130
going to get really really good people
 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.670
going to get really really good people
and really capable people special people

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680
and really capable people special people
 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.560

getting into the education field right

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
getting into the education field right
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.440
getting into the education field right
at the beginning and I know that's a bit

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
at the beginning and I know that's a bit
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.440
at the beginning and I know that's a bit
of a long term kind of like quest but

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
of a long term kind of like quest but
 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.810
of a long term kind of like quest but
then at the second part is around using

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820
then at the second part is around using
 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.350
then at the second part is around using
technology is there a way to in order to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360
technology is there a way to in order to
 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.250
technology is there a way to in order to
facilitate access to great lectures

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
facilitate access to great lectures
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.650
facilitate access to great lectures
great teachers great curriculums on

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660
great teachers great curriculums on
 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.130
great teachers great curriculums on
using technology many of our people in

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
using technology many of our people in
 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.020
using technology many of our people in
many of our governments in the Arab

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
many of our governments in the Arab
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.540
many of our governments in the Arab
world are investing a lot on that front

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
world are investing a lot on that front
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.880
world are investing a lot on that front
and there's lots of personal computers

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
and there's lots of personal computers
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.060
and there's lots of personal computers
and there's lots of investments in in

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
and there's lots of investments in in
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.699
and there's lots of investments in in
broadband and telecommunication and you

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
broadband and telecommunication and you
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.680
broadband and telecommunication and you
think that maybe if we add a bit of

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690
think that maybe if we add a bit of
 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.509
think that maybe if we add a bit of
content in that maybe if we make sure

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519
content in that maybe if we make sure
 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.940
content in that maybe if we make sure
that the great lectures are being

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950
that the great lectures are being
 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.190
that the great lectures are being
actually convey and a teacher will be

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
actually convey and a teacher will be
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.680
actually convey and a teacher will be
comfortable enough using content and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
comfortable enough using content and
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.710
comfortable enough using content and
curriculum from other

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
curriculum from other
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780
curriculum from other
that would be another very useful thing

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
that would be another very useful thing
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.680
that would be another very useful thing
too and then the third thing relates to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690
too and then the third thing relates to
 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.470
too and then the third thing relates to
sort of like the whole reward system and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
sort of like the whole reward system and
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.340
sort of like the whole reward system and
how do we take care of great teachers in

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
how do we take care of great teachers in
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.770
how do we take care of great teachers in
the schools and and part of that would

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
the schools and and part of that would
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.720
the schools and and part of that would
relate to results part of that has to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730
relate to results part of that has to
 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.540
relate to results part of that has to
relate to student feedback you see in

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
relate to student feedback you see in
 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.100
relate to student feedback you see in
the West and some parts of the world is

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
the West and some parts of the world is
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.920
the West and some parts of the world is
an official kind of like rate my teacher

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930
an official kind of like rate my teacher
 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.690
an official kind of like rate my teacher
kind of thing so I think if we if we add

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
kind of thing so I think if we if we add
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.810
kind of thing so I think if we if we add
a bit of that into the into the mix that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820
a bit of that into the into the mix that
 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.180
a bit of that into the into the mix that
will be useful too and then finally it's

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
will be useful too and then finally it's
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.530
will be useful too and then finally it's
the role of the ministries of Education

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
the role of the ministries of Education
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.860
the role of the ministries of Education
and how tightly they monitor that and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
and how tightly they monitor that and
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.949
and how tightly they monitor that and
how seriously are about to rewards and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959
how seriously are about to rewards and
 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.720
how seriously are about to rewards and
two great teachers and at the same time

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730
two great teachers and at the same time
 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.890
two great teachers and at the same time
also making sure that those who don't do

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900
also making sure that those who don't do
 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.510
also making sure that those who don't do
very well do not further not progress

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520
very well do not further not progress
 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.090
very well do not further not progress
may further in the indication career

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
may further in the indication career
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.850
may further in the indication career
thank you
