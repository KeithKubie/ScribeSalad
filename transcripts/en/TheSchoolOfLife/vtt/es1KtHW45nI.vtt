00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.340
It isn’t difficult to imagine a privileged
childhood: we associate the term with a swimming

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.450
pool in the garden, holidays abroad, lavish
presents and outsize birthday parties – and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.690
maybe someone deferential picking up the clothes
from the bedroom floor during school hours.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.640
Our ideas are plainly focused on money.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.570
The idea has enough truth in it to convince
the cynical parts of us, but the number of

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.890
breakdowns and mental illnesses gnawing at
the upper middle classes should be enough

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:41.390
to force us to concede that money cannot on
its own be the reliable guarantor of ‘privilege’

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.680
that it would, in a way, be simpler to imagine
it was. True privilege is an emotional phenomenon.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.860
It involves receiving the nectar of love – which
can be stubbornly missing in the best equipped

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.210
mansions and oddly abundant in the bare rooms
of modest bungalows. It is true privilege

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.369
when a parent is on hand to enter imaginatively
into a child’s world; when they have the

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.789
wherewithal to put their own needs aside for
a time in order to focus wholeheartedly on

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.990
the confusions and fears of their offspring;
and when they are attuned not just to what

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.269
a child actually manages to say but to what
they might be aspiring yet struggling to explain.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:31.079
It is privilege when a parent lends us a feeling

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.399
that they are loyal to us simply on the basis
that we exist rather than because of anything

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.950
extraordinary we have managed to achieve,
when they can imbue us with a sense that they

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.619
will be on our side even if the world has
turned against us and can teach us that all

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.100
humans deserve compassion and understanding
despite their errors and compulsions. It is

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.649
privilege when parents can shield us from
the worst of their anxiety and rage and the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.299
full conflicts of their adult lives; when
they can respect that it is many years before

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.180
a child is old enough to face the full complexity
of existence – and when they are sufficiently

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.170
mature to let us grow up slowly. It is privilege
when parents don’t set themselves up as

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.280
perfect or, by being remote and unavailable,
encourage us to idealise or demonise them.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.849
It is privilege when they can be ordinary
and a little boring, can invite us to develop

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.409
into a man or a woman beside them – and
can know how to let themselves be superseded.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.849
It is privilege when parents can bear our
rebellions and don’t force us to be preternaturally

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.069
obedient or good, when they don’t crumple
if we try out what it feels like to call them

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.250
old idiots, and when they themselves reliably
seek to explain, rather than impose their ideas.

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.999
It is privilege when they can accept that
we will eventually need to leave them and

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:07.880
not mistake our independence for betrayal.
All of these moves belong to privilege sincerely

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.190
understood, and they are, at present, about
as rare as huge wealth, but at points more

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.640
crucial. It is those who have enjoyed years
of emotional privilege that deserve to be

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.290
counted among the true one per cent. It can
be natural, when we meet with any sort of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.900
privilege that has been deeply and unfairly
distributed, to seek to level the playing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.579
field. But it can’t be a redistribution
of privilege that is required here, rather

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.469
a universal increase – and the assurance
of a decent minimum. A truly fair society

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.499
would be one in which a yearly rise in the
degree of emotional privilege in circulation

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:54.499
would became a national priority – and where
an abundance of love, concern, and connection

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.640
was adequately studied, encouraged and prized
as the true ‘wealth’ it is.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:15.680
The Joys and Sorrows of Parenting promises us a gentle way of staying calm around one of the most arduous yet most fullfilling jobs in the world.
