Rockefeller I had I had worked a little

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
Rockefeller I had I had worked a little
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:48.100
Rockefeller I had I had worked a little
bit on this problem circadian rhythms

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110
 
 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.880
 
and I just thought it was a terrific

and I just thought it was a terrific
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830

behave what what what could we learn

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
behave what what what could we learn
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.359

about a fairly complicated behavior we

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
about a fairly complicated behavior we
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.580
about a fairly complicated behavior we
all exhibit which was you know most

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
all exhibit which was you know most

easily represented by sleep-wake cycles
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.790
easily represented by sleep-wake cycles
and frankly I thought we'd find out

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
and frankly I thought we'd find out
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.150
and frankly I thought we'd find out
maybe a little bit I never thought we

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
maybe a little bit I never thought we
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.880
maybe a little bit I never thought we
would really understand what that motor

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
would really understand what that motor
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.450
would really understand what that motor
fine this was at the time we were very

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
fine this was at the time we were very
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.550
fine this was at the time we were very
lucky we managed to find jeans that fit

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
lucky we managed to find jeans that fit

another thing work and and the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
another thing work and and the
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.580
another thing work and and the
techniques and the approaches kept

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590
techniques and the approaches kept
 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.460
techniques and the approaches kept
changing and I kept I was very lucky I

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
changing and I kept I was very lucky I
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.970

kept getting students and postdocs that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
kept getting students and postdocs that
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.790
kept getting students and postdocs that
were extremely good and and just get

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
were extremely good and and just get
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.420
were extremely good and and just get
everything right and the other piece of

Hall and Michael Ross - and we kind of

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
Hall and Michael Ross - and we kind of
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.430
Hall and Michael Ross - and we kind of
pushed each other along because I mean

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
pushed each other along because I mean
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.500

time to time but we work on slightly

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930
time to time but we work on slightly

different problems with the solutions
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.950
different problems with the solutions
for those problems all right worsening
