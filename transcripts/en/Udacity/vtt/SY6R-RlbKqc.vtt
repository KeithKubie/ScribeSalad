00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.800
Here's an example of Snort rule.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.890
Typically the root user account is
used only for specific privileged

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.510
operations such as picking out file
systems and setting up subnetworks.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.120
It is quite uncommon to send
email using the root account.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.220
And such an event should
trigger an alert.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.500
Here's an example of how
Snort can capture this event.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.850
It looks for traffic to the SMTP
port on any host in the /24 network,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.520
and checks if the content
of the email contains,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.990
mail from: root, which indicates
that a root user is sending email.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.964
It then sends an alert with
the following message,

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:45.976
root users attempt to send email.

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:51.180
The content keyword here is one of
the more important features of Snort.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.240
It allows the sys admin to
set rules that search for

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.510
specific content in the packet payload
and trigger response based on that data.
