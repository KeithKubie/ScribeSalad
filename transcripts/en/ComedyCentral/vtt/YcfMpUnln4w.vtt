00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.770
DON'T HIT
THE MAIDEN SLAYER.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:05.339
THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING
MY FACE NOW--THE MAIDEN SLAYER.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.075
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.
I PLAYED A LOT OF AREA 51.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.610

[knock on door]

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:12.279
- UH, GUYS...

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.014
- OH, FUDGE.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.950
- OH...YOU TWO ARE HERE.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.986
AND A HOMELESS PERSON.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.756
OKAY, GAYLE, THESE ARE JUST
A COUPLE MORE EMPLOYEES OF MINE.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.892
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHERE'S THIS ACID?

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.793

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.028
YEAH, WHERE'S THE ACID?

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.596
THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.898
IT'S PROBABLY
AT A DRUG DEALER'S HOUSE.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.932
- UH, ADAM...
- NO, NO. NO, NO.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.333
WE KNOW--
I TOLD THEM.

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.169
JUST--IT'S IN THE SAFE.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.803
- MM. MM-HMM.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.138
- YEAH, WELL, LET'S...

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:39.640
GET IT OUT, I GUESS,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.709
AND...
LET'S DO ACID.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.678
- ALICE MURPHY, YOU DOG.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.980
[fireworks popping]

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.553
[ominous music]

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.254
- BYE.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.323
- I ALREADY DID IT.
WAS I SUPPOSED TO WAIT?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.861
- IT'S GOOD.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.433
- YES. FINALLY.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.968
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS
WANNA DO?

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.336
GO OUT TO THE DESERT,
SHOOT SOME FIREWORKS?

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.104
STARE AT STARS?

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.240
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.408
[rock music]

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.843
- SEE THAT BIG DICK!

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:16.844

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.912
AAH!
IT'S A BIG DICK.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.147
[giggles]

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.382
- SO ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR TRIP?

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.151
- THIS IS UN-[bleep]-REAL.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.521
IT'S LIKE ALL I CAN HEAR
IS THE SOUNDTRACK FROM <i>DRIVE.</i>

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:32.092
BUT ALL I SEE IS MY MOTHER
RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:36.096
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, "DIRGE"?

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.931
- YES, OF COURSE
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.433
'CAUSE I'M--
I'M TRIPPIN' WITH YOU GUYS.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.168
