00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:09.603
The discovery of the structure of DNA

00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:14.170
was one of the most important scientific
achievements in the last century,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.224
in human history, in fact.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:20.163
The now-famous double helix is almost
synonymous with Watson and Crick,

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:24.327
two of the scientists who won
the Nobel Prize for figuring it out.

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:26.442
But there's another name 
you may know, too,

00:00:26.442 --> 00:00:28.382
Rosalind Franklin.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:32.567
You may have heard that her data supported
Watson and Crick's brilliant idea,

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:36.850
or that she was a plain-dressing,
belligerent scientist,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.859
which is how Watson actually described her
in "The Double Helix."

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.852
But thanks to Franklin's biographers,

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.191
who investigated her life 
and interviewed many people close to her,

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:50.917
we now know that that account
is far from true,

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.851
and her scientific contributions
have been vastly underplayed.

00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:56.721
Let's hear the real story.

00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:01.475
Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born
in London in 1920.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.612
She wanted to be a scientist ever
since she was a teenager,

00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:08.764
which wasn't a common or easy
career path for girls at that time.

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:11.039
But she excelled at science anyway.

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.325
She won a scholarship to Cambridge
to study chemistry,

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.112
where she earned her Ph.D.,

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:19.397
and she later conducted research on
the structure of coal

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:23.700
that led to better gas masks for 
the British during World War II.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.256
In 1951, she joined King's College

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:29.790
to use x-ray techniques to study
the structure of DNA,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.414
then one of the hottest topics in science.

00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:35.449
Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab
and got to work

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:40.120
shining high-energy x-rays 
on tiny, wet crystals of DNA.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.804
But the acadmemic culture at the time
wasn't very friendly to women,

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.286
and Franklin was isolated 
from her colleagues.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:48.609
She clashed with Maurice Wilkins,

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.974
a labmate who assumed Franklin
had been hired as his assistant.

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:54.472
But Franklin kept working,

00:01:54.472 --> 00:02:01.193
and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51,
the most famous x-ray image of DNA.

00:02:01.193 --> 00:02:03.630
Just getting the image took 100 hours,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.485
the calculations necessary to analyze it
would take a year.

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:10.448
Meanwhile, the American biologist
James Watson

00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:12.787
and the British physicist Francis Crick

00:02:12.787 --> 00:02:15.730
were also working 
on finding DNA's structure.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.252
Without Franklin's knowledge,

00:02:17.252 --> 00:02:21.667
Wilkins took Photo 51
and showed it to Watson and Crick.

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:25.078
Instead of calculating the exact
position of every atom,

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.942
they did a quick analysis 
of Franklin's data

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:31.442
and used that to build 
a few potential structures.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.220
Eventually, they arrived at the right one.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.169
DNA is made of two helicoidal strands,

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:42.416
one opposite the other with bases
in the center like rungs of a ladder.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:46.670
Watson and Crick published their model
in April 1953.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.215
Meanwhile, 
Franklin had finished her calculations,

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.664
come to the same conclusion,

00:02:51.664 --> 00:02:54.398
and submitted her own manuscript.

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:56.721
The journal published 
the manuscripts together,

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:58.883
but put Franklin's last,

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:02.882
making it look like her experiments just
confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.381
instead of inspiring it.

00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:07.920
But Franklin had already 
stopped working on DNA

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.018
and died of cancer in 1958,

00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:15.107
never knowing that Watson and Crick
had seen her photographs.

00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:19.326
Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won
the Nobel Prize in 1962

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:21.421
for their work on DNA.

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:25.006
It's often said that Franklin would have
been recognized by a Nobel Prize

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.288
if only they could be 
awarded posthumously.

00:03:28.288 --> 00:03:31.638
And, in fact, it's possible 
she could have won twice.

00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:37.302
Her work on the structure of viruses
led to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982.

00:03:37.302 --> 00:03:42.636
It's time to tell the story of a brave
woman who fought sexism in science,

00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:47.514
and whose work revolutionized
medicine, biology, and agriculture.

00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:51.039
It's time to honor 
Rosalind Elsie Franklin,

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.534
the unsung mother of the double helix.
