there are a couple of of choices so

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310
there are a couple of of choices so
 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.460
there are a couple of of choices so
ultimately what I'd like to understand

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470
ultimately what I'd like to understand
 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.150
ultimately what I'd like to understand
is how attention works in a human

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
is how attention works in a human
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.659
is how attention works in a human
because I'm a human but the problem is

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:15.669
because I'm a human but the problem is
 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.029
because I'm a human but the problem is
that for doing experiments humans are

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039
that for doing experiments humans are
 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.740
that for doing experiments humans are
sometimes in many ways not the ideal

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750
sometimes in many ways not the ideal
 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.690
sometimes in many ways not the ideal
preparation they're not the ideal

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700
preparation they're not the ideal
 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.940
preparation they're not the ideal
subjects and the reason of course is

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950
subjects and the reason of course is
 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.280
subjects and the reason of course is
that we don't have access to what's

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290
that we don't have access to what's
 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.580
that we don't have access to what's
going on inside the human brain at the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590
going on inside the human brain at the
 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.069
going on inside the human brain at the
level of resolution that one might like

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079
level of resolution that one might like
 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.959
level of resolution that one might like
and furthermore we don't have the means

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969
and furthermore we don't have the means
 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.290
and furthermore we don't have the means
of manipulating that activity within a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300
of manipulating that activity within a
 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.709
of manipulating that activity within a
human in a way that we can actually

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719
human in a way that we can actually
 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.130
human in a way that we can actually
probe what's really going on so although

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140
probe what's really going on so although
 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.119
probe what's really going on so although
one preparation that has been and is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
one preparation that has been and is
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.410
one preparation that has been and is
remains really useful for studying

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420
remains really useful for studying
 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.360
remains really useful for studying
attention as the human if we want sort

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370
attention as the human if we want sort
 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.250
attention as the human if we want sort
of a finer grain understanding we have

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260
of a finer grain understanding we have
 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.910
of a finer grain understanding we have
to go to so-called non-human models of

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920
to go to so-called non-human models of
 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.000
to go to so-called non-human models of
attention and there are several the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010
attention and there are several the
 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.210
attention and there are several the
dominant one is the primate monkey the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220
dominant one is the primate monkey the
 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.190
dominant one is the primate monkey the
monkey the primate model the monkey and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200
monkey the primate model the monkey and
 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.249
monkey the primate model the monkey and
the reason for studying a monkey of

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259
the reason for studying a monkey of
 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.840
the reason for studying a monkey of
course is that monkeys are fairly

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850
course is that monkeys are fairly
 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.109
course is that monkeys are fairly
similar to humans in a lot of ways their

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119
similar to humans in a lot of ways their
 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.200
similar to humans in a lot of ways their
brain seems similar their evolutionary

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
brain seems similar their evolutionary
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.910
brain seems similar their evolutionary
evolutionarily quite close but in

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920
evolutionarily quite close but in
 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.709
evolutionarily quite close but in
practice there are also limitations with

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719
practice there are also limitations with
 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.429
practice there are also limitations with
monkeys and so for my research we've

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439
monkeys and so for my research we've
 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.770
monkeys and so for my research we've
actually moved to rodents and there are

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780
actually moved to rodents and there are
 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.899
actually moved to rodents and there are
a couple of advantages of studying

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909
a couple of advantages of studying
 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.149
a couple of advantages of studying
attention in rome's but the first

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159
attention in rome's but the first
 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.020
attention in rome's but the first
advantage is that we can scale up and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030
advantage is that we can scale up and
 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.120
advantage is that we can scale up and
study dozens and and potentially from

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130
study dozens and and potentially from
 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.609
study dozens and and potentially from
hundreds of rodents in parallel in a way

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619
hundreds of rodents in parallel in a way
 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.080
hundreds of rodents in parallel in a way
that you can't really do in a monkey and

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
that you can't really do in a monkey and
 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.270
that you can't really do in a monkey and
practice the way that people work with

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280
practice the way that people work with
 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.630
practice the way that people work with
monkeys is they they train a monkey for

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
monkeys is they they train a monkey for
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.569
monkeys is they they train a monkey for
a year or two and then they perform

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579
a year or two and then they perform
 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.340
a year or two and then they perform
experiments on that monkey for many

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
experiments on that monkey for many
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.840
experiments on that monkey for many
years because monkeys are incredibly

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
years because monkeys are incredibly
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.179
years because monkeys are incredibly
valuable so the kinds of information

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189
valuable so the kinds of information
 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.800
valuable so the kinds of information
that you can get out from a monkey is

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
that you can get out from a monkey is
 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.679
that you can get out from a monkey is
really useful but you can't really do a

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689
really useful but you can't really do a
 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.010
really useful but you can't really do a
lot of experimental manipulations the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020
lot of experimental manipulations the
 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.230
lot of experimental manipulations the
way you can in other kinds of

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240
way you can in other kinds of
 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.359
way you can in other kinds of
preparations so with rodents what we do

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
preparations so with rodents what we do
 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.240
preparations so with rodents what we do
is we focus on tasks that we can train

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250
is we focus on tasks that we can train
 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.630
is we focus on tasks that we can train
the rats and mice to perform our

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
the rats and mice to perform our
 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.410
the rats and mice to perform our
training time is

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
training time is
 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.300
training time is
typically a few weeks and then what we

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
typically a few weeks and then what we
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880
typically a few weeks and then what we
can do is explore what happens in their

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
can do is explore what happens in their
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.059
can do is explore what happens in their
brain after they've learned to perform

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069
brain after they've learned to perform
 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.030
brain after they've learned to perform
an attention task on top of that what we

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
an attention task on top of that what we
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.150
an attention task on top of that what we
can do is we can manipulate the neural

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160
can do is we can manipulate the neural
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.229
can do is we can manipulate the neural
activity within a rodents brain at a

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239
activity within a rodents brain at a
 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.070
activity within a rodents brain at a
level of precision that at this point we

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080
level of precision that at this point we
 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.250
level of precision that at this point we
really can't achieve in a monkey and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
really can't achieve in a monkey and
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.050
really can't achieve in a monkey and
certainly not in a human with a human we

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
certainly not in a human with a human we
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.830
certainly not in a human with a human we
study groups neural activity in patches

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840
study groups neural activity in patches
 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.530
study groups neural activity in patches
that are you know consist of hundreds of

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
that are you know consist of hundreds of
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.410
that are you know consist of hundreds of
thousands of neurons in monkeys we can

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
thousands of neurons in monkeys we can
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.960
thousands of neurons in monkeys we can
study single neurons at a time but we

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
study single neurons at a time but we
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.970
study single neurons at a time but we
can't really manipulate whole parts of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
can't really manipulate whole parts of
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.340
can't really manipulate whole parts of
the circuit and in rodents we can

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350
the circuit and in rodents we can
 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.400
the circuit and in rodents we can
actually now target subsets of neurons

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410
actually now target subsets of neurons
 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.130
actually now target subsets of neurons
based on how they're wired up and so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140
based on how they're wired up and so
 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.890
based on how they're wired up and so
that's what we're able to do now in in

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900
that's what we're able to do now in in
 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.710
that's what we're able to do now in in
the rodent preparation we've designed a

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720
the rodent preparation we've designed a
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.990
the rodent preparation we've designed a
special behavioral box so that we can

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000
special behavioral box so that we can
 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.280
special behavioral box so that we can
actually train runs to perform

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
actually train runs to perform
 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.309
actually train runs to perform
attentional tasks in parallel the whole

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319
attentional tasks in parallel the whole
 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.840
attentional tasks in parallel the whole
thing is computer controlled the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850
thing is computer controlled the
 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.270
thing is computer controlled the
starting point for all these tasks is a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
starting point for all these tasks is a
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.250
starting point for all these tasks is a
rat that's been trained to stick its

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260
rat that's been trained to stick its
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.099
rat that's been trained to stick its
nose into the center port of a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109
nose into the center port of a
 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.140
nose into the center port of a
three-port box so what you see is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150
three-port box so what you see is
 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.930
three-port box so what you see is
looking down on a box the rat sticks its

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940
looking down on a box the rat sticks its
 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.120
looking down on a box the rat sticks its
nose into the center port that breaks an

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
nose into the center port that breaks an
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.390
nose into the center port that breaks an
LED beam that signals to a computer that

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400
LED beam that signals to a computer that
 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.460
LED beam that signals to a computer that
ah the rat has entered the center port

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470
ah the rat has entered the center port
 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.580
ah the rat has entered the center port
and now we can program the computer to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590
and now we can program the computer to
 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.560
and now we can program the computer to
deliver whatever kind of stimuli we want

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570
deliver whatever kind of stimuli we want
 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.150
deliver whatever kind of stimuli we want
auditory in fact one of my colleagues

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160
auditory in fact one of my colleagues
 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.759
auditory in fact one of my colleagues
uses it to present olfactory stimuli

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769
uses it to present olfactory stimuli
 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.099
uses it to present olfactory stimuli
visual stimuli but in our case it's

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109
visual stimuli but in our case it's
 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.720
visual stimuli but in our case it's
auditory stimuli the rat breaks the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730
auditory stimuli the rat breaks the
 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.720
auditory stimuli the rat breaks the
center beam in this example what you see

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730
center beam in this example what you see
 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.000
center beam in this example what you see
is that that triggers the computer to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010
is that that triggers the computer to
 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.580
is that that triggers the computer to
present either a low-frequency sound or

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590
present either a low-frequency sound or
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.910
present either a low-frequency sound or
a high-frequency sound when it presents

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920
a high-frequency sound when it presents
 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.099
a high-frequency sound when it presents
a low-frequency sound the rat goes to

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109
a low-frequency sound the rat goes to
 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.020
a low-frequency sound the rat goes to
one of the ports and then he gets a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030
one of the ports and then he gets a
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.110
one of the ports and then he gets a
reward of a small amount of water if he

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120
reward of a small amount of water if he
 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.120
reward of a small amount of water if he
breaks the beam and it's the other sound

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130
breaks the beam and it's the other sound
 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.410
breaks the beam and it's the other sound
that's presented he goes to the other

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420
that's presented he goes to the other
 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.099
that's presented he goes to the other
port and gets his reward and as you can

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109
port and gets his reward and as you can
 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.110
port and gets his reward and as you can
see the rat really understands what he's

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120
see the rat really understands what he's
 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.729
see the rat really understands what he's
supposed to do he sticks his nose in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
supposed to do he sticks his nose in
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.860
supposed to do he sticks his nose in
goes in one way sticks his nose in goes

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870
goes in one way sticks his nose in goes
 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.740
goes in one way sticks his nose in goes
the other way he's going as fast as he

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750
the other way he's going as fast as he
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.279
the other way he's going as fast as he
can to pick up his rewards now when you

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289
can to pick up his rewards now when you
 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.270
can to pick up his rewards now when you
actually what you actually hear

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280
actually what you actually hear
 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.640
actually what you actually hear
on this video is that the low frequency

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
on this video is that the low frequency
 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.440
on this video is that the low frequency
and high frequency sounds are both

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450
and high frequency sounds are both
 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.379
and high frequency sounds are both
masked by some white noise that's to

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389
masked by some white noise that's to
 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.480
masked by some white noise that's to
make it more challenging for the rat and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490
make it more challenging for the rat and
 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.909
make it more challenging for the rat and
the the other thing is that the hearing

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919
the the other thing is that the hearing
 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.920
the the other thing is that the hearing
range of a rat is shifted from the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930
range of a rat is shifted from the
 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.110
range of a rat is shifted from the
hearing range of a human so humans rain

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120
hearing range of a human so humans rain
 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.860
hearing range of a human so humans rain
here from about 20 Hertz to about 20

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870
here from about 20 Hertz to about 20
 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.920
here from about 20 Hertz to about 20
kilohertz rats here from about 1

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930
kilohertz rats here from about 1
 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.070
kilohertz rats here from about 1
kilohertz to the ultrasonic what is for

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080
kilohertz to the ultrasonic what is for
 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.950
kilohertz to the ultrasonic what is for
us ultrasonic 70 kilohertz so the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960
us ultrasonic 70 kilohertz so the
 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.080
us ultrasonic 70 kilohertz so the
low-frequency sound for the rat is

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090
low-frequency sound for the rat is
 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.370
low-frequency sound for the rat is
something that's sort of on the upper

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380
something that's sort of on the upper
 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.100
something that's sort of on the upper
end of what we hear a few kilohertz I

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110
end of what we hear a few kilohertz I
 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.800
end of what we hear a few kilohertz I
think it's 5 kilohertz and the high

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810
think it's 5 kilohertz and the high
 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.659
think it's 5 kilohertz and the high
frequency sound in this case is beyond

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669
frequency sound in this case is beyond
 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.880
frequency sound in this case is beyond
what we can actually hear and so what

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890
what we can actually hear and so what
 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.550
what we can actually hear and so what
you actually hear is either white noise

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560
you actually hear is either white noise
 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.670
you actually hear is either white noise
alone or white noise plus a low

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680
alone or white noise plus a low
 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.909
alone or white noise plus a low
frequency sound oh and that's what you

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919
frequency sound oh and that's what you
 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.190
frequency sound oh and that's what you
see so how do we use this to study

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200
see so how do we use this to study
 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.040
see so how do we use this to study
attention so this is the starting point

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050
attention so this is the starting point
 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.930
attention so this is the starting point
for all our tests this just demonstrates

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940
for all our tests this just demonstrates
 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.140
for all our tests this just demonstrates
that the rat can take sound stimuli and

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150
that the rat can take sound stimuli and
 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.200
that the rat can take sound stimuli and
use it to guide his behavior left and

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210
use it to guide his behavior left and
 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.360
use it to guide his behavior left and
right we have more complicated tasks

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370
right we have more complicated tasks
 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.600
right we have more complicated tasks
where what we do is we have the rat

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610
where what we do is we have the rat
 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.810
where what we do is we have the rat
attend to a particular aspect of the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820
attend to a particular aspect of the
 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.210
attend to a particular aspect of the
sound stimulus so one of the studies

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220
sound stimulus so one of the studies
 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.870
sound stimulus so one of the studies
that we've done recently is the ability

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880
that we've done recently is the ability
 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.029
that we've done recently is the ability
of a rat to focus in on particular

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039
of a rat to focus in on particular
 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.050
of a rat to focus in on particular
moments in time in other words we we

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
moments in time in other words we we
 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.690
moments in time in other words we we
train the rat to guide his temporal

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700
train the rat to guide his temporal
 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.060
train the rat to guide his temporal
expectation as to when a target occurs

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070
expectation as to when a target occurs
 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.140
expectation as to when a target occurs
so in the other example what you see is

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150
so in the other example what you see is
 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.060
so in the other example what you see is
that the rat sticks his nose in and he's

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070
that the rat sticks his nose in and he's
 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.580
that the rat sticks his nose in and he's
presented with a series of distractor

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590
presented with a series of distractor
 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.279
presented with a series of distractor
tones baby pppp pppp and then he goes

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289
tones baby pppp pppp and then he goes
 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.860
tones baby pppp pppp and then he goes
either left or right based on whether a

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870
either left or right based on whether a
 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.620
either left or right based on whether a
target sound which is a warble verb is

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630
target sound which is a warble verb is
 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.290
target sound which is a warble verb is
either high frequency or low frequency

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300
either high frequency or low frequency
 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.800
either high frequency or low frequency
or and what makes it an attentional task

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810
or and what makes it an attentional task
 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.480
or and what makes it an attentional task
is that we've trained the rat to expect

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490
is that we've trained the rat to expect
 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.140
is that we've trained the rat to expect
the target to be either early in the

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150
the target to be either early in the
 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.360
the target to be either early in the
trial after one or two of the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370
trial after one or two of the
 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.580
trial after one or two of the
distractors or late in the trial after

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590
distractors or late in the trial after
 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.040
distractors or late in the trial after
about 10 or 15 of the distractor

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050
about 10 or 15 of the distractor
 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.140
about 10 or 15 of the distractor
that is after about a second second and

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150
that is after about a second second and
 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.960
that is after about a second second and
a half in the center port and in that

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970
a half in the center port and in that
 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.290
a half in the center port and in that
way we can guide the moment at which he

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300
way we can guide the moment at which he
 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.409
way we can guide the moment at which he
expects the target to occur and the idea

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419
expects the target to occur and the idea
 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.950
expects the target to occur and the idea
is that he kind of ramps up his

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960
is that he kind of ramps up his
 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.129
is that he kind of ramps up his
attention for the the target sound and

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:02.139
attention for the the target sound and
 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.740
attention for the the target sound and
what we found is that when he ramps up

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750
what we found is that when he ramps up
 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.909
what we found is that when he ramps up
his attention in this way is the speed

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919
his attention in this way is the speed
 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.999
his attention in this way is the speed
with which he responds to the target is

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009
with which he responds to the target is
 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.020
with which he responds to the target is
faster than if the target comes

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030
faster than if the target comes
 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.360
faster than if the target comes
unexpectedly and that's something that

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370
unexpectedly and that's something that
 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.390
unexpectedly and that's something that
we find in humans as well so that's what

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400
we find in humans as well so that's what
 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.100
we find in humans as well so that's what
I'm in fact the hallmarks of attention

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110
I'm in fact the hallmarks of attention
 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.999
I'm in fact the hallmarks of attention
is an improvement in performance as

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009
is an improvement in performance as
 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.999
is an improvement in performance as
measured either by his speed or accuracy

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009
measured either by his speed or accuracy
 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.890
measured either by his speed or accuracy
and the other thing we found is that

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:28.900
and the other thing we found is that
 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.249
and the other thing we found is that
there are neurons in the auditory cortex

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259
there are neurons in the auditory cortex
 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:35.270
there are neurons in the auditory cortex
whose activity is specially enhanced

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280
whose activity is specially enhanced
 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.399
whose activity is specially enhanced
when he expects the target compared with

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:38.409
when he expects the target compared with
 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.890
when he expects the target compared with
when that same target is presented but

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900
when that same target is presented but
 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.040
when that same target is presented but
it comes in an unexpected moment so we

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.050
it comes in an unexpected moment so we
 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.790
it comes in an unexpected moment so we
think that that is beginning to be the

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800
think that that is beginning to be the
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.480
think that that is beginning to be the
neural correlates of the enhanced

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490
neural correlates of the enhanced
 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.740
neural correlates of the enhanced
performance that we've seen
