00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.340
To start off, I created variables for article two and article three.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.110
Article two got set equal to this jQuery selector for the class featured, and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.480
then I set article three to the next sibling of article two.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.890
Then, all I did was toggle the class of featured on article two and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.190
article three.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.920
I hit Test Run.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.970
And, let's see how it looks.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.451
We can see that now article three has a blue background while article two

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:26.980
does not.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.090
Looks like it worked.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.140
This shows that toggleClass will either add or

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.200
remove a class depending on whether or not it's already there.
