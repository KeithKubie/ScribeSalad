My name is Tom Crampton. I'm based out of
Hong Kong. I run social media strategy for

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:11.223
Ogilvy and I'm a blogger. And the question
of whether the political problems or the economical

00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:15.440
problems are going to be the biggest ones
going ahead. I have to say that I hope it

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.840
is economic problems. If the political problems
are the biggest problems facing East Asia,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.351
these problems are so dangerous and detractable,
that I hate to think what they will be. And

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:35.000
I think what we see right now in the state
of the economic crisis, we might be seeing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.739
the green shoots of recovery. But it's certainly
nothing on the scale as what would happen

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.200
it we were to have an outbreak of conflict
on the Korean peninsula or any of the other

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.210
major security issues or problem in Scratnese
which would have not just a consequence among

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.570
a couple of countries but of a global importance.
So I hope that there are no economic, fewer

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.180
economic and fewer political problems, but
I think that the danger is if they are political

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.570
ones.
