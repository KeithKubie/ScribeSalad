00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
In the words of Daddy Yankee,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.100
Reggaeton is street,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.300
reggaeton is sex,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.220
reggaeton is the struggle.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.420
And reggaeton is everywhere.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.120
Most of the names that are associated with reggaeton are male.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.640
Think J. Balvin, Daddy Yankee, Gente de Zona, Zion y Lennox, Bad Bunny.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.320
I think that women have been pretty underrepresented in reggaeton.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.520
I think it's also important to understand that reggaeton does not operate in a vacuum.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.700
But women – like Ivy Queen, Lisa M., Glory, DJ Bembona, DJ Riobamba, Tomasa del Real –

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.140
have been a part of the scene and are among those trying to change it, and its image.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.080
And it's always been a boys’ club, and it still is. But I feel like, with that one woman that’s breaking through,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.000
to pull in other women to be like, this could be – we can all be queens, we can all share that space.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.880
Hey guys, it’s Sana, and this week we’re gonna talk a bit

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.380
about what it means to be a woman in the reggaeton scene and how that’s changing.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.620
In a recent episode, we looked at the roots of reggaeton – talking to pioneers, scholars and innovators

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.940
about how one of the most popular music genres has evolved over the last 35 years.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.360
Reggaeton went from being a musical expression from the caseríos of Puerto Rico,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.860
with Jamaican and Panamanian roots, to now having its base rhythm, known as dembow,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.480
being used in songs that have blown up on the charts.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.880
But despite its success, reggaeton has a reputation for being really macho and hypersexualizing women.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.120
Women are usually presented in music videos and on album covers as scantily clad models, often faceless.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.800
When they’re singing, they’re usually voices in the background exclaiming sexualized phrases like “ay papi”

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.180
or offering sexualized hooks for the songs, like Glory in Don Omar’s classic hit “Dale Don Dale”:

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.980
There are a lot of songs and certainly a lot of videos, you know, portraying

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.560
women essentially as sex objects for the stars of the genre.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.140
That’s music historian Wayne Marshall, and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.300
he says that the hypersexualization of women isn’t just a problem in reggaeton.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:33.180
Now, that's not terribly exceptional in the world of popular music. So without excusing it, I will just point out

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.840
that those same depictions can be found in rap videos and rock videos and salsa videos

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.840
and Latin pop videos and just, you know, you name it.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.540
While Marshall’s right that the hypersexualization of women in reggaeton isn’t unique to the genre,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.040
reggaeton has been targeted.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.240
In the ’90s and early 2000s, the Puerto Rican government targeted reggaeton. And in 2002,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.060
it led an anti-pornography campaign that focused largely on reggaeton music videos.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.460
In addition to Puerto Rico being a pretty religious society, DJ Riobamba points out that it’s hard to ignore

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.440
the role that race and class have played in condemning reggaeton as obscene or pornographic music.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.280
I think that racism gets coded as classism in Latin America and in Latin diaspora communities, and so

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.560
when I've heard reggaeton be stigmatized in the past, it’s like, oh no, that's like "hood music,"

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.260
or that’s like low class or whatever. And it's like, c’mon, like what are we really getting at here?

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.920
And the roots of reggaeton are in black communities.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.700
But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t problems in reggaeton’s depictions of women,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.500
as Petra Rideau-Rivera, who focuses on race and pop culture, points out.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.740
I think, at the same time that some artists or some songs might be contesting racism,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.320
they can also reproduce the objectification of women.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.360
We have to acknowledge the kind of positive aspects of the music, the ways that it has provided a space

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.180
to talk about some forms of inequality, but also the ways that it has reproduced other forms of inequality.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.080
But those depictions shouldn’t erase the role of women in reggaeton’s history and evolution.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.860
Recently, now there's been a whole movement of feminine energy that's coming in, too.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.200
And it's always been around, we've had people like beyond Ivy Queen that's been legends, that's been killing the game.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.500
Take, for example, women like La Atrevida, Ivy Queen, Lisa M., Glory, Jenny La Sexy Voz.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.380
La Atrevida was a Panamanian reggae-en-Español artist, known also as “Rude Girl,”

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.360
considered a pioneer for women in the sound that would later develop as reggaeton.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.280
Both Glory and Jenny La Sexy Voz, while reggaeton artists in their own right,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.360
provided the vocals for some of the most well-known reggaeton hooks.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.400
Despite that, they both not only had a difficult time breaking into the mainstream,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.520
but sometimes didn’t even get credit for their work.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.700
Then there’s Lisa M., who has been referred to as “La Pionera,” or the Pioneer,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.200
for her role in developing and raising the platform Latin rap.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.560
She’s considered one of the first female Latin rappers.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.740
Then there’s the only reggaeton artist to reach the success of her male counterparts,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.860
in the early 2000s: Ivy Queen.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.920
 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.140
Ivy Queen joined Puerto Rican reggaeton collective the Noise in 1995

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.480
and quickly became a force to be reckoned with.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.720
She went on to to have a successful solo career,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.940
known for turning the machismo reggaeton was known for on its head.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.780
She's a very talented artist who has had a very long career that has

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.200
spanned almost the entire history of reggaeton. And I think a lot of that has to do with her talent as a rapper

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.180
and her ability to continuously create this innovative musical style.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.060
And in a May 2018 interview with Remezcla, Ivy Queen characterized her legacy as

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.580
“talking about empowerment” when reggaeton was talking about women and their butts.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.220
And it was her 2003 hit “Quiero Bailar” that became an empowerment anthem for talking about sexual consent.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.840
In fact, the entire basis of the song is about a guy expecting sex from a woman after a night of dancing

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.180
– and how that’s just not how it works, buddy.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.240
That song would go on to become an integral part of the mainstreaming of reggaeton in the early 2000s.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.240
But both DJ Riobama and DJ Bembona, who are New York-based Latinx DJs

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.960
and the first to play reggaeton in New York’s renowned Boiler Room club,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.380
point out how traditionally only one woman’s been allowed a space in the mainstream reggaeton scene,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.380
others just relegated to hooks.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.380
Ivy Queen, right? Queen is singular. Because there was one woman who was allowed to have that place.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.860
You know? Or like, there were the hooks on the tracks with like Glory or Jenny La Sexy Voz, where like you hear

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.100
a little snippet. But it was always like a really marginalized place.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.720
But this is changing with more women coming into the reggaeton scene.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.120
An example of a woman making waves recently – and controversially

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.300
– is Chilean neo-perreo artist Tomasa del Real.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.220
 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.840
Tomasa del Real is a tattoo-artist-turned-reggaeton-performer, known for her sexually graphic lyrics

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.560
And because of her centering of women’s sexuality in her music,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.480
she’s been heralded as taking reggaeton into its next phase – one led by women.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.400
The sexual nature of the music and like the way that women are talked about. Like, I play those tracks

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.280
because I'm going to stand in front of it and be like I'm not supposed to be here,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.940
I'm not supposed to take up this space, but like I'm going to reclaim that space, in the club,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.680
in a way that this was never intended to be.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.140
While there’s still a lot of debate on exactly what sexual agency and empowerment looks like

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.060
in the reggaeton scene, Marshall points out that it’s important to treat the genre like any other genre.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.780
Reggaeton deserves as much of a chance – and as much a sort of sense of scrutiny

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.000
and kind of getting a sense of what you like there and what you don't – as any.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.140
So with reggaeton back in the mainstream, the genre is ripe for having its direction changed

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.680
– especially by women.
