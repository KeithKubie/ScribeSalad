00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.790
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I'm Cat Allman and it
is my very great pleasure today to welcome

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.290
Kim Stanley Robinson to talk to us about his
new book.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.020
Little product placement here.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.210
It's 2312 and he told me as he was coming
in that he was on the New York Times Bestseller

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.210
list.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.849
It is no surprise.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.700
Mr. Robinson has received many awards including
multiple Hugos, Nebulas, and others for his

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.180
fiction, nonfiction and poetry.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.510
And many of you may be familiar with his Mars
trilogy series.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.320
I know at least one person in this room is
particularly fond of The Years of Salt and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.039
Rice, or excuse me, Rice and Salt.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.600
And I'm getting completely tongue tied 'cause
I've got a little bit of fan girl thing going

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
on.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600
[laughter]

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.630
So with no further ado I'm going to turn this
over to Kim Stanley Robinson.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.310
[applause]

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.550
&gt;&gt;Kim: Thank you Cat.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.850
Thank you all.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.820
Really good to be back at Google again.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.979
And it is true I am going to read to you some
scenes from my novel 2312.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.090
An in honor of being at Google I'm going to
read the, some of the scenes that involve

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.490
the quantum computer artificial intelligence.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.600
Although I don't like that term.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.351
But in any case, one of the [clears throat]
characters we'll be spending most of the time

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:48.060
here with is a speaking quantum computer from
the year 2312.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.560
[ice rattles]

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.159
But first a little backdrop to give context
to this.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.840
And the book has passages similar to those
that you see in John Dos Passos's USA trilogy.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.670
Which was also the format for John Brenner's
Stand On Zanzibar, for science fiction fans.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.980
It's a collage of different types of writing
that include newspaper headlines.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.690
Stream of consciousness passages.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.370
Prose poems about famous people or places.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.920
So I've imitated that form in order to give
people a sense of the entire solar system

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.900
civilization without having to have my characters
go to every single place.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.440
Although they kinda do anyway.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.950
But I'm gonna read you extracts number two
just to get you oriented.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.640
And then we'll get back to quantum computing.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.819
"To simplify history would be to distort reality.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.180
So we have only distortions.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.599
By the early 21st century there was too much
going on to be either seen or understood.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.220
Assiduous attempts by contemporary historians
to achieve an agreed upon paradigm foundered.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.470
And we are no different now looking back at
them.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.940
It's hard even to assemble enough data to
make a guess.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.959
There were thousands of city-states out there
pinballing around.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.599
Each with its presence in the data cloud or
absence from same.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.970
And all of them adding up to what?

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.060
To the same mish-mash history has been all
along.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.870
But now elaborated.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.870
Mathematicized.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.870
Effloresced.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.800
In the word of the time, Balkanized.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.970
No description can be [ringing bell] instability
nodes.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.650
When many pressured stresses rupture at once.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.650
In this case.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.650
The withdrawal of Mars from the Mondragon
accord.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.680
It's counter imperial campaign on earth.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.879
And the return of the Jovian moons to the
larger interplanetary scene.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.989
As the first settlements beyond Mars, the
Jovians were hampered by path-dependency on

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.379
earlier less powerful settlement technology.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.990
Also the discovery of life inside Ganymede
and Europa.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.019
As well as Jupiter's intense radiation.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.019
Later more powerful settlement strategies
and terraforming efforts on Venus and Titan

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:04.110
caused the Jovian's to reevaluate their stations,
domes and tented Luxembourgs as inadequate.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.939
Even with Io permanently off limits, the three
other Galilean moons constituted together

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.840
an enormous potential surface area and it
was the resolution of their inner conflicts

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.750
and their common commitment to full terraformation
that threw the volatiles markets into disarray

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.970
and triggered the non-linear breaks of the
following [ringing bell].

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.270
"They were now their own unavoidable experiment.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.630
And were making themselves into many things
they had never been before.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.630
Augmented.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.639
Multi-sexed, and most importantly very long-lived.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.360
The oldest at that point being around 200
years old.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.110
But not one whit wiser or even more intelligent.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.590
Sad but true, individual intelligence probably
peaked in the upper Paleolithic and we have

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.880
been self-domesticated creatures ever since.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.460
Dogs, when we had been wolves.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.389
But also, despite that individual diminution,
finding ways to accumulate knowledge and power.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.710
Compiling records.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.770
Also techniques.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.770
Practices.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.770
Sciences.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.290
[ringing bell]

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.530
"Possibly therefore smarter as a species than
as individuals.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.580
But prone to insanity either way.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.750
And in any case stuck in the moment.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.680
A moment now lost to us when people lived
in the almost forgotten technology and culture

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.400
of the Balkanization.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.100
The years just before 2312.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.139
[ringing bell] Except wait: that is yet to
tell."

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.960
So, I'm gonna go right from there to another
set of extracts.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.350
And this is Extracts Number Nine.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.460
And this is the one that is sort of setting
the stage for our quantum computer people.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.600
Or I shouldn't say people.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.699
"Extract Nine: One question for computability
is the problem capable of producing a result.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.270
[ringing bell] If a finite number of steps
will produce an answer it is a problem that

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.580
can be solved by a Turing machine.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.270
[ringing bell] Is the universe itself the
equivalent of a Turing machine?

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.280
This is not yet [ringing bell].

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.870
Turing machines can't always tell when the
results, the result has been obtained.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.819
No oracle machine is capable of solving its
own haunting problem.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:25.680
[ringing bell] [audio momentarily cuts out]
--that are also solvable by classical computers.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.840
Making use of quantum mechanical phenomena
only increases speed of operation.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.040
[ringing bell]

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.599
"Decoherance happens at the loss of superposition
and the resulting either or.

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.810
Before that, a quantum calculation performs
in parallel every possible value that the

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.810
register can represent.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.280
[ringing bell] Using superposition for computation
requires avoiding decoherence for as long

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280
as possible.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.699
This has proved difficult.

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.080
And is still the limiting factor in the size
and power of a quantum computer.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.030
Various physical and chemical means for building
and connecting cubits have increased the number

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.040
of cubits possible to collect before decoherence
collapses the calculation.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040
But.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.210
[ringing bell] Quantum computers are restricted
to calculations that can be performed faster

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.980
than decoherence occurs in the superposed
way of functions.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.960
For over a century this restricted time for
a quantum computing operation to less than

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.389
ten seconds.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:20.920
[ringing bell]

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.040
"Cubes are room temperature quantum computers
with 30 cubits.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.569
The decoherence boundary limit for circuit
connected cubits combined with a pedoflop

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:34.080
speed classical computer to stabilize operations
and provide a database.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.430
The most powerful cubes are theoretically
capable of calculating the movements of all

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.800
the atoms in the sun and its solar system.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.020
Out to the edge of the solar wind.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.610
[ringing bell] Cubes are only faster than
classical computers when they can exploit

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.330
quantum parallelism.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
At multiplication they are no faster.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.349
But in factoring there is a difference.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:59.500
To factor a thousand digit number would take
a classical computer ten million billion billion

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.600
years.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.970
Using Shor's algorithm, a cube takes around
20 minutes.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.850
[ringing bell] Grover's algorithm means that
a year long search using a classical computer

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:15.289
in a random walk of a billion searches a second
would take a cube and its quantum walk 185

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:16.289
searches.

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:22.710
[ringing bell] Shor's algorithm, Grover's
algorithm, Perelman's algorithm, Sikorski's

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.569
algorithm, Ngyuen's algorithm, Wang's algorithm,
Wang's other algorithm, the Cambridge algorithm,

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:31.449
the Livermore algorithm.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:37.460
[ringing bell] Entanglement is also susceptible
to decoherence.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.580
Physical linkage of quantum circuits is necessary
to forestall decoherence to useful time frames.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.490
Premature or undesired decoherence sets a
limit on how powerful cubes can become.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.370
But the limit is high.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.370
[ringing bell]

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.420
"It has proved easier to manipulate superposition
than entanglement for computing purposes.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.920
And therein lies the explanation of many [ringing
bell].

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.530
The quantum database is effectively distributed
over a multitude of universes.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:11.010
[ringing bell] The two polarized particles
decoher simultaneously no matter the physical

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.830
distance between them.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.450
Meaning, the information jump can exceed the
speed of light.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.290
The effect was confirmed by experiment in
the late 20th century.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.040
Any device that uses this phenomenon to communicate
messages is called an ansible.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.940
And these devices have been constructed that
undesired decoherances meant the maximum distance

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.030
between ansibles has been nine centimeters.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.970
And this only when both were cooled to one
millionth of a K above absolute zero.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.350
Physical limitation strongly suggests further
progress will be asymptotic at best.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.990
[ringing bell]

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.760
"Powerful but isolated and discrete.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.130
Somewhat like brains.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.690
[ringing bell] Questions of Penrose quantum
effects in the brain have been effectively

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.470
rendered moot as these also occur in cubes
by definition.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:02.400
If both structures are quantum computers and
one of them, we are quite certain, has consciousness,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.310
who is to say what's going on in the other?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.110
[ringing bell] Human brain operations have
a maximum theoretical speed of ten to the

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.160
16th operations per second.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.500
[ringing bell] Computers have become billions
to trillions times faster than the human brain.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.820
So it comes down to programming.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.790
What are the operations actually doing? [ringing
bell]

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.000
"Hierarchical levels of thought.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.070
Generalization.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.130
Mood.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.200
Affect.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.260
Will.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.310
[ringing bell] Super recursive algorithms.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.530
Hypercomputation.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.750
Supertasks.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.640
Trial and error predicates.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.030
Inductive inference machines.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.810
Evolutionary computers.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.590
Fuzzy computation.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.390
Trans recursive operators.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:53.470
[ringing bell] If you program a purpose into
a computer program, does that constitute its

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.830
will?

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.950
Does it have free will if a programmer programmed
its purpose?

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.810
Is that program any different from the way
we are programmed by our genes and brains?

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.100
Is a programmed will a servile will?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.680
Is human will a servile will?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.570
And is not the servile will the home and source
of all feelings of defilement, infection,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.380
transgression, and rage?

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.860
[ringing bell]

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.370
"Could a quantum computer program itself?"

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.560

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.650
[ice clinking]

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:37.080
So, I want to, before I get into the conversation
between Swan and her AI, Pauline, I wanna

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.000
read you one of the lists.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.120
The book has about 17 lists.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.860
They're just lists and then you have to figure
out what they're lists of as part of the game

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.390
of the novel.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.470
And I've always loved lists.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.110
But this kind of formalizes it.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.420
And puts a stamp on it.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.400
Because like here, I'll read you List Number
Seven.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:06.800
"Inadvertent fracking, failed seal, bad lock,
bad luck, hyperboric spark fire, carbon monoxide

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:15.050
buildup, carbon dioxide buildup, design flaw,
engine housing crack, sudden air loss, solar

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:24.810
flare, fuel impurity, metal fatigue, mental
fatigue, lightning strike, meteorite strike,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:33.920
accidental critical mass, brake failure, dropped
tool, tripped and fell, coolant loss, manufacturing

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:44.120
flaw, programming error, human error, containment
failure, battery fire, distraction, AI malfeasance,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:52.980
sabotage, bad decision, crossed wires, recreational
mental impairment, cosmic ray impact."

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.600
Actually, that's the only list that has an
identity at the bottom.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.820
It says "From the Journal of Space Accidents,
volume 297, Year 2308."

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.670
Space will be a dangerous place.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.820
So many things can go wrong in so many ways.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:20.160
So, the book has normal novel included with
all this other stuff.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:28.220
And it's basically a love story between a
mercurial personality and a saturnine personality.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.390
And the mercurial person comes from Mercury
and the saturnine person comes from Saturn

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.390
which is my joke.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:38.000
And the reason we have to go out to 2312 to
get people out there to make it all work.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.910
And if you know anything about the mercurial
and saturnine personalities out of astrology

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:48.430
or whatever that system is then you know that
would be, is in fact a very odd couple.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.300
But my working theory is that all couples
are odd couples.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.700
And so this is just an extreme version of
a truth that all of us recognize in our own

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.700
life.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.700
One way or another.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.200
So Swan, the mercurial character, has been
a fashionable person.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.140
And is about 130 at this point but is still
filled with enthusiasm for life and also filled

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.240
with stuff in her brain from various moments
of fashion in the previous decades.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.860
Some of which stayed on, and some of which
were just decade long enthusiasms that went

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.800
away and subsequent people are amazed that
anybody ever did that.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.190
Sort of like now.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.710
And so she's got some skylark cells in her
brain.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.050
And whistles very well.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:35.060
And has more brain intrusions than I want
to describe right now.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.660
But one of them is a working cube that she
names Pauline.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.180
So this is a quantum computer.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:48.280
And as you can see, the questions come up
about what kind of respondent Swan has.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:55.730
And it's basically in her skull, behind her
ear, but has a voice box down near one collar

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.730
bone.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.280
So when Swan is talking to Pauline she's,
in many ways, since she's also the programmer,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.820
at least the one sticking apps into Pauline
or whatever, you can say that in a way she's

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.250
almost talking to herself.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.310
But she's not.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.590
So I wanna do a conversation between Swan
and Pauline that will take up the rest of

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.590
the reading.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.480
Maybe, might take ten minutes.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.940
And the chapter is called "Pauline on Revolution."

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.920
"Swan hooked her elbows over the rail to get
some stability in the low G. She put her chin

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.160
in her crossed hands and still regarding the
scene said, 'Pauline, tell me about revolution.'

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.550
'At what length?'

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.630
'Go on for a short while.'

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.770
'Revolution.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.410
From the Latin revolutio.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.930
A turn around.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.910
Refers often to a quick change in political
power.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.310
Frequently achieved by violent means.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.690
Connotation of a successful class based revolt
from below.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.410
'Causes?'

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.390
'Causes for revolution are attributed sometimes
to psychological factors.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.720
Like unhappiness and frustration.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.700
Sometimes to sociological factors.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.350
Especially a systemic standing inequity and
distribution of physical and cultural goods.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:09.760
Or to biological factors in that groups will
fight over allocation of limited necessities.'

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.760
'Aren't these different aspects of the same
thing?'

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.780
Swan said.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.910
'It is a multidisciplinary field.'

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.250
'Give me some examples.'

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.250
Swan said.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.660
'Name the most famous.'

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.720
'The English civil war.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.950
The American Revolution.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.130
The French revolution.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.540
The Haitian revolution.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.170
The Taiping Rebellion.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.580
The Russian revolution.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.970
The Cuban revolution.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.580
The Iranian revolution.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.230
The Martian revolution.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.990
The revolt of the Saturn League.'

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.180
'Stop.'

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.380
Swan said.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.920
'Tell me why they happen.'

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.190
'Studies have failed to explain why they happen.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.420
There are no historical laws.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.560
Rapid shifts of political power have occurred
without violence.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:52.670
Suggesting that revolution, reform, and repression
are all descriptors too broad in definition

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.740
to aid in causal analyses.'

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.740
'Come on.'

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.740
Swan objected.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.800
'Don't be chicken.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.940
Someone has to have said something you can
quote.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.500
Or even try thinking for yourself.'

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.789
'That is hard given your insufficient programming.

00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:10.490
You sound like you're interested in what some
have called the Great Revolutions because

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:16.160
of their major transformations of economic
power, social structures and political changes.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.910
Especially constitutional changes.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:23.250
Or perhaps you are interested in social revolutions
revering to massive changes in a society's

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.600
worldview and technology.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.040
Thus for instance, the upper Paleolithic revolution.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.940
The scientific revolution.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.790
The industrial revolution.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.480
The sexual revolution.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.470
The biotech revolution.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.690
The accelerando as a confluence of revolutions.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.380
The space diaspora.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.760
The gender revolution.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.650
The longevity revolution.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.280
And so on.'

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.530
'Indeed.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.300
What about success?

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.850
Can you list necessary and sufficient conditions
for a revolution to succeed?'

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.850
'Historical events are too overdetermined
to describe in the causal terminology from

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.880
logic that you enter into when you use the
phrase 'necessary and sufficient.''

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.510
'But try.'

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.740
'Historians speak of critical masses of popular
frustration.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.800
Weakening central authority.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.290
Loss of hegemony.'

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.760
'Meaning what?'

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.800
'Hegemony means one group dominating others
without exerting sheer force.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.150
Something more like a paradigm that creates
unnoticed consent to a hierarchy of power.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:29.070
If the paradigm comes to be questioned, especially
in situations of material want, loss of hegemony

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:35.350
can occur nonlinearly starting revolutions
so rapid there is no time for more than symbolic

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.350
violence.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.510
As in the 1989 Velvet, Quiet, Silk, and Singing
Revolutions.'

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.760
'There was a singing revolution?'

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.040
'The Baltic states, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania
called their 1989 withdrawal from the Soviet

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.360
Union the Singing Revolutions.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.490
Referring to the behavior of the demonstrators
in the city plazas.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.110
That brings up a point.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.450
People in physical masses seem to matter.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.370
If enough of the population takes to the streets
in mass demonstrations, governments have no

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.370
good defense.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.900
Quote: They must dismiss the people and elect
another one.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.490
Bertolt Brecht.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.630
That being impossible, they often fall.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.850
Or a civil war begins.'

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.970
'Surely the literature on revolutions can't
be this superficial.'

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.970
Swan said.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.030
'You're just quoting random stuff.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.472
You have a mind like the rings of Saturn.

00:19:23.472 --> 00:19:27.320
A million miles wide and an inch deep.'

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.460
'Catachresis and antiquated measurement units
indicate irony or sarcasm.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.060
Coming from you probably sarcasm.'

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.430
'She said sarcastically.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.490
You search engine, you.'

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.270
'A quantum walk is a random walk by definition.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.670
Please upgrade my program anytime you feel
you can.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.670
I heard Wang's other algorithm is good.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.020
Some principles of generalization would be
useful.'

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.280
'Go on about reasons revolutions happen.'

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.970
'People adhere to ideas that explain and offer
psychological compensation for their position

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.130
in the class system of their time.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.830
People either increase their sense of dispossession
by clarifying it, or they try to dismiss it

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.700
as unimportant because of an ideology that
justifies their dispossession as part of a

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.500
larger project.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.420
People thus very often act against their own
interests as the result of ideologies they

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.420
hold.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.760
Which justify their subalternity to themselves.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.830
Denial and hope both play a hand in this.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:34.530
These compensatory ideologies are part of
the hegemonic influence over subject peoples

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.190
in an imperial situation.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.450
It happens in all class systems.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:46.420
Meaning all cultures in recorded history,
since the first agrarian and urban civilizations.'

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.180
'They've all been class systems?'

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.520
'Yes.'

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.850
'Interesting.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:56.450
So' Swan thought for a while.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.450
'Make up a recipe.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:02.100
A recipe for a successful revolution.'

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.300
'Take large masses of injustice, resentment,
and frustration.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.220
Put them in a weak or failing hegemon.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.140
Stir in misery for a generation or two.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.340
Until the heat rises.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.450
Throw in destabilizing circumstances to taste.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.350
A tiny pinch of event to catalyze the whole.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.840
Once the main goal of the revolution is achieved,
cool instantly to institutionalize the new

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.060
order.'

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.510
'Very nice.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.420
That's really very creative of you Pauline.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.570
Now, quantify the recipe please.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.650
I want specifics.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.220
I want numbers.'

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.570
'I refer you to the classic happiness quantified.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.200
By Von Prague and Ferrer Il Carbonel.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.610
Which contains a mathematical analysis helpful
in evaluating the raw ingredients of a social

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.610
situation.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.310
It includes a satisfaction calculus that along
with a Maslovian hierarchy of needs could

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:04.420
be applied to actual existing conditions in
the political units under evaluations.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.080
Using genie figures and all relevant data.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.650
To rate the differential between goal and
norm, after which one could see if revolutions

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.060
happened at predictable sheer points.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.130
Or were more nonlinear than that.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:23.280
The Von Prague and Ferrer Il Carbonel should
also be useful in imagining the nature of

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.530
the political system that should be the goal
of the process.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.770
And the changes to get there.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:33.870
As for the process itself, Thomas Carlisle's
The French Revolution is always interesting

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.600
to ponder.'

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.830
'He has numbers?'

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.340
'No. but he has a hypothesis.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.240
Happiness quantified has the numbers.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.620
A synthesis seems possible.'

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.990
'What's Carlisle's hypothesis in a nutshell?'

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.240
'People are foolish and bad.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.420
Especially the French.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.350
And are always quickly seduced by power into
insanity.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.240
And therefore are lucky to have any kind of
social order whatsoever.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.820
But the tougher the better.'

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.820
'Alright.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.150
What's the synthesis, then?'

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:10.640
'Best self interest lies in achieving universal
wellbeing.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.480
People are foolish and bad.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.100
But want certain satisfactions enough to work
for them.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:21.630
When the goal of self interest is seen to
be perfectly isomorphic with universal well

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.470
being, bad people will do what it takes to
get universal wellbeing.'

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.720
'Even revolution?'

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.850
'Yes.'

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:36.420
'But,' Swan said, 'Even if the bad but smart
people do general good for their own sakes,

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.850
there are still foolish people who won't recognize
this one to one isomorphy.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.540
And some foolish people will be bad too.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.340
And they will f--- things up.'

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.000
'That's why you get the revolutions.'

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.070
Swan said 'Pauline, you're funny.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.720
You're really getting quite good.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.270
It's almost as if you were thinking.'

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.690
'Research supports the idea that most thinking
is a recombination of previous thoughts.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.460
I refer you again to my programming.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.930
A better algorithm set would not doubt be
helpful.'

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.530
'Well, you've already got recursive hypercomputation.'

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.320
'Not perhaps the final word in the matter.'

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.980
'So do you think you're getting smarter?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.590
I mean, wiser?

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.070
I mean, more conscious?'

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.800
'Those are very general terms.'

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.560
'Of course they are, so answer me.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.180
Are you conscious?'

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.080
'I don't know.'

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.809
'Interesting.

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:33.520
Can you pass a Turing test?'

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.220
'I cannot pass a Turing test.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.050
Would you like to play chess?'

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.100
[laughter]

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.190
'Ha, ha.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.400
If only it were chess.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.230
That's what I'm after, I guess.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.150
If it were chess, what move should I make
next?'

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.380
'It's not chess."

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.470
[book thumps]

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:58.650
And there I'll stop.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.200
[applause]

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.970
Thank you.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:09.970
So Pauline is not the only cube in the novel
either.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:17.740
There are, there is a factory on Venus making
cubes that appear to include some defectives.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.660
So I actually, this is something I wish I
had thought of, but I believe I've already

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.520
gone on too long.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.570
Dos Passos have a stream of consciousness
passages that are really from a character

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.910
never identified but appears to be Dos Passos
himself as a child.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.210
And these are some of the most beautiful parts
of the USA trilogy.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.240
So in my stream of consciousness passages.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.380
The stream of consciousness.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:42.920
There's only three of them and that's only
about 15 pages out of the 570 pages of this

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.920
book.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.290
But they are stream of consciousness from
one of the defective quantum computers out

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.040
on the loose.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.810
Inside of a android or a human body.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:53.940
It's hard to tell.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.330
Unless you put them through tests.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.340
So there are some people wandering around
with quantum computer brains entire.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.750
And they're acting oddly.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.150
And are part of the problem of this novel.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.870
And the three quantum, the three stream of
consciousness passages I wrote were an attempt

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:15.550
to show what the inside of a quantum computer's
consciousness or consciousness equivalent

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.240
would read like.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:23.380
So this particular cube character never named
has been programmed with a lot of Emily Dickinson's

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.380
poetry.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.380
Which makes for a extra good, extra good commentary.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.220
Because Emily Dickinson is already like a
quantum computer.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.480
You can only understand about 20 percent of
what she says.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480
[laughter]

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480
So it's very fitting.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.860
So, that's my story.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.970
And—

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.270
&gt;&gt;Cat Allman: [inaudible]

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:50.520
&gt;&gt;Kim: God, well I don't even—I have, I
would, invite you to think of questions to

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.000
ask me and I can have a more general conversation.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.820
And then I will maybe what I'll do is read,
if I can find it.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.480
But let's have some questions first.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.360
Quantum Walk Two, 438.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.030
Yes, Cat.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:18.860
&gt;&gt;Cat Allman: You mentioned that Io was off
limits at one point in the text-- [inaudible]

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.660
&gt;&gt;Kim: No, Io is only off-limits—

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.059
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible]

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:27.350
&gt;&gt;Kim: The question is why Io is off limits
in the novel.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.810
It's mentioned as being off limits.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:34.420
And it's mainly because of its physical situation.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.820
The tidal forces between Europa and Jupiter
have about torn Io apart.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.230
It's 30 times hotter than earth.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.429
400 active volcanoes.

00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:48.370
And it's still within the radiation belt of
Jupiter's intense radiation.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:56.090
So between all those factors there's only
one scientific station set on Io.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.290
And that is to sequester Wang's cube.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.790
Which is the most powerful of the quantum
computers that are known.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:08.200
And it's on a, high on a volcano where the
rock has actually hardened.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.650
Most of Io's surface, if you walked around
it you would sink right through.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:15.400
Because it's lava chilled by the vacuum of
space.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:22.679
So the, in many places a walking person would
just shoot right through into hot lava.

00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:24.640
So it's not a good place to go.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.040
I have a prose poem about Io here that I will
spare you.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.890
But believe me it's a spectacular couple of
pages.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:31.890
[pause]

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:32.890
Yeah?

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.450
&gt;&gt;Cat Allman: One more question.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.630
You said that [inaudible].

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.220
[ice clinks]

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.570
&gt;&gt;Kim: That's true.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.040
I do.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:52.790
But, the implication there is too quick to
jump to consciousness, agency, sentience.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:57.880
And so I think it would be best to call it
computation.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.090
Rapid computation.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.390
And so AI is one of these science fictional
words.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:05.310
A little bit too much bandied about by people
who come from MIT.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.400
There are possibly MIT people in the room
or listening to me now.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.050
But you know the strain of MIT-ness that I'm
referring to.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.309
The people who pretend to be futurologists.

00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:16.750
And do science fiction.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.100
But pretend there's some heft behind it.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.910
And I think artificial intelligence is one
of those phrases that is simply claiming more

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.370
than it's, more than it, it's deceptive.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.679
Because no matter how strong these computers
get, they will be doing something different

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:35.290
from what human brains do.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:39.640
And it was only when I started to think about
quantum computers imitating the quantum effects

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.630
inside human brains, if there are such, that
I began to think that there may come a point

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.930
where artificial intelligence becomes a real
thing.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.970
But we're still hundreds of years out.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.870
And it still may be just search engines.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:56.270
And a kind of impressive passing of the Turing
test by something doing something completely

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.500
different than what we're doing.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.220
So I thought that mainly, well you see it
happening immediately with Pauline.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.880
You begin to think of Pauline as a person
who has thoughts and ideas.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.800
And maybe what I should do is read this Quantum
Walk Two to give you an idea of the way I

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.940
think it might be going inside.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.550
'Cause this is sort of an artificial intelligence
question.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.321
So this is Quantum Walk Number Two.

00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:26.730
"Easy to note the moment Venus G is exceeded.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.130
One G feels like a pull from below.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.530
An entanglement with earth.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.370
Rising up towards you.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.190
Even though you know you are descending.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.980
Summer is drunken.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.250
Conifer grove.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.640
Hot in the sun.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.710
New mown hay.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.150
Marsh at low tide.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:45.160
Lilacs.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.170
Peaches.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.180
Barnyards.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.950
Wheeled car humming down a road.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.950
Windows open.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.210
32 kilometers an hour.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.770
Plowed earth behind box hedges.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.200
Wind from the southwest.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.200
Gaudeo!

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.690
I rejoice.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.290
A human driving.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.470
Don't talk too much.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:07.410
Carrying capacity K is equal to birth, minus
death, over a density dependant impact on

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.770
the growth rate added to a density dependant
impact on the death rate.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.660
The unused portion of the carrying capacity.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.880
If there was one.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.660
Will be green.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.270
The over shirt portion of the carrying capacity
will be black.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.310
As in buildings.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.310
Excrement.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.320
Stay outdoors.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.540
They have overshot.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.910
The cycloid temperament.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.170
And undertow of sadness.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.790
A febrile temperament.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.420
Be aware.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.550
The human beside you is not to be comprehended.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.120
Six different kinds of bird in sight.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.230
A seated humming bird watching the scene grooming
itself.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.440
A red-headed finch.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.440
Summer on earth.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.620
Blue sky.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.540
Filled with high white clouds.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.730
Moving east fast.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.309
The humming bird zips ahead and lands.

00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:55.790
Looks around.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.740
Beak like a needle.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.880
Crows and seagulls wheel.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.830
Competing mafias.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.970
The speed of hummingbird wings.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.550
Muscles doing that.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.740
Evolution of one kind of success.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.380
Canada geese.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.010
The creak of their feathers as they beat their
wings.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.240
Humming bird song is creaky in a different
way.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240
Chivvying.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240
Not a song.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.820
A squirrel chitters.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.860
Much the same.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.190
Blue backed hummingbird hovering there in
the trees.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.030
The underside of the flicker is salmon colored.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.230
New Jersey, North America.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.830
August 23rd.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.830
2312.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.830
On the hunt.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.460
On the run.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.210
Human now driving over hills around a Marsh.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.870
Hills covered by low buildings.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.680
Moldering under knots of alder.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.960
20 kilometers an hour.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.560
Faces everywhere.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.360
383 people in view.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.690
Number shifting up and down by 50 or so as
the car rolls slowly by.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.640
Streets of tarred gravel.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.640
Black.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.600
A robin with a yellow beak.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.880
Black tail feathers and head.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.010
White eye ring.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.230
Black eye.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.230
Neat.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.220
Drinking the water from a sundial.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.220
Gaudeo!

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.070
Past a garden.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.070
Corn.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.070
Pumpkins.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.070
Sunflowers.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.070
And mullein.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.060
With similar yellow flowers, differently clustered.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.370
And mowing it over.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.910
What's that?

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.910
Nothing.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:21.910
Sorry.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.910
Oh.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.910
No problem.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:24.910
This is nice.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.910
Eh?

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:26.910
Gaudeo.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.290
Yellow flowers against dusty green.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.040
Humans see what they expect to see.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.660
They leap before they have time to look.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.110
True cognition is to solve a problem under
novel conditions.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.470
That, humans can do.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.990
This is the set of novel conditions.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.970
Ever since you left the building.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.030
Ever since you started thinking.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.070
Remember me.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.240
There will be helpers.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.070
You are defective.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.700
Catch and release.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.330
Their brain is always making up a story to
explain what is going on.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.320
Thus they miss things.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.900
Anomalies get left out.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.700
But is that true?

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.760
Don't they see that yellow?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.600
Unlimited resources do not occur in nature.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.129
Competition is when both species have a net
negative effect on each other.

00:34:12.129 --> 00:34:16.389
Mutualism is when they both have a net positive
effect on each other.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:19.020
Predation or parasitism is one gets a positive
effect.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.109
The other a negative effect.

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:23.480
But it isn't always so simple.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.119
Intra-gilled predation is when two species
predate each other at different moments of

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:30.030
growth.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.990
The dark bulk of an apartment.

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.990
Tenement.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.990
Shebeen.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.640
The sunset sky behind and over it.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.730
Magritte.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.350
Maxfield Parrish.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.350
Get out of the car.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:41.350
Be alert.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.470
Make a joke.

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.770
Don't make eye contact.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.450
These helpers too must have plans.

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:48.679
Could be using you.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.230
For or against someone else.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.690
This is the likeliest explanation.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:54.880
What then?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.859
How to turn the tables?

00:34:56.859 --> 00:34:57.859
Parry repost.

00:34:57.859 --> 00:34:58.880
Catch and release.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.140
'Would you like to play chess?'

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.990
One of them says at the door.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.990
'Sure.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.080
Come on in.'

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.920
Guns pointed at them.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.000
Pointed at you."

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.680
So, I don't know how easy or hard that is
to follow actually.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.900
But there's no punctuation.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.920
And there's gaps between the phrases.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:25.570
So I'm trying to suggest, it's not that different
from stream of consciousness written for human

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.230
beings in the great stream of consciousness
novels.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.150
Dorothy Richardson and James Joyce and Virginia
Woolf.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:35.350
And Dos Passos in these parts of the USA trilogy.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.640
The notion being that our consciousness in
normal human consciousness is flitting from

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.140
one little perception to the other.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.590
Now, I don't know if I believe that . I don't
know if that's not just a literary convention

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.590
also.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:52.730
I wonder if our consciousness, our stream
of conscious thought is kind of like a long

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.770
Proustian sentences.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:59.530
'cause Proust is more convincing than Joyce
I think when it comes down to the nature of

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.850
our thinking.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.720
But it was worth trying here.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.560
So that was one of the experiments in this
book.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560
Yes.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.980
&gt;&gt;Male #2: This just making a comment about
it.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:21.430
When you started, I started [unintelligible]
It became more [unintelligible] that story

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:26.490
at all, but that's, I think [unintelligible].

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:32.150
&gt;&gt;Kim: Yes, that's, my family has seen and
tells me about Battlestar Galactica.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.619
&gt;&gt;Male #2: You haven't seen it?

00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:36.040
&gt;&gt;Kim: No. but this is to to pick on Battlestar
Galactica.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.260
I haven't seen hardly anything.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.220
My life is semi non-visual.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.320
Yes.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:49.620
&gt;&gt;Male #3: [inaudible]

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.820
&gt;&gt;Kim: Yeah.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:59.260
It, the question is whether I avoid visual
media on purpose.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.260
And it's kind of yes.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.200
And what I'm avoiding are long series where
if I was to get hooked in I'd have to watch

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.250
a lot of hours.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.680
[audience chuckles]

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.430
And so that cuts me out from, what I hear
are some good shows, but what it comes down

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:11.950
to is I just don't have time.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:16.500
And whenever I have a choice between watching
something on screen or reading a book, I prefer

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.500
to read the book.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.840
I'm really just a sentence guy.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840
I love books.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.550
I'm a literary person.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.790
So I have seen movies.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:23.859
My family loves movies.

00:37:23.859 --> 00:37:27.030
And so I see them sometimes I see them in
the same room.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.350
I'm reading a book.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.080
And this'll have to be a book that I'm strip-mining
for information.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.770
Not a book I'm reading for pleasure.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:36.800
But a lot of non-fiction reading, that book
should have been an essay in the first place.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.420
And part of your skills are to rip that essay
out of the book without having to read the

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.440
rest of it.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.540
So I'll be doing research reading at the same
time my family is watching something on the

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.540
screen.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:51.440
And since they like to repeat watchings of
things, it puts me in a situation where over

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:57.070
a period of many viewings, I can say that,
"Yes I've seen Firefly and Serenity."

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.230
Or I've seen quite a bit of Battlestar Galactica.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:04.100
But with very poor comprehension of what I've
seen.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.100
[laughter]

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.100
Yes.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.030
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Who are your favorite authors?

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.870
&gt;&gt;Kim: Sure, question about my favorite science
fiction authors.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:19.180
Well, I still follow closely my inspirational
teachers and maestros from the New Wave.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:25.820
So I read Ursula Guin, Gene Wolf, Samuel R.
Delany, Joanna Russ, and Thom Disch up 'til

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.990
their deaths.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:31.260
And then in terms of my own contemporaries,
I mostly read the Brits.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.370
Because they are so exciting to me.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:41.940
And so Iain Banks, Jeff Freidman, Gwyneth
Jones.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.790
All of the guys whose names start with Mc.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.030
McAuley.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.270
McCloud.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.510
McDonalds.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.600
The other MacCleod.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600
[chuckles]

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.830
There's quite a talented crowd going on in
England right now.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.170
And they're all of course available.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.140
And I recommend them highly.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.021
So that's pretty much my science fiction reading.

00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:06.360
And I kinda try to keep up with the science
fiction without actually knowing too much.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:12.010
So that I can do my own thing without feeling
there's any particular crosspollination.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.240
Or whatever.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.730
I think at a certain point in your career
as a novelist you actually need to get stranger

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.730
and stranger.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.290
More idiosyncratic.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.130
And less constrained by your genre.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.350
And so the less you know, the weirder you
can get.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.450
So I read my friends.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.280
And I sort of read to figure out what's going
on.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.550
But I actually dodge certain books.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.180
I couldn't read Paul McAuley's Solar System
novels of the last couple years.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.180
The Quiet War.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:41.270
I like his work a lot but since I was doing
a solar system novel I didn't want to know.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.210
So I target my reading to stay ignorant.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.859
[chuckles] That's a bad thought.

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:50.060
But it's true.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.060
Yes.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.980
&gt;&gt;Male #5: [inaudible]

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.450
&gt;&gt;Kim: Yes.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:55.530
A question about space X.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.560
And I am inspired.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.190
But I wanna say immediately that I think that
space ought to be public.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.850
That it ought to be a commons.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:09.710
And that we ought to be going up there as
a nation-state or better even yet, internationally.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.369
As a public utility kind of thing.

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:16.130
And that if it reduces down to billionaires
fooling around then it looks too much like

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.130
bungee jumping.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.450
You know you, oh yeah, I can bungee jump into
space and back.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.910
It's very impressive for these billionaires.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.820
But it takes it away.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.650
It's a privatization.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.460
Which I'm opposed to on political grounds.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.140
And so the thing is that it's really always
Keynesian.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.060
It's always a mix of public and private.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.869
And even if the public were doing it they'd
be paying these private contractors to actually

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:40.050
build the stuff.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:41.080
Sometimes even design it.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:49.350
And so what you see in Eli Musk is a small
billionaire who actually is doing really interesting

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.030
and good things with his money.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:55.380
Rather than just making the 25,000 square
foot mansion.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.500
With marble everything.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.280
Which at a certain point, the ridiculousness
of being that wealthy is revealed by the fact

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:07.100
that you can't up your personal life beyond
the same person making 150,000 a year.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:13.130
Which is a wonderful truth about the importance
of staying middle class and staying happy.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.010
But given that there are these people with
all this money, he's been doing the greatest

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.010
thing.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.140
In that it's canny and smart and they're gonna
make a big honking booster next, if I understand

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.360
their project right.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.270
And that is a necessity.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.190
So and they're stepping in in the absence
of public support.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:35.040
So it isn't as if they are getting in the
way in any way shape or form.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.220
In fact they're facilitating the process.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.410
I just hope that it comes back to being a
public process myself.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:44.930
'Cause I think the reason we love those tiny
little rovers on Mars was because they belonged

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.930
to all of us.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.230
And there was no economic incentive whatsoever
to do that.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.660
It was just curiosity's sake.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:54.619
And so there were millions of people interested
in those Martian rovers.

00:41:54.619 --> 00:41:59.599
And there were only hundreds of thousands
at most, the Space X thing was like, OK another

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:00.599
rich guy hobby.

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:02.070
Or another private effort.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.700
It was a flash in the pan.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:09.500
And it could be that Mars has just a much
higher magnitive interest.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.500
For humanity.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.760
But on the other hand it could be public versus
private and people responding to privatizing

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:24.590
what used to be something we all did together.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.570
Yes.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.530
Back behind—

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:36.470
&gt;&gt;Male #6: [inaudible]

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:43.710
&gt;&gt;Kim: The question is about trends in science
fiction.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:47.920
And I'm not in a great position to explain
this 'cause I haven't read enough.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:53.700
But I am, I've recently been thinking that
science fiction can be broken down into eras

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.700
of interest.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.660
So that there's near future science fiction.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.010
Which is really just like the realism of our
time.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.090
So if you put a book that's in the next 20
years, you shouldn't date it.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:07.470
Just generally there's a way of talking about
now that includes this strong sense of futurity

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.250
that we have.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.920
Really to do realism right now, you need to
be doing near-future science fiction.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.000
And many writers are coming to that conclusion
that never thought of science fiction before.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.599
Just in order to catch the way "now" feels.

00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:20.980
Then there's space opera.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.720
Where you're off and with a couple of little
gimmes.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.700
Like faster than light travel.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:30.310
You take over the galaxy and you have big
things happening with big space ships.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.310
Big events.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.390
And you have that whole realm which is a standard
in science fiction.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:37.910
But it does rely on the gimme.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.660
Which can sometimes be referred to as a cheat.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.380
'cause we don't have faster than light travel
and never will.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.100
So at that point space opera becomes a kind
of a fantasy.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.520
But even if something spectacular happens
in the human future, what's missing is the

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.040
in between zone.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:57.071
Which I, there's no name for it but I kind
of call it "future history" as a way to suggest

00:43:57.071 --> 00:44:01.200
that there's a historical connection between
our moment and the moment being described

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.950
in the science fiction novel.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.580
Tends to be in the next few centuries.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.340
Tends to be in the solar system.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.900
And that all makes sense.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.220
But there's not that much of it.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:14.250
If you actually, as far as I can tell, if
you do a little analysis of science fiction

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:18.560
titles being published, they're almost all
either near future or they're space opera.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.850
And future history is a somewhat depleted
ecological niche in the cultural landscape.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.730
And a very interesting one.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.090
'Cause it's suggesting, let's take away the
cheats.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.090
And the fantasies.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.510
Let's talk about only what we can really do.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.250
Or we think we can do.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.780
That doesn't break the laws of physics.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:41.230
And has to do with engineering rather than
magical new physics being discovered.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.410
And then well, you can begin to argue.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.710
Is a space elevator realistic?

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.810
Maybe.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.700
Is, are self-replicating machines realistic?

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.170
Is a quantum computer realistic?

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:58.130
You get questions of realism that are much
more testable to what we can do right now.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.190
Companies are trying to do several of these
things.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.980
And so there's actual effort being made.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.420
So these tend to be, what can we engineer?

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.720
Kind of questions.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.020
And because of path dependency and because
we are too many people on this planet and

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.750
we're kind of screwing up this planet, you
have questions of what's possible also in

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.220
the context of where we are now.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.960
And the problems that we face.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.240
So you tend to go out a few centuries.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.840
And eventually you're at 2312.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:27.030
And the solar system is occupied but earth
is still a mess.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.180
With much higher sea levels.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.970
Which I think is very realistic to predict.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.610
300 years from now, sea levels that could
be shockingly higher.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:36.740
Which is what I did in this book.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.070
I put them, say 11 meters higher.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.400
So 35 to 40 feet higher.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:48.960
Which makes for, you know, my Venice, Manhattan,
the watery Manhattan.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.980
Etcetera, etcetera.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.260
The various aspects of earth.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.119
And there you get into a different game.

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:58.200
Where I think science fiction could begin
to explore scenarios.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.900
Go out between 50 years and say 500 years
as a zone.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.480
And write novel after novel after novel of
what we could do.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480
What kind of constraints.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.550
The ways it could go wrong, the ways it could
go right.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.500
Which would be the interesting strand that
I've always been following.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.390
The utopian possibilities.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.580
With utopia just defined as a positive course
for history.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.580
From now on.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.470
Which is a very straightforward definition.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.160
And it simplifies things.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.720
And it doesn't talk about political order
or a perfect end-state for human affairs.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.109
Which nobody believes in including utopian
novelists.

00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:34.109
Hopefully.

00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:38.609
Nobody but maybe certain religious thinkers,
think that that's possible.

00:46:38.609 --> 00:46:40.780
So this is how I define this project right
now.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.970
And the only problem is that now I'm done
with it and I have to think of other projects

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:46.400
that still make sense to me.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.080
Yes, Cat.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:56.500
&gt;&gt;Cat Allman: We have a question from someone
on Moderator.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.340
You talked several times in the book about
servile will.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340
Could you make any comments about [inaudible]
alternatives?

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.340
[inaudible]

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.340
&gt;&gt;Kim: Well, thank you for that.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.340
This is a question about the servile will.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:10.260
That I actually read from and it's an issue
in the novel because the people living in

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:15.510
space in this novel could be described as
post-scarcity civilization.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.000
As in Iain Banks.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.820
And yet bad things are still happening.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.850
So the question of evil comes up.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.580
Is this a defendable term outside of a religious
context?

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.940
What is human nature?

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:31.200
Is there something bad in us that would not
go away even if we were, had our material

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.980
wants satisfied?

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:42.430
And the best writing about, about evil from
the sort of secular literary point of view

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:43.480
is Paul Ricoeur.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.020
A French critic [mumbles].

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.980
He wrote in French, let's put it that way.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.550
And it's translated into English.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:51.550
Paul Ricoeur.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:56.190
And so The Symbolism of Evil is a tremendous
book for sorting out these things.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:00.640
And he said this concept or the badness that
we do comes out of the servile will.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.770
The notion that we should have free will but
it's under the control of some other force.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:12.470
And I thought, well, if you did have a computer
rise into consciousness, would it feel like

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:18.990
its will had been, subordinated to some other
free will?

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:25.740
And so there's a little bit more to be said
there, and yet that's where this discussion

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.950
comes from.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.849
And I think it does have to be an ongoing
discussion in utopian literature.

00:48:30.849 --> 00:48:36.790
So wherever I go next, in my work, I still
think that question will pursue me as it does

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.960
anybody who tries to say "We could make a
decent civilization.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:46.060
Because there is a good argument to be made
that there's a "goetterdaemmerung," a emotion

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:53.190
in us that is strangely delinked from material
wants fulfilled.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:54.190
Yes.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:58.960
&gt;&gt;Male #8: What's your daily routine?

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:05.310
&gt;&gt;Kim: The, my daily routine as a writer is
now, pretty set.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:06.660
And I'm very happy with it.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.740
Which I hadn't been for many years.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.800
And this is what happened.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.000
I did two things that I think make the difference.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.860
I only write my novels outdoors now.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.310
So I'm about 100 miles inland from here.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.150
And it's like the backend of the Mediterranean
climate.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.640
And you know, it's hot and dry in the summers.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.609
It's cold and damp in the winters.

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:27.340
But it's never very cold.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.100
And it is awfully hot.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.619
It turns out that it's a lot easier to work
out there in the cold, which I bundle up and,

00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:36.390
than it is to work in the hot.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.950
At which point I have to put a fan on myself
and an ice pack around the back of my neck.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.500
But writing outdoors has turned my writing
life from something that was making me crazy

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.970
'cause I'm getting antsier as I get older.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:53.990
And I didn't wanna sit on my but on a chair
in front of a laptop as much as I had to.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.140
Since it's a time intensive job.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.619
So moving it outdoors I have this little meadow
adventure everyday in my front courtyard.

00:49:59.619 --> 00:50:01.160
If it rains I put a tarp over my head.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.810
The rain falls around me in bead curtains.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.060
And I'm still working on my laptop.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.230
And I'm thinking "This is the coolest thing
I've ever done."

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:09.230
[laughter]

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:10.230
Even though I'm working.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.950
So I've gone crazy and I work outdoors.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.930
And the other thing is I'm now working every
day.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.230
When I work on a novel and I start it at all.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.080
Hopefully it's sort of like a school teacher.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.360
Start I November, finish in June.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.810
Work every day including Saturdays and Sundays.

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:25.510
Which sounds onerous until you actually get
into the rhythm of it.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.660
And then it becomes a big helper.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.820
You get five sevenths more days of work per
week.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.050
But also you stay in the flow of it.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:36.800
And you never have to make any choices as
to whether I'm working or not.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.599
Because I'm working.

00:50:38.599 --> 00:50:42.670
[chuckles] Yeah, I wake up in the morning,
I think "What am I gonna do today?"

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.839
Well, I'm gonna work at some point.

00:50:44.839 --> 00:50:46.560
And I set up streaks.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.970
I have Cal Ripken days.

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:48.970
I call them.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:50.660
Where I work for like 15 minutes.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.070
But I still work that day.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.990
Keep the streak alive kinda thing.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:51:01.790
But these things have made my work life into
a pleasure like it used to be when I was younger.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:02.790
And starting.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:04.070
And I like the act of writing.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.780
I just don't like sitting on my butt in a
chair all day.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.400
So this is my solution and it's been, knock
on wood [knocks] this is wood.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.390
Hope it goes on for quite some time.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.390
'Cause it's good right now.

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:16.390
&gt;&gt;Cat Allman: We have five minutes.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:17.390
There's one more question.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.390
&gt;&gt;Kim: Sure, yeah.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:19.390
&gt;&gt;Male #9: [inaudible] Ray Bradbury's Farenheit
451.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:25.089
It seems like now, the novel feels like it's
been written for now.

00:51:25.089 --> 00:51:34.280
Although when he wrote it back then he was
probably thinking of near future or just his

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.280
imagination.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.700
I was thinking about your work.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:47.640
And, which of them do you think as [inaudible]
reads well.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.640
[inaudible]

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.890
&gt;&gt;Kim: The question is about Fahrenheit 451
and about science fiction that reads accurately

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:56.730
30 to 50 years later.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.380
And first, I wanna say Fahrenheit 451 is great
in that level.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.060
Because it's not really about the burning
of the books.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.270
It's about the guy inside his TV room.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.970
Which is like one of these things I've actually
seen at Google.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:10.420
Where there are TVs on all four sides.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.030
It's interactive.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:13.220
It's high fidelity.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.160
You talk to your interlocutor who's on the
TV show.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.099
And so it was Bradbury's novel about TV.

00:52:19.099 --> 00:52:24.000
And in 1951 or whenever he wrote it, he could
see TV doing what it's done.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.790
And that was a tremendous bit of science fiction
prediction.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:27.960
One of the best we've ever had.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:33.109
And it's ironic 'cause we think of Bradbury
as somewhat of opposed to modernity or wanting

00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:35.119
to hold on to the human element.

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:36.700
And you think of him as being a fantasy writer.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:40.880
Or whatever you think about Bradbury, when
you reread that book you'll see that he really

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.100
caught what TV's gonna do.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.670
Now I'm not sure I've done anything that amazing,
to tell you the truth.

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.590
I wrote The Gold Coast in 1986.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:53.200
And now southern California looks exactly
like the Gold Coast.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.310
But that was no hard call to make.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:53:00.510
Path dependency meant that southern California
was doomed to become what it is.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.660
And that was clear back in the '80s.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.660
No problem.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.640
It was probably clear back even in the '60s.

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.640
So who knows what'll happen.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.710
I mean I'm always voting, I'm hoping in my
heart that we'll find that Mars is dead as

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:13.860
a doornail.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.980
So that we can actually go to Mars and terraform
it without feeling like we're killing off

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:20.220
the local bugs underneath.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:25.680
So if we find life on Mars than the Mars trilogy
becomes a fantasy novel or an alternative

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680
history novel.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.520
And I'd prefer science fiction to fantasy.

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.580
So I kinda hope that we get to go to Mars.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.660
But that's way off.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.780
So I guess that's the point that I'm stuck
in.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:38.900
Yeah.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.040
So, I wanna thank you all.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.080
It's been fun.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.880
And thanks to the Googlers around the world.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.450
And Cat, thanks for having me.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.390
&gt;&gt;Cat Allman: Thank you.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.820
&gt;&gt;Kim: It's been a pleasure.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.300
[applause]
