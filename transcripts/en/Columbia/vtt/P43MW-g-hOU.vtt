00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.190
Hello everyone I’m Peter Bower welcome to

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.790
Pete’s Lab 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.970
today , we have another

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.709
one of our short little lectures vignettes if you will on
subjects related to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:13.510
ground fields

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.869
and groundwater

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.019
today's topic is

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.929
porosity

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.020
Porosity is the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.849
percentage of open space

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.739
in rock or regolith

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.909
usually we think of rock as being completely
solid the but in many cases there are fractures

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.169
or cracks

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.890
sometimes open spaces

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.090
and that can

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.410
provide some

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.450
porosity

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.620
Regolith on the other hand is the lose
Material at the surface of the earth

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 mud  sand gravel and so forth

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.810
and  it is composed of particles  and those particles have
spaces between them

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.290
 which can give

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.349
you a rather large

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:55.910
amount of open space or

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.429
as we will see porosity

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.970
there's some other subjects that we're going to
touch upon

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.530
 permeability  bulk volume
bulk  density density of particles

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.930
volumes of the particles and so forth

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.220
we’ll make some measurements and we'll discuss
their significance

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.340
I have here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.460
a  pebble

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.350
quartz

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.720
and if one were to try to determine the volume
of this pebble most people understand that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.060
if we have

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 a graduated cylinder

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.420
in this case a hundred and ten milliliters
of water that by dropping the pebble into the water

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660
the water level will rise

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.990
and we should be able to determine

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.540
the volume of the pebble by difference

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.370
so let me drop this in here

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.109
and we can see that the water level has gone up

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.780
and the new water level is a  hundred and thirty milliliters

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.190
meaning that the difference one thirty minus one
ten

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.409
twenty milliliters is the volume

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620
of a pebble

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.620
milliliters we should also understand is the
same volume as a little cube one centimeter on a side

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.620
that is a cubic centimeter or CC is exactly the
same volume as a milliliter

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:20.789
while most understand that one can determine
the volume of a pebble by 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.629
volume different by dropping it into a

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.919
 graduated cylinder with  some liquid in it

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.729
 it gets a little more confusing when

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.909
 we have more than one particle

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.799
but it's really the same

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:35.849
 principle

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.209
if we were to dump all these particles in this case 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.300
a  nice pile of  half-inch

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.059
plastic  bedes 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.909
into a liquid surely the volume would rise

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.629
and what would we have done we would have measured

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.260
the volume of all of these particles

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.930
not just one but many

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.179
here for instance is a beaker of sand consisting
of

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.040
 hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.420
 particles

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.350
we could do the same thing by dropping
sand into a water and watching the water level rise in determining

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.969
the volume of all particles

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.829
that's exactly what we're going to do

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.639
okay so let's begin the experiment 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.529
before  you

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.579
begin the experiment you should all have

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.569
a  copy of

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.560
the handout particles

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.799
porosity bulk density and particle density

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.619
if you don't have it pause the video

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:35.670
and 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.549
go to  the web site and print it out

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.630
and then start watching

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.899
the video

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:44.870
again so lets begin

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.900
 the first thing that we’ll want to do is
to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.900
 determine the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 weight of this beaker

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:17.170
okay the weight of the beaker is one hundred
and seventy one point

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.419
three grams

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.220
so if you would please enter that

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.379
 data on

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.080
you're sheet

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.430
in item number two the way of the beaker

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.490
and the next thing 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.139
we’re going to do is  determine the weight of the beaker
plus the particles again the particles are the plastic

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.139
that is styrene  beads the is one half inch in diameter

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.909
and we're going to use a weight

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:03.909
to assist us

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:26.110
they're we’re getting close

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.509
and the

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.700
wait of the beaker

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.550
plus the beads

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.410
is five hundred and thirty nine

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.160
point eight

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.039
grams

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.300
so please enter that on your sheet

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.860
five thirty nine-point eight

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.340
by subtracting the weight of the beaker

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.889
 from the weight of the beaker plus the particles we
can find out the weight  of the particles

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.790
and that turns out to be three hundred and sixty
six

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.690
point seven

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.750
 grams se we’ve determined 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.719
one thing

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.330
and that is the weight

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.420
of the particles

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.930
 the next thing that we could do that
would be

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.240
Fairly straightforward

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.180
it would be to determine the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.999
bulk volume that is the volume of the
particles plus the spaces between the particles

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.409
and we can do that

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:24.409
by putting the particles into the graduated cylinder

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.720
try to get them level
0:06:32.720,0:06:37.999
 the divisions on this graduated cylinder
are 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.269
in increments of ten milliliters

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:44.489
 the volume of the beads is

00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:46.620
four hundred and forty

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.610
Milliliters so

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:54.559
 please enter that on your sheet

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.179
and now

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:59.330
we’re going to determine the

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.389
volume of the particles

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.389
I have here some
0:07:07.389,0:07:08.979
 water that I put some dye in

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.979
and I'm going to put this

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:16.509
into the graduated cylinder

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:17.689
and the

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.089
volume here is

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:24.259
three hundred and ninety milliliters

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.679
and the next step

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.699
the dramatic step is to

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:29.800
pour the beads

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.039
 into this graduated cylinder  exactly
as we did for the single quartz pebble before

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.100
only were doing it

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.880
 maybe

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.880
a hundred times over 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.429
and we can see  that the water level has
risen of course

00:07:57.429 --> 00:07:59.649
and we can also note that

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:03.990
the spaces between the particles are completely
filled with liquid

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.139
 here

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:11.809
the pour space  that is the open space between
the particles is connected and fluids

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:14.230
water in this case can move freely

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.729
between the particles

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:18.589
 this is  an important

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:23.340
 term  called permeability  it means
simply

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.730
the ability of 

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.610
fluids to be

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.459
transmitted by rock or regolith and clearly

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:34.409
 the spaces between these particles are connected and
fluid moves

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:35.650
easily between them

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.000
 the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.210
new volume

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.770
is six hundred and forty milliliters
so if you enter that on your sheet

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.210
and then you can see 

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:51.280
by looking at your sheet that we can now determine
the volume of the particles by subtracting

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.259
the initial volume of the water

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:54.490
from the final

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.390
that is

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.990
three ninety from six forty gives us two hundred
and fifty

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.700
milliliters

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.890
that's the volume of the particles

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.970
now since the bulk volume was the volume of

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.500
 the particles plus the volume of the pour space

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.490
we can also now determine the

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.540
amount of open space parting these particles

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.650
the original bulk volume was four hundred and
forty milliliters

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.790
the volume of the particles was two hundred and fifty
so subtracting two fifty from

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.140
four forty gives us

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.320
one hundred and ninety

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.949
milliliters

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:32.339
which is the volume of the open space or

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:35.440
pour space between the particles

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.980
the rest of this is

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.160
really some simple calculations

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.019
we can determine the porosity that's number nine
on your sheet

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:46.830
which is the percentage of open
space

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.800
and we do that by dividing one ninety

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.060
 the  volume of the

00:09:53.060 --> 00:10:00.060
pour space over the total volume the bulk volume
of four forty and we get forty three percent

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.699
so forty three percent of the volume of these
particles is open space

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:07.160
and conversely the particles take up fifty seven

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.600
 percent

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.620
of the space

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.130
we can also now determine the density remember
density is

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.800
the weight divided by the volume

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.999
so we could do the

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:20.740
bulk density which would be the

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.720
weight which is

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.500
 we determined right at the beginning three
hundred sixty six point seven grams

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.720
divide that by the 

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.370
 bulk volume of four hundred and forty milliliters and we find out that the bulk density

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.180
is point eight three grams

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.660
per milliliter or grams per

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.590
 cubic centimeter that’s 

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.830
particularly 

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.389
 useful much more useful is

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:47.980
the density of the particles themselves if we
know the density of the particles themselves it

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.740
may give us

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.050
some information

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.850
that would be very useful in determining what the particles are made of

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.820
in this case

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.689
we divide three hundred sixty six point seven of
weight of the particles by 

00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:01.290
the volume 
0:11:01.290,0:11:03.960
of the particles two hundred fifty

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.570
milliliters and we find out that the density

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.470
of these styrene beads is one point

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.550
four seven grams per cubic centimeter 

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.640
which makes sense

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.800
 the density of water is one

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.080
gram per cubic centimeter

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.520
and of course these beads have

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.499
sunk to the bottom 

00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:25.720
if they were less dense than water they would float

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.120
and  we wouldn’t be able to do the experiment

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.129
okay so

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:30.259
we have now shown you

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:34.000
 how to measure porosity the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.590
percentage of open space

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.699
 in

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:38.649
a collection

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:39.990
of particles

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.720
 in this case the  percentage of open space in
the

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.030
 pile of plastic beads is about forty three percent

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.020
we weighed  the particles we determine the bulk
volume of the particles

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.400
and pour space

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.440
we determine the volume of the particles the
density of the particles

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.270
and so forth

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.710
all these measurements are

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.250
a very important

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.110
for studying groundwater and the flow of fluids

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.669
 through  regolith

00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:13.840
on the surface of the earth

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.009
 we could have done the same experiment 
with this 

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:20.890
with this sand and determined it’s porosity 

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.180
and also the

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.770
density of the particles

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.450
permeability  to remind you again is the
ability of

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.529
fluids 

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:31.070
to flow

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.480
through rock or regolith

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.530
in order for that to happen of course there
has to be porosity

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:43.070
but the porosity must also be connected so
that the liquid can move from one place to another

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.940
a good example of a material that

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.630
has very high porosity but

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.130
dosen’t

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.769
 allow fluids to move is Styrofoam

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:55.180
take a Styrofoam cup and if you look

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:02.180
at the walls of the styrofoam cup you'll see that
it's made of very tiny bubbles  foam

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.180
 made from styrene and

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.010
those bubbles are not connected

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:11.280
% they're all individually wrapped in plastic

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.190
and of course we know the Styrofoam cup

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.710
t does not was allow liquids to pass through it

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.640
 there are some rocks such as  pumice that has
similar  properties

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.420
 very very light and airy lots of open space but the

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.570
air space is  not connected at all

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.320
so permeability  is the ability of

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.790
um fluids to move within

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.090
 sand lets say

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.149
 or even through rock where you have

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:43.980
 fractures

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.670
and this number of porosity we'll see later on

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.600
the very important um 

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.290
piece of information  that we need in order to use Darcy’s
law which allows us to

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.090
calculate the rate

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.270
at which water flows

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.740
in sub surface

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.970
until next time

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:03.870
this is

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.590
