[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.350
KEVIN CHANDLER: Hey, guys.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.500
Thanks for having me.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.150
It's great to be with you.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.540
My story is kind of interesting
because a couple of years

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.320
ago, some friends and I
decided to come over to Europe

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.660
and backpack around, but I was
the backpack, which obviously

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.520
caused some heads to turn.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.570
And so people assumed that
my story started there,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.400
and some people asked a lot
of questions about that.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.790
But the funny thing
is it actually

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.400
started back before I was born.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.890
My parents had two
children before me,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.160
and their second
was named Connie.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.140
And Connie, when she was about
the age where she should start

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.030
being able to walk on her own
and let go of the furniture,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.020
she didn't.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.610
She just kept holding on.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.870
And when she did,
she would fall over.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.190
And so my parents took
her to the doctor.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.180
And that began several
months of testing.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.490
And after a while of
testing, the doctors

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.680
came back with a diagnosis.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.070
And the diagnosis was for
spinal muscular atrophy,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.970
which essentially
means that the message

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.850
between her brain and her spinal
cord gets kind of jumbled up.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.660
And so the message doesn't
get to her muscles properly,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.350
and so her muscles
atrophy over time.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.310
And so the doctors brought
my parents into a room,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.320
and they were
explaining all this.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.660
And they said, if you
have more children,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.290
it will probably be
the same story again.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.020
And this is already going to be
a difficult-enough life for you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.160
and for your children, so we
would just suggest that you're

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.699
not have any more children.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.390
My parents are very
good at loving people,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.730
and they do it in two
very different ways.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.710
My mom is a fighter.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.360
She's the firecracker
of the family.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.200
And my dad is the quiet,
behind-the-scenes one.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.110
But my dad was the
one to speak up.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.350
And in that room with
these well-meaning doctors,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.920
he took my mom's hand
and he said, well,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.040
if what you're telling us is
that the worst that can happen

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.410
is that we have another
child like Connie,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.840
that's perfectly fine with us.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.750
And about a year
later, I showed up.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.810
And just as the doctors
said, it was the same story.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.720
About the age where
I should start

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.140
letting go of the
furniture, well, I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.910
was already falling down.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.075
I never really got to that
stage of holding on to things.

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:14.020
And so life went on.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.590
And I was diagnosed,
and my parents

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
decided that they had three
children, two of which

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.300
had this rare disease, and
that was fine with them,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.170
and they were going to raise
us as normal as possible.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.710
What that meant for them was
that we were going to have

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.180
extremely adventurous lives.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.340
And so we grew up traveling, and
inviting people into our homes,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.770
and going out into the world.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.860
Although we were disabled,
we were completely a part

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.890
of the able-bodied community.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.890
And it was just a really
wonderful experience

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.480
that I didn't fully understand
the power of at the time

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.340
until I grew up and
moved out on my own,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.360
and realized that that
afforded me the ability

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.019
to interact with everyday life
just as a normal person, right?

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.450
As if any of us are normal.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.570
And what that meant was, well,
I'm not living with my parents

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.410
now.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.050
I have to have friends help me.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.440
And that became my life, is
inviting people into my home,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.060
and going out into the
world, and just melding

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.630
all that together to where I
had the help that I needed--

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.130
not inviting people in to
help, but inviting people in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.770
to be a part of my
life, and realizing

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.880
that if we wanted to
experience this life together,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.520
then this is how
it had to happen.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.230
And so for the past
about 12 years,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.880
I've been living on my own and
having friends take care of me.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.180
I was doing the math recently.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.610
Out of the, let's
say, 65 people that

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.610
have helped me over the past
15 years, I think one of them

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.470
might have been a
trained nurse, maybe two.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.660
So most of them are musicians,
and that's a fun side note.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.850
And almost all of them are
nerds, so that's also fun.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.580
But yeah, it's my friends
and it's my community.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.560
And because of that
community and these friends,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.130
I get to live a normal life.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.670
Not only that, but I
get to live a full life.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.570
And so about three
years ago, some--

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.730
no, four years ago.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.620
Wow, time flies, right?

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.910
About four years ago, some
of those friends and myself

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.050
decided, you know what?

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.080
We want to try and do something
without my wheelchair,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.130
because we would go
and have potlucks

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.990
at each other's houses, and
some of those had stairs,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.300
and I couldn't get
into the house.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.150
And so we would just
leave my chair outside.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.640
So we thought, well,
what if we actually

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.520
had an adventure,
where we intentionally

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.890
left my wheelchair behind?

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.830
And we decided, because we grew
up on Batman and Ninja Turtles,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.670
that we would go into
the sewer system,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.570
because that's not
handicapped accessible at all.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.030
I found myself lying one night
on my friend's coffee table

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.280
with a metal frame underneath
me from a old hiking backpack.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.070
And we took some hammocks
and wrapped them around me,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.990
and came up with this
very makeshift backpack.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.390
And we went into
the sewer system.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.650
It was two friends, Tom and
Phillip, and then a couple

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.280
other guys helping out.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.790
And for a whole
evening, we climbed

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.300
through pipes that were
probably too small and way

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.390
too filthy to be in.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.080
We sloshed through
water up to our shins

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.740
and found out later on that
there were spiders that I

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.620
couldn't see, but they could.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.400
Glad I didn't know that.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.860
I almost got my nose ripped
off by concrete at one point.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.200
It was, you know, your
average fun weekend

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.900
with some buddies from school.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.980
And about a year later, we
started asking ourselves, well,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.750
what else can we do?

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:55.070
If we can pull that off, if
we can survive, what's next?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.840
So that's when we decided that
we would do the same thing,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.920
but above ground, for
three weeks in Europe.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.770
And we proceeded to come
up with a better backpack.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.490
I thought that was a good idea,
because I wasn't going to live

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.740
for three weeks in a hammock.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.580
That was going to
be uncomfortable.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.940
So we came up with
a better backpack.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.770
And Tom and Phillip, and then
a couple of other guys, Ben

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.090
and Robbie, and two
filmmakers came together

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:34.720
from all over the United States,
and we met up in Paris, France

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.080
in the summer of 2016.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.560
And we had filmmakers to provide
proof that what we actually did

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.140
happened, because it was
so completely absurd to us.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.930
So that's the back
story of a documentary

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.730
that we ended up making.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.685
And we would like to show
it, if that's all right.

00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:02.560
Does that sound good?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.860
Cool.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.255
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.880
I was born with a disease
called spinal muscular atrophy.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.860
I'm supposed to sit
in a wheelchair,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.250
take supplements, and
maybe work on a computer.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.290
But instead, I let a bunch of
medically unqualified musicians

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.630
put me in a backpack and
carry me around the world.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.920
France to visit the home
of Django Reinhardt.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.250
England to explore the
world of Kensington.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.790
Ireland to brave the
Island of Skellig Michael.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.190
And then plenty of wiggle
room in there for adventure

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.740
to find us, if she pleased.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.928
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.150
And yeah, it was bound
to hurt, but I'm alive.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.640
And I've seeing the world as we
all were meant to see it-- big,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.760
and beautiful, and full of life.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.246
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.240
Nothing was out of reach.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.733
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.660
There is no post-credit
scene, sorry.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.820
Not this time.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.120
But yeah, something
that I really

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.450
loved about the
whole experience was

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.290
that every turn that
we took, we never had

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.660
to worry about what
was accessible,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.420
what was "wheelchair
friendly," quote unquote.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.080
And that was all because of
the people that were with me,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.620
and not only their physical
ability to carry me,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.570
but also their creativity
and their willingness

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.220
to be creative with how
we would pull things off.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.330
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.740
And so since then, we
came home from the trip.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.240
And we had such a
response from people

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.660
asking, like I said in the
film about the backpack

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.192
and about traveling, where
did you get these friends,

00:11:22.192 --> 00:11:22.710
you know?

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.440
I grow them in my backyard.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.180
No.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.000
But we wanted to give a
proper response to that.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.290
And so we started a nonprofit
called We Carry Kevan.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.650
And we'd been speaking,
sharing our story

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.700
for the past few years.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.190
But we've also been working on
providing practical application

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.980
for people.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.850
And so what that looks
like is we went back

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.170
to Deuter, the company that we
built the backpack with, and we

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:57.000
said, hey, what if we tweak this
to be more adjustable for more

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.800
needs and more people?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.260
And so they've been
working with us on that.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.760
And we're actually going to go
into production in the spring

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.110
to be able to provide
it on the market, which

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.803
is really exciting.

00:12:14.803 --> 00:12:16.470
In the meantime, we've
been able to work

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.430
with families individually and
set them up with backpacks.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.130
And the backpack
works for some people.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.620
It doesn't work for others.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.050
But the principle
behind it, which

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:33.240
is thinking outside the box,
and also people helping people

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:41.640
as true accessibility, is
really the key behind it all.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.670
And so that's what
we're running with.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.410
And so some people,
we work with them

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.750
on developing a
backpack for them.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.110
Some people, we just meet
with, and talk with, and help

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.230
them come up with other ideas.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.290
And then we're also introducing
people to each other.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.190
There's a family
that we worked with.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.570
We got them a backpack for
a trip out to the Rockies,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.440
because the Rocky Mountains
are not handicapped accessible.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.920
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.200
And this family went out there
with their six-year-old son,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.580
who has cerebral palsy.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.720
And his dad got to
carry him up onto peaks

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.950
that they would never otherwise
been able to experience

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.570
as a father and son.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.400
And that was really special.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.030
But when they came
home, I ran into the dad

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.350
one day at a coffee shop.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.410
And he said, well,
we're actually

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.880
planning to go to New York
next year and do some camping,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.710
but then go into the city.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.480
Do you have anyone in mind
that we could meet up with

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.590
and maybe they could help carry?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.440
And I had just heard from a
guy in New York City saying,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.520
hey, if you ever come,
I'd love to help carry.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.010
So we connected them and
said, well, I'm not coming,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.410
but there's this other family.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.870
Turns out the guy
works for the NYPD

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.500
and he had this whole
group of police officers

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.950
that wanted to help.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.450
And so they got this
just awesome treatment

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.450
while they were in the city,
and got carried around by police

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.520
officers, which was pretty cool.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.040
And they just got
back from that trip.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:29.970
So that's just a microcosm look
at what we're doing on a larger

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.930
scale, and so connecting
people and providing

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:40.440
backpacks and other means of
accessibility outside the box.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.590
Yeah, we also just got back from
China, which was really cool.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.160
Again, coming back from Europe,
we thought, well, what's next?

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.010
What's the next big adventure?

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.060
So that's what we did.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.150
We went to China
and spent some time

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.040
in some care centers that are
for orphans with disabilities

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.720
and provided some backpacks, but
also just hung out and played

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.840
with the kids, rolled
around on the floor, which

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.290
is what it's all about
at the end of the day.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.760
Anyways, it's a
ongoing adventure.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.740
It's a great life to live,
being able to do something

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.980
as crazy as this just
for ourselves for fun,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.260
and then realizing how
we can give back now,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.760
and that it's about a lot
more than just a couple

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.190
of guys having an
adventure around Europe.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.817
We have a few minutes, if
there are any questions.

00:15:39.817 --> 00:15:42.400
AUDIENCE: Just out of curiosity,
did you go with the same guys

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.160
to China?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.870
KEVIN CHANDLER: So it was about
half the same group, yeah.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.940
So on this trip, we had seven
of us, so four carriers,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.100
two camera guys, and myself.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.570
In China, we had three
carriers, and one camera guy,

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.405
and a translator, which
was very important.

00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:02.888
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:05.950
But also with
that, we ended up--

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.380
because we had fewer carriers--

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.660
and it did, I would
say-- it ended up

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.380
proving to be a physically
more taxing trip,

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.803
because the Great
Wall, you know, period.

00:16:17.803 --> 00:16:19.720
AUDIENCE: Is there a
documentary on that, too?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720
KEVIN CHANDLER: Not yet.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.860
We're working on that.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.210
But with that, because
we had fewer carriers,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.170
we actually, as we met people
and interacted with people,

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.870
we invited them to carry as
well, which was kind of cool.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.270
So the more, the merrier.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.100
That's what we say.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.660
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
big adventures planned next?

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.050
KEVIN CHANDLER: Oh, well, I
mean we're here in Ireland.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.250
No, we have a few ideas
of different places

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.370
we would like to go,
along the same lines.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:57.250
Now, the big thing right now
is speaking and interacting

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.030
with families.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.510
That's become our new adventure.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.510
But as far as our next
big trip, it will probably

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.240
be a few years, but
we've talked about doing

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.119
a camping trip in New
Zealand, like actual tents

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.940
and that sort of thing.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.280
But we've also talked
about going to India

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.440
and doing some exploring there.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.089
And yeah, we have some
different ideas, so we'll see.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.000
The big thing is
with each trip, we

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.240
look at what we
would like to do,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.180
and then we see what doors
open, and then we go through.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.180
We wanted to go to China.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.900
We knew that at the
end of the Europe trip.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.150
And it wasn't until
probably eight months later

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.500
that we just met the right
people and doors started

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.080
opening.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.740
And so we decided
to actually go.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.720
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.830
AUDIENCE: I have
one more question.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.780
Based on your experience
and your family,

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.900
what would you
recommend to parents who

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.000
have small children with SMA?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.160
Like some best practices.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.290
Like, what do you think your
parents did really well?

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.670
KEVIN CHANDLER: Oh, man.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.180
No, no, that's a big question.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.910
You know, I've had a lot of
conversations with my parents

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.930
over the past couple
of years, because I've

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.440
met a lot more families
with disabilities.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.060
And I've sat down
with my parents

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.870
and been like, what do
I say to these parents?

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.130
I'm the kid.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.870
I'm not the parent.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.345
And yeah, and my parents--

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.600
like I said at the
beginning, they

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.540
raised us as normal
as possible, which

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.790
took a lot more work for them.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.370
But it was definitely more
worth it in the long run.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.760
Also, realizing that
the people around you

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.340
aren't going to get
it fully, but that

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.780
doesn't mean that
they don't care

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.490
and that they won't help out.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.220
And so inviting people into
your life, into your home,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.190
is a big part of it.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.280
It's going to be
uncomfortable, but it's also

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.860
going to be really rich
in the end for them

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.236
as well as for you.

00:19:17.236 --> 00:19:19.850
So, yeah, yeah.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.096
That's a little bit, I know.

00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:26.630
Usually when I interact
with families or parents,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.090
it's a few hours of really
getting into the meat of it,

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.830
but that's a bit.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.515
[LAUGHS]

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.560
AUDIENCE: Kevin, I have
a question for you.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.716
So apologies for what happened
on the Irish motorway.

00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:43.880
It gave us an insight, though,
into your mental strength

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.800
and your resilience.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.010
KEVIN CHANDLER: My mental
strength and resilience.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.520
AUDIENCE: Can you talk to us
a little bit about that and--

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.395
KEVIN CHANDLER: Sure.

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:52.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.920
KEVIN CHANDLER: Yeah, you
know, I would say just

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.620
like the physical strength
that the guys provide to me,

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.710
I would say emotionally,
and mentally,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.280
and spiritually, it's
the same in that we

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.760
have a joke that people are
like, oh, you're so brave.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.330
I'm like, I have to be brave
for five seconds to say, sure,

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:18.930
why not?

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.292
And then I can be
yelling at them

00:20:22.292 --> 00:20:24.000
the rest of the time,
what are you doing?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.010
Why are we doing this?

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.410
And I'm on their back.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.550
What am I supposed to do?

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:36.710
But I think that's the thing,
is having these friends

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.920
that not only carry you, but in
the morning when you're like,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.790
I just don't feel like
getting out of this bed,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.070
and they will really get you out
of the bed and keep you going.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.280
And we have a lot
of conversations,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.950
a lot of very open
conversations,

00:20:54.950 --> 00:21:00.890
about how we're doing
emotionally with things.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:06.340
And so we carry each
other through that.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.040
I think that's pretty applicable
whether you have disability

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.630
or not.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:17.060
We all need people in our lives
that can speak life into us

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.620
and speak truth into us.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.570
And we can do the
same right back.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.550
And so I would like
to say that I'm just

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.790
brilliant person
with this great,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.430
was it constitution,
to forge the way.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.918
But I could not do a
single thing on my own.

00:21:38.918 --> 00:21:40.460
AUDIENCE: A question
on the community

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.680
that now is kind of a
[INAUDIBLE] building

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.600
since you started it,
and now a lot of people

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.210
would reach out to
you to ask for advice.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.020
Are you planning, or maybe
it's already work in progress,

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.450
to build a proper
online community,

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:58.220
like CouchSurfing [INAUDIBLE]
or something that people can--

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.170
they know that it
exists, and they

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:06.515
can ask questions or reach out,
like a proper online community?

00:22:06.515 --> 00:22:07.390
KEVIN CHANDLER: Yeah.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.230
Oh, I don't want
to get in trouble,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.495
because we're at Google.

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.006
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:12.006 --> 00:22:16.010
But for me
personally, I've found

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:21.280
there are a lot of
support groups for parents

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.260
who have kids with
disabilities or individuals

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.380
with disabilities.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.440
And there are a lot of
support groups online.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.680
But what's really, I would
say, lacking in our culture

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.490
right now is people actually
having that face-to-face

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.420
and interacting.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.560
And so we're definitely going
to provide information online

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.580
and provide a lot of resources.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.280
But something that we're
working on right now

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.670
is developing weekend events
all over the world eventually.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.580
We'll start with one.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.880
But weekend events
that for now will

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.360
center around the backpack, but
hopefully will open up more.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.390
And it will be families
with disabilities

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.710
and able-bodied people
who want to be involved,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.130
but don't know how.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.180
And so breaking down
those barriers--

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.970
an icebreaker dinner
party, you know?

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.800
You bring these friends
and these friends,

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.640
because you're the
mutual acquaintance.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.260
Then you say, hey, you
guys would get along great,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.100
and you put him in
a room together.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.720
So we want to do that
everywhere, and just

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.950
introduce people, and
also promote the concept

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:45.040
that you might be coming
to help or you might

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.320
be coming because you
need help, but these

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.630
are all people involved.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.650
And people need friends,
and people have feelings,

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.330
and people need
support on both sides.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.360
And so hopefully speaking
some truth into that,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:07.240
because it is easier to fall
into that categorizing yourself

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.730
of someone who needs help,
and so you're here to help me,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.350
and I don't care
about your feelings,

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.960
or my needs are more important
than yours, or vise versa.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:24.710
And if we can just build
relationships around friendship

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:29.570
first and foremost, then I
think a lot more gets done,

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.090
and it's a richer
experience for everyone.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.465
So that's what we're
working on, yeah, yeah.

00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:36.763
SPEAKER: It's a lovely
note to finish on.

00:24:36.763 --> 00:24:38.805
Thank you very much, Kevan,
for being here today,

00:24:38.805 --> 00:24:39.627
and to your team.

00:24:39.627 --> 00:24:40.960
KEVIN CHANDLER: Yeah, thank you.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.310
