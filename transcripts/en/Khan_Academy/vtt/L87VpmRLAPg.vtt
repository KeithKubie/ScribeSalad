00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.709
- [Voiceover] All right Kim,
so we left off in I guess,

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.040
early-mid 1861, you have
Lincoln gets inagurated,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.660
Fort Sumter which is kind
of the first real conflict

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.852
of the war, if not the first major battle.

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:18.081
Lincoln forms his volunteer army, and then

00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:20.552
the rest of the southern
states secede, four more

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:22.213
states secede.

00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:23.106
- [Kim] Right.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.289
- [Voiceover] And then what
was the first major conflict?

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.145
- [Kim] So the first
major conflict comes after

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:29.248
a number of months.

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:31.906
There are a couple of little
skirmishes here and there,

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.547
but nothing super large

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:38.153
until about 60,000 troops

00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:41.845
meet outside of Manassas, Virginia,

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:44.608
at a place called Bull Run.

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:47.626
An interesting fact, I think, is that

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:52.131
Union armies and
Confederate armies actually

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:54.569
named battles different
things, if you've ever been

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:55.706
confused about this.

00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:58.283
The Union armies tended
to name battles after

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:01.847
bodies of water, whereas
the Confederate armies

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:04.425
tended to name them by nearby towns.

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.990
So if you've ever heard
the Battle of Manassas

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.602
and the Battle of Bull Run,
they're the same thing,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.342
it's just the Union officers
are talking about this creek,

00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:15.801
Bull Run, whereas the
Confederates are talking about

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.392
the town nearby.

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:18.622
- [Voiceover] I see, and the 60,000 troops

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:19.690
between the two of them.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.666
- [Kim] Right.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:25.666
So they meet, and this is very
close to Washington, D.C.,

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.268
so much so that people go
out and they bring picnics

00:01:29.268 --> 00:01:31.084
to watch this battle.

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.199
- [Voiceover] They think it's
going to be entertaining.

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:33.267
- [Kim] Yeah, they think
it's going to be like

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:34.927
a football game.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:37.608
And it is not like a football game.

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:42.509
It is a gigantic battle,
800 people die that day,

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.048
which doesn't sound like a lot to us, but

00:01:46.048 --> 00:01:50.882
it was the most deadly battle
ever in American history

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:52.943
up until that point.

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:57.043
So it's a Confederate victory,
which is very surprising

00:01:57.043 --> 00:02:01.095
to the Union, because they
think that they have such

00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:04.299
superior forces that this
is really going to be

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.214
a very short war.

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:10.161
And this is a quick rebellion, in 90 days

00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.959
we're going to be able to, you know,

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.037
suppress this rebellion and that'll be it.

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:17.661
But Bull Run is really the first sign that

00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.319
this is going to be a major war.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.931
It's not going to be quick
and it is going to be

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:23.918
very deadly.

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:24.812
- [Voiceover] This was July of...

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:26.855
- [Both] 1861.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:30.315
- [Voiceover] Okay, so now
it's clear to both sides,

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:32.091
especially, I guess you
could say the North,

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:34.134
that this is not going to be a short war.

00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:36.038
So they need to prepare.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:38.406
How are they approaching this?

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:41.541
- [Kim] Well, so both
sides have some advantages

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:43.236
and disadvantages.

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:45.697
For the South, they have some of the same

00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:49.145
advantages that the United
States would have had

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:52.845
during the war for independence.

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:56.330
They have home court
advantage, we could say,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.825
which is that they know
the territory very well

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:04.155
and also there's a real
incentive for people to

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:06.349
protect their homes, right.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.845
You're gonna care more
about a war that's happening

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:11.666
on your property than a
war that's gonna happen

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.744
very far away.

00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:17.946
The other advantage that they have is

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:21.673
just really, really terrific
military leadership.

00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:25.364
So they have Robert E. Lee,

00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:28.034
who is

00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:32.759
widely considered the
greatest general of his era.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.999
He's truly a military genius.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.354
He, in fact, was offered a
commission in the Union army

00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:42.534
but when Virginia seceded,
he went with Virginia.

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:45.413
He preferred his home state.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:49.592
So he is a terrific general.

00:03:49.592 --> 00:03:54.433
The Union is gonna really
struggle to come up with

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.474
the kind of military
leadership that the South has.

00:03:57.474 --> 00:03:59.225
- [Voiceover] Who is in
charge of the Union or the

00:03:59.225 --> 00:03:59.887
Northern armies?

00:03:59.887 --> 00:04:00.862
You said, the United States Army.

00:04:00.862 --> 00:04:02.371
- [Kim] The United States Army.

00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:06.005
The first general that
Lincoln puts in charge is

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:07.709
George B. McClellan.

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:12.474
This is problematic for a lot of reasons.

00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:15.736
One is that George
McClellan is a Democrat,

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:18.731
so he doesn't agree
politically with Lincoln.

00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.192
I think he would have
preferred peace, in fact

00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:24.698
in 1864 he runs against
Lincoln for President

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:28.575
on a platform of letting
the South go, basically.

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:35.164
And so Lincoln is struggling

00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.272
to match the South when it comes to

00:04:37.272 --> 00:04:39.345
military leadership, but he does have

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:41.432
other advantages.

00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:46.383
For one thing, there are four
times as many free people

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:49.181
in the North as there are in the South.

00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:51.403
- [Voiceover] And you made
the point, free people.

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:52.819
- [Kim] Right.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:53.876
- [Voiceover] Because the
South, as you mentioned,

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:58.275
it has a majority of the
population was not free.

00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:00.725
- [Kim] I wouldn't say a
majority of the population,

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.604
in many states,
- [Voiceover] In Deep South.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.299
- [Kim] In the Deep South states, right.

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:08.758
But so there are only
about 9,000,000 people

00:05:08.758 --> 00:05:11.833
living in the South, and
of those 9,000,000 people

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:14.899
3,500,000 to 4,000,000
of them are enslaved.

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:16.316
So they're not going to be fighting

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.312
to continue the institution of slavery.

00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:24.606
By contrast, the North
has 22,000,000 people

00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:30.684
and it also has a
terrific industrial base.

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:34.241
One of the major cultural differences

00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.994
between the North and South that leads to

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:38.257
the Civil War is that
the South is primarily

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:41.636
agrarian, and the North
becomes very industrial.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:44.073
But industry is really helpful in a war.

00:05:44.073 --> 00:05:47.278
They've got miles and
miles of railroad tracks

00:05:47.278 --> 00:05:49.181
which means that they can move supplies

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.711
very quickly, and they also
have hundreds and hundreds

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:57.110
of factories that make it easy
for them to make munitions.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.074
- [Voiceover] This is the middle of the

00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.676
Industrial Revolution
- [Kim] Right.

00:05:59.676 --> 00:06:02.950
- [Voiceover] and an
industrial base matters a lot.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.618
And so what's, given the North's

00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:09.950
advantages and the South's advantages,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.179
what's their strategies, how do they try

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:13.978
to play to their strengths?

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:16.939
- [Kim] Right, so the South, they

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.525
are basically trying to outlast the North.

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:26.121
They know that they have this territory,

00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:28.675
and if the North wants them to come back

00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:30.080
into the Union, they're going to have to

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.030
conquer this territory.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.291
And even though it's hard to kind of tell,

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.578
the territory of the
South is actually larger

00:06:38.578 --> 00:06:40.633
than Western Europe.
- [Voiceover] Wow.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:44.615
- [Kim] So in a way, the
North has a bigger job

00:06:44.615 --> 00:06:47.459
to conquer the South than the Allies did

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:50.315
in World War II, to conquer Europe.

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:55.016
So they know that the
North is gonna have to

00:06:55.016 --> 00:06:58.058
fight a war to conquer them, whereas

00:06:58.058 --> 00:07:02.920
the South just needs to
win the war of waiting.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.207
- [Voiceover] Of attrition.

00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:08.813
- [Kim] Yeah, they're
hoping that the North

00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:10.833
will get tired of fighting.

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.760
- [Voiceover] Fighting
in another person's land,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.977
you're not defending your own land.

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.892
- [Kim] Right, and they
know that there are

00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:20.212
plenty of whites in the North who don't

00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:21.292
care about slavery.

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:23.196
It's not in their..

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:24.217
- [Voiceover] They're
indifferent, what do they care.

00:07:24.217 --> 00:07:25.379
- [Kim] Yeah, what do they care, in fact

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:29.152
some people are afraid that
if the slaves are freed

00:07:29.152 --> 00:07:31.334
in the South, they're
all gonna come up North

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.178
and they're going to compete for labor

00:07:34.178 --> 00:07:35.316
with poor white people.

00:07:35.316 --> 00:07:37.382
So there are plenty of whites in the North

00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:40.517
who have no interest in the slaves

00:07:40.517 --> 00:07:42.758
in the South being free, even if that's

00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:45.672
not an early war aim of the North.

00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:48.376
So the South is hoping that maybe they can

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:51.348
win a couple of really
big battles that show

00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:53.275
this isn't gonna be a big war.

00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:54.947
- [Voiceover] Or it'd be
so painful for the North

00:07:54.947 --> 00:07:57.977
to try to conquer the South, so to speak.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.788
- [Kim] And they're
also trying to show that

00:07:59.788 --> 00:08:02.388
they're serious, to an
international audience,

00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:05.975
particularly England, because
the South is producing

00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:09.806
3/4 of the world's supply
of cotton at this point,

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:13.980
and England is an
industrial nation which is

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:19.580
built in many cases around
textile manufacturing.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.517
So they're hoping that if they show that

00:08:22.517 --> 00:08:24.804
they are serious about
their own nationhood

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.637
that they're going to win
this war against the North

00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:29.842
that England will
intercede on their behalf

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.618
to protect their supply of cotton.

00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:32.780
- [Voiceover] So this would
be an appeal to England

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.242
on purely economic grounds.

00:08:34.242 --> 00:08:35.334
- [Kim] Right.

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:35.983
- [Voiceover] Fascinating.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:39.258
Because England, they didn't have slavery.

00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:40.279
- [Kim] No.

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.554
- [Voiceover] But purely
economically, at least,

00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:43.541
appeal to them.

00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:46.780
- [Kim] So on the other
hand, the North's strategy

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.333
is what they call "The Anaconda Plan".

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.154
And the idea of the Anaconda Plan is that

00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:56.497
they are going to squeeze
the South, economically.

00:08:56.497 --> 00:08:57.856
What they want to do,

00:08:57.856 --> 00:08:58.679
- [Voiceover] Like an anaconda.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.154
- [Kim] Like an anaconda, right.

00:09:00.154 --> 00:09:04.437
So they want to blockade
the Atlantic ocean

00:09:04.437 --> 00:09:06.933
because they don't want
the South to be able

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:09.755
to sell their cotton to
get money, and they also

00:09:09.755 --> 00:09:11.971
don't want the South to be able to buy

00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:13.841
the kinds of things that
they're going to need

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:16.871
to make a war happen.

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:20.761
They also want to control
the Mississippi River

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:24.892
cuz that's the real main artery of

00:09:24.892 --> 00:09:26.635
commerce in the West.

00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:28.979
Anyone who is gonna be
shipping their grain

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:31.035
or their cotton is gonna be shipping it

00:09:31.035 --> 00:09:33.914
down the Mississippi to
the port of New Orleans.

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:38.115
So the Union hopes that
if they can basically

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:40.159
surround the South, and make sure nothing

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:42.133
gets in or out, then
eventually they're just

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:43.258
gonna starve to death.

00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:44.373
- [Voiceover] This also
goes through the industrial

00:09:44.373 --> 00:09:47.032
bays, it can also produce
more ships and etc.

00:09:47.032 --> 00:09:49.167
- [Kim] Right, and it takes
them a while to do that,

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:52.732
in fact at the start of
the war, the Union only has

00:09:52.732 --> 00:09:55.298
90 ships.

00:09:55.298 --> 00:09:57.689
I've heard it compared
to "Five leaky boats".

00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:00.672
Right, we're not a naval
power at this point

00:10:00.672 --> 00:10:03.088
and so it's gonna take them a while to

00:10:03.088 --> 00:10:04.874
build up the kind of naval power they need

00:10:04.874 --> 00:10:09.252
to do that, cuz this is
3500 miles of coastline

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:11.435
that they're gonna need to patrol.

00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:13.070
- [Voiceover] I'm just
looking at this map, not

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.405
getting too much into
details, it looks like

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.752
a lot of the battles
are concentrated right

00:10:16.752 --> 00:10:19.014
in this Virginia/Maryland area, and then

00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:20.850
there's more, it's a
little bit more sparse

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.647
but you have a few that
are in the Deep South

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:26.885
and along this Mississippi corridor.

00:10:26.885 --> 00:10:28.732
- [Kim] There are two major theaters

00:10:28.732 --> 00:10:29.370
of the war.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.926
We'd say the Eastern Theater, and this is

00:10:30.926 --> 00:10:34.849
that 100-mile corridor between

00:10:34.849 --> 00:10:38.204
Washington and Richmond,
where a huge amount

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.166
of the fighting takes place.

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:43.370
It's important to
remember that the capital

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.008
of the Confederacy and the capital of the

00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:47.584
United States are only 100 miles apart.

00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:49.315
- [Voiceover] This capital
is, you can't see it

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.289
on this map but it's
someplace in the middle

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:54.062
of Virginia, and then D.C.,
literally, as you mentioned

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:55.246
you said it was 100 miles apart?

00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:57.453
- [Kim] Yep.

00:10:57.453 --> 00:10:59.154
- [Voiceover] Fascinating.
