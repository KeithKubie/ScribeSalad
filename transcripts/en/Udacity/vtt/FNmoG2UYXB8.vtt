Our job here is to figure out how many of these pictures are in portrait

00:00:03.112 --> 00:00:09.640
orientation. It's a counting task. We start by declaring counter. Now, we want

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.948
to look through all of the elements of the array list. And since we want to go

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:18.750
through all of them, we can use the enhanced for loop. We consider the picture

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.239
a match if it's taller than it is wide. And it seems a good idea in this case

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.998
to make a comment to explain that. And when we do have a match, then we

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:31.514
increment the counter, and that's all. When we run the program, we're told that

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:35.701
there are three matching pictures. It would be kind of nice to know which ones they

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.929
are, and we'll get to that soon.
