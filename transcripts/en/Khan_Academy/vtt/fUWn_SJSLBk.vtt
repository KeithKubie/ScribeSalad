00:00:00.494 --> 00:00:01.416
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can find the limit

00:00:01.416 --> 00:00:05.230
as h approaches zero of
five log of two plus h

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.063
minus five log of two,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.198
all of that over h.

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:11.603
And I'll give you a little bit of a hint

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:12.728
because I know you're
about to pause the video

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:14.112
and try to work through it.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:16.294
Think of your derivative properties,

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:19.187
especially the derivatives
of logarithmic functions,

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.315
especially logarithmic
functions in this case

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.672
with a base 10.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:24.444
If someone just writes
log without the base,

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:28.027
you can just assume that that
is a 10 right over there.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.725
So pause the video, and see
if you can work through it.

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.816
Alright, so the key here
is to remember that if

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:35.899
I have, if I have f of x,

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:38.603
let me do it over here,

00:00:38.603 --> 00:00:39.585
I'll do it over here.

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:40.418
F of x

00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:43.247
and I want to find

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:44.164
f prime of,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.280
let's say f prime of some number,

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:50.571
let's say a,

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:52.422
this is going to be equal to

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:54.505
the limit as x, or sorry,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.604
as h approaches zero is one
way of thinking about it,

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:01.771
as h approaches zero of f of a plus h,

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:04.452
minus f of a,

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:07.779
all of that over h.

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:10.595
So this looks pretty close
to that limit definition,

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:12.465
except we have these fives here.

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:15.542
But lucky for us we can
factor out those fives,

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.156
and we could factor them out,

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:19.658
we could factor them out out front here,

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:22.157
but if you just have a scale
or times the expression,

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:23.636
we know from our limit properties

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:26.312
we can actually take those
out of the limit themselves.

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:27.191
So let's do that,

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:28.733
let's take both of these fives,

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:29.856
and factor them out,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.490
and so this whole thing
is going to simplify to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.157
five times the limit

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:38.022
as h approaches zero of log of two plus h,

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:43.984
minus, minus log of two,

00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:49.355
all of that over h.

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:54.348
Now, you might recognize
what we have in yellow here,

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:55.229
cause think about it,

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.652
what this is,

00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:59.211
if we had f of x is equal to

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:00.044
log of x,

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.524
and we wanted to know what f prime of,

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:09.206
well actually let's say f prime of two is,

00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:11.923
well this would be the limit

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:14.423
as h approaches zero of log of

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:17.948
two plus h,

00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:18.865
two plus h,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.216
minus log of two,

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:23.205
minus log of two,

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.429
all of that over h.

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.064
So this is really just a,

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.009
what we see there,

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:29.978
this by definition

00:02:29.978 --> 00:02:32.183
this right over here is,

00:02:32.183 --> 00:02:33.683
is f prime of two.

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:36.632
If f of x is log of x,

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:38.522
this is f prime of two,

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:39.772
f prime of two.

00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:41.850
So can we figure that out?

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.213
If f of x is log of x,

00:02:44.213 --> 00:02:46.083
what is f prime of x?

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:49.095
F prime of x, we don't need
to use the limit definition.

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:50.296
In fact the limit definition is quite

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:52.285
hard to evaluate this limit,

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:53.958
but we know how to take the derivative

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.223
of logarithmic functions.

00:02:56.223 --> 00:02:57.975
So f prime of x

00:02:57.975 --> 00:02:59.471
is going to be equal to

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:03.155
one over the natural log of our base,

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.847
our base here we already
talked about that,

00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:06.205
that is 10.

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:07.996
So one over natural log of 10,

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:08.829
times,

00:03:10.438 --> 00:03:11.688
times, times x.

00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:15.144
If this was a natural log,

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.231
well, then, this would be one over

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.845
natural log of e times x,

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.046
natural log of e is just one,

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:21.247
so that's where you get the one over x,

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:22.468
but if you have any other base

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:23.866
you put the natural log of that base

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.618
right over here in the denominator.

00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:27.469
So what is f prime of two?

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.886
F prime of two is

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:31.702
one over the natural log of 10,

00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:32.535
times two.

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:36.368
So this whole thing has simplified,

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:40.365
this whole thing is equal
to five times this business.

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:41.447
So I could actually just write it as

00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:43.447
it's equal to five over,

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.925
five over the natural log of 10,

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.599
natural log of 10,

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.740
times two,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.477
I could have written it
as two natural log of 10s.

00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:55.722
The key here for this type of exercise,

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:56.785
you might be a little let me see

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:57.710
if I can evaluate this limit?

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.817
You're like whoa, this looks
a lot like the derivative

00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:01.372
of a logarithmic function,

00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:04.129
especially the derivative
when x is equal to two,

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.019
if we could just factor these fives out.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.023
So you factor out the fives,

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:09.071
and say hey, this is,
this is the derivative

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.488
of log of x when x is equal to two,

00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:16.966
and so we know how to take
the derivative of log of x.

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:20.096
If you don't know we have
videos where we prove this.

00:04:20.096 --> 00:04:22.342
Where you take the
derivatives of logarithms

00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:24.526
with bases other than e,

00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:26.554
and you just use that to actually

00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:28.169
and you find the derivative,

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.193
and you evaluate it at two,

00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:30.943
and then you're done!
