00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Aren't we suspicious of this number?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Most of the homes here are in the $100K range.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There is one of $325K and one of $2.4 million.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The mean doesn't really reflect this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It makes you feel that the average home in the neighborhood is $492,000.00.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But that's not a good description of what's happening.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Instead, we have a situation where we can graph the price and the frequency,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we have a peak around $130K.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But then there is a really, really long tail that gets us all the way to $2.4 million.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the sad part is rather than finding the peak over here,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we find ourselves somewhere in the middle.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the reason is this one number of $2.4 million

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
drags us to the right side and really has a strong impact on the mean,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which ends up to be just below $500K.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is exactly where we get the second M, the so-called median.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The median is a different statistic that seeks to find

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the typical house price in this list--the one in the middle.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Put differently, if you sorted those, the median picks the one in the middle.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm sure you can do this in your head,

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so please enter the median house price over here.
