&gt;&gt;COMMENTATOR: Hi everyone. Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.890
It's great pleasure for me to introduce Tom
Bissell.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.809
Tom is the author of two previous books of
non-fiction: Chasing the Sea and The Father

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.380
of All Things, as well as, the wonderful short
story collection God Lives in Saint Petersburg,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.640
which won him many well deserved accolades.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.029
In his newest book, Extra Lives, Tom shares
with us his long-time fascination with videogames.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.840
It's neither a history of the medium, nor
a survey of the industry, nor a technical

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:38.430
treatise on game design; but rather, it is
one man's opinions on what playing games feels

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.070
like, an examination of why videogames matter,
and why they do not matter more.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.050
Whether or not you're already the gaming addict
that Tom reveals himself to be; Extra Lives

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.410
provides a unique view of what these games
have become and makes a strong and provocative

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.410
case for their continuing relevance and significance.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.570
Please join me in welcoming to YouTube, Tom
Bissell.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:19.320
&gt;&gt;TOM BISSELL: Everyone, thank you for coming
out today. It's a real pleasure to be here

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.180
and I don't know if the camera's ever gonna
turn around and look at this room, but I really,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.591
I really like this room 'cause of it makes
me feel like I'm trying to explain to the

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:30.240
Galactic Senate why the Trade Federation invaded
Naboo.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.619
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] [PAUSE]

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.799
And I think I could make that case.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:46.310
[PAUSE DEEP BREATH] So- [PAUSE] As, Dan said,
the game's called Extra Lives, Why Videogames

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.860
Matter. And a couple of the reviews that I've
gotten have claimed to-have enjoyed the book

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.130
whilst, while also expressing some frustration
that I don't really make the case why videogames

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.810
matter. That rather I make the case that they
matter to me.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.560
I've kind of, I've conceded that point a little
bit. I- I think that there's probably something

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.500
to that. Maybe I do not make that case, so-I'd
like to take a few minutes before I start

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.890
actually reading a, a little brief part of
this book why- why I think games do in fact

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.890
matter.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.790
So let me, let me just ask the room here.
How-How many of you guys consider yourselves

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.060
gamers-in the room?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.330
[PAUSE LOOKS AROUND]

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.900
Wow! That's about half. Interesting. So this
is-there'll be some internecine arguments

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.260
and bloodshed at the end of this session,
I hope, while we all debate whether or not

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.460
they do, in fact, matter.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:45.840
So, the first videogame is genuinely regarded
as a thing called "Tennis for Two", which

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.349
was invented in the late 1950's by [PAUSE]
an engineer, the guy who actually invented

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.060
the timers that were used on the atomic bombs
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.060
II.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.640
He-He later became an-an engineer and so there
was some open house, I think at MIT that they

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:14.340
were having; and this guy ginned up this very
simple device ta, it was basically, it was

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.130
like a proto-palm that this guy invented.
And what's funny about that is, you know,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.030
15 years later, whatever it was when palm
finally, went- when palm dropped nationally,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.269
it was still basically the same thing.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.800
And so, it's these two things shooting a ball
at each other, it's repetitive, it's kind

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.300
of like a digital approximation of an-an athletic
activity. It's repetitive, it's competitive,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.780
and it had to do with like the same thing
over and over again until someone failed and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.159
someone won. So that's how games sort of begin.
They begin in this sort of digital approximation

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.700
of something that happens over and over and
over again.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.049
And then the next wave of like popular games,
you know, you get in the late 1970s, late

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:02.470
1980s, you start seeing games like Donkey
Kong and Pacman. And suddenly, these are goal-oriented

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.220
activities with a very vague storytelling
overlay.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.269
Like, for instance, Pacman has cut scenes,
which are interstitial things that go on between

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.480
bits of game play. And so, you realize that
there's history between Pacman and the ghosts.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.690
There-there's something between them. And
they've obviously shared -- there's some bad

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.690
blood there.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.100
And, it's not storytelling the way we have
traditionally come to understand it; but it's

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.520
definitely there's something more to the game
than just the activity of going through these-these-these-these

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.340
passageways. That the game designer actually
wants you to feel that there is something

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.040
narratively going on here.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.710
And Donkey Kong is the same way. We don't
really know why Donkey Kong has captured Mario's

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.729
girlfriend; but he has and he has to get her
back. And so, there's this-s, why did she

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.150
fall into his grasp? Why does she maybe not
seem like she's fighting it quite as strong

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.050
as she could be? Does she, does she actually
like Donkey Kong? These are all things you

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.981
can think about within the parameters of the
Donkey Kong story. This kind of vague thing

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:08.350
that happens in the game.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.270
So then after that, a lot of the big, commercial
games-s-s-s, the-the-the-the pendulum sorta

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.780
swung the other way. They were no longer goal-oriented
activities with the vague storytelling overlay.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.400
They were actually a storytelling medium that
were organized around successfully obtaining

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.761
goals. And so these, this is where the games
that I'm kind of interested in come into this

00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:36.300
and why I think games matter.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.690
And this form of storytelling that the games
started doing in the early 90s, late 80s,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.710
wherever you wanna date it from, wasn't really
very good for a long time for all sorts of

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.710
technical reasons that we can talk about later.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.120
But, I think we can concede that the knock
on games for a long time was the stories weren't

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.970
as good as stories in traditional medium because
well as a game the story was supposed to be

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.600
stupid. It didn't matter. In a way it didn't.
What did matter if the game was fun?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.870
Well, by 2005-2006, I started to notice the
game's storytelling was actually getting pretty

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.169
good, and more and more designers seemed less
satisfied with the-it's a videogame, it's

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.470
supposed to be stupid-approach to game design.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:28.250
And so, why I think games are important is
that however garish and clumsy and sometimes

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.300
ridiculous they seem, that I do think that
they constitute an entirely new form of storytelling,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.150
and moreover a really important one because
the rules of this form of storytelling are

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.080
not really very well established yet. For
instance-do you have a silent protagonist

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.980
or a speaking protagonist? Do you use cut
scenes? Or not use cut scenes? What is environmental

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:54.810
storytelling and how can games use that to
their advantage? How useful is exposition

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.910
in a game?

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.460
There's all very-within game design circles
these are all semi-heated topics that people

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.259
are making games endorsing various design
principles, and you see these things worked

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.900
out now. Just about every year, a couple of
videogames come out the really reset the table

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.650
when it comes to what we can expect from videogames'
storytelling. And there is not another medium

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:23.210
that I know of that is so open to sudden,
swift decisive game-changing sort of developments;

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.220
and that's what I find really exciting about
it.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.480
And this is why I focus in this book on narrative
games; it's why I talk about narrative games.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:42.259
Partially because I'm a writer myself, I'm
a fiction writer so storytelling is my fascination.

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:45.590
It's my passion. It's what I'm most interested
in.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.560
So there's a lot of hard-core game people,
a lot of people who seriously love their games

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.770
who kind of don't like narrative games and
think the narrative game is kind of a dead

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.690
end. And they're more interested in the mechanics
of play and how you tell stories just through

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.310
play without all those bothersome, clunky,
storytelling crap that games have never done

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.840
very well to begin with. And I have sympathy
for that position.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.319
But I ultimately, for me, I-I kind of reject
it because I think that there is a reason

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:11.200
why that the game medium desperately wants
to become a storytelling medium and I think

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.410
it does. You can see it. I think it desperately
wants to become a storytelling medium because

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.910
human beings desperately love to be told stories.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:23.380
And so my passion and my argument is that
I don't want game narratives to be unnecessarily

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:32.400
stupid, anymore. And-and that's kind of why
I wrote this book, and I wanna distinguish

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:39.520
between unnecessarily stupid things in games
and things that are kind of core to the game

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.520
experience.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.570
My girlfriend is an actor and I just came
back from Texas seeing her perform in a couple

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.430
uh Shakespearean performances. One of which
was Much Ado About Nothing and the other which

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.860
was Hamlet. And I realized watching these
performances that there are all of these core

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.029
artificialities to the stage.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:57.360
Like the Shakespearean soliloquy's about as
ridiculous as a convention as you could possibly

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.630
think. When one character turns to the audience
and speaks his heart while people are standing

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.180
two feet away from him, and we're supposed
that this is-that this is not obviously a

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:10.220
realistic depiction of what is supposed to
be going on in the play world. It's a stylized

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.430
approximation of something that's going on
in the character's head.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.520
So games obviously have this kind of stuff
happening all the time. And novels happen

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.380
in chapters, which is also a very weird, artificially,
arbitrary kind of convention to the form that

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.460
we don't really question.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:32.959
So- what I think games need to be doing more
of is learning how to soften these things

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:37.580
that seem ridiculous into things that seem
acceptably ridiculous within the medium; and

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.350
separating those from the things that are
unnecessarily ridiculous and just coming up

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:47.630
with some very stronger ground rules as to
how the medium works best.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:54.270
And I'm sure all of you have heard the "Are
games art?" question, and I'm not going to

00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:01.630
address that much beyond to say, it's the
wrong question. It's not the question is not,

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.620
"Are games art?" but the question is, "Can
artists express themselves through this medium?"

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.220
And I think the answer to that question is,
"Absolutely, yes!"

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.400
And a lot of the basis of people saying games
are not art comes down to this weird misunderstanding

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.540
that because games are quote "games" and because
they have goals, that like chess, or like

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.630
football, or like basketball they can't really
be art.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.170
Roger Ebert's position is that Michael Jordan's
not an artist. And that is true, but Michael

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.540
Jordan is also not telling a story.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:37.350
And I think any medium that is- serves as
a storytelling medium provides a basis for

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.470
an artistic experience.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:49.130
'Cause to me an artistic experience-whether
it's like a good artistic experience or a

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:58.180
bad artistic experience or a high or a low
art artistic experience-to me an artistic

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:05.130
experiences allows you to go into something
created by another person or another group

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:32.110
of people and come out of it transformed somehow-emotionally.
And some games have done that to me. And I'm

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:40.470
sure that some games have done that to those
of you who game. Maybe not as many as we'd

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.470
like but it-it's definitely happened.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:50.890
And so I think the biggest problem with this
question for a lot of people who are ignorant

00:11:50.890 --> 00:12:02.829
of the medium is that just-just-just this
term game gets in the way, videogame. It just

00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:03.829
sounds so ridiculous.

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:07.990
And I think that everyone agrees that it's
the worst title for something ever. But I

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:15.470
think we're kind of stuck with it; but I would
also remind you that thinking about "movie"

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:30.170
for a minute it's a -- [CHUCKLES] -- it's
a pretty dumb name for that medium as well.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:44.730
Something-a movie is something that moves.
And it's better than talkie though, I suppose.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:54.399
So I would hope that at some point this idea
of things being games or game-like -- that

00:12:54.399 --> 00:13:01.520
all the childish, adolescent associations
we have with the idea of games will-will sort

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.540
of fade.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:12.250
And I think it is also why videogame -- in
my book I use the two word, I represent it

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:19.560
as two words "video game" whereas most of
the real serious critics and game designers

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.670
I know all prefer to use the one word spelling
of it. And I now think that the one word spelling

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:35.290
of it is a way to sorta get away from this-this-this
[Pause] the childish game like association

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:46.339
that we have with 'em so I really regret having
spelled it with two words throughout this

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:47.720
entire book.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.150
So egg is on [SIGHS] is on my face.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:56.340
I'm here to read a-a little bit of Chapter
Two. Which is a Chapter called "Head Shots".

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.400
I'm going to read the first half of it. And,
it's about, about an experience I had playing

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.680
games, god, about four...thirteen years ago
now. And some of you may recognize this game

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.389
and some of you may not.

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:07.389
[PAUSE]

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.310
And-I will just start.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.310
[Pause]

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:22.050
"So it begins here, in your stepfather's darkened
living room, with you hunched over, watching

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:28.190
as a dateline title card '1998, July', forcefully
types itself across the television screen.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:35.270
1998, July? Why not England, London? Why not
'A time once upon'?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:44.710
"A narrator dude views to describe Alpha Teams
in medias res-in medias res search for something

called Bravo teams downed chopper in what
is mouthfully described as a forest zone situated

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.529
in the northwest of Raccoon City.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:06.810
"Okay, this is a Japanese game. That probably
explains the year-date swappage. That also

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:18.459
makes Raccoon City a valiant attempt at something
idiomatically American sounding. Though it

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:26.910
is about as convincing as an American-made
game set in the Japanese metropolis of Port

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.910
Sushi.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:36.290
"You harbor affection for the products of
Japan from its cuisine, to its girls; to its

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:44.980
video games- the medium Japanese designers
have made their own. To your mind then, a

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:55.720
certain amount of ineffable Japanese weirdity
is par for the course -- even if the course

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:03.810
in question has 15 holes and everyone is a
par 9.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:13.110
"A live action scene commences in which Alpha
Team lands upon a foggy moor, finds Bravo

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:20.870
Team's crashed chopper and is attacked by
Baskervillian hounds. But all you are privy

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.529
to is the puppetry of snarling muzzles shot
in artless close-up. To the canine puppeteer's

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:25.540
credit, the hounds are more convincing than
the living actors whose performances are miraculously

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.540
unsuccessful. The cinematography, meanwhile,
is a shaky cam evil, deadish fugue minus any

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.540
insinuation of talent, style or coherence.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.540
"Once the hell-hound enfilade has taken the
life of one Alpha Team member, the survivors

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.540
retreat into a nearby mansion. You know that
one of these survivors, following the load

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.540
screen, will be yours to control.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.540
"Given the majestic incompetence of the proceedings
thus far you check to see that the games receipt

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.540
remains extent. For most of your life you
have played video games. You have owned in

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.540
turn the Atari 2600, the Nintendo Entertainment
System, the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.540
the Nintendo 64, and familiarized yourself
with most of their marquee titles.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.540
"The console you are playing now -- the console
you have only today purchased is categorically

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.540
different from its ancestors. It is called
the Sony PlayStation. Its controllers are

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540
more ergonomic than those you have previously
held and far more loaded with buttons. And

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.540
its games are not plastic cartridges but compact
discs. Previous consoles were silent but your

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.540
new PlayStation zizzes and whirrs in an unfamiliar
way as its digital stylus scans and loads.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.540
"It is 1997. The PlayStation was released
to the American market one year ago. You missed

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.540
this, having been away in the Peace Corps
teaching English, which service you terminated

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.540
in a panic 16 months short of your expected
stay.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.540
"Now you are back in your hometown in the
house you grew up in, feeling less directionless,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.540
and mapless, compassless, in lack of any navigational
tool at all. You are also bored, hence the

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.540
PlayStation.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.540
"The live action sequence has given way to
an indoor tableau of surprising detail and

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.540
stark loveliness like no console game that
you have hitherto encountered.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.540
"Three characters stand in the mansion foyer.
There is Barry, a husky, ursine, ginger-bearded

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.540
man; Wesker, enjoying the sunglasses and slick-backed
hair of a coke fiend; and Jill, your character,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.540
a trim, brunette looker in a beret.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.540
"A brief conversation ensues about the necessity
of finding Chris, your fellow Alpha Team member,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.540
who has somehow managed to go AWOL in the
time it took to step across the threshold

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.540
of the mansion's entryway.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.540
"Soon enough a gunshot sounds from the next
room. You and Barry are dispatched by Wesker

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.540
to investigate.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.540
"The dialogue bad enough as written, 'Wow!
What a mansion!' is mesmerizing in performance.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.540
"It is as though the actors have been encouraged
to place emphasis on the least apposite word

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.540
in every spoken line. Barry's, 'He's our old
partner, you know,' to provide but one example,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.540
could have been read in any number of more
or less appropriate ways. From 'HE'S our old

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.540
partner, you know.' To 'He's OUR old partner,
you know.' To, 'He's our old PARTNER, you

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.889
know.' 'He's our OLD partner, YOU KNOW,' is
the line reading of artistic miscalculation

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:04.430
this game goes with.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.880
"Upon entering to the new room you are finally
granted control of Jill.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.339
"But how the game has chosen to frame the
mise-en-scene is a little strange. You are

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.959
not looking through Jill's eyes and movement
does not result in a scrolling, follow-along

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:21.689
screen. And still Ji-instead Jill stands in
what appears to be a dining room.

00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:24.750
"The in-game camera angling upon her in a
way that nulls any wider field of vision.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.140
Plenty of games have given you spaces around
which to wander, but they always took care

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:34.240
to provide you with a maximal vantage point.
This is not a maximal angle. This is not at

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.970
all how your eye has been trained by video
games to work. It is as though you, the gamer,

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:47.380
are an invisible, purposefully compromised
presence within the game world.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.470
"The room's only sound is a metronimically-metronimically
ticking grandfather clock.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:55.120
"You step forward, experimenting with your
controllers 17 buttons and noting the responsiveness

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.900
of the controls which lends Jill's movement
a precision that is both impressive and a

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.100
little creepy.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.100
"Holding down one button allows Jill to run,
for instance, and this is nicely animated.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.539
"A pair of trigger buttons lies beneath each
of your index fingers. Squeeze the left trigger

00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:12.870
and Jill lifts her pistol into a firing position.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.470
"Squeeze the right trigger and Jill fires,
loudly, her pistol kicking up in response.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.190
"All of this, from the preparatory, pre-firing
mechanic to the unfamiliar sensation of consequence

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:27.020
your single shot has been given, feels new
to you. Every video game gun you have previously

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:33.350
fired did so at the push of a single button.
The resultant physics no more palpable or

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.610
significant than jumping or moving or any
other in-game movement.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:41.919
"Video game armaments have always seemed to
you a kind of voodoo. If you wanted some digital

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:47.750
effigy to die you simply lined it up and pushed
in the requisite photonic pin. Here, however,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.770
there is no cross-hair or reticle. You fire
several more shots to verify this. How on

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.740
earth do you aim?

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.559
"As you explore the dining room, something
even more bizarre begins to occur. The in-game

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:03.781
camera is changing angles. Depending on where
you go the camera sometimes frames your caper...your

00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:09.520
character in relative close-up and other times
leaps back, reducing Jill to an apparent foreground

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.520
afterthought.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.809
"And yet no matter the angle from which you
ju-you view Jill, the directional control

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:19.460
schema, the precision of which you a moments
ago admired, remains the same.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.809
"What this means is that with every camera
shift your brain is forced to make a slight,

00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:28.510
but bothersome, spatial adjustment. The awkwardness
of this baffles you.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:33.440
"When you wanted Link or Mario to go left
you pushed left. That the character you controlled

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.960
moved in accordance to his on-screen positioning
which in turn corresponded to your joystick

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.080
or directional pad was an accepted convention
of the form.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.410
"Yes, you've experienced mode shifts in games
before but never so inexplicably or so totally.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.020
So far the game provides no compelling explanation
as to why it has sundered every convention

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.860
it comes across.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.690
"The dining room itself is stunning though,
reminding you of the flat, lush, realism of

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.601
Myst. A personal computer game your girlfriend
adores that-that-that- has always, that has

00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:07.600
always struck you as a warm milk soporific.
You've not played a tremendous number of PC

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.840
games. It's simply not a style of gaming you
respond to.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.600
"You're a console gamer for better or for
worse. Even though you are aware of the generally

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.809
higher quality of PC games, anyone who claims
allegiance to the recognizably inferior is

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:23.010
in dire need of a compelling argument.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:28.390
"Here's yours: The keyboard has one supreme
purpose, and that is to create words. Swapping

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:33.580
out keys for aspects game control -- J for
jump, the lesser sign for switch weapon strikes

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.770
you as frustrating and unwieldy. And almost
every PC game does this or something like

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:38.770
it.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.530
"PC gamers themselves meanwhile have always
seemed to you a kind of-have always seemed

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:49.460
to you an unlikable fusion of tech-geek and
cult member - a kind of mad scientologist.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:55.049
"You gance-glance at the box in which this
game came packaged -- Resident Evil. What

00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:57.470
the hell does that even mean?

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.669
"You know that this game is intended to be
scary. You also know that zombies are somehow

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:04.330
involved. The box art promises that much.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.780
"The notion of a scary game is striking you
as increasingly laughable. While nothing is

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:14.080
more terrifying to you than zombies, calling
a zombie based game Resident Evil is a solecism

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.400
probably born from failing to fully understand
the zombie.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.570
"Part of what makes zombies so frightening
is that they are not evil. The zombie, a Caribbean

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:29.299
borrowing, is in its North American guise
a modern parable for-well, there you go. Like

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:30.530
all parables zombies are both widely evocative
and impossible to pin down.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:36.169
"Part of the reason that you purchased this
game was because you were curious to see what

00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:41.730
the Japanese imagination had made of the zombie.
This was a culture after all that had transformed

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.020
its 20th century resident evil into a giant
bi-pedal dinosaur.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:52.220
"On screen, Barry calls Jill over, where he
kneels next to a pool of blood. 'I hope it's

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.880
not Chris' blood.' That's actually a perfect
impersonation of Barry, if anyone has played

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880
that game.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.419
"He orders you to press on looking around
while he completes his investigation.

00:22:02.419 --> 00:22:06.890
"You are no criminologist, but gleaning the
available information from a small, free-standing

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.970
blood puddle would seem to you an undertaking
of no more than three or four seconds. Barry

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.710
though continues to ponder the hell out of
that blood.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.669
"You have two options -- leave the dining
room to go back and explore the foyer, where

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:23.679
Wesker presumably awaits your report, or go
through a nearby side door. You take the side

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:24.679
door.

00:22:24.679 --> 00:22:28.340
"Anytime you go through a door in this game
you are presented with a load screen of daunting

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.220
literalness. The point of view reverts to
an implied first person, the door grows closer,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:38.270
the knob turns, the door opens, which is followed
by the noise of it closing behind you.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.669
"Considerable investment has been placed in
the dramatic reproduction of this process.

00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:46.620
The knobs sound as though they were last oiled
in the Cleveland administration, and the doors

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:52.520
themselves slam shut as though they weigh
500 pounds.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.280
"The load screen complete, Jill now stands
in a long, narrow hallway. Camera looks down

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.590
at her from an angle of perhaps 70 degrees,
which leaves you unable to see either ahead

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.750
of or behind her.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:09.350
"You turn her left instinctively only to hear
something further down the hall.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:16.960
"You hear-chewing? No. It is worse than that.
It is a wet, slushy sound -- more like feasting

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.270
than chewing.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.500
"Camera has shifted yet again allowing you
to look down the hall, but not around the

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.870
corner; whence this gluttonies-gluttonous
feasting sound originates.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.789
"There is no music, no cues at all. The game
world is silent but for your footsteps and

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:35.890
the sound you now realize that you have been
set upon this path to encounter.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:40.110
"You panic and run down to the other end of
the hall, the feasting sound growing fainter,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.400
only to find two locked doors.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:48.809
"No choice then, you walk-not run-back toward
the hallway corner and stop and go to a sub-screen

00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:53.210
to check your inventory. Your pistols ammunition
reserves are paltry and you curse yourself

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.460
for having shot off so many bullets in the
dining room.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.860
"You also have a knife. You toggle back and
forth between pistol and knife, equipping

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.940
and un-equipping. You eventually go with the
pistol and leave the inventory screen.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.710
"Jill stands inches before the hallway corner,
but it suddenly feels as though it is you

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.270
standing before Hellmouth itself.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.210
"Your body has become a hatchery from which
spiderlings of dread erupt, and skitter. Part

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.929
of this is merely expectation, for you know
that a zombie is around that corner, and you

00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:24.309
are fairly certain that is it-it is-that it
is eating Chris.

00:24:24.309 --> 00:24:29.610
"Another part is -- you are not sure you can
name it -- it is not quite the control and

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:34.049
release tension of the horror film, and it
is not quite actual terror. It's something

00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:39.559
else, a fear that you can control to a point;
but to which you are also helplessly subject.

00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:43.250
A fear whose elec...whose electricity becomes
pleasure.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:49.330
"You raise your pistol. And this is interesting.
You cannot move while your pistol is raised.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.720
You had not noticed this before. You should
be able to move with your pistol raised, and

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.159
certainly you should be able to shoot while
moving.

00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:59.440
"This is another convention of the form. In
video games, you can shoot your sluggish bullets

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.270
while running, jumping, falling off a cliff,
swimming under water. On top of this you have

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.289
exactly five rounds.

00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:09.391
"Zombies are dispatched with head shots, you
know that much. But how do you shoot for the

00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:12.120
head when the game provides you with no crosshair?

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:17.120
"A scary game seems a far less laughable notion
than it did only a few moments ago.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.980
"You turn the corner to yet another camera
change. You have only a second or two to make

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.800
out the particulars- a tiny room, a downed
figure, another figure bent over him- before

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.450
what is called 'a cut scene' kicks in.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.620
"The camera closes on a bald humanoid now
turning, noticing you. White head lividly

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:41.159
veiny, mouth bloody, eyes flat and empty and
purgatorial. There the brief cut scene ends.

00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:47.160
"The zombie, now approaching, groans in thoughtless
zombie misery, a half-eaten corpse behind

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.590
it. You fire but nothing happens. In your
panic you have forgotten the left trigger,

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.419
which raises your weapon.

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:58.500
"This blunder has cost you. The zombie falls
upon you with a groan and bites you avidly,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.419
your torso transforming into a blood fountain.
You mash all 17 if your controller's buttons

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:04.419
before finally breaking free.

00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:10.000
"The zombie staggers back a few steps and
you manage to fire, still no crosshair or

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.580
reticle. Your shot misses. Though by how much
you have no idea.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:19.180
"The zombie is upon you again. After pushing
it away -- and there is something date-rapishly

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.029
unwholesome about the way it assaults you
 -- you stagger back into the hallway to give

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:24.480
yourself more room to maneuver.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.600
"But the camera switches in such a way as
to leave you unaware of the zombies exact

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:34.260
location though you can still hear its awful
blood-freezing moan, which, disembodied, sounds

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.400
not only terrifying but sad.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.340
"You fire blindly down the hall toward the
moaning. With no guarantee that your shots

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.330
are hitting the zombie or coming anywhere
close to it. Soon pulling the trigger produces

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.260
only spent clicks.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.940
"You go to the inventory screen and equip
your knife.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.279
"When you return to game play, the zombie
appears within frame and lurches forward.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:59.279
You slash at it successfully, blood geysering
everywhere. But not before it manages to grab

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.960
onto you yet again.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.390
"After another chewy struggle, you back up
farther, the camera finally providing you

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.179
with a vantage point that is not actively
frustrating.

00:27:08.179 --> 00:27:13.190
"And you lure the zommie-zombie toward you,
lunging when it staggers into stabbing range.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.179
At last, the creature drops.

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:19.260
"You approach its doubly lifeless husk. Not
quite believing what is happening when it

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.549
grabs you by the leg and begins, quite naturally
by this point, to bite you.

00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:30.159
"You stab at the specimen of undead instruct...indestructability
until with a final anguished moan, a copious

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:34.480
amount of blood pools beneath it. What new
devilry is this?

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:40.279
"None of it has made sense. Not the absurd
paucity of your ammunition stores, not the

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:44.720
handicapping camera system, not the amount
of effort it took to defeat a single foe,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.610
not that foes ability to play dead.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.110
"You know a few things about video game enemies.
When they are attacked, they either die instantly,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.679
or loose health. And for foes as tough as
this one you are typically able to track the

00:27:55.679 --> 00:28:01.980
process by way of an on-screen health bar.
This zombie, however, had no health bar. Neither

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.460
do you properly speaking.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.610
"What you do have is an electrocardiographic
wave form that is green when you are at full

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:12.120
health, orange when you are hurt, and red
when you are severely hurt. Not only is this

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.890
EKG stashed away in an inventory sub-screen,
it provides only an approximate state of health.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.850
Right now your health is red, but how red?
You have no idea. This game is rationing not

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.690
only resources but information.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.490
"When video game characters die, furthermore,
they disappear like raptured Christians or

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:34.460
Jedi. Your assailant has not disappeared and
instead remains face down in a red pool of

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.640
useless zombie plasma.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.720
"This is a game in which every bullet evidently
will count. This is also a game in which everything

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.669
you kill will remain where it falls. At least
until you leave the room.

00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:51.250
"You stab it again. Revenge! You flee the
hallway and return to Barry. Before you can

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.210
tell him what has happened, the door behind
you opens.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.110
"The zombie whose deadness was a heliocentric
certainty has followed you.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:04.919
"You, not Jill, you cry out in delighted shock.
Your worried stepfather, a few rooms away,

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:09.820
calls your name, his voice emanating from
a world that for the last half hour has been

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.169
as enclosing but indistinct as an amnion.

00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:17.250
"After calling back that you are ok, you are
newly conscious of the darkness around you;

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.880
the lateness of the hour. For the first time
in your life, a video game has done something

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.270
more than entertain or distract you. It has
bypassed your limbic system and gone straight

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.809
for the spinal canal.

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:34.830
"You lean back, cautiously. You are 23 years
old. You have played a lot of games. Right

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.500
now all those games, all of the irrecoverable
eons that you have invested in them, seem

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.350
to you suddenly like nothing more than a collective
prologue."

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.100
[PAUSE]

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.600
Thank you.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:57.630
So, I suspect I might be probably one of the
older people in the room. And so I'm curious

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.570
as how-as to how many of you actually played
Resident Evil, the first one that ever came

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:10.149
out? And do any of you remember it feeling
like sort of mind blowing? What-what-what

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:13.010
it was like?

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:17.190
I think we all have like our own resident
examples of games sort of kind of impressed

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:22.000
upon you like goodness gracious, this is-this
is no longer Dig Dog. This is something really

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.260
sort of intense and weird. And for me Resident
Evil was that game. It's not even a particularly

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:35.250
good game in a lot of ways. In fact, I go
on in this chapter to jus-just excoriate its

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.809
terrible, terrible dialogue and absolutely
ridiculous narrative.

00:30:38.809 --> 00:30:42.850
But the one thing that it did really well,
that sense of immersion combined with just

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:48.280
the terror of not -- well, you know in a horror
movie the protagonist is always safe, 'cause

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.280
protagonists don't die.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.720
But in a vid-horror videogame, you're the
protagonist and you can die. And it just creates

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.059
this totally different expectation of-of fear.

00:30:57.059 --> 00:31:02.790
And I also explained that the other thing
that it did was it was so hard to save your

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.200
progress in the game through a very complicated
in-game mechanic of how you actually saved

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200
your progress.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:17.360
That as I write in this chapter, I've had
like friends have died and I've had relationships

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.460
end, and I've run out of money, and had terrible
experiences; and I would still place being

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.250
torn apart by zombies with an hour and a half
of unsaved Resident Evil game play behind

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.909
me, it's like in the upper quartile [AUDIENCE
CHUCKLES] of the most miserable experiences

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:37.220
of my life. It was so demoralizing and so
infuriating, when that happened.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:42.690
So that's- from the second chapter of the
book, and it's really like the only pre-2006

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:48.169
game that I really get into very much.

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:52.760
And so it is very much a book about today's
games. But I really think a lot about today's

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.850
games, not that their like Resident Evil very
much but-but to me Resident Evil's the first

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.190
game that I was very consciously being told
a full-blown, narratively ambitious story.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:07.490
The fact that the narrative ambition was preposterous
and the story itself sucked did not change

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.980
the fact that it was a really ambitious attempt
to do something in the medium that like very

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.560
few games had before it had tried, and certainly
no game that I had happened to play.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.370
With that I would love to talk some games
or answer some questions. And argue with anyone

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.399
who thinks games don't matter,

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.399
[LAUGHS]

00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:18.399
If anyone feels like doing that.

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:19.399
[PAUSE]

00:32:19.399 --> 00:32:20.399
Yes, sir.

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.399
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: I'm curious to hear your
opinion on the kind of contemporary argument

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:25.250
about what- what is the best use of tool or
combination of experiences for young adults.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:35.120
Obviously there is a role of videogame play
in the maturing of the young adults mind versus

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:46.220
more active types of-of reading or other types
of intellectual stimulation. I'm just curious

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:57.399
to hear your thoughts of how videogames play
in that whole developmental type of argument.

00:32:57.399 --> 00:33:04.360
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah, I would have to think based on
the little that I have read on the subject

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.690
that I just can't imagine that a lot of videogame
playing is good for young adults. I just don't

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.130
think it's probably very good for them, for
all sorts of reasons.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.130
[PAUSE]

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:24.380
You know games should be a part of a rich,
cultural diet that people have. I mean, I

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.610
grew up playing games and I also grew up a
huge reader. I don't think it's impossible.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:28.610
It's probably slightly more unusual.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.990
And as games-let's face it the games that
I played as a kid they weren't really--you

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.360
couldn't really play them for more than a
couple of hours without going mad from boredom.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.730
Once you'd had Pitfall Harry go through the
entire thing, and you'd recycled yourself

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:42.240
back at the beginning of the-of the map in
Pitfall!, there wasn't a whole lot to get

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.320
out of that game.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.809
If I had to deal with something like some
of these multi-player online games where you

00:33:47.809 --> 00:33:51.910
can set there with your friends for hours
and very time you play it's a new map, and

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.330
you're doing something different. Yeah, I
don't know if my-if my mind would have really

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.330
withstood that.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:03.360
So I, I, I think if I had kids I would really
seriously limit their game playing time. I

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.319
just can't imagine it's good for them, which
isn't to say that videogames are bad a priori.

00:34:08.319 --> 00:34:13.599
I just think that they should be part of a
healthy, balanced cultural lifestyle, and

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:16.480
a part of a balanced entertainment intake.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:25.640
I also wouldn't let kids play super violent
games until it was the appropriate time for

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.721
them to play them. And the fact that that
is even controversial at all seems kind of

00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:33.230
nuts to me. People say that games don't make
kids violent -- that's probably true. But

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:39.669
I just think mowing down hundreds of people
every day for hours.

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:41.560
I-[CHUCKLES]-I-I, maybe it doesn't turn them
into killers but I can't imagine it's going

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:48.200
to turn them into Rhodes Scholars either.
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES] So, that's my take on

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:54.520
that. And most of the games that I like aren't
for kids --they're just not. And the people

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:02.100
who make them say, these are not kids' games.
We don't want kids playing them. So...[PAUSE]

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.100
Yeah.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.100
[PAUSE]

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.100
Anyone else?

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.100
[PAUSE]

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.100
Oh, Yes!

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.510
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: I was wondering about
the one thing that you mentioned with the

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.920
Resident Evil, the big hit, was the hour and
a half since you saved...

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.920
&gt;&gt;TOM: [CHUCKLES]

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.310
&gt;&gt; MAN FROM AUDIENCE: ...and then you lose
it.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.310
&gt;&gt;TOM: [CHUCKLES]

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.210
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: There is a sense in modern
single player games where the publisher wouldn't

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.270
get away without saving a character any more.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:27.161
&gt;&gt;TOM: It's true. But one game did it - Demon's
Souls. Did you play that?

00:35:27.161 --> 00:35:28.859
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: No, I don't have a PS3.

00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:35.760
&gt;&gt;TOM: It's a PS3 game. It was old school,
crushing, hard core. If you fuck up, you lose

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:42.570
hours of-of progress. It was great; actually,
I loved that game.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.300
I-it also, my girlfriend almost broke up with
me during the time that I was playing it too.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.400
Because she said I was just going to bed mumbling
at night like I was-I was just so -- crazy

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.580
 -- about that game; and I am really glad
that games don't do that anymore. I'm really,

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.580
really, really glad.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:04.609
But it's very cool to play a game that occasionally
comes along and says, "Hey, you remember this

00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:05.810
style of game play [CHUCKLES]. We're going
to give it to you again."

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:12.570
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: I mean do you think that
your enjoyment was partially this kinda throw

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:17.830
back thing or do you think it was more that-that
there is genuinely something about that type

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:18.830
of game that's...

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.099
&gt;&gt;TOM: Well, it makes you very careful, and
it makes you very tense; and so, but tense

00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:29.710
in a way that -- like Resident Evil and Demon's
Souls are both fair. They don't like arbitrarily

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.710
do stuff.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:35.440
They make you pay attention and they make
you really go slow and pay close watch on

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.000
everything that is going on around you. And
as long as a game's fair about its sternness,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.170
I don't really have a quarrel with it.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.980
But, I think that a lot of the older games
were just hard for the sake of being hard.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:52.240
And they would throw these really arbitrary
kinds of things at you that were-that-that

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.440
they weren't hard in a fun way; they weren't
hard in a way that rewarded paying close attention.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.420
And I think that's where a lot of game designers
kind of got hung up. They thought hardness

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:07.690
was the thing to pursue rather than the encouragement
of paying attention. And those are two different

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.420
qualities, I think.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:16.020
So. I will occasionally treat myself. And
most of the games that do that are Japanese.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:20.020
I mean, that-that's the Japanese style of
game design. They like hard games. They're

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.020
into that.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:25.970
And western game designers moved away from
it, and I think that there is probably like

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:29.850
a middle ground somewhere between the two.
'Cause there is something about a lot of games,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.850
a lot of them are pretty easy, you know.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:31.850
[PAUSE]

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:37.420
But at the same time these guys want the games
to be more accessible and they want people

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:42.890
to be able to enjoy them. You-you-you don't
feel like you are getting frustrated at this

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:43.950
thing that you paid this money for.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:48.390
So I can see all sides of this argument simultaneously.
I don't really know if there is a right answer.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:54.270
I think it's just how the game approaches
it. 'Cause it is an aesthetic decision. And

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.510
if it is an aesthetic decision that has like
a solid foundational grounding to it, then,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.060
I think if it is thoughtfully done; it's totally
legit any way you want to do it.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.060
[PAUSE]

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060
Ah, yes.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.060
Green shirt.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.359
&gt;&gt;GREEN SHIRT: Do you know of any instances
where the story has originated in videogames

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:14.800
and then gone on to other media?

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.170
&gt;&gt;TOM: Well, you mean like movies being made
from games?

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.640
&gt;&gt;GREEN SHIRT: Yeah, or books.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.260
&gt;&gt;Tom: Yeah, I mean like most of the stuff-
times in which that has happened it's all

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:29.250
been like really pulpy, genre, sci-fi stuff.
But has there been like- like the Halo-Halo

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:34.810
Series has got a zillion novels come out.
Mass Effect has got. And, you know-so-most

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:39.970
games are genre games. That's just something
you have to wrap your head around as gamer.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.990
And my-the great weirdness of my life is I'm
not really interested in sci-fi mo-film or

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:49.570
literature that much. I don't even like fantasy
that much, but I do like games. And so I get

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.770
almost all of my genre nutrition...

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.770
[LAUGHS]

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:58.830
..from-from-from the ga-game genre. And I
read almost no sci-fi. In fact I don't even

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.030
remember the last sci-fi novel I read.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:10.660
So, there's lots of that stuff but I don't
really know of any work that is kind of -- I

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.900
think I know what you mean and I don't think
there's ever really been a game story that

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.900
has, that has been...

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.060
[PAUSE]

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.890
...into non-genre mainstream mediums. Other
mediums.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.830
But I heard this new movie, Scott-Scott Pilgrim,
although it comes from a comic book it's one

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:31.541
of the first films not based on a videogame
to actually use videogame grammar to-to tell

00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.541
the story.

00:39:32.541 --> 00:39:37.790
There is lots of videogame imagery in it -- like
health meters of characters on screen. You

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:43.220
see stuff like that. And I've heard it's pretty
wild and-and for people of our generation

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.089
who can look at that stuff and not automatically
assume the apocalypse is going to happen the

00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:49.320
next day. Then I-I-I am really looking forward
to it.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:55.270
To actually see a movie that has nothing to
do with games actually use the grammar of-of

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.930
the medium in a way that feels fresh. I think
that that could be pretty cool. So I'm really

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:58.930
looking forward to that.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:39:59.930
[PAUSE]

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:00.930
You had a question, sir.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:01.930
Yes.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.130
&gt;&gt;MAN IN THE AUDIENCE: Yes, it seems like
for a game to be more than just a game a game

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:11.580
that tells a story to be more than just a
collection of cut scenes that are stitched

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.850
together? You have to give the players some
amount of control...

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.850
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.840
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: ...over the narrative.
Then so what do you think of the argument

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840
that if you give control over the narrative
then you can't have the same emotional impact.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.460
That you can have the tragedy then the person
can just replay it and do it in a different

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.460
way. So, you can't have something like Hamlet
where the tragedy comes from the fact that

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:31.480
there is only one way that the narrative could've
unfolded.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.940
&gt;&gt;TOM: I think that is absolutely true. Games
that are trying to be resonant in that way

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.940
are doomed.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:44.540
But games have all sorts of other resonances.
Say you spend a lot of time in game design

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:50.650
creating a relationship between characters,
right, that you like. The characters are well

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.270
drawn, they're interesting, they're surprising,
they're not just crappy versions of action

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.270
film.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:59.780
So say you make losing one of those characters
an irrevocable decision, or-or an irrevocable

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:05.470
event, that if you lose this character; you
lose them. You can't go back and re-you know,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:10.599
you have one save slot per game and anyone
you lose along the way they're gone. You only

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:11.599
can get them back if you start over from the
beginning of the game.

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:16.451
That's a whole different kind of resonance
and in a moment like that where something

00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:20.290
like that happens. I-It's not going to be
Hamlet but it's not supposed to be. It-it's

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.120
 -- Hamlet is a totally different kind of
aesthetic experience.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.790
But game-game play that actually assigns your
agency an awful lot of in-game meaning, that

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.589
actually really doesn't screw around with
the decisions you make; that actually says

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:38.153
you're going to make some choices, and they're
going to be difficult, and they're going to

00:41:38.153 --> 00:41:42.900
have real consequences. Not consequences you
can just kind of go back and reload.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.720
I think that is a really valuable kind of
resonance. That-that's the kind of thing that

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.100
only a game can really give you.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.609
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: But that makes for many,
many levels of play that being a solo person-incredibly

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:57.079
frustrating game that a lot of people are
not going to even bother playing, right. Like

00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:00.230
if you take away that ability that you can
kind of go back and change things, which seems

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.800
like you have to do to get that resonance...

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.830
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE:...that's a game that not
a lot of people are even going to bother playing.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:04.830
&gt;&gt;TOM: Well...

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.369
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: I used to play Demon's
Souls. It's the game's impact -- enormous

00:42:07.369 --> 00:42:08.369
time

00:42:08.369 --> 00:42:09.369
&gt;&gt;TOM: [CHUCKLES]

00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:15.690
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: Because everything is,
you know, so difficult, and your choices have

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.690
such meaning.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:20.680
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah, I don´t think it is the on...I
don't think irrevocability of that kind is,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.260
is not necessss...I mean, here's the thing.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.310
Yeah, as the game designer you can think well
people can just go back and reload it and

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.310
experience it again.

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:32.940
But when I play games, I-I don't do that.
I try to honor the vision of the designers,

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:39.950
and I-I try to resist that game temptation
of just revisiting things that I did to see

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.329
how they work out a different way.

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:46.610
And so, I think game designers, in my opinion,
spend too much time anticipating the kid who

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:52.780
wants to pee in the pool and-and figuring
out ways ta-ta-ta-to foil the kid who wants

00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:00.950
to pee in the pool. Thereby, and by doing
that they kind of make all the rest of us

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.640
suffer through all the firewalls that they
are putting up around this kid. And I kind

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.400
of think that if some people wanta break the
game, you can't really protect, you can't

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.950
really worry about that.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:18.510
And so, I think all that you can do is just
design and encourage the player to sort of

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:23.240
want to believe in the fictional primacy of
the world and not want you to violate it.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.460
And that's really the best you can do. And
you can just hope that people kinda go through

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:32.150
with generally what you-you're trying to intend
them to experience.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:37.550
See you don't have to go the cruel Demon Souls
path. You can actually also take the s-somewhat

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:43.520
gentler path and not-yeah-and not worry too
much about that thing. I mean, I don't know.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.230
I don't think there is a good answer to this
question, and I think that it's a kind of

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:53.450
game-by-game issue that you have to approach.
So I hear you, that there doesn't seem to

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.630
be a very satisfactory answer here, but I
do think that there are all sorts of kinds

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:01.552
of resonances that are unique to games, and
those are the kinds of experiences that I

00:44:01.552 --> 00:44:02.552
love about games. And...

00:44:02.552 --> 00:44:03.552
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: This is kind of an odd
question. What are some of the modern games

00:44:03.552 --> 00:44:06.040
that have emotional impact comparable to a
good novel or kinda comparable to a good novel?

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:14.650
What modern games have emotional impact experience?
 ...

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:18.280
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah. I would never say comparable
to a good novel because again those are two

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.280
totally different...

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.130
&gt;&gt;MAN FROM AUDIENCE: Give me a comparison
to what game have emotional impact.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:27.050
&gt;&gt;TOM: Well-The game Portal, I thought was
a tremendously moving game that really just

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.050
freaked me out.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:35.180
There is a game called Far Cry 2, which just
left me completely drained and wrung out by

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:39.849
the time I played it. I felt utterly ashamed
and disguste-[LAUGHS]-with the, with the-the

00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:44.770
game was just like about relentless slaughter.
That-that-that slowly convinces you-that slowly

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:50.860
impresses upon you that unlike most shooters
in which you're the good guy, Far Cry 2 gradually

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.670
sort of piles upon you the realization that
you are the bad guy.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.950
And that is a really novel kind of thing for
a game to do. You're not like an anti-hero

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:02.170
you are actually the problem. And-and I love
that about it.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:07.550
I thought there was stuff in GT4-GK4-Grand
Theft Auto IV that made me laugh, and troubled

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:08.550
me.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:14.110
BioShock was a tremendous game for the first
80% of it.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:19.960
Left for Dead has given me some unbelievably
gripping, visceral experiences with friends

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.190
of mine.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:25.119
Mass Effect is like kind of a corny space
opera, but because it commits so much to its

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:29.619
characters and it's-and it's a pretty good
story. There are moments in that that I was

00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:31.670
just absolutely riveted.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:35.810
I have never felt guilty about spending time
on games that give me like a valuable kind

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:37.339
of storytelling experiences.

00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:43.300
The games that I'm kind of more and more less
satisfied with are these hyper-kinetic Call

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.960
of Duty style games that don't really give
your heart or mind enough time to really like

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.750
absorb anything. Where it is just like a relentless
push you through a roller coaster. And hope

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.050
you come out more or less in one piece at
the end of it.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:46:00.750
I'm less and less satisfied with that style
of game design. And I really like games that

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.400
are maybe a little bit slower and maybe a
little bit more mischievous about how they

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:09.720
wanta play with your emotions. Have you had
resonant game experiences or-or a...

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:15.510
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have. It's funny
that you mention some of those games that

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.780
you mentioned like Far Cry. I mean, I haven't
played that but I wouldn't have thought of

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.339
that. That, to me, just sounds like another
shooter.

00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:22.760
&gt;&gt;TOM: I think it is the best shooter ever
made personally, I do.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760
&gt;&gt;Man In Audience: I'll check it out.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.760
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah it's really fantastic. It's kinda
slow it takes a little while to get going

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.790
but once it gets going it's-it's pretty great.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:30.790
Yes.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.660
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: I was gonna mention Shadow
of the Colossus.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.579
&gt;&gt;TOM: Oh, god, yeah! I should have mentioned
that one right off the bat. Yeah, that-that-that

00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:41.380
game's at a whole 'nother level of emotional
impact. Has anyone played that game?

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.550
&gt;&gt;MAN IN AUDIENCE: What was the name of it
again?

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:50.670
&gt;&gt;TOM: Shadow of the Colossus. It's kind of
like a famous game that everyone who loves

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.580
games like loves today but it was sort of
a commercial disaster when it came out. It

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.900
didn't sell well in this country at all, because
it was so ahead of its time.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.280
It's just a game about loneliness and sadness
and...

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280
[CHUCKLES]

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.890
...takes the single corniest thing of the
videogame medium-- the boss fight-- and it

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:11.410
just makes it about nothing but boss fights.
And the bosses are actually these big, lovely,

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:18.069
lumbering creatures that seem to bear you
no harm, and yet you have to kill them one

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:19.069
by one.

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:25.730
And-and so there is this level of ambiguity
and questioning about what-and it does this

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:29.690
with very little dialogue, very little explicit
story telling. All the story-storytelling

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:34.170
is environmental. It's all this sort of this
combination of like the-the visual presentation

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:39.430
of the game and what you're projecting onto
it emotionally. And it's this unbelievably,

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.140
haunting, weird experience.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:49.760
That at the end of the game, I was-I was kind
of a wreck. It's a really special piece of-of-of-of...

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:56.120
It's a really special game. And their remaking
it for PS3 I've heard. I'm going to be on

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.740
that like white on rice as soon as that-that
comes out.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.740
Yes.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:06.020
&gt;&gt;MAN: I mean -- could you contrast the advertising
done in movies to the advertising done in

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:12.380
video games? What is the size of the market?
What are the growth rates?

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:18.369
&gt;&gt;TOM: I don't really have those numbers at
the top of my head. But I do know that games

00:48:18.369 --> 00:48:22.690
make more...made more than Hollywood last
year and the year before that.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.780
&gt;&gt;MAN: Ads. I'm talking about ads!

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.780
&gt;&gt;TOM: Ads?

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:33.980
&gt;&gt;MAN: Like say if you watch the movie Transformers
you see Chevy car, the brand new Chevy car...

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:34.980
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:37.089
&gt;&gt;MAN: So Chevy had obviously paid some money
to the movie producer to place it...

00:48:37.089 --> 00:48:38.089
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah

00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:39.089
&gt;&gt;MAN: So is similar thing is done on the
videogames also?

00:48:39.089 --> 00:48:40.210
&gt;&gt;TOM: Well, I do know that I was once playing
a driving game called Burnout Paradise, which

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.210
is like you're driving around in a city looking
for races. It's kind of an open world driving

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:45.210
game, which is sort of an interesting thing.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.829
And I'm driving down the street one day, and
I see an "Obama '08" sign [AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:52.820
on one of the billboards. And I'm like literally
I have-I actually have the nerdy driving steering

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.981
wheel so I like hit the guy -- hit the brake.
I'm like wha-a-a-at! And I was looking at

00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:01.640
this thing. And the game had come out like
two years before or maybe a year before. And

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:05.030
I saw an "Obama '08" billboard, and I thought
that was the greatest thing.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:10.210
So, you know, games don't have that kind of
in-game advertising very often right now.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:14.599
Sports games do somewhat. But I really don't
know any of the advertising sta-statistics.

00:49:14.599 --> 00:49:21.450
It's just not-not really my-my-my area of-of
knowledge on this. But that's the weird thing

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.610
with games.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:28.089
It's-it's basically the most profitable storytelling
medium in the world, and yet they're still

00:49:28.089 --> 00:49:32.290
weirdly culturally invisible in some very
curious way that no one has really been able

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:33.290
to figure out.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:38.660
Games have a very hard time shaking this stigma
of that they're for 13 year-old boys. Some

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:42.480
of them are and a lot of 13 year-old-year-old
boys play them. But the statistics just don't

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.829
back that up. The average age of the gamers
is in his mid-30s. And in most of-like more

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:52.920
and more it's like 60-40 men to women.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.920
So yeah...Someone back there...

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920
&gt;&gt;MAN: I was just wondering as to the focus,
I mean it's already is in Asia and it's getting

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.590
to more and more shift that way in North America
the focus comes more-shifts more toward competitive

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:01.540
gaming and team playing competitions that
actually leads in a sense. What do you think

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:08.900
that does to storytelling or the storytelling
in the games? And what do you think it does

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.550
to the videogame industry in general.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.550
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:20.980
I think those games are not-tho-tho-those
games are like sports. And they have their

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:21.980
place.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.750
&gt;&gt;MAN: You mean it's like major league gaming...

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.200
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yeah

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:33.250
I get kind of upset when -- and I play multiplayer
shooters online. I play with my friends. I

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:36.990
have a good time. But I don't go to that kind
of a game experience for anything emotionally

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:42.440
resonant. Just like I don't go see Transformers
2 if I want to like [CHUCKLES] have a thoughtful

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440
experience at a film.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.720
I mean, games have the same-no, not the same-but
they have a comparable spectrum of sophistication

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.880
of the Hollywood movies. Some action-oriented
stuff is actually really smart and fun. Some

00:50:52.880 --> 00:51:00.359
of it is complete cynical shit. And some of
the like serious stuff is pretentious, bloated

00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:03.840
and dreadful; and some of the serious stuff
is actually really brilliant.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.640
And so, the whole rise of the competitive
sporting thing, I can say that I-I Even though

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:14.750
I play multiplayer competitive games, that
world has absolutely zero appeal to me and.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:15.750
Just personally.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:21.900
I don't doubt anyone else's interest in it.
But for me, I-I do think that the multiplayer

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.150
thing is becoming really kind of ridiculous
though because I think that people are putting

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:28.660
multiplayer options in games that have no
use for them.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.751
And so what this means is that lots of publishers'
resources are going toward a thing that no

00:51:33.751 --> 00:51:36.760
one is going to play for reasons they don't
even really -- they're just doing it because

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.170
they think it's like commercial. It will increase
game play longevity.

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:48.470
But I don't know. Yeah, I think that the multiplayer
thing is a weird, unexpected development that

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:55.030
is in the last ten years has really kind of
distorted a lot of-a lot of game-game experiences.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.910
&gt;&gt;VOICE: Time for one more.

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:57.910
&gt;&gt;TOM: Yes.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:03.540
&gt;&gt;MAN: Yeah. Do you think that online games
matter?

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.540
&gt;&gt;TOM: Do you mean like competitive things?

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.540
&gt;&gt;MAN: Yeah

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.540
&gt;&gt;TOM: Um [PAUSE]

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540
&gt;&gt;MAN: I'm thinking of flash -- little

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.540
&gt;&gt;TOM: Oh, those kind of games!

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:14.280
You know, I don't see why there can't be like
really valuable aesthetic experiences to be

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.579
had in flash games. I've not played that many
of them but I've seen some really cool stuff.

00:52:18.579 --> 00:52:25.589
Yeah. I mean, I think the story telling model
of the big bloated triple A storytelling model

00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:31.119
of game design is far from the only viable
way. I just write about those games because

00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:37.490
I find them the easiest and most pleasant
to write about for me personally. But, yeah,

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.490
I've seen some flash games that are terrific,
actually.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:45.240
I think that anytime anyone wants to create
an experience for another person to have that

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:50.720
rearranges their mind or enchants them or
fills them with like anxiety or scares them

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.160
or-or. Again, anytime you are trying to share
an aesthetic experience with another person

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.030
 -- that matters -- I think. And I think that
is why games matter to me. That is what I

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:04.520
want-I want more of that from my entertainment
with games.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.320
Are we done?

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.930
&gt;&gt;Voice: I think we are done. Thanks a lot.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:08.930
&gt;&gt;TOM: OK. Thank you guys.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.931
[APPLAUSE]
