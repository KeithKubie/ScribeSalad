important are not sufficient and you
need to get to the deeper root causes of

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860
need to get to the deeper root causes of
 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.770
need to get to the deeper root causes of
things and I studied in in in Britain

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780

who actually did in other cases have
answers to how how to address the deeper

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
answers to how how to address the deeper
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.160
answers to how how to address the deeper
root causes of poverty

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170
 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.770
one of the things that I learned from

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780
one of the things that I learned from
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.380
one of the things that I learned from
groups around the world particularly

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390
groups around the world particularly
 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.700

looking at issues of hunger is that that
 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.800
looking at issues of hunger is that that
the root cause of hunger isn't that

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810
the root cause of hunger isn't that
 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.210

than enough food on earth today to feed

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170
than enough food on earth today to feed
 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.320
than enough food on earth today to feed
everyone one and a half times over we've

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330
everyone one and a half times over we've
 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.180
everyone one and a half times over we've
got plenty of food on this planet but

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190
got plenty of food on this planet but
 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.680
got plenty of food on this planet but
the reason people are going hungry is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690
the reason people are going hungry is
 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.350
the reason people are going hungry is
not because of a shortage of food um but

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360
not because of a shortage of food um but
 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.699

countries and replacing it with an

agriculture that at the moment is
 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.200
agriculture that at the moment is
looking increasingly unsustainable and

looking increasingly unsustainable and
 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.119
looking increasingly unsustainable and
so having food sovereignty having a

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:54.129
so having food sovereignty having a
 

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:56.490
so having food sovereignty having a
democratic conversation about food is

democratic conversation about food is
 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.980
democratic conversation about food is
actually pretty new most countries have

very keen to learn about ways in which
we can address the root causes of

it all by himself he had help but he
 

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:35.069
it all by himself he had help but he
treats his labor very badly and so they

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079
treats his labor very badly and so they
 

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.470
treats his labor very badly and so they
run off with a map of the universe and

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480
run off with a map of the universe and
 

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.120
run off with a map of the universe and
with its imperfections and they used the

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.130
with its imperfections and they used the
 

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.030
with its imperfections and they used the
holes in the universe to rob people and

general um but what's more mysterious to
 

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.210
general um but what's more mysterious to
us is what other ways of valuing the

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:16.220

I'm what what's important to remember is
 

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.300
I'm what what's important to remember is
that there are hundreds of examples

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:05.310
that there are hundreds of examples
 

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.400
that there are hundreds of examples
thousands of examples where commenting

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:07.410
thousands of examples where commenting
 

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.580
thousands of examples where commenting
works today and in the book I talk a lot

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.590
works today and in the book I talk a lot
 

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.140
works today and in the book I talk a lot
about what those examples are and how we

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.150
about what those examples are and how we
 

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.560
about what those examples are and how we
can learn from

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:15.570
 

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.599
so the title of the value of nothing

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:17.609
so the title of the value of nothing
 

00:22:17.609 --> 00:22:20.570
so the title of the value of nothing
comes from an Oscar Wilde line which is

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580
comes from an Oscar Wilde line which is
 

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.219
comes from an Oscar Wilde line which is
nowadays people know the price of

00:22:22.219 --> 00:22:22.229
nowadays people know the price of
 

00:22:22.229 --> 00:22:24.859
nowadays people know the price of
everything and the value of nothing and

00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:24.869
everything and the value of nothing and
 

00:22:24.869 --> 00:22:28.759
everything and the value of nothing and
this an idea of knowing prices he's you

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:28.769
this an idea of knowing prices he's you
 

00:22:28.769 --> 00:22:31.269
this an idea of knowing prices he's you
know what when I'm gonna start again

00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279
know what when I'm gonna start again
 

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:35.299

because that was boys don't me to some

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:35.309
because that was boys don't me to some
 

00:22:35.309 --> 00:22:38.060

extent I kind of feel like I've said a

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.070
extent I kind of feel like I've said a
 

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.830
extent I kind of feel like I've said a
little bit I mean I've kind of talked

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840
little bit I mean I've kind of talked
 

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.609
little bit I mean I've kind of talked
about that already okay but I mean I can

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:43.619
about that already okay but I mean I can
 

00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:44.960
about that already okay but I mean I can
I can take that I can take that slightly

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:44.970
I can take that I can take that slightly
 

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.930
I can take that I can take that slightly
different direction which is um so the

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940
different direction which is um so the
 

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.479
different direction which is um so the
opening line of the book I don't find

opening line of the book I don't find
 

00:22:50.489 --> 00:22:51.919
opening line of the book I don't find
the title the value of nothing comes

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:51.929
the title the value of nothing comes
 

00:22:51.929 --> 00:22:53.779
the title the value of nothing comes
from an Oscar Wilde line people today

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:53.789
from an Oscar Wilde line people today
 

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:55.369

know the price of everything and the
 

00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:57.499
know the price of everything and the
value of nothing now in the book I

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:57.509
value of nothing now in the book I
 

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:59.539
value of nothing now in the book I
explained how we might value the world

00:22:59.539 --> 00:22:59.549
explained how we might value the world
 

00:22:59.549 --> 00:23:01.519
explained how we might value the world
differently but it's not an accident

00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:01.529
differently but it's not an accident
 

00:23:01.529 --> 00:23:05.719
differently but it's not an accident
that I use Oscar an Oscar Wilde line I

00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:05.729
that I use Oscar an Oscar Wilde line I
 

00:23:05.729 --> 00:23:07.609
that I use Oscar an Oscar Wilde line I
mean beyond the fact that he's very

00:23:07.609 --> 00:23:07.619

socialist and I think that it's

00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:23.489
socialist and I think that it's
 

00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:26.570
socialist and I think that it's
important to remember that there have

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580
important to remember that there have
 

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.239
important to remember that there have
been political systems that have valued

00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:29.249
been political systems that have valued
 

00:23:29.249 --> 00:23:30.680
been political systems that have valued
the world differently and figured out

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:30.690
the world differently and figured out
 

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.259
the world differently and figured out
ways of valuing the world differently

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:32.269
ways of valuing the world differently
 

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:37.129
ways of valuing the world differently

triumph of capitalism by the fall of the

Soviet Union and in fact those political
 

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:44.450
Soviet Union and in fact those political
systems although we hear very little

systems although we hear very little
 

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.570

and thank God they don't have those

and thank God they don't have those
kinds of lines but there are

00:23:59.499 --> 00:23:59.509
kinds of lines but there are
 

00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:02.269
kinds of lines but there are

have no doubt that when people read the

00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:08.759
have no doubt that when people read the
 

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:10.460
have no doubt that when people read the
book and finds that actually I'm not

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:10.470
book and finds that actually I'm not

it's it's important to have a
look at other ways of valuing the world

look at other ways of valuing the world
 

00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:33.159

the climate and the environment it means
that we are heading towards a

catastrophe of immense proportions and
 

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.510
catastrophe of immense proportions and
and we do need to figure out other ways

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520
and we do need to figure out other ways
 

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.880
and we do need to figure out other ways
of valuing the world and actually there

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:51.890
of valuing the world and actually there
 

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.380
of valuing the world and actually there
are some pretty sensible alternatives

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:53.390
are some pretty sensible alternatives
 

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.490
are some pretty sensible alternatives
around if people are ready to be

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:54.500
around if people are ready to be

I'm sure I think of what what the what a
 

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.870
I'm sure I think of what what the what a
good example is so what would it look

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880
good example is so what would it look
 

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.990
good example is so what would it look
like to have a world where we where we

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000
like to have a world where we where we
 

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.659
like to have a world where we where we
valued things and where it wasn't the

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:14.669
valued things and where it wasn't the
 

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:16.070

according to supply and demand but but
 

00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:21.860
according to supply and demand but but
but there were other forces at work well

it be a good idea if the citizens of
 

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.740
it be a good idea if the citizens of
that city were part of that decision as

democracy then that's exactly what
democracy is about democracy is about

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.130
democracy is about democracy is about
 

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.980
democracy is about democracy is about
taking personal responsibility for

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:14.990
taking personal responsibility for
 

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.370
taking personal responsibility for
yourself in a political way and Athenian

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:18.380
yourself in a political way and Athenian
 

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.720
yourself in a political way and Athenian
democracy was all about that and I think

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:19.730
democracy was all about that and I think
 

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:20.770
democracy was all about that and I think
that

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:20.780
that
 

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.720
that
we have at the moment is intended to

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:22.730
we have at the moment is intended to
 

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.150
we have at the moment is intended to
descale us that the education system we

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:25.160
descale us that the education system we
 

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.920
descale us that the education system we
have the the mechanisms for political

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:26.930
have the the mechanisms for political
 

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.510
have the the mechanisms for political
process and engagement that we have are

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:28.520
process and engagement that we have are
 

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.210
process and engagement that we have are
intended really to turn us into in terms

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:31.220
intended really to turn us into in terms
 

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.920
intended really to turn us into in terms
of drooling idiots when it comes to

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:32.930
of drooling idiots when it comes to
 

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.470
of drooling idiots when it comes to
political responsibility and I think

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480
political responsibility and I think
 

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.730
political responsibility and I think
that there are movements and

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:36.740
that there are movements and
 

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.950
that there are movements and
organizations around the world that

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960
organizations around the world that
 

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.680
organizations around the world that
offer us a glimpse into what it would be

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:41.690
offer us a glimpse into what it would be
 

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.300
offer us a glimpse into what it would be
like if we did take political

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:43.310
like if we did take political
 

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.880
like if we did take political
responsibility for ourselves and they're

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:45.890
responsibility for ourselves and they're
 

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.830
responsibility for ourselves and they're
not perfect and people make mistakes but

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840
not perfect and people make mistakes but
 

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.740
not perfect and people make mistakes but
of course that's the point what in many

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:50.750
of course that's the point what in many
 

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.750
of course that's the point what in many
ways we're fighting for is the right to

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760
ways we're fighting for is the right to
 

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.370
ways we're fighting for is the right to
make our own mistakes because at the

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:54.380
make our own mistakes because at the
 

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.570
make our own mistakes because at the
moment we're suffering the consequences

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:55.580
moment we're suffering the consequences
 

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.390
moment we're suffering the consequences
of other people's mistakes and democracy

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:58.400
of other people's mistakes and democracy
 

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.100
of other people's mistakes and democracy
means getting the right to make your own

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.110
means getting the right to make your own
 

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.690
means getting the right to make your own
clean up after yourself and learn from

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:01.700
clean up after yourself and learn from
 

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.180
clean up after yourself and learn from
it right now we spend a lot of time

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.190
it right now we spend a lot of time
 

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.630
it right now we spend a lot of time
cleaning up after a handful of sort of

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640
cleaning up after a handful of sort of
 

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.140
cleaning up after a handful of sort of
plutocrats and I think actually getting

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.150
plutocrats and I think actually getting
 

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.390
plutocrats and I think actually getting
democracy back involves reom powering

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:13.400
democracy back involves reom powering
 

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.710
democracy back involves reom powering
ourselves to be able to make our own

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720
ourselves to be able to make our own
 

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.810
ourselves to be able to make our own
mistakes and to learn from them

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:18.820
 

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.070
it was very interesting in at the end of

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080
it was very interesting in at the end of
 

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.379
it was very interesting in at the end of
2008 to see Alan Greenspan looking

destructive to society those kinds of
 

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.190
destructive to society those kinds of
ideas are ones that Alan Greenspan

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200
ideas are ones that Alan Greenspan
 

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.379
ideas are ones that Alan Greenspan
more or less faithfully embodied in his

00:31:52.379 --> 00:31:52.389
more or less faithfully embodied in his

end of 2008 it all came crashing down
 

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.669
end of 2008 it all came crashing down
now one of the reasons that I wrote this

00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679
now one of the reasons that I wrote this
 

00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:03.590
now one of the reasons that I wrote this
book is firstly to show how those ideas

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600
book is firstly to show how those ideas
 

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.419
book is firstly to show how those ideas
ascended and why they inevitably came

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:06.429
ascended and why they inevitably came
 

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:11.249
ascended and why they inevitably came
apart at the fell to pieces but also I

00:32:11.249 --> 00:32:11.259
apart at the fell to pieces but also I
 

00:32:11.259 --> 00:32:13.799
apart at the fell to pieces but also I
mean it's a way of saying look actually

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:13.809
mean it's a way of saying look actually
 

00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:17.639
mean it's a way of saying look actually
that there was a few decades where that

00:32:17.639 --> 00:32:17.649
that there was a few decades where that
 

00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:18.990
that there was a few decades where that
the sort of free market fundamentalists

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000
the sort of free market fundamentalists
 

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.360
the sort of free market fundamentalists
were able to take control of the economy

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.370
were able to take control of the economy
 

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.789
were able to take control of the economy
and it's gonna be very hard to pry the

00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799
and it's gonna be very hard to pry the
 

00:32:23.799 --> 00:32:27.210
and it's gonna be very hard to pry the
pry their hands off it um but there are

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:27.220
pry their hands off it um but there are
 

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.389
pry their hands off it um but there are
ways of actually reclaiming our economy

00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399
ways of actually reclaiming our economy

dogma of the free-market libertarians
 

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:39.779
dogma of the free-market libertarians
and so it's important to remember that

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:39.789
and so it's important to remember that
 

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:41.730
and so it's important to remember that
and important to actually plunder

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:41.740
and important to actually plunder
 

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.260
and important to actually plunder

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:45.270
history but for lessons that we have
 

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.990
history but for lessons that we have
that are well worth learning for as we

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000
that are well worth learning for as we
 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.690
that are well worth learning for as we
try and build a better economy and right

now's a good time to be thinking

00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:52.659
now's a good time to be thinking
 

00:33:52.659 --> 00:33:54.149
now's a good time to be thinking
learning those lessons and thinking

00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159
learning those lessons and thinking
 

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:55.440
learning those lessons and thinking
about how we can restructure things

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:55.450
about how we can restructure things
 

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.270
about how we can restructure things
because as we come out of the recession

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:57.280
because as we come out of the recession
 

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.760
because as we come out of the recession
and you know although we're told that

00:33:59.760 --> 00:33:59.770
and you know although we're told that
 

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:00.899
and you know although we're told that
recovery is on its way I mean

00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:00.909
recovery is on its way I mean
 

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:02.580
recovery is on its way I mean
unemployment is still going to climb

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:02.590
unemployment is still going to climb
 

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.230
unemployment is still going to climb
over the next couple of years and no one

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240
over the next couple of years and no one
 

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.899

things are going to get better for the

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:07.809
things are going to get better for the
 

00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:09.119
things are going to get better for the
richest Americans things are starting to

richest Americans things are starting to
 

00:34:09.129 --> 00:34:10.500
richest Americans things are starting to
turn around but for the poorest things

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:10.510
turn around but for the poorest things
 

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.180

are gonna get worse for a good good two

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:12.190
are gonna get worse for a good good two
 

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:16.109
are gonna get worse for a good good two
three years at best and I think now's a

00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119
three years at best and I think now's a
 

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:17.280
three years at best and I think now's a
good time to be thinking about well

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.290
good time to be thinking about well
 

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.190
good time to be thinking about well
actually if if we're not part of the

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200
actually if if we're not part of the
 

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.310
actually if if we're not part of the
plutocracy well what what do we want and

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320
plutocracy well what what do we want and
 

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.169
plutocracy well what what do we want and
what can we learn from the past to make

00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:25.179
what can we learn from the past to make
 

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.730
what can we learn from the past to make
sure that we these mistakes never happen

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:26.740
sure that we these mistakes never happen
 

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.680
sure that we these mistakes never happen
again

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:29.690
 

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.389
my my first book was called stuffed and

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399
my my first book was called stuffed and
 

00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:35.480
my my first book was called stuffed and
starved and it the title comes from a

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:35.490
starved and it the title comes from a
 

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.460
starved and it the title comes from a
strange paradox that we live in a world

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:37.470
strange paradox that we live in a world
 

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.280
strange paradox that we live in a world
where today over a billion people are

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.290
where today over a billion people are
 

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:43.190
where today over a billion people are
malnourished and going hungry and at the

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200
malnourished and going hungry and at the
 

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.960
malnourished and going hungry and at the
same time more than a billion people are

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:44.970
same time more than a billion people are
 

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.530
same time more than a billion people are
overweight and what I tried to do in the

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540
overweight and what I tried to do in the
 

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.470
overweight and what I tried to do in the
book is is explain how it is that not

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480
book is is explain how it is that not
 

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.639
book is is explain how it is that not
only that these two things are possible

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:52.649
only that these two things are possible
 

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:55.100
only that these two things are possible
simultaneously but how they are outcomes

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:55.110
simultaneously but how they are outcomes
 

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.720
simultaneously but how they are outcomes
of the same system so let's I mean first

00:34:59.720 --> 00:34:59.730
of the same system so let's I mean first
 

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.460
of the same system so let's I mean first
aren't let's let's just understand the

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:01.470
aren't let's let's just understand the
 

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.410
aren't let's let's just understand the
dynamic here and actually you don't have

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420
dynamic here and actually you don't have
 

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.620
dynamic here and actually you don't have
to go to Africa I mean you one could

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:06.630
to go to Africa I mean you one could
 

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.780
to go to Africa I mean you one could
imagine that the starving are in Africa

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:08.790
imagine that the starving are in Africa
 

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.570
imagine that the starving are in Africa
and the you know the the the obese are

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:11.580
and the you know the the the obese are
 

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.310
and the you know the the the obese are
in America I mean to some extent that's

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320
in America I mean to some extent that's
 

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.410
in America I mean to some extent that's
true

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:14.420
true
 

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.150
true
the United States is the most obese

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160
the United States is the most obese
 

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.790
the United States is the most obese
country on earth and only four out of

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800
country on earth and only four out of
 

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.540
country on earth and only four out of
ten Americans are have a normal body

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:23.550
ten Americans are have a normal body
 

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.609
ten Americans are have a normal body
weight and the rest of us are a little

00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619
weight and the rest of us are a little
 

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:29.990
weight and the rest of us are a little
portly but but the the the the the fact

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000
portly but but the the the the the fact
 

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.670
portly but but the the the the the fact
is that there is hunger in America as

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680
is that there is hunger in America as
 

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.760
is that there is hunger in America as
well in 2008 forty nine million

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:34.770
well in 2008 forty nine million
 

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.490
well in 2008 forty nine million
Americans were food insecure they didn't

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500
Americans were food insecure they didn't
 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.560
Americans were food insecure they didn't
know it during the year where their next

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:39.570
know it during the year where their next
 

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.230
know it during the year where their next
meal was coming from so it's possible to

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240
meal was coming from so it's possible to
 

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.349
meal was coming from so it's possible to
have hunger hunger and obesity in the

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359
have hunger hunger and obesity in the
 

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:47.180
have hunger hunger and obesity in the
same country at the same time and it's

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.190
same country at the same time and it's
 

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.900
same country at the same time and it's
possible to have hunger in in in the

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:50.910
possible to have hunger in in in the
 

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.550
possible to have hunger in in in the
United States even when there's an

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560
United States even when there's an
 

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.160
United States even when there's an
abundance of food and you know I mean

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.170
abundance of food and you know I mean
 

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.470
abundance of food and you know I mean
it's not like in 2008 the shelves were

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480
it's not like in 2008 the shelves were
 

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.510
it's not like in 2008 the shelves were
emptied in the United States but what

00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520
emptied in the United States but what
 

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.980
emptied in the United States but what
happened was the price of that food went

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:00.990
happened was the price of that food went
 

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.780
happened was the price of that food went
up and the incomes of people went down

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.790
up and the incomes of people went down
 

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.420
up and the incomes of people went down
and that's why people go hungry in

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:05.430
and that's why people go hungry in
 

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.950
and that's why people go hungry in
America it's not because of some

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960
America it's not because of some
 

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.980
America it's not because of some
Malthusian shortage of food it's because

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:09.990
Malthusian shortage of food it's because
 

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.220
Malthusian shortage of food it's because
of poverty now the AMIA that's so the

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.230
of poverty now the AMIA that's so the
 

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:18.260
of poverty now the AMIA that's so the
question that i ask is is about well how

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:18.270
question that i ask is is about well how
 

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.599
question that i ask is is about well how
do we get the situation and also how do

00:36:20.599 --> 00:36:20.609
do we get the situation and also how do
 

00:36:20.609 --> 00:36:22.940
do we get the situation and also how do
how do we get these outcomes of hunger

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:22.950
how do we get these outcomes of hunger
 

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.740
how do we get these outcomes of hunger
and obesity well the hunger is easy to

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:24.750
and obesity well the hunger is easy to
 

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.160
and obesity well the hunger is easy to
explain

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.170
explain
 

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.730
explain
hunger obtains when as I say people are

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740
hunger obtains when as I say people are
 

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.859
hunger obtains when as I say people are
too poor to be able to afford the food

00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:30.869
too poor to be able to afford the food
 

00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:33.590
too poor to be able to afford the food
that is around them um and the majority

today live in rural areas that this is a
strange paradox that the people who are

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:39.750
strange paradox that the people who are
 

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.660
strange paradox that the people who are
the hungriest on earth tend to be the

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:41.670
the hungriest on earth tend to be the
 

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.280
the hungriest on earth tend to be the
people involved in agriculture

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:43.290
people involved in agriculture
 

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.560
people involved in agriculture
and farm but particularly farm laborers

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:45.570
