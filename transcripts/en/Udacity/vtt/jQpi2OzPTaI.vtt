The answer is diffuse environment map or a radiance map. This type of map

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:07.118
captures the diffuse contribution from the environment for various normal

00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:10.812
directions. By having these sorts of maps for different points in space, it's

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:15.590
possible to the diffuse contribution also vary with position. This idea is

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.187
called the nuradiance volume. In practice, there is more compact representation

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.610
than cube maps, but the idea is the same.
