00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.450
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.330
I am Betsy Peterson,
the director

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.440
of the American Folklife
Center and I want

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.970
to welcome you here today
for the first -- the --

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.300
the first of our
2018 lectures as part

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.650
of the Benjamin Botkin
Lecture Series.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.550
The Botkin Series, for
those of you who don't know,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.860
is an opportunity for the
American Folklife Center

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
to highlight the work of
leading scholars and researchers

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.650
in the disciplines of folklore,
ethnomusicology, oral history,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.920
and cultural heritage.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.930
It also is an opportunity for us

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.690
to enhance our collections
here at the AFC.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.470
The Botkin Lectures
form an important facet

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.770
of our collections.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.180
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes a part

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.470
of the permanent collections
here at the Library.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.830
In addition, the
lectures are later posted

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.950
as website -- and
not as websites.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.340
As webcasts on the Library's
website where they are available

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.660
for viewing to Internet
patrons throughout the world.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.090
So with that caveat
let me ask you

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.100
if you do have your cell phone
on please turn it off now

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.110
or any other electronic devices.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.780
But on to our lecture.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.150
Today I have the pleasure

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.750
of introducing Washington
based journalist, researcher,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.110
and author, Rick Massimo

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.470
for a Botkin Lecture
highlighting the history

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920
of the Newport Folk Festival.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.460
Rick drew on his
extensive interviews

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.900
and in-depth archival
research about the festival

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.830
for his recently released book
from Wesleyan University Press,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.290
I Got a Song: A History of
the Newport Folk Festival,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.370
I'm very happy to point out that
he also did much of the research

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.310
for this book here
at the Library

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.740
in the American Folklife
Center archive.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.210
And I want to urge
everyone to please stick

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.500
around after the lecture
to talk with Rick,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.120
buy a copy of the book,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.390
and there will be a book signing
just out in the entryway there.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.140
Established more than a
half century ago in Newport,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.850
Rhode Island, the festival
has become an American

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.870
musical institution.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.640
Over the years the
Newport Festival has shaped

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.560
and influenced the American
public's understanding

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.350
of folk music, introducing
audiences

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.890
to deeply root deeply --
rooted traditional artists

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.900
and now classic folk
repertoires as well

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.480
as by introducing newer
interpretations of folk,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.820
a generation of singer
songwriters,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.070
and featuring legendary
performances.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.700
Today, Rick explores
Newport's impact

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.090
on the American folk
music scene.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.940
Relates a few of
the many stories

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.230
about fabled Newport
Festival performances

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.230
and discusses how the iconic
festival has reemerged

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.780
as an influential focal
point for a new generation

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.060
of performers and fans.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.270
And once again, the
talk will be followed

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.320
by a book signing in
the outside foyer.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.520
So please join me in
welcoming Rick Massimo

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.890
for his Botkin Lecture,
I Got a Song:

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.750
A History of the
Newport Folk Festival.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.710
&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo:
Thank you very much.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.870
Thank you for having me.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.250
The Newport Folk
Festival started in 1959

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.440
and since then it's gone --

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.970
it's undergone a
number of regeneration

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.590
and a number of reinventions.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.310
And one of the things that
I noticed immediately is

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.250
that the two questions
it continues

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.090
to ask every year are what is
folk music and what can it do

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.680
and there's no one
answer to that,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.050
there are a lot of
answers to that.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.390
And I also quickly realized
that the fact that there are

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.350
so many different answers
to that, that is the answer.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.060
In fact, one of the chapters
of the book, I actually --

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.930
that influenced the entire
structure and the writing

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.170
of that chapter and we'll
get to that in a minute.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.040
So the Newport Folk Festival was
begun by George wean in 1959.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.560
He had started running
the Newport Folk --

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.710
the Newport Jazz
Festival in 1954.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.620
He also ran the nightclub,
Storyville in Boston.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.040
And in 1959 he brought Odetta
in to do what they used

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.080
to call the time
the eight-day week.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.970
That was seven shows, one
show each night for a week

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.200
and a matinee on Sunday.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.360
And what he noticed very quickly
was that nobody was coming

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.710
to the shows except the Sunday
matinee was completely packed.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.710
It was completely packed by kids
from Harvard University and MIT.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.590
And like George says, they
were all drinking ginger ale.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.320
I wasn't making any money
selling drinks to them.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.270
But Odetta was the
queen of folk music and

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.570
and the place was
completely packed

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.360
and he realized something
is actually going on here.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.160
And this was at a time when
folk music was probably the most

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.640
popular music of the day.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.470
It became -- it was sort of in
the in in one of the troughs

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.060
of rock and roll's history
that folk music with groups

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.490
like The Kingston Trio,
The Chad Mitchell trio,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.790
The brothers Four.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.680
This became -- these were these
were hit makers at the time

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.000
and George we didn't really know
that but he didn't know much

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.300
about that world of music.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.350
But he saw that it
was popular and he saw

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.880
that something was happening.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.360
So he began to have
long discussions

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.840
with Odetta's manager,
Albert Grossman.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.100
And together they decided
to have a folk afternoon

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.020
at the Newport Jazz Festival.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.360
And it wasn't long
before you realize, no,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.640
there's actually enough there's
actually enough interest here

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.600
to have an entire folk festival
so that's what they did.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.260
What he -- but like I said
he was not very conversant

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.080
in in the world of folk music
and he needed, what I refer

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.490
to in the book as,
a native guide.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.000
He had several native guides
in the in the in the course

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.610
of the history of folk festival

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.940
and Albert Grossman
was the first one.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.460
Pete Seeger, of course.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.200
And this is from
the first festival.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.360
&gt;&gt; Whenever you see here, banjo
player anywhere in the country.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.030
With a banjo waist high, head
back, Adam's apple bobbing,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.030
you san say like Killroy,
Pete Seeger has been there.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.510
Here then is America's
tuning fork, Pete Seeger.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:20.940
[ Applause ]

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.480
&gt;&gt; This song, the words were
written by a man in Wales.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.460
A man who was raised
as a coal miner.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.870
And he rewrote a little
old nursery rhyme.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.110
The nursery rhyme
originally said, oranges

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.180
and lemons say the
bells of St. Clement's.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.870
But he rewrote it
for all the bells

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.510
in the little mining
towns of his home.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.810
&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo: Right.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.510
Well that clip started right at
the very beginning and the edit

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.930
that I had in there didn't
actually take so we'll move on.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.580
But what I wanted to
say about Pete Seeger

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.750
and the first festival is
that right at the beginning,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.060
the argument, the dispute

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.960
over what real folk music
was began right then.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.050
At the -- on the last
day of the folk festival,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.130
the Kingston Trio were
supposed to be the --

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.800
was supposed to be
the headliners.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.100
They were supposed to
finish the night out.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.850
And one of -- one of the
co-organizers, Lewis Lorillard,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.260
he was one of the
organizers of the

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.730
of the Jazz Festival as well.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.840
He was getting besieged
by people all day.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.170
"Can you put the Kingston
Trio on a bit earlier?

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.960
It's Sunday night, I got to get
home, I got a babysitter, etc."

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:51.870
So finally he did that and Earl
Scruggs who was supposed to go

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.370
on before the Kingston
Trio, they put him last.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.740
Problem was, after the Kingston
Trio were done, you know,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:07.000
they had Charlie on the MTA,
Cerocero, they had Tom Dooley.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.040
After all these hits,
people were charged

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.660
up they were they
were going crazy.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.360
They wanted them to stay.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.830
When Earl Scruggs came
on, everyone said --

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.360
well, I mean, you know,
everyone was bored by this

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.660
and everyone was chanting

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.470
for the Kingston
Trio to come back on.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.020
Even, I believe it was Dave
Guard, one of the members

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.240
of the Kingston Trio,
said -- came out and said.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.540
"Guys, please.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.840
You know, come on.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.140
Show some respect."

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.440
Didn't work.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.240
He did a couple of songs,
and then he left, and they --

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.510
and the Kingston
Trio came back on.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.480
This was a problem in the in the
folk music world at the time.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.090
And George Wing will tell you
he lost a lot of respect in the

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.660
in the folk music
world over that.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.300
But that conflict actually
started even before hand.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.230
The day before, it
was the second day

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.730
of the first Newport
Folk Festival

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.470
and there was a panel
discussion on what --

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.120
on whether what was
being presented

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.020
at the Newport Folk Festival
was sufficiently real folk music

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.640
and whether it was going to
destroy genuine folk music

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.480
and whether the mass production
of music was going to lead to a

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.910
to a bland monochromatic world.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.270
So these are things
that happened right

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.660
from the beginning and they
they're continuing today.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.490
Joan Baez of course, she
was probably the discovery

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.190
of the first festival.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.590
She did a guest spot with Bob
Gibson and it was unannounced.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.750
In fact, John Cowan
told me that he was --

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.810
he had been chatting up Joan
Baez for a couple of days.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:53.570
And finally on that last evening
she said, you know, "Excuse me.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.270
I got to go do something
with this guy."

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.650
And he's like, "I don't
know what that is."

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.220
But as he watched and she
got up with him and she sang

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.420
and the whole place went crazy.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.510
And let's see what
we have this time.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:29.150
[ Music ]

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.590
Well shorter than I
intended but never mind.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:41.150
So after the second Newport Folk
Festival in 1960 there was --

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.350
it -- the festival
came onto one of its --

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.210
came up to one of its hiatuses
that it's had over the years.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.160
Essentially what happened
is that the Jazz Festival

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.850
which is the week
afterwards, there was rioting

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.180
and destruction in the
streets of Newport from --

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.830
not from people who
were in the festival

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.050
but the whole crowd
outside the festival.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.900
A, you know, there weren't
rock festivals at the time.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.580
It wasn't the kind of place.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.290
So your -- it was sort of
your mass happening kind of --

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.460
it was sort of your
mass happening

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.910
that would bring droves of
young people to Newport,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.800
some of whom went in to
hear the music and some

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.250
of whom had just come
to cause trouble.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.580
So after the 1960 festival, the
Newport festivals were kicked

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.630
out of Newport for
a couple of years.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.270
They came back in 1963.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.230
In 1963 there were a
couple of major changes

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.520
to the way the festival was run.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.220
First of all, Albert
Grossman was out.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.230
He was too busy with
his own work.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.930
Pete Seeger became --

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.250
what I would call the
second native guide

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.680
to folk music for George Wing.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.710
And it reorganized as
a nonprofit festival.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.630
And that may sound like inside
baseball but what happened,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.110
the main point of the
structure of the nonprofit was

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:18.140
that every artist got $50 a
day whether you were Bob Dylan

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:24.460
or Joan Baez or, you
know, the second fiddler

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.140
for cousin Emmy's band.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.980
You got $50 a day.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:38.100
And the proceeds from that went
into a nonprofit foundation

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.680
that was dedicated to the
discovery and the promulgation

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.140
of folk music and
indigenous music nationwide.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:55.970
There was also, at the time, a
strong current of social justice

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.900
that ran through the festival.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.230
This is probably
the capstone moment.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.850
This is -- let's see.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.170
That's Peter, Paul, and
Mary, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.040
the Freedom Singers,
Pete Seeger,

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.260
and Theo Bikel singing We
Shall Overcome at the end

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:19.260
of the Saturday of
the 1963 festival.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.790
McKell later called
it the supreme moment

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.490
in the national seance
and one of the things

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.350
that I think is important
to note is

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:35.260
that this is a song
that already existed.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.420
I think that -- in the fact
this wasn't even the first time

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.080
that this song was
sung in Newport.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.370
Guy Carillon sang it in 1960.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.450
But it's a matter of context.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.340
It's not just the performers
and it's not just the song

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.210
that make a musical
moment iconic.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.010
It's the audience and it's
the time that it comes in.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.050
This was July 1963, a
month later was the march

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.350
on Washington.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.610
A couple of weeks after that was
the Birmingham church bombing.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.460
And, you know the
Civil Rights Act

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.370
and the Voting Rights Act
were still in the future.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.410
So this is why this is
the moment that stuck

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:24.050
because this was a, you know, it
was a large -- it had an impact.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.810
Soon after this, President
Johnson was saying that,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.940
you know, that the problem,

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.360
the Civil Rights problem is
not just a Negro problem,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.470
it's a problem for all of us to
overcome and we shall overcome.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.190
And that was kind of
an earthshaking moment

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.000
for a president to say
something like that.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.240
It was, you know, it -- I --

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.230
all I can relate it to is the
president saying black lives

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:00.860
matter or, you know, this
was a -- consider, you know,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.950
the Civil Rights Movement was
still considered a radical kind

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.420
of fringe at the time.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.990
And for a president
to pick up a phrase

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.890
like that was significant.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.600
And of course it wasn't just

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.050
because of the Newport Folk
Festival but it was a sign

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.450
of where the folk knew --
where the folk movement was

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.660
and the Newport Festival
was at the forefront of that

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:59.050
[ Music ]

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.180
Okay. So that's Lightnin'
Hopkins.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.270
And one of the other key moments

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:10.050
of the 1963 festival was the
discovery, and the rediscovery,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.250
and the presentation of blues
singers such as himself.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.050
Such as Mississippi John Hurt.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.930
This was part of what the
nonprofit structure did.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.560
They were -- people were --

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.650
and the Newport people
weren't the only people

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.080
but there were people
going down in the South

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.760
and finding these singers who
had recorded a couple of sides

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.450
at the time, you know, in the
in the 30's and '40s or so

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.730
but no one had seen
them ever since.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.120
In the case of Mississippi
John Hurt, for example,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.720
he came to the Newport Festival
in 1963 and somebody told him,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.480
"You're not Mississippi
John Hurt.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.050
Mississippi John Hurt is dead.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.150
I have that unreliable
authority."

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.570
And in fact, Dick Spots
was one of the people

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.930
who discovered him, you
know, it's a funny story.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.630
But he said, "Well let's see.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:06.180
He has a song called" -- He
explained how they found him.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.480
They said, "Well, you know,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.610
we figured he had a song
called Avalon Blues."

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.700
And said, "Avalon's my home."

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.500
And his name is Mississippi
John Hurt

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.710
so he's probably
from Mississippi.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.330
So let's see if there is a town
called Avalon, Mississippi.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.790
And so they had to
get ,you know,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.490
south of the Mason-Dixon line
before they could even find a

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.200
map that had Avalon,
Mississippi on it

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.960
but there was so they found it.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.360
And they -- once they found
somebody in Avalon, Mississippi,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.180
they stopped the car, and
they got out, and they said,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.430
"Do you know a guy
named John hurt?"

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.060
"The, what, guitar player?"

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.880
"Yeah." "Oh yeah.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.180
He's right over there."

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.750
And that's how they found him.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.610
This kind of field work was
one of the very important --

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.270
one of the very important
aspects of the

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:59.970
of the nonprofit Newport Folk
Festival of the mid '60s.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:36.050
[ Music ]

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.400
&gt;&gt; Right. So that is a
Cajun band consisting

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.050
of Adam Landreneau, Cyprien
Landreneau and Jerry Devillier.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.280
That was at the 1965 festival.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.690
At the 1964 festival, which I
could not find a picture of,

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.030
an ad-hoc Cajun band
with Dewey Balfa

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.080
as a substitute guitar player,
came to the Newport Festival

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.710
and that was the first time that
Cajun music had been performed

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.740
in a large, sort of, concert
setting outside of Louisiana.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.430
And the thing about that was a
lot of people in Louisiana said

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.730
that they shouldn't go.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.550
There were op eds and
the newspapers saying.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.850
"They shouldn't come.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.530
They shouldn't leave Louisiana."

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.800
Because Cajuns were
considered these backwards,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.750
embarrassing kind of people

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.000
and they're also considered
these sort of, you know,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.720
they were maybe they
were second,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.400
third generation immigrants but
they were basically not real,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.440
you know, they were
not the real thing.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.860
And in fact, I've been told a
lot of Cajuns felt the same way.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.040
They said, "No, they
shouldn't go up there and play.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.430
They're just going
to embarrass us

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.770
and the entire state
of Louisiana."

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.490
Of course that didn't happen
and the place went crazy.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.270
You know, I've pulled a
little sleight of hand.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.570
That that cut is actually

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:03.850
from the Cajun band's
1964 performance.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:09.760
And what happened
there was twofold.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.620
The -- an entire, you know, fans
from all over the country came

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.840
and they heard Cajun music and
suddenly you had Cajun fans

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.020
from all over the country and
there was hospitable territory

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.770
for Cajun musicians to travel
and play across the U.S.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.260
And at the same time,
Dewey Balfa, especially,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.770
came back to Louisiana
and said, "What --

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.690
you know, we just
knocked people --

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.710
we just got a standing
ovation in Newport Rhode Island

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.240
and I come back here and you
act like you don't know me.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.680
This is not right.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.290
This is -- you know, my culture
is not a second-class culture."

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.920
And he was determined that
it was going to be respected

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.000
and that it was going
to be known.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.700
And that is what happened, you
know, with help funding from the

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.600
from the Newport Folk
Foundation, among others.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.640
There started -- they started
holding Cajun music mini

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.970
festivals and contests
and concerts in Louisiana.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:25.170
And that became instrumental in
popularizing and bringing sort

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.210
of a cultural a cultural
respect to Cajun music

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.050
and culture in Louisiana itself.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.700
So it worked inside the state
and it worked outside the state.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.120
Bob Jones, who I'll get to
in a moment, told me a story.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.660
He was he was on one
of these road trips.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.110
They were scouting out talent
to play at the Newport festival.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.120
And he, and Ralph
Rinzler, and Revon Reed,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.970
and a couple other people were

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.300
in this car driving
along the road.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.790
And they stopped and asked
this Cajun guy for directions,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.550
I believe it was Ralph.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.040
I believe it was Ralph Rinzler
who asked for directions.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.420
And the guy gave
them the directions

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.580
and then he asked them,
"You're not Cajun.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.250
How do you know my language?"

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.720
And Ralph Rinzler said, "Well
I learned it in school."

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.350
And he said, "School?

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.930
You learned this
language in school?"

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.890
He said, "Yeah, you know,
I have books, teachers.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.190
I learned it."

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.710
He said, "People write
this language down?"

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.460
They had no -- he had no idea.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.510
And so the effect that --
Bob Jones will tell you.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.370
The effect that this
had on him to know

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.270
that his language was
something that was in books

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.090
and that was taught in school.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.540
The effect that it
had on him was,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.360
he was just completely blown
away by this and he'll tell you

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.790
that was one of the
great moments he had

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.290
when he was traveling
through the south.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.700
And that, again, that's part
of what the nonprofit structure

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.970
of the Newport Folk Festival
was able to accomplish.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.510
We know who this is

00:24:07.510 --> 00:25:12.340
[ Music ]

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.620
So that's Bob Dylan going
electric at Newport in 1965.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.680
That was his first performance
with an electric guitar

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.500
and a full backup band.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.560
That's one of those
sort of seismic moments

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.330
that affected a lot of people
in a lot of different ways.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:39.120
And thanks to, for example
Martin Scorsese's Dylan

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.540
documentary, we kind of know
-- we know what happened.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.310
We can hear the music.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.920
What we don't know is how --

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.860
what's different is
how it hit each person.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.740
I, when I started writing
what became this book.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.870
I started as a series of stories
for the Providence Journal

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:05.500
where I was working at the
time, I started asking people

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.940
about this and I
started hearing,

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.680
"Oh the whole place went crazy.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.050
People were booing
and throwing things."

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.610
And I started hearing,
"Well people loved it."

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.640
And I started hearing,
"Well it sounded great."

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.460
"It sounded terrible."

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.150
"People booed."

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.450
"Nobody booed."

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.620
"Well I booed."

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.680
And when I started to think
of how I was going to write

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.810
about this, it occurred to
me that that is the answer

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:42.150
to what actually happened
at Newport that evening.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:46.220
There's -- everyone has a
different answer and the fact

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.520
that everyone has a different
answer is the answer.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.530
And you know, I ask myself,
is that is that a cop out?

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.570
But I don't think it is.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.890
You can listen to the
tapes for yourself

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.450
and decide what you think.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.760
But the fact is each
person saw it differently

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.930
or at least there were -- there
was an entire kaleidoscope

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.090
of different reactions to it.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.050
It was a thrilling sort
of look into the future.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.680
It was a betrayal.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.990
It is especially a sacrilege

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.750
because he had done
it at Newport.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.200
You know, I feel like
people couldn't have been

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.300
that surprised because Like a
Rolling Stone was the number two

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.630
records in the country
at the time.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.910
And he had sort of --
he started off in 1963

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.620
with these denim work
shirts and singing songs

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.540
about the coal miners
and that sort of thing.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:48.400
And then there's a
wonderful moment of footage

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.110
that Murray Lerner shot in 1964

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.490
of Bob Dylan playing
Mr. Tambourine Man.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.740
And so, you know, solo acoustic.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.460
But Pete Seeger is
sitting off to the side.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.030
He is -- he was one of the
people who introduced him.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.280
And he's just sort of,
"Well I'm going to try

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.960
to make sense of this, you know.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.330
It's Bob, so I know that
it's coming from a good place

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:18.480
but I don't -- what
is he talking about?"

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.540
And so this was the next
step in the process.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.500
And of course by the
end of that year,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.510
he had kind of left the folk
music world behind entirely

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.950
and George Wing will
tell you that too.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:35.930
He said, "By 1966 I knew
we were having problems."

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.990
So like I said in the book,
I mean, you know, he's --

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:44.360
they thought he was going
to sort of shine a --

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.240
they thought he was going
to shine a light on --

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.360
I think they thought he
was going to shine a light

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.730
on the folk music world
and who was in it.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.480
When in fact he sort
of left a bit

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.470
of scorched earth behind
him where he had been.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.350
Because there was
all sorts of --

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.530
there was still plenty
of great music being made

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:09.230
but there was all sorts of
conflict and recrimination.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.430
And the other thing
that happened is simply,

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:16.300
he demonstrated for a lot of
performers, and then for a lot

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.810
of audience members, that you
could you could have intelligent

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.300
lyrics, you could
have poetic lyrics,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.550
you could have evocative
lyrics, and play rock and roll.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.680
And obviously the Beatles
had something to do with that

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.780
as well but he influenced a lot
of performers and a lot of fans

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.170
to go off with him
and play rock music

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.460
and that left the
Newport Folk Festival

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.420
in kind of a difficult place.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.310
Now this is the finale
of the 1967 festival.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.120
That is Judy Collins,
Theodore Bikel.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.840
I don't know who's
right in the back.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.180
Then there's Arlo Guthrie, Mimi
Farina, Joan Baez, Jim Kweskin,

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.650
Maria Muldaur, and George
Wing fitting in very perfectly

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.700
with the with the rest
of the attire on stage.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.850
I love that picture.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:14.260
Like I say, at this point the
festival was starting to run

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.230
out of gas and more -- starting
to run out of gas culturally

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.780
and more importantly it
was running out of money.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:28.980
They were continuing to plow
money into the promotion,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.900
and the promulgation of folk
music, and folk traditions.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.990
But the same kind of
money wasn't coming

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.720
in because you weren't getting
Bob Dylan, you got Joan Baez

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.920
that year, but for the most
part you didn't have Joan Baez.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.390
And the other thing is that the
festival was getting too big

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.690
for Newport.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.110
Newport at the time
had about 30,000 people

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.500
and the total attendance,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.130
obviously there would
be some repeaters,

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.990
but the total attendance
for the festival in 1967

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.440
or '68, I believe was 70,000.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.850
You had people sleeping
on the beach.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.150
You had people sleeping

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.560
on people's front lawns
and people's porches.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.160
This was -- and not in
an invited sense either.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.330
The -- some people
in Newport loved it

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.580
because they didn't have
Airbnb at the time but they,

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.890
that's essentially
what they did.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.370
They rented out rooms
in their houses.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.480
But for the most
part it was a --

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.690
it was becoming a massive
headache for Newport itself

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:39.960
and that became a -- well,
just became a huge collection

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.780
of bad vibes all around.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.110
The same process happened
at the Jazz Festival.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:51.270
In 1970 they canceled
the Newport Folk Festival

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.430
and they were going
-- there was going

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:57.120
to be a very small 1971
Newport Folk Festival

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:04.500
but there was a riot at, again,
at the 1971 Jazz Festival

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.230
which Dionne -- it reached a
peak while Dionne Warwick was

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.510
singing, What the
World Needs Now.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.250
[ Laughter ]

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.720
They trashed the stage,
they trashed the piano.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.630
People invaded -- again,

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.230
it was people invading
from the outside.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.710
And there -- and at that
point, Newport voted

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.760
to eject both festivals.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.520
So Newport -- so the
festivals left Newport in 1971.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:41.460
Around the mid-'80s,
there was a resurgence

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.810
in singer/songwriter folk
music, which you can argue,

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.350
is one of the many arguments,
if it's by a singer/songwriter,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.930
is it really folk music?

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.260
Is it only folk music
if it's passed

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.000
down from one unnamed
Appalachian songwriter

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.210
to another?

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.120
These are open -- these are --

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.100
well, I don't know if they're
open questions anymore,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.580
but I certainly get -- I
certainly still hear plenty

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.740
of opinions on both
sides of that.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.170
This is Tom Rush.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:23.020
In 1984, he made an important
discovery that had resonance

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.130
to the revival of the
Newport Folk Festival.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.890
He did an annual Christmas show

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:35.530
at I believe it was
the Channel in Boston.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:40.690
And he realized -- he
started that in the late '70s,

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.650
and by the early '80s,

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:47.420
he realized that attendance was
kind of falling off the table.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.360
He realized that
people weren't coming

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.170
out to see the show anymore.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.630
And at the same time, this
marketing student came to him

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.680
and said, "Listen, can I do a
marketing questionnaire your --

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.660
at your next Christmas show?"

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.630
And he said, "Market --

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.700
" He said, "I don't know
about a market -- all right.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.000
Sure. Fine.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.300
Do what you want."

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.730
So he found out, but -- and he
said, you know, at the middle

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.060
of -- you know, in the middle
of the show at the intermission,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.760
people were scribbling like
it was a test in school.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.270
He said he loved it.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:23.710
But he actually found out from
that that his fans were --

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.190
had, for lack of a
better word, grown up.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.090
They were doctors,
they were lawyers,

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.020
they were professional people.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.360
And he had the insight --

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.800
well, instead of
staying at the channel

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.830
or going someplace smaller and
going fewer and fewer nights,

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.230
he said, "I'm going to rent
out freaking Symphony Hall."

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.730
He said, "People don't want to
go to a dingy place like the --

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.030
" The Channel is terrible.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.960
It's not there anymore.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.630
I'm glad. "People want to --

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.150
you know, my fans want
to go someplace --

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.800
they have a couple
of extra dollars.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.100
They're still out there."

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.600
You know, he was being told
there's no more audience

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.430
for your music and he said,
you know, "This is ridiculous.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.760
You know, this is the same
generation that I grew up with."

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.230
And he said, "If --
they haven't all died.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.260
It would be in the papers."

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.120
So he rented out Symphony Hall
and he sold out Symphony Hall.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:23.580
So he went from not being able
to fill two shows at a capacity

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.230
of 400 per show to selling
out Symphony Hall which was

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.580
about just short of 2,000.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.040
So that's when he realized,
something is going on here

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.070
and a number of people involved

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.980
with the Newport Folk
Festival realized

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.110
that something was
going on here as well.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:46.010
And that's when they decided
to revive the festival.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.190
At the same time, the city of
Newport was going through a lot

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.230
of changes and they realized

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.440
that they needed
large tourist events

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.010
and they were better
able to handle them.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.360
And they also negotiated --
you know, the festival now,

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.170
it has to be in the daytime.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:05.590
It has to be at Ford Adams,
which is on a peninsula.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.590
The shows have to be
over by seven o'clock.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.710
The attendance is
capped at 10,000.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.310
It became a very
different festival

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.140
with a very different crowd.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.960
But there were enough people
together to revive it and that's

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.090
when the music changed again.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.060
This is Bob Jones.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:34.280
He started as a volunteer
in 1963 and he, like I said,

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.220
he was one of the people who
traveled through the South,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:41.230
scouting out talent and
interviewing, finding musicians.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.060
You know, in the pre-internet
days, it was just very --

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.870
much more difficult to
say, "Let's find some --

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.950
let's find a pan pipes
player in Alabama."

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:52.200
Or, "Let's find some
black Cajun musicians.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.500
Not Creole musicians.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.050
Black Cajun musicians."

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.640
This was -- you know,
this was a difficult thing

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.170
when you couldn't just
sort of like look it up,

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.010
when you couldn't Google things.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:07.940
But he had been a
singer/songwriter himself

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.160
and he sort of became
the third native guide

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.550
to the folk world
for George Wein.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.840
And he'd brought that sound --

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.960
he brought the more modern
singer/songwriter sound.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.230
He also expanded the
definition of folk music.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.630
You know, a lot of people were
a little bit -- like, Los Lobos,

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.820
Robert Cray, do they
really fit into this?

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:39.490
But I found that Mike
Seeger once wrote --

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.240
and this was back
in the mid-'60s.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.340
Mike Seeger, Pete Seeger's
half-brother, said, you know,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.810
we want to keep the festival
within the bounds of performers

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:57.550
who fit in the -- I'm
trying to remember now.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.070
The -- what we think of as
the -- has something to do --

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.260
have some connection with
the traditions of folk music.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.860
And those word some
connections mean a lot

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.120
and they can mean a lot
of different things.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.330
And he used that and
he used that to sort

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.170
of grow the popularity
of the festival

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.970
and to expand the
definition of folk music.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.840
And one of the things
he did, as well,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.080
was to consult his
daughter and her friends,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.500
because they were
a new generation

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.010
and they were listening to music

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.710
that he didn't know
anything about.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.370
Perfect example.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:38.510
&gt;&gt; You want me to --

00:38:38.510 --> 00:39:24.040
[ Music ]

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.030
&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo: So
the Indigo Girls,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.280
they played at Newport
nine years

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.390
out of 10, I believe it was.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:41.300
I believe it was 1988
or '89 to 1998, 1999.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.650
They headlined each time.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:48.140
They were by far the most
popular act at the festival.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.920
They once -- and they
loved the festival as well.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.940
Amy Ray once told me that
actually her favorite moments

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.050
from the Newport Folk
Festival weren't about playing.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.420
They were about hearing
other people play.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.090
They were about hearing -- they
were about her family coming

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.270
and being able to relax
and see old friends

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.830
and hear old friends.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:17.090
And not everybody who
was a long-time attendee

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:21.740
of Newport felt that way because
a lot of their fans would sort

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:27.160
of helicopter in, so to
speak, for their set,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.160
and then helicopter back out
and sort of push their way

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.460
to the front at the same time.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.050
So it was a little bit of a --
you know, there was a little bit

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:37.960
of a schism there
but they were --

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.450
there's no doubt that they were
one of the most popular acts

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.990
at the festival for many years

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:49.450
and they expanded the
definition of folk music.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.750
And they were one of the --

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.880
you know, they were one
of the main female artists

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.290
in the history of the festival.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:01.040
So they sort of expanded the
definition of who could play

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.430
at the festival and who
could draw an enormous crowd

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.730
at the festival.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.030
&gt;&gt; Who was that singing?

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.330
&gt;&gt; That was the Indigo Girls.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.630
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.930
I thought so.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.230
Right.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.530
&gt;&gt; Now, this is George Wein.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.830
He's the set -- he's
second from the right.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.450
His wife, Joyce, is
second from the left

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:22.920
and that is Pops Staples
and the Staple Singers.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:29.550
When George and Joyce
Wein got married in 1959,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:34.040
their marriage was
illegal in 19 states.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.870
And one of the things he
told me that he wanted to do

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.490
with the folk festival was to --

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:49.420
the idea that it was an activist
festival was not an accident.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.060
You know, I asked
him about that.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:58.490
He told me some of the
moments that happened in terms

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.440
of relations between groups
of people from Alabama and,

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.710
you know, black performers
from South Carolina

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.090
and white performers
from Alabama.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:15.030
And he said that these were
very beautiful moments.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.940
And I said, "You knew
what you were doing.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.360
You made these moments
happen, didn't you?"

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.060
And he said, "Well, yeah, I did.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.260
We kind of had to
do that if we wanted

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.290
to be what we wanted
to represent."

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:31.150
He explained to me that
the jazz festival was --

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.200
that's where you demonstrate
an integrated world

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.140
and the folk festival is
where you agitate for one.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.840
And one of my favorite stories
that he ever told me was

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.000
about the founding of
the New Orleans Jazz

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.510
and Heritage Festival.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:51.710
They invited him down there
and the first time that they --

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:55.300
the first time they invited him
to create a festival, they said,

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.360
you know, so we'll
have one side of the --

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.790
we'll have one side of the
field for the white audience

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.680
and another side for
the black audience.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.160
We'll just have a
rope in the middle.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.270
And he said, "Well,
you can't do that.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:14.970
I mean, first of all, I've got
-- I mean, you know, I've --

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.520
you're asking me to bring in
Duke Ellington and these giants

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.520
of jazz and they have
integrated bands.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.820
And they have contracts.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.390
They won't play for
segregated audiences.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.210
They said, "Well, all right."

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.790
They actually huddled over it.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.730
And he said, you know, they're
trying to figure out a way

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.030
around their own laws.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:32.390
This is really strange.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.690
But finally they couldn't.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.040
They said, "Well, we'll
try again in a few years."

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.800
They tried again in a few years
and then they found out --

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:46.070
then they -- there was
another incident of segregation

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.970
in New Orleans over combinations

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.210
for football players
at an All Star game.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.470
And they said, "Well, I guess
we're just not ready for this."

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.330
And a couple years after
that, they said, "Okay.

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.240
I think we're ready
and we're going

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.190
to start a New Orleans Jazz
and Heritage Festival."

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.840
And they had somebody
else run it.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.460
And George Wein said, "Well,
why did you pick somebody else

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.760
to run this festival?"

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.750
And they said, "Well, your
wife's black and we can't --

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.220
you know, we're just not
ready for that here."

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.900
And a year later, after
the festival had been kind

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.000
of disastrous, they
invited him back

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.480
and said, "Well, yeah, sure.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.230
Come on down and
run the festival."

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.910
And he said, "What
happened to the other guy?"

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.430
"Well, don't worry
about the other guy."

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:38.750
And one of the things
he said was, you know,

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:44.830
"I don't change -- " Well, let
me start by saying, he said,

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.570
"I never wanted to be a rebel.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.040
I didn't want to live
outside of society.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.060
I wanted respect
like my father had.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.360
He was a doctor.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.660
He had respect.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.960
I wanted respect.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.260
I've accomplished things.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.560
I'm a businessman.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.600
I want -- you know, I want
that kind of respect."

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.630
And he said, "I wasn't --

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:05.940
I didn't marry Joyce because I
wanted to rebel against society.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.650
I married Joyce because that's
who I wanted to be with."

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:14.910
And he said, "I don't compromise
who I am but at the same time,

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:18.500
I don't tell people
that they're wrong.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.910
They have to find out for
themselves that they're wrong

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.340
and they'll find out."

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:29.110
And I thought that that
was -- I loved that story.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.370
It's one of my favorite
stories that George has told me

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.810
and it's kind of -- it's one
of the centers of the book,

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:39.540
I think, is one of the -- you
know, it's one of the things

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:45.180
that drove me to write about
the festival in the first place.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:49.520
So by about 2009,
this is Tom Morello.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.430
He played there in 2009 as --

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:58.080
in his persona as
the Nightwatchman.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.270
And this is -- these
are the Avett brothers

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:10.270
and this was another evolution
in the sound of folk music.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.510
Sorry.

00:46:12.510 --> 00:47:34.880
[ Music ]

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.090
Right. That didn't cut
off when it was supposed

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.060
to be, but never mind.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:46.340
The Avett Brothers, in 2006
I believe it was, they --

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.690
the Newport Folk
Festival had one

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:50.670
of its least auspicious
bookings ever.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:53.130
That was Jimmy Buffett.

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.750
He said at the time
that he had come

00:47:55.750 --> 00:48:00.630
up a young singer/songwriter in
Cambridge and that he was going

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.790
to do a show that
reflected that.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.170
And I think a lot of people,
including myself, thought, well,

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:09.690
all right, I mean, you know,
Margaritaville is kind of a --

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:12.350
you know, it's actually a sad
song if you think about it.

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:14.370
This could actually work.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:15.830
Yeah, no, it didn't work.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.680
He came there with
his entire band.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.670
He sort of blew the doors
out of the place and --

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.710
but an interesting
thing happened.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.080
Again, there's another situation
where all his fans kind

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.680
of helicoptered in to see him.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.570
And everyone else
made for the exits.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.990
But when they did, they went
past the Avett Brothers.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.990
They weren't supposed to
be playing at the time

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.540
but there had been a rain delay
so they were still playing.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.060
And people went crazy over them.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.030
They were completely -- they
thought they were heading

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.150
to the parking lot but
they stopped at the tent

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.170
and the crowd just sort of
swelled and swelled and swelled.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.120
And one of my friends,
who covered the festival

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.690
for the Newport Daily News,

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.890
asked some of the young
people there, "How did you --

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.190
I never heard of these guys.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.490
They're great but I
never heard of them.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:03.790
How did you find
out about them?"

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.040
And he said, well, you
know, this -- the Internet.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.190
Their website's -- their
music's all over the Internet.

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:14.590
So that was a new sort of -- to
me, that's sort of a new form

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:19.520
of word of mouth, that sort of
spreads the word about artists

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.830
that older people such as
myself don't know about.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.780
And to me that's a continuation
of the kind of folk music --

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.750
the folk tradition that's there.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.300
Now, this is the 2009 festival.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:36.190
I'm going quick because
we are almost out of time.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.320
I am -- this was
the 2009 festival,

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.000
the 50th anniversary festival.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.430
George Wein had sold the
-- after his wife died,

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:49.780
George Wein sold his
operations to a startup company

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.500
who lasted a couple years before
they went completely broke.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.230
And with three months
until the 50th anniversary

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:59.550
of the Newport Folk Festival,
there was no festival.

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:01.670
So they had to bang up
something very quickly

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.200
without a lot of money.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:08.090
And Colin Meloy of the
Decembrists told me

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.720
that he had been told, you know,
his agent told him, "We don't --

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.520
we have no idea whether
they're going

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.860
to actually be able to pay you."

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.380
And he said, "You know,
I don't actually care."

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:23.410
The point was to celebrate the
Newport Festival and that's

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:26.260
when a lot of people realized --

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:30.920
found out how important that
festival had been to a lot

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.740
of people who are
still alive and kicking

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.420
and making new music today.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.750
A lot of people -- a lot

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:41.540
of young people who
are still active.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.710
And, you know, they may be
talking about, you know,

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:48.660
the '80s festival and, you know,
they sort of know the history

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:53.520
of the '60s festival and in a
way what the festival did was

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.890
turn that history from sort
of an albatross into a --

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:58.960
into something that
they celebrate

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.200
and that they recreate.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.760
And at this time,
one of the people

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.850
from that startup operation,
his name is Jay Sweet,

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:10.220
he sort of became the fourth
native guide to folk music.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:15.560
And one of his big
tenants was that just

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.510
because you started off
playing electric guitar in a bar

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:23.240
to people who are drinking beer,
you aren't necessarily less

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.240
of a folk artist than someone
who started playing to --

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.710
an acoustic guitar to people
who were drinking coffee.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:52:22.770
[ Music ]

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:26.010
Okay. So that was
Alynda Lee Segarra

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.230
and Hurray for the Riff Raff.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:29.920
They played there last year.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.370
It's a -- superficially,
it's a very different sound.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.170
It's all electric.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:37.790
You have those very
'80s-sounding keyboards.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:41.940
But to me, the lyric of the song
and the spirit of the song is --

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.760
I feel very -- I sense a very
blues influence there and I --

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.760
to me, that's an
example of the connection

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.060
that artists still have with --

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.100
that's part of that connection
Mike Seeger was talking about

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:59.190
and it's the connection that
artists of today still have

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:01.080
with the artists who we think

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.690
of as undeniably folk music
whereas we think it's maybe some

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.650
sort of different thing now.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.150
And I will just wrap up with,

00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:13.630
this is the finale
of the 2015 festival.

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:18.060
It was the 50th anniversary
of Bob Dylan going electric.

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:24.680
And so we have -- what we
have here is -- these are --

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:30.520
the point I'm trying to make
at the end is that these --

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:33.820
this is music that
was -- these are --

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.330
they're playing songs that
were not considered folk music

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:37.650
at the time.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:43.980
But if you have this many people
singing a song that everyone --

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.720
that they didn't write and
that everyone knows, well,

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.330
that's folk music right there.

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.070
This happens to be Rainy
Day Women number 12

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.040
and 35, I believe it is.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.240
And everybody knows it, and
if you were there, I mean,

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.190
this is a folk music moment.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:04.080
It wasn't -- you know,
and so was Maggie's Farm.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.850
That's on the left
hand microphone there,

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.660
that's the guy from Dawes.

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:16.020
Taylor Goldsmith from Dawes
and he's playing the guitar

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.910
that Bob Dylan played in 1965.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:26.170
And this is -- you know, to me,
that's a folk music moment and,

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:30.410
you know, one of the things I
say in the book is that we think

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.710
of this as going through -- as
these very discreet periods,

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:38.160
but when you really look at
them, what you actually have,

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.960
I think, is one conversation

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.750
that is stretched
out over a lifetime.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:46.510
So thank you and I'll
take any questions.

and so [inaudible]

[inaudible] have continued

because you have the
[inaudible] over there

[inaudible] this whole thing is

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:29.060
now there are all kinds
of [inaudible] going

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:34.680
on with people taking
[inaudible] and basing it

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.770
on [inaudible] or, you know,

Is it world?

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:46.610
Does it even matter?

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.170
It is connected to
a tradition even

from what somebody [inaudible]

&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo: Well, yeah.

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:54.350
And one of the things I --

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.310
one of the things I like
to point out, and I pointed

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.600
out in the book, is that
I think as soon as you --

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.280
I think as soon as you invent --

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.980
as soon as they invented
records,

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.480
this was going to happen.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.080
&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo: I
mean, once you --

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.080
you know, once you learn
songs from somewhere other

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.270
than your dad, you were going
to learn songs from people other

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.050
than the people you
grew up with.

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:19.140
And so this was going to happen.

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.440
Yes?

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.210

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:28.210
that you have this
[inaudible] both festivals

there was [inaudible]

for the program festival the
jazz festival [inaudible] I

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:51.540
guess the [inaudible] but then
throughout the [inaudible]

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.450
series, a lot of [inaudible]

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:59.060
or at least the folk festival
[inaudible] see the folk

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.360
festival too?

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:05.620
And then okay well what -- with
these wealthy families there,

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:15.880
how does [inaudible] involve
[inaudible] why was there not

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:21.360
money [inaudible] and why
were they not also helping

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.210
to fund the festival?

the -- the wealthy people --

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:26.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.520
&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo: Were not
benefitting from the festival

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.390
or at least they
didn't think they were.

00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:33.800
They -- this -- these
were their summer houses

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.360
and they were there
for peace and quiet.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.170
The business people of
Newport really liked it.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:40.730
The people who had an extra room

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:43.030
to rent out, they
really liked it.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:47.290
Now, of course, in Newport,
there was kind of a --

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.170
after the Gilded Age,
there was kind of a --

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:55.870
an exodus from Newport and
so that's why you had --

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:59.410
you know, you had empty mansions
and you had people who needed --

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:03.310
you had regular people who
needed and a regular city

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:06.060
who needed tourism and
that sort of thing.

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.360
But yeah. No.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:11.850
The wealthy people -- honestly,
the jazz festival was a one-off.

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:14.740
Not a one-off obviously
but you know what I mean.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.480
It was a unique set of
circumstance is what I'm saying.

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.320
Elaine Lorillard was bored.

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.470
She was kind of the black
sheep of Newport society

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:27.350
and I honestly think she --
you know, she liked jazz.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:29.460
She and her husband
went to Storyville a lot

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.490
and that's how they
met George Wein.

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:37.160
But she -- people who knew
her tell me that, yeah, she --

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.940
there was definitely part of it
-- part of her that just wanted

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.000
to piss Newport society off

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.460
and that's why she
started the seed money

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.670
for the jazz festival.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:50.170
Yes?

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:52.380
&gt;&gt; I've been involved
in a program

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:56.410
in the Washington Folk Festival
for the last about 30 years now.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.900
And so we've gone through
a lot of the same kind

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.940
of struggles that I heard.

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.420
And I actually kind
of agreed to hear --

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.750
I didn't know that the Newport
Festival had actually not

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.660
happened a few years but we
30 years [inaudible] run.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:12.340
But I -- you know, in terms

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.480
of what's [inaudible]
we've had a lot

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.360
of evolution [inaudible]
let's be more modern.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.540
And but there have been
others that have served

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:25.690
on that committee over the
years who are, you know,

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:29.140
who should be [inaudible]
and that's it, you know?

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:32.820
But what I wanted to say is
we do audition a lot of groups

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.760
and to your point, you
know, there's a lot of views

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.550
and things when we do
a singer/songwriter.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.940
And how you define
that tradition.

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.950
And, you know, my [inaudible]
definition was it's kind

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.250
of like [inaudible].

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:49.080
You can't really [inaudible]
but I know that when I hear it.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.000
And I think that, you
know, is about as close

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.510
as you can get, you know?

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.300
&gt;&gt; Rick Massimo: Two things that
people told me or that I read

00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.340
that I think really inform that.

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.040
One was that, you
know, in the program

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.820
for the first Newport
Folk Festival,

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:09.800
Pete Seeger wrote a list
of made out, you know,

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.490
a definition of folk music.

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.710
And it said, let's see,
no Bel Canto singing,

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.880
no notes on paper, no songs

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.420
that were written
specifically to be hits.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.430
And I'm reading -- it was
a longer list than that.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.120
But I remember reading
it and thinking,

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.600
"This list is no,
no, no, no, no."

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.950
And I thought, well, once
you start talking about --

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:35.910
everybody who starts
defining folk music starts --

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:39.470
in my experience starts talking
about what folk music isn't.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.050
And I feel like once
you stop talking

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:44.690
about what folk music isn't and
start talking about what it is,

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:46.840
it becomes a lot
harder to define

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.730
and a lot more stuff
comes into it.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.560
The other one, you know,
it jives with what I said

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.490
about we shall overcome.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:01:01.070
Dar Williams, I believe
it was, said, "To me,

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:03.560
what makes folk music
is the audience."

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.850
And, you know, an audience
that's really listening

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:09.630
and that's letting the
music affect their lives,

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:10.970
I think that's part
of the definition

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.290
of folk music as well.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:18.380
And the other thing I should
point out is that the --

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:22.610
I was rushing there at the end,
but the Newport Folk Festival is

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:25.940
as popular now as its ever been.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.290
I don't know that they'd ever
get 70,000 people but they --

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:33.900
their audience is
limited to 10,000 people

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.060
and they have a three-day
festival and it sells

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.940
out before the acts
are announced.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.810
People buy the tickets
just because they know.

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.110
They know it's going
to be really good.

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.780
In fact, Jay Sweet told
me that they've toyed

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.670
with never announcing the acts.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.820
You buy the ticket and
then you just show up

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.350
and you see what you see.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.890
There are some good
reasons not to do that.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:57.720
You know, essentially
the smaller acts,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.420
the lesser-known acts
would like to be able

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.570
to tell people that
they're there.

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:05.360
But it's -- there are reasons --

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.800
there are interesting
reasons for it.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.490
And so to me, you know, and
this is also in the book,

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:15.340
but the thing about
English ballad singers --

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:19.120
that's great but there's
probably somewhere else

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.460
to hear them.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.450
You know, that was one of
the things that happened

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:25.210
to the Newport Festival in
the '90s is that so many

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:28.040
of these acts, between
small venues

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:35.020
for the quote unquote real
folk singers and casinos

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.300
for bigger acts like
Mary Chapin Carpenter

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.460
or Los Lobos or Alison Krauss.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:47.020
You could see a lot of these
acts other places, so there had

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.120
to be some other -- there had
to be some other kind of appeal.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.880
So are we --

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.180
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Well,

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.590
thank you very much
[inaudible] has some copies

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:02.900
of the book outside he's going
to be selling and signing

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.660
and [inaudible] conversation.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.960
So thank everybody for coming.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.900
We have another Botkin lecture
same time next week also

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.340
on Wednesday.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.210
Barry Burgie [assumed spelling]
and Tom Pitch will be talking

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:17.820
about a project to photograph

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.730
and document National
Heritage award winners

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.050
and it's going to
be a great show.

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.510
So thank you and thanks for
coming and thank you, Rick.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.780
