00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] Here's a definition of card_ranks that's almost right.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We say what card_ranks does. It returns a list of the ranks sorted with higher first.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We pulled the ranks out of the cards,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so here we're iterating over the cards and we're having 2 values: the rank and the suit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And what this is doing is saying each card is a 2 value element,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and we can break down those 2 elements into the first and second,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the one that has rank 0 and rank 1 or index 0 and index 1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And so we're saying a card consists of a rank and a suit,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and we're only going to collect up the ranks and make that into a list.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So ranks is the list of ranks, then we sorted it and we said we want to reverse sort

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so that the higher comes first rather than the lower, and then we return the ranks.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is almost right, but the problem is if we just pull out the rank of each card as is,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
then the rank T for 10 is the highest because T comes alphabetically after A

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and Q and all the other cards. But we don't want that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Instead we want 10 to map to the number 10 and J to the number 11 and so on.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So we're going to have to come up with a way of fixing that,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
taking these letters that we pulled out of the cards

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and mapping them into an integer in the correct way.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
See if you can fix this definition of card_ranks

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to correctly return a list of numbers, not a list of characters.
