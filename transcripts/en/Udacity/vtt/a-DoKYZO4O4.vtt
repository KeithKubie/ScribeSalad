00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.210
&gt;&gt;I'm here with a good friend of mine, Becky, who has narcolepsy and we're

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.100
going to talk to her a little bit more about it. So when were you first

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.470
diagnosed with narcolepsy? &gt;&gt;Probably it was the end of my freshman year of

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.420
high school and I was, had good sleep habits. Like I had younger siblings so I

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.910
still went to bed 9 o'clock at night, 10 o'clock at the latest. And I was still

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.010
so tired, like, I would come home from school and I would take a nap right

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.360
away. And I was playing soccer, so, sometimes I'd be at soccer practice and

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.200
then take a nap, wake up and go to my next soccer practice. And, I was also

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.150
falling asleep in a lot of my classes. We went and saw Finding Nemo and I fell

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.450
asleep in it, and I wasn't tired, it was the last day of school, I was super

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.690
excited to be summer break. And then I went and saw it a couple of weeks later

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.240
and fell asleep almost the same time in the movie again. For only like 10

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.200
minutes and then I woke up, so that's when I realized, why am I so tired? And

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.490
then I, my parents just kind of thought I was being a lazy teenager and then I

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.420
started to show the signs of cataplexy, where you lose muscle control during

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.650
strong emotions. So when I'd laugh, my mom started noticing my facial features,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.710
they kind of like droop, because you just can't control them, and my neck

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.210
would, like, drop. And she started noticing that, so that's when we decided to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
go to a doctor. So we went to a general practitioner that we'd never used

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
before, and we told him my symptoms, and he's like, have you done drugs? And

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.040
I'm like, no, I've never done anything. I had never even drank alcohol at all

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.500
yet. And he was like, so you've never done this, this, this, listed like ten

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.970
drugs, and I'm like, no, no, no, no, and he's like, then I don't know what you

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.460
have. So then we went to my pediatrician and we told him like, she's tired all

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.460
the time and she loses muscle control and he was like, I think you have

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.855
narcolepsy. And then I went to a pediatric neurologist.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:53.370
&gt;&gt; By the way, she's like, you can't drive anymore. And I was like, right when I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.490
got my permit, so I was really upset about that. And then I did the EEG and 24

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.930
hours sleep study at a center and lastly they did an MRI on my head and then I

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.575
got diagnosed with narcolepsy.

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:12.300
&gt;&gt; What is it like to live with narcolepsy? It's kind of just something that's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.120
always in the back of my head, like and my parents, and my fiance, like

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.670
whenever I'm going to drive anywhere they're like make sure you're not too

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.110
tired. Every day is different, like sometimes I'll have to take a nap at 2

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.240
o'clock or sometimes I'll want to take a nap at work like at 10:30 in the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.010
morning. And usually when I do take a nap I really only need to sleep for like

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.500
ten minutes and I'll feel refreshed. So I'll just literally lay my head down on

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.550
my desk and I'll fall asleep in like 20 seconds and I'll set a timer, and then

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.430
I'll wake back up. Luckily, at my job I have right now, I have my own office so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.400
I'll just like close the door to my office and just lay down on my desk. But

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.670
it's something I always think about. Like, the other day I wanted to like rush

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.180
and go to the gym and then rush and meet my mom somewhere, and it was kind of

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.030
across town and I was like, can I drive? Like, should I lay down for 15 minutes

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.630
and take a nap? So I always have to think about that. When I was working at my

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.600
job before this I was like clocked out on a break and I went into like a back

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.750
room and I set my timer and I fell asleep in like a chair, like this. And my

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.330
boss came in and she suspended me for taking a nap at work. And I was like, so

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.965
upset. I was like, here's my timer, it was going to go off in like one minute.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:29.350
&gt;&gt; And I was like I have narcolepsy which I wrote on the application and then the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.910
next day I brought my note from my neurologist that said I have narcolepsy and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.860
they like paid me for the hours that I missed and everything but I was very

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.044
upset when I got in trouble for taking a nap.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:45.650
&gt;&gt; Is there anything you want to tell people about the disorder. I kind of want

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.692
people to know that there are a lot of different levels and like extemetires of

00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:54.270
narcolepsy. Like a lot of people when I tell them I have narcolepsy they're

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.920
really surprised and then they bring up that one Deuce Bigalow movie where the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.085
girl's like trying to bowl. And I guess some people can fall asleep like

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:08.180
mid-sentence but I can't, so it sometimes, it kind of annoys me that people are

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.680
like, oh, can you fall asleep right now? I'm like, no, I can't. If I try to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.019
fall at any time I will but not while I'm doing something. It really bothers me

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.110
when people that, I guess don't know I have narcolepsy or forget I do Think

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.960
it's funny when I do fall asleep somewhere. And I guess another thing I want

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.820
people to know is a really odd symptom of narcolepsy is that it's really hard

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.580
to sleep at night. because I guess since you go into REM sleep so fast that I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.330
never sleep for more than like three hours straight. I always will wake up So

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.590
I'd like get a good nights sleep but I would wake up at least like ten times a

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.430
night, and just be awake for like a minute and then I'll fall back asleep.
