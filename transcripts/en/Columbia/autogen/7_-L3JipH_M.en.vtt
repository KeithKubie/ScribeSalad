undergrad students in a coed setting and

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600
undergrad students in a coed setting and
 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.979
undergrad students in a coed setting and
really saw some of the distinctions and

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989
really saw some of the distinctions and
 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.410

research that I just did it's
 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.260
research that I just did it's
interesting I was speaking with people

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270
interesting I was speaking with people
 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.480
interesting I was speaking with people
in girls detention facilities so they're

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
in girls detention facilities so they're
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.880

you know setting that's designated as
 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.620
you know setting that's designated as
being for girls or for women and so I

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630
being for girls or for women and so I
 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.600
being for girls or for women and so I
thought about that a lot i was doing the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610
thought about that a lot i was doing the
 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.160
thought about that a lot i was doing the
research having gone to a school that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170
research having gone to a school that
 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.880
research having gone to a school that
was also you know designated as being

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890
was also you know designated as being
 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.200
was also you know designated as being
for girls or women oh my god you know

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210
for girls or women oh my god you know
 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.790
for girls or women oh my god you know
it's so funny before when I was saying

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800
it's so funny before when I was saying
 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.380
it's so funny before when I was saying
there are things about academia that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390
there are things about academia that
 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.090
there are things about academia that
sometimes felt like they contradicted

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100
sometimes felt like they contradicted
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.890
sometimes felt like they contradicted
the work I was trying to do actually

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900
the work I was trying to do actually
 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.740
the work I was trying to do actually
expected IRB to be one of the hardest

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750
expected IRB to be one of the hardest
 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.280
expected IRB to be one of the hardest
parts and it went quite smoothly for me

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290
parts and it went quite smoothly for me
 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.400
parts and it went quite smoothly for me
I think it had largely to do with the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410
I think it had largely to do with the
 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.390
I think it had largely to do with the
particular person who was reviewing my

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400
particular person who was reviewing my
 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.529
particular person who was reviewing my
work and who had some social work

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
work and who had some social work
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.860
work and who had some social work
backgrounds and was really interested in

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
backgrounds and was really interested in
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.570
backgrounds and was really interested in
what I was doing and thought it was

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580
what I was doing and thought it was
 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.229
what I was doing and thought it was
important and so she really you know

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239
important and so she really you know
 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.809
important and so she really you know
advocated and helped me Shepherd the the

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819
advocated and helped me Shepherd the the
 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.490
advocated and helped me Shepherd the the
application through the IRB process I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500
application through the IRB process I
 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.720
application through the IRB process I
think it would have been way slower and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730
think it would have been way slower and
 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.780
think it would have been way slower and
more challenging

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
more challenging
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.369
more challenging
if two things were the case one if I

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379
if two things were the case one if I
 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.869
if two things were the case one if I
were interviewing people who were under

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879
were interviewing people who were under
 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.300
were interviewing people who were under
18 and two if I were actually

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
18 and two if I were actually
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.470
18 and two if I were actually
interviewing people who were in

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
interviewing people who were in
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.720
interviewing people who were in
detention I also think if I were

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
detention I also think if I were
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.949
detention I also think if I were
interviewing people who were in

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
interviewing people who were in
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.110
interviewing people who were in
detention I would have heard really

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
detention I would have heard really
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.110
detention I would have heard really
different things than what I did

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
 
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.199
 
I think that people would not have

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209
I think that people would not have
 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.270
I think that people would not have
trusted me as much I think that they

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280
trusted me as much I think that they
 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.100
trusted me as much I think that they
would have been much more apprehensive

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
would have been much more apprehensive
 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.990
would have been much more apprehensive
about sharing some of the things that

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
about sharing some of the things that
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.119
about sharing some of the things that
happened to them in detention because

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129
happened to them in detention because
 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.559
happened to them in detention because
it's really a culture of retaliation

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569
it's really a culture of retaliation
 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.020
it's really a culture of retaliation
unfortunately I heard some horrific

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
unfortunately I heard some horrific
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.039
unfortunately I heard some horrific
stories about different kinds of

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049
stories about different kinds of
 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.839
stories about different kinds of
physical and sexual violence in

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849
physical and sexual violence in
 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.130
physical and sexual violence in
detention that one people made efforts

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140
detention that one people made efforts
 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.599
detention that one people made efforts
to report it it kind of made their

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609
to report it it kind of made their
 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:38.390
to report it it kind of made their
situation worse so

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
 
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.479
 
you

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489
 
 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.300
 
yeah I mean it's I think that we're not

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
yeah I mean it's I think that we're not
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.309
yeah I mean it's I think that we're not
really socialized to have those

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319
really socialized to have those
 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.349
really socialized to have those
conversations in a lot of contacts and

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359
conversations in a lot of contacts and
 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.110
conversations in a lot of contacts and
so it can be a little bit awkward but I

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
so it can be a little bit awkward but I
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.420
so it can be a little bit awkward but I
was so used to doing it from being a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430
was so used to doing it from being a
 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.059
was so used to doing it from being a
practitioner and also from being an

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069
practitioner and also from being an
 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.709
practitioner and also from being an
activist and feeling like I'm oh wait

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719
activist and feeling like I'm oh wait
 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.240
activist and feeling like I'm oh wait
that's something I'm always you know

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250
that's something I'm always you know
 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.929
that's something I'm always you know
having conversations about and so I did

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939
having conversations about and so I did
 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.610
having conversations about and so I did
name it and sometimes people are like

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620
name it and sometimes people are like
 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.009
name it and sometimes people are like
what like I can't believe we're talking

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019
what like I can't believe we're talking
 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.229
what like I can't believe we're talking
about this but I felt like it was

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239
about this but I felt like it was
 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.720
about this but I felt like it was
important and I also felt like in some

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730
important and I also felt like in some
 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.430
important and I also felt like in some
ways it created more intimacy so I kind

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440
ways it created more intimacy so I kind
 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.760
ways it created more intimacy so I kind
of just did it

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
