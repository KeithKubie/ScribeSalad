morning about demystifying Android

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
morning about demystifying Android
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.790
morning about demystifying Android
accessibility development and what we

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
accessibility development and what we
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.859
accessibility development and what we
mean by demystifying is there's a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
mean by demystifying is there's a
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.740
mean by demystifying is there's a
tremendous amount of complexity in

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750
tremendous amount of complexity in
 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.290
tremendous amount of complexity in
accessibility and sort of as part of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
accessibility and sort of as part of
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.910
accessibility and sort of as part of
Android we're trying we I think our job

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
Android we're trying we I think our job
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920
Android we're trying we I think our job
is partly to try to avoid having

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
is partly to try to avoid having
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.250
is partly to try to avoid having
developers deal with that complexity and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260
developers deal with that complexity and
 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.479
developers deal with that complexity and
as we've looked at some of our API is we

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
as we've looked at some of our API is we
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160
as we've looked at some of our API is we
feel like we've maybe not done as good a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
feel like we've maybe not done as good a
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170
feel like we've maybe not done as good a
job on that as we should have so we want

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
job on that as we should have so we want
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299
job on that as we should have so we want
to do is present some ideas here the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
to do is present some ideas here the
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979
to do is present some ideas here the
overall idea of how we think about

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
overall idea of how we think about
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.860
overall idea of how we think about
accessibility and also some new api's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
accessibility and also some new api's
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.529
accessibility and also some new api's
we've done for for to try to simplify

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
we've done for for to try to simplify
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.389
we've done for for to try to simplify
your experience and some tools we have

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
your experience and some tools we have
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220
your experience and some tools we have
to talk about to help you test your

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
to talk about to help you test your
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920
to talk about to help you test your
products so I'm gonna do a bit of a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
products so I'm gonna do a bit of a
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.100
products so I'm gonna do a bit of a
run-through of our high-level opinion

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110
run-through of our high-level opinion
 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.479
run-through of our high-level opinion
castas gonna talk a bit about api's each

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
castas gonna talk a bit about api's each
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.740
castas gonna talk a bit about api's each
is going to talk about testing and I'll

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
is going to talk about testing and I'll
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.940
is going to talk about testing and I'll
talk a bit at the end wrap up so let's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
talk a bit at the end wrap up so let's
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.130
talk a bit at the end wrap up so let's
start with three simple things about

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
start with three simple things about
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.399
start with three simple things about
accessibility I feel like as I think

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
accessibility I feel like as I think
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.219
accessibility I feel like as I think
about this I personally no more than

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
about this I personally no more than
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.510
about this I personally no more than
three things about accessibility I'm

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
three things about accessibility I'm
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.160
three things about accessibility I'm
working on this for close to a decade so

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
working on this for close to a decade so
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.359
working on this for close to a decade so
I maybe know like five things but if

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
I maybe know like five things but if
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399
I maybe know like five things but if
what I think a lot of other areas where

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
what I think a lot of other areas where
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.640
what I think a lot of other areas where
I work where like internationalization

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650
I work where like internationalization
 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.590
I work where like internationalization
version control sort of a whole range of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
version control sort of a whole range of
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.880
version control sort of a whole range of
things where I kind of know a few things

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
things where I kind of know a few things
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620
things where I kind of know a few things
and that's kind of enough to get through

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
and that's kind of enough to get through
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560
and that's kind of enough to get through
like my overall workflow as I feel like

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
like my overall workflow as I feel like
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.999
like my overall workflow as I feel like
there should be probably three things

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
there should be probably three things
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.170
there should be probably three things
that everybody in the world should know

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
that everybody in the world should know
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120
that everybody in the world should know
about accessibility it's sort of built

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
about accessibility it's sort of built
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.600
about accessibility it's sort of built
into their daily work I think the first

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
into their daily work I think the first
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910
into their daily work I think the first
one is very simply to make information

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
one is very simply to make information
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.630
one is very simply to make information
visible and a lot of people think about

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
visible and a lot of people think about
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.560
visible and a lot of people think about
accessibility they start think about

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
accessibility they start think about
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300
accessibility they start think about
screen readers and people who cannot see

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
screen readers and people who cannot see
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100
screen readers and people who cannot see
and there's a lot of people in that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
and there's a lot of people in that
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810
and there's a lot of people in that
category and that's important there's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
category and that's important there's
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100
category and that's important there's
also a lot of people who just have low

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
also a lot of people who just have low
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.859
also a lot of people who just have low
vision or like me are getting older and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
vision or like me are getting older and
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.109
vision or like me are getting older and
it's harder to read small fonts and so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
it's harder to read small fonts and so
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.399
it's harder to read small fonts and so
just making sure that your information

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
just making sure that your information
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350
just making sure that your information
is as visible as possible without

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
is as visible as possible without
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.420
is as visible as possible without
anybody having to turn on any tools or

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
anybody having to turn on any tools or
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910
anybody having to turn on any tools or
do anything fancy with accessibility

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
do anything fancy with accessibility
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980
do anything fancy with accessibility
one of the most common things we see

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
one of the most common things we see
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.830
one of the most common things we see
people struggle with there's a lot of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
people struggle with there's a lot of
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.870
people struggle with there's a lot of
designers who will kind of design

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
designers who will kind of design
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.160
designers who will kind of design
something that's you know looks really

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
something that's you know looks really
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780
something that's you know looks really
great because it's light gray on

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
great because it's light gray on
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.449
great because it's light gray on
slightly lighter gray and I think a lot

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459
slightly lighter gray and I think a lot
 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.580
slightly lighter gray and I think a lot
of us have seen that in both in designs

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
of us have seen that in both in designs
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.590
of us have seen that in both in designs
we're trying to implement and designs

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600
we're trying to implement and designs
 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.680
we're trying to implement and designs
that we were struggling to use or fonts

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
that we were struggling to use or fonts
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.090
that we were struggling to use or fonts
that are just too small because too much

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
that are just too small because too much
 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.740
that are just too small because too much
information is being crammed in the into

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
information is being crammed in the into
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780
information is being crammed in the into
a page the other thing to think about is

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
a page the other thing to think about is
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.449
a page the other thing to think about is
color if you're using color to convey

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
color if you're using color to convey
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.180
color if you're using color to convey
information keep in mind that there's a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
information keep in mind that there's a
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.530
information keep in mind that there's a
lot of people out there who are

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
lot of people out there who are
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.270
lot of people out there who are
colorblind and so they're just missing

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
colorblind and so they're just missing
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.240
colorblind and so they're just missing
the information you're trying to convey

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250
the information you're trying to convey
 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.710
the information you're trying to convey
but so just in general if you can think

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
but so just in general if you can think
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.370
but so just in general if you can think
about how to make information visible

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380
about how to make information visible
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.750
about how to make information visible
you can get a long ways to just reaching

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
you can get a long ways to just reaching
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660
you can get a long ways to just reaching
more and more people the second would

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
more and more people the second would
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.340
more and more people the second would
sort of the complement of that which is

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
sort of the complement of that which is
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.990
sort of the complement of that which is
assuming somebody can see your UI and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
assuming somebody can see your UI and
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.040
assuming somebody can see your UI and
understand what you're trying to convey

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
understand what you're trying to convey
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.110
understand what you're trying to convey
are they able to actually use it and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120
are they able to actually use it and
 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.850
are they able to actually use it and
that's where just simple big controls

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
that's where just simple big controls
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740
that's where just simple big controls
can make a big difference I think again

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
can make a big difference I think again
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.150
can make a big difference I think again
we've all had the experience of somebody

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
we've all had the experience of somebody
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.710
we've all had the experience of somebody
who got a little carried away of just

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
who got a little carried away of just
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.060
who got a little carried away of just
trying to add too much configurability

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070
trying to add too much configurability
 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.250
trying to add too much configurability
into too small a space and you it ends

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
into too small a space and you it ends
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.199
into too small a space and you it ends
up being kind of random which button you

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209
up being kind of random which button you
 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.870
up being kind of random which button you

that is just to label the image and we

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519
that is just to label the image and we
 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.520
that is just to label the image and we
have a very simple API that Casa del

convey information make sure that
 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.210
convey information make sure that
information is conveyed in the text but

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220
information is conveyed in the text but

a long treatise

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500
a long treatise
 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.530
a long treatise
about how exciting this particular

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540
about how exciting this particular
 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.480
about how exciting this particular
graphic is they really want to just get

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490
graphic is they really want to just get
 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.340
graphic is they really want to just get
on with their with their day and get on

with whatever action that thing can do

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850
with whatever action that thing can do
 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.520
with whatever action that thing can do
so you want to label things concisely

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530
so you want to label things concisely
 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.470
so you want to label things concisely
these two things are a little bit in

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480
these two things are a little bit in
 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.200
these two things are a little bit in
tension with one another so part of this

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210
tension with one another so part of this
 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.370
tension with one another so part of this
is like are you for trying to really

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380
is like are you for trying to really
 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.170
is like are you for trying to really
just convey information and that's

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180
just convey information and that's
 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.370
just convey information and that's
what's in there make sure that's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380
what's in there make sure that's
 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.800
what's in there make sure that's
conveyed as precisely as possible if

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810
conveyed as precisely as possible if
 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.790
conveyed as precisely as possible if
you're trying to just explain to

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800
you're trying to just explain to
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.100
you're trying to just explain to
somebody how to use something just one

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110
somebody how to use something just one
 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.530
somebody how to use something just one
word which is a verb is usually enough

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540
 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.300
so that's three things but you may have

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310
so that's three things but you may have
 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.710
so that's three things but you may have
come here to learn more than three

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720
come here to learn more than three
 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.240
come here to learn more than three
things so we want to dig a little bit

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250
things so we want to dig a little bit
 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.790
things so we want to dig a little bit
deeper and just think about how users

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800
deeper and just think about how users
 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.180
deeper and just think about how users
interact with your app much like the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190
interact with your app much like the
 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.380
interact with your app much like the
three things there's essentially two

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390
three things there's essentially two
 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.210
three things there's essentially two
things that you're doing you're

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220
things that you're doing you're
 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.040
things that you're doing you're
presenting information to users and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
presenting information to users and
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.080
presenting information to users and
you're allowing them to take actions on

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090
you're allowing them to take actions on
 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.330
you're allowing them to take actions on
your UI so often we designed for often

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340
your UI so often we designed for often
 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.500
your UI so often we designed for often
the first design ends up being for

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510
the first design ends up being for
 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.720
the first design ends up being for
people who sort of definitely not

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730
people who sort of definitely not
 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.220
people who sort of definitely not
necessarily have an accessibility need

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230
necessarily have an accessibility need
 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.080
necessarily have an accessibility need
but ideally you're thinking about this

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090
but ideally you're thinking about this
 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.060
but ideally you're thinking about this
up front but it quickly becomes kind of

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070
up front but it quickly becomes kind of
 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.680
up front but it quickly becomes kind of
overwhelming you start thinking about

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690
overwhelming you start thinking about
 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.780
overwhelming you start thinking about
okay how somebody who can't see going to

somebody who's deaf or hard-of-hearing
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.070
somebody who's deaf or hard-of-hearing
going to use my app so now you suddenly

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080
going to use my app so now you suddenly
 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.140
going to use my app so now you suddenly
you've got maybe four types of users

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150
you've got maybe four types of users
 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.170
you've got maybe four types of users
which is your original mainstream user

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180
which is your original mainstream user
 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.360
which is your original mainstream user
and then these three categories but

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370
and then these three categories but
 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.710
and then these three categories but
within these three categories the more

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720
within these three categories the more
 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.300
within these three categories the more
you stare at them the more complexity

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310
you stare at them the more complexity
 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.270
you stare at them the more complexity
you see it's like a fractal people who

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280
you see it's like a fractal people who
 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.800
you see it's like a fractal people who
are visually impaired there's all sorts

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810
are visually impaired there's all sorts
 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.060
are visually impaired there's all sorts
of different visual impairments we

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070
of different visual impairments we
 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.320
of different visual impairments we
wouldn't see different levels of detail

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330
wouldn't see different levels of detail
 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.540

different types of things motor

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550
different types of things motor

impairments come in radical um sort of

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110
impairments come in radical um sort of
 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.100

variety of people out there and then

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110
variety of people out there and then
 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.350
variety of people out there and then
also there are people that have

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360
also there are people that have
 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.360
also there are people that have
combinations of these disabilities and

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370
combinations of these disabilities and
 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.360
combinations of these disabilities and
so what are you supposed to do as an app

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370
so what are you supposed to do as an app
 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.820
so what are you supposed to do as an app
developer I mean we there's it's like a

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
developer I mean we there's it's like a
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.930
developer I mean we there's it's like a
billion people in the world with a

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940
billion people in the world with a
 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.250
billion people in the world with a
disability are you supposed to think

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260
disability are you supposed to think
 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.020
disability are you supposed to think
through a billion use cases it is

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030
through a billion use cases it is
 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.140
through a billion use cases it is
there's no fortunately and nobody is

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150
there's no fortunately and nobody is
 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.700
there's no fortunately and nobody is
ever going to think through all billion

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710
ever going to think through all billion
 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.120
ever going to think through all billion
use cases but with an ecosystem like

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130
use cases but with an ecosystem like
 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.790
use cases but with an ecosystem like
this we do have the ability to scale to

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800
this we do have the ability to scale to
 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.610
this we do have the ability to scale to
that many use cases and the tool we use

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620
that many use cases and the tool we use
 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.860
that many use cases and the tool we use
to do that are accessibility services so

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870
to do that are accessibility services so
 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.120
to do that are accessibility services so
these are plugins to the Android

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130
these are plugins to the Android
 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.110
these are plugins to the Android
platform

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120

that get information about the you I can

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340
that get information about the you I can
 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.129
that get information about the you I can
take actions on the UI on behalf of the

and they those developers can think

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
and they those developers can think
 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.110
and they those developers can think
about how do I serve this particular set

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120
about how do I serve this particular set
 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.950
about how do I serve this particular set
of users that I'm targeting and so

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960
of users that I'm targeting and so
 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.150
of users that I'm targeting and so
they're the ones that are presenting the

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160
they're the ones that are presenting the
 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.730
they're the ones that are presenting the
information if somebody can't see the

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740
information if somebody can't see the
 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.890
information if somebody can't see the
screen they're presenting it audio or

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900

Braille if somebody can't take actions

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270
Braille if somebody can't take actions
 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.760
Braille if somebody can't take actions
on the screen directly they may be using

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770
on the screen directly they may be using
 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.260
on the screen directly they may be using
a switch to do it and then these

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270
a switch to do it and then these
 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.780
a switch to do it and then these
services can inter mediate that the way

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790
services can inter mediate that the way
 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.850
services can inter mediate that the way
that they work is they work there they

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860
that they work is they work there they
 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.140
that they work is they work there they
get their information from the android

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150
get their information from the android
 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.900
get their information from the android
framework and they use the android

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910
framework and they use the android
 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.469
framework and they use the android
framework to take actions on the UI and

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479
framework to take actions on the UI and
 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.090
framework to take actions on the UI and
so down here at the bottom is your app

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100
so down here at the bottom is your app
 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.940
so down here at the bottom is your app
in your app just what it needs to do is

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950
in your app just what it needs to do is
 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.370
in your app just what it needs to do is
present the information to the android

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380
present the information to the android
 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.560
present the information to the android
framework so that the framework can then

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570
framework so that the framework can then
 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.550
framework so that the framework can then
share it with all these different

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560
share it with all these different
 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.260
share it with all these different
services to support these different

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270
services to support these different
 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.740
services to support these different
users and then it needs to allow the

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:35.750
users and then it needs to allow the
 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.800
users and then it needs to allow the
framework to take actions on it so that

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810
framework to take actions on it so that
 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.810
framework to take actions on it so that
all these different services all these

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820
all these different services all these
 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.790
all these different services all these
different users can can actually get

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800
different users can can actually get
 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.900
different users can can actually get
control of your app so the way that you

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:49.910
control of your app so the way that you
 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.480
control of your app so the way that you
can do this is village to use the api's

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.490
can do this is village to use the api's
 

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.000

the information and allowing users take

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.090
the information and allowing users take
 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.260
the information and allowing users take
actions on it and once you've done that

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:02.270
actions on it and once you've done that
 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.980
actions on it and once you've done that
you can use these testing tools to

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:04.990
you can use these testing tools to
 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.450
you can use these testing tools to
verify that your app is actually working

well and this is a problem because you

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:39.189
well and this is a problem because you
 

00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:40.979
well and this is a problem because you
can imagine users like talkback users

so to solve this problem we added some
api int and so they wouldn't be they

problem for accessibility services like
talkback because there's some

this behaves a bit like a window so our

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:42.549
this behaves a bit like a window so our

accessibility user isn't informed about
this so the way you solve this is by

00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:46.629
this so the way you solve this is by
 

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:48.359
this so the way you solve this is by
treating this view group as an

treating this view group as an
 

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.249
treating this view group as an
accessibility pane and you can do that

00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:50.259
accessibility pane and you can do that
 

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:53.489
accessibility pane and you can do that
by calling view compat set accessibility

00:12:53.489 --> 00:12:53.499
by calling view compat set accessibility

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.820
to figure out a way to get that play
button back up on screen they've got to

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:41.830
button back up on screen they've got to
 

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.080
button back up on screen they've got to
figure out a way to interact with it

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.090
figure out a way to interact with it
 

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.370
figure out a way to interact with it
before the timeout disappears again and

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.380
before the timeout disappears again and
 

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.590
before the timeout disappears again and
this is a pretty frustrating cycle so

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600
this is a pretty frustrating cycle so
 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.210
this is a pretty frustrating cycle so
what we ideally need in the situation is

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.220
what we ideally need in the situation is
 

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.420
what we ideally need in the situation is
a way to adjust our timeout based on our

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:52.430
a way to adjust our timeout based on our
 

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.060
a way to adjust our timeout based on our
current users needs and you can do that

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.070
current users needs and you can do that
 

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.430
current users needs and you can do that
through our new timeouts API first you

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440
through our new timeouts API first you
 

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.780
through our new timeouts API first you
get a reference to the accessibility

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:58.790
get a reference to the accessibility
 

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.330
get a reference to the accessibility
manager then you call get recommended

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:01.340
manager then you call get recommended
 

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.870
manager then you call get recommended
timeout milliseconds this returns the

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880
timeout milliseconds this returns the
 

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.120
timeout milliseconds this returns the
suggested timeout for your view it's

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.130
suggested timeout for your view it's
 

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.680
suggested timeout for your view it's
customized for your view and for your

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:08.690
customized for your view and for your
 

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.380
customized for your view and for your
user it does this by taking the default

user it does this by taking the default
 

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:15.000
user it does this by taking the default
timeout that you had planned and

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.010
 

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.230
adjusting it based on the type of

this is a play button and it's to

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920
this is a play button and it's to
 

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.500
this is a play button and it's to
control so we pass in fly content

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:26.510

you're communicating the exact semantics
of the changes in your UI by using the

of the changes in your UI by using the
 

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.350
of the changes in your UI by using the
correct accessibility events and

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360
correct accessibility events and
 

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.660
correct accessibility events and
populating it correctly remember in this

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:49.670
populating it correctly remember in this
 

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.620

communicating with the accessibility
 

00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:00.130
communicating with the accessibility
service so something similar that people

service so something similar that people
 

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.069

themselves and again this is a bad idea

00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:05.809
themselves and again this is a bad idea

themselves and again this is a bad idea
accessibility focus is to be determined

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:07.669
accessibility focus is to be determined
 

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:10.390
accessibility focus is to be determined
by the accessibility service and just

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400
by the accessibility service and just
 

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.860
by the accessibility service and just
like announcements this creates an

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.870
like announcements this creates an
 

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.610
like announcements this creates an
inconsistency in experience and actually

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:15.620
inconsistency in experience and actually
 

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.199
inconsistency in experience and actually
that's one of the biggest issues that

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:17.209
that's one of the biggest issues that
 

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:19.689
that's one of the biggest issues that
accessibility users face inconsistency

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:19.699
accessibility users face inconsistency
 

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:24.100
accessibility users face inconsistency
across applications and over time you

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.110
across applications and over time you
 

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.040
across applications and over time you
see there are a lot of applications and

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.050
see there are a lot of applications and
 

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.400
see there are a lot of applications and
if you as an app developer decide to

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:30.410
if you as an app developer decide to
 

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.810
if you as an app developer decide to
break with the paradigms of

of how their interaction works and
 

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.190
of how their interaction works and
they've got to relearn this whole new UI

about the framework and we understood

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:43.929
about the framework and we understood
 

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:45.720
about the framework and we understood
what the framework tests for the

what the framework tests for the
 

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.490
what the framework tests for the
question is how do I use this framework

was about the automated tools we looked

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:16.540
was about the automated tools we looked
 

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.900
was about the automated tools we looked
at the automated test tests which

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:18.910
at the automated test tests which
 

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.970
at the automated test tests which
required coding changes and are good to

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:20.980
required coding changes and are good to
 

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.370

next we looked at the automated testing

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000
next we looked at the automated testing
 

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.730
next we looked at the automated testing
tools which were the pre-launch report

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:26.740
tools which were the pre-launch report
 

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.220

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:30.470
that respect because it used to be if
 

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.990
that respect because it used to be if
you were doing something relatively

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000
you were doing something relatively
 

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.659
you were doing something relatively
minor overriding the touch the touch

00:28:34.659 --> 00:28:34.669
minor overriding the touch the touch
 

00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:36.700
minor overriding the touch the touch
handler it was like okay you did the

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:36.710
handler it was like okay you did the
 

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.560
handler it was like okay you did the
small change and now you've got a crack

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:38.570
small change and now you've got a crack
 

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.720
small change and now you've got a crack
open this great big API surface and like

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:40.730
open this great big API surface and like
 

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.039
open this great big API surface and like
to figure out how to modify your

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:42.049
to figure out how to modify your
 

00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:43.390
to figure out how to modify your
accessibility node info we have an

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:43.400
accessibility node info we have an
 

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.250
accessibility node info we have an
accessibility action API you needed to

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:45.260
accessibility action API you needed to
 

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.419
accessibility action API you needed to
add you needed to go through and

00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:46.429
add you needed to go through and
 

00:28:46.429 --> 00:28:50.830
add you needed to go through and
override a method in view and but a lot

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840
override a method in view and but a lot
 

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.510
override a method in view and but a lot
of people like they kind of come up

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:52.520
of people like they kind of come up
 

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.100
of people like they kind of come up
against the learning curve like that

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.110
against the learning curve like that
 

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.169
against the learning curve like that
like you know I'm kind of okay with my

00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:56.179
like you know I'm kind of okay with my
 

00:28:56.179 --> 00:28:58.060
like you know I'm kind of okay with my
touch handler just kind of being

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.070
touch handler just kind of being
 

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.470
touch handler just kind of being
like that and I feel bad about not

00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480
like that and I feel bad about not
 

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.020
like that and I feel bad about not
having it be accessible but I just don't

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:02.030
having it be accessible but I just don't
 

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.970
having it be accessible but I just don't
have the time and so we're hoping that

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:03.980
have the time and so we're hoping that
 

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.620
have the time and so we're hoping that
these API is sort of reduce that energy

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:05.630
these API is sort of reduce that energy
 

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.070
these API is sort of reduce that energy
barrier to one line of code that's

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080
barrier to one line of code that's
 

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.830
barrier to one line of code that's
pretty straightforward and so we hope

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840
pretty straightforward and so we hope
 

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.620
pretty straightforward and so we hope
that you'll use them

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:13.630
that you'll use them
 

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.810
that you'll use them

there's all different ways to do it we

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.340
there's all different ways to do it we
 

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.000
there's all different ways to do it we
all hope that you'll go out and do find

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.010
all hope that you'll go out and do find
 

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.160
all hope that you'll go out and do find
a wide range of users and test for

a wide range of users and test for
 

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.530
a wide range of users and test for
