00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.890
Okay now that we talked about what
we want in a trusted computing base,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.350
we want it to be trustworthy,
we want it to be high assurance and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.770
we said even in a follow
designed principals.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.450
So let's talk a little bit about how
do we build a trusted computing base.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.240
Well first of all, if we claim it
to be a trusted computing base,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360
it has to implement certain
key requirements or

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.540
features that you associate
with a secure system.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.200
In other words, it must implement
certain security Relevant functions.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.130
Certain functions that are important for
securing access to resources.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.860
So, for example,
it has to address authentication.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.890
If it doesn't address authentication
we will know who's making a request for

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.820
a resource that is
protected in the system.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.730
It has to do access control.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.130
Access control for whatever resources
that we have, could be files,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.170
could be other kind of
objects that we have.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.470
When it comes to access control,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.170
we talked about two different
kinds of access control.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.400
We talked about
mandatory access control.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.500
It may support that.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.209
It may support labels that can be
used to implement the BLP model for

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:09.210
example or some of the other mandatory
access control models that we discussed.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.780
It has to support
discretionary access control.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
So somebody who creates a resource
that has some control over

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.070
who can access it and
who cannot access it.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.100
The basic idea here is that
when you say I'm going to build

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.220
a trusted computing base, the first
question you have to think about is,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.920
what are the core functions
I have to provide?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.790
Some core mechanisms that have
to go into the system and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.420
these are some examples of those.
