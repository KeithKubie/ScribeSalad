00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.230
The answer is 3. A combination of 3 bases is needed. Now there are a couple

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.180
of ways of figuring this out. Probably one of the easiest but longest ways of

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.030
doing this is to actually just test everything out one by one. You can see if

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.435
we just write combos of one letter out we only get a total of 4 combinations.

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:21.550
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.650
We can also do the same thing for the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.220
dinucleotide, or two base combination. And remember, GA is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.550
is not the same thing as AG, because, you

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.950
know, the order matters here. And we get a total

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.970
possible combinations of 16. When we do the same

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.860
thing for the three base nucleotide combinations, we see

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.720
that we get 64 different ones. And at this

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.860
point, we've reached past our minimum of 20 amino acids.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.300
But the shorter way of doing this is to just use a little math. We have four

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.240
possible letters and three positions, so we can

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.430
raise four to the power of three, which is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.590
also equal to 64 combinations And get that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.650
answer pretty quickly. And so it turns out that

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.320
a minimum number, a minimum combination of three letters

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.960
is necessary to start coding for all the amino

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.310
acids that cell needs to use for translation. And you can see we

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.400
actually have room for extra. And we'll see how that works in a second.
