00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.000
A very important category of copyrighted
works consists of works of visual art,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.610
or as the statute puts it, "pictorial,
graphical, and sculptural works."

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.590
Most of the things that
fall into this zone

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.480
are obvious-- paintings,
posters, statues, and so forth.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.570
However, two dimensions
of the protection

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.130
extended to pictorial,
graphic and sculptural works

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.680
are not obvious and are important.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.545
The first is that,
nowadays, copyright law

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.830
is often used by companies
to shield the logos that they

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.410
apply to consumer products.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.580
Here's an example.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.510
The Omega watch company
has obtained a US Copyright

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.260
on the design shown on your screen,
which it calls the Omega globe design.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.200
From lecture number
one, you should remember

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.570
how and why a Swiss company
can get a US copyright.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.800
Omega engraves a version of this
logo on the underside of its watches,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.470
which are typically
manufactured in Switzerland

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.430
but sold all over the world.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.360
Typically, Omega sells its watches
for lower prices in poor countries

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.450
than it does in more wealthy countries.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.050
Some years ago, Costco,
an American discounter,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.290
using an intermediary,
purchased some of the watches

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.440
that Omega had sold cheaply
outside the United States,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.050
imported them into the United
States, and began selling them

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.460
in Costco's US stores for prices
lower than the prices charged

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.370
by Omega's authorized US dealers.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.140
Omega, dismayed,
brought suit, contending

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.700
that this so-called parallel
importation violated Omega's copyright

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.810
in the logo, not its trademark or
patent rights, but its copyright.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.080
The legal rule underlying
this lawsuit and its outcome

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.360
we'll consider when we discuss the
rights of distribution and importation

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.200
in lecture number eight.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.830
For now, I just want to emphasize
the expansive reach of the subject

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.150
matter of copyright and
how companies like Omega

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.240
try to use that expansive
coverage to engage

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.000
in international geographic
price discrimination

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.630
when making their products
available in different countries.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.090
The second non-obvious
dimension of this category

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.810
involves what is sometimes called
applied art or industrial design.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.270
These typically consist of
three dimensional objects

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.510
that are intended to be
both useful and attractive.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.600
Objects of this sort permeate
modern consumer culture.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.000
Just look around the room or space
where you are located right now.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.840
Most likely, you'll notice many objects
that fit this general definition.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.130
Possibilities include an unusual
lamp, a container of bottled water,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.390
a distinctive coffee mug, the shape
of a laptop computer or a tablet,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.480
your eyeglasses if you wear them,
a decorative doorknob or window

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.850
fixture, a decorative table
or chair, and so forth.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.040
Each of these things combines
in some way art and function.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.320
In the United States, three
different systems of law

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.540
are potentially available to the
creators of new objects of this sort--

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.410
copyright law, design patent
law, and the protection

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.080
that trademark law extends
to so-called trade dress.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.330
Some innovations qualify under
more than one of these systems,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.380
but others fail to qualify under any.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.730
It all depends on the shape and
history of the particular object,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.800
and sometimes on the whims of
the tribunal evaluating it.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.070
If you're curious about the potential
reach of design patent law or trademark

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.520
law, feel free to follow those
branches of the map on your own

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.120
using the interactive version
you can get through my website.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.300
I'll concentrate here,
for obvious reasons,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.720
on the possibility of copyright
protection for such objects.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.040
In the late 19th century, it was
clear that copyright law did not

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.320
extend to works of applied
art or industrial design.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.240
After 1870, three
dimensional forms of fine art

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.940
were shielded, but not the
kind of consumer products

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.590
to which I directed your
attention a minute ago.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.090
Then gradually, through a series
of steps itemized on your map,

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.390
Congress, the Copyright
Office, and finally the courts

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.410
liberalized the relevant rules.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.730
Today, the governing general
principle is that copyright protection

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.090
is available to
so-called useful articles

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.440
if and only if the aesthetic
and functional features of those

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.910
articles are separable.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.950
The first step in
applying this principle

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.690
is to determine whether a
particular object qualifies as a,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.140
quote, "useful" article.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.810
The reason why this is so important
is that if an object does not

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.380
constitute a useful article, the
ordinary lenient rules of copyright law

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.330
apply, whereas if it does
constitute a useful article,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.080
it has to pass more stringent tests.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.190
So what does the technical
term "useful article" mean?

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.460
The statute defines it as follows.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.200
"A useful article is an article having
an intrinsic utilitarian function that

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.290
is not merely to portray the
appearance of the article

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.474
or to convey information."

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:45.015
Some applications of this
definition will be straightforward.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.930
For example, Rodin's sculpture does
not constitute a useful article

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.490
because its function
is to depict itself,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.840
to depict, in other words, a thinker.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.890
By contrast, a lamp, no
matter how beautiful,

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.940
is a useful article because it has
a function other than looking good,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.560
namely, illuminating a room.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.090
In other instances, however, application
of this definition is much trickier.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.640
If a particular object is deemed
to fall into this special category,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.840
then its creator gets
copyright protection,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.650
to repeat, only if its aesthetic and
functional dimensions are separable.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.760
How might they be separable?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.790
There are two options.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.450
The first, which arises rarely,
is that the two dimensions

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.900
might be physically separable.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.630
For example, as the treatise
writer Melville Nimmer suggests,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.630
the stylized Jaguar shape that is
attached to the hood of a Jaguar

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.710
automobile enjoys copyright protection
because it could be physically removed

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.910
from the car without impairing
its utilitarian function.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.280
Likewise, the utilitarian
components of the car

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.920
could be removed from the Jaguar without
impairing its aesthetic features.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.660
With respect to most useful articles,
however, physical separability

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.210
of this sort is not feasible.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.160
The creators of such objects may
still obtain copyright protection,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.100
but only if they can demonstrate that
the aesthetic and utilitarian features

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.140
are, quote, "conceptually separable."

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.450
What does that mean?

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.160
The conceptual separability inquiry
is the most intriguing and least

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.290
satisfying aspect of this doctrine.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.870
US courts, as you can see from the map,
have developed five distinct families

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.490
of interpretations of this term.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.510
The first of the five approaches asks
whether the form of the object at issue

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.440
is dictated by its function.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.170
If so, conceptual
separability does not exist.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.870
This variant was emphasized
by the majority of the judges

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.610
in the influential 1985
Barnhart case, which

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.410
involved these two sets of mannequins,
which were copied by a competitor

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.790
without permission.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.660
The majority of the judges
in that case contended

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.550
that the shape of the
mannequins was, quote,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.400
"required by their function,"
namely displaying clothes in stores,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.050
and consequently that their
utilitarianism and aesthetic features

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.410
were inextricably combined.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.780
The second of the five approaches asks
which aspect of the object in question

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.630
is primary.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.090
So for example, the court in
the Kieselstein-Cord case,

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.120
another influential
Second Circuit opinion,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.669
concluded that the, quote, "ornamental
aspect" of these belt buckles

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.850
was primary and their utilitarian
function, namely holding pants up,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.360
was subsidiary, and thus that
they enjoyed copyright protection.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.060
The third approach was made famous
by Judge Newman's dissenting opinion

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.280
in the Barnhart case,
which I mentioned earlier.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.410
It's commonly known as the,
quote, "temporal displacement,"

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.865
closed quote, test.

00:08:57.865 --> 00:09:02.760
The key question under this approach
is whether the article stimulates

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.820
in the mind of the
beholder a concept that

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.150
is separate from the concept
evoked by its utilitarian function.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.920
If so, there's conceptual separability.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.380
If not, not.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.720
The phrase "temporal displacement"
comes from Newman's contention

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.880
that the two concepts,
utilitarian and non-utilitarian,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.220
must occur to the beholder not
simultaneously but separated in time.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.760
Newman's test is
intriguing and continues

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.960
to attract the interest of scholars,
but so far, few judicial adherents.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.270
The fourth approach asks whether the
article at issue can stand on its own

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.355
as a work of art.

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:48.770
If so, it enjoys protection.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.900
There are at least two different
ways of elaborating this approach.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.000
Paul Goldstein suggests that we ask
whether the article could constitute

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.090
a work of art, quote, "traditionally
conceived," which is related,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.110
he argues, to whether
the article would be

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.980
equally useful without
its aesthetic feature.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.490
Goldstein's reference to
art traditionally conceived

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.780
naturally draws us back
into the debate we discussed

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.750
in the first lecture concerning
the best way of defining art.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.300
For the reasons we
reviewed there, resolving

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.980
that question would be difficult,
although perhaps unavoidable.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.420
By contrast, Goldstein's
fellow treatise writer Nimmer

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.020
points to a more
empirical interpretation,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.740
asking whether a significant
number of copies of the article

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.509
would be purchased if it
had no utilitarian use.

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:38.550
This approach was adopted
by the Court of Appeals

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.430
for the Fifth Circuit
in the Galiano case,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:47.040
which involved uniforms for employees
of the Harrah's gambling casino.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.920
The fifth and last of
the approaches focuses

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.920
on the intent of the creator of the
article, the individual designer who

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.129
determined its final shape.

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:57.170
This approach was adopted
by the Court of Appeals

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.020
for the Second Circuit
in the Brandir case,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.780
which involved the
following interesting facts.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.820
David Levine was playing
around with some wires,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.350
making miniature sculptures in his home.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.940
He twisted one wire into the
shape of a bicycle and another

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.010
into the shape of a ribbon,
and then placed both along,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.780
with some other designs,
on his mantelpiece.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.040
A friend of his pointed
out that the ribbon shape

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.110
could serve as a useful rack
for the miniature bicycle.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.050
Inspired, Levine worked with
a friend to refine the design

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.190
and eventually began manufacturing
and selling commercial versions

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.150
under the company name
Brandir International.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.970
This product is depicted on this slide.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.230
Here's a blow up of the photo
of the rack and another image

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.060
showing how bicycles
can be locked to it.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.680
The rack proved popular and a
competitor, Cascade Pacific Lumber,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.220
began producing knockoffs.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.090
Brandir brought a copyright
infringement suit against Cascade.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.800
The outcome of the case hinged
on whether the ribbon rack

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.960
satisfies the conceptual
separability test.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.950
Relying on a 1983 article by
the scholar Robert Denicola,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.120
the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit announced the following test.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.740
If design elements reflect a
merger of aesthetic and functional

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.820
considerations, the artistic aspects
of a work cannot be said to be

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.450
conceptually separable from
the utilitarian elements.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.680
Conversely, where design
elements can be identified

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.970
as reflecting the designer's artistic
judgment exercised independently

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:43.550
of functional influences,
conceptual separability exists.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.760
Applying this approach, the
court ruled against Brandir,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.810
emphasizing several ways in
which Levine had modified

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.170
the shape of the original abstract
sculpture in order to make it durable

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.820
and to accommodate as many
bicycles and mopeds as possible.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.090
Because the shape of the
product did not reflect, quote,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:07.540
"artistic expression uninhibited
by functional considerations,"

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.580
closed quote, it could
be copied with impunity.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.230
As one might expect, the
net result of the decision

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.370
is that other companies
now manufacture and sell

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.720
competing versions of the ribbon rack.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.950
The approach exemplified
by Brandir now appears

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.830
to be gaining in
popularity among courts.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.850
Whether that trend will
continue remains to be seen.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.270
If it does, one can expect
designers of industrial products

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.880
in the future to include in their
designs features unconstrained

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.550
by functional considerations and,
with the support of their employers,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:47.630
to document their indulgence
of their artistic impulses.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.800
There remains one more type of
three dimensional object that

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.470
now enjoys copyright
protection, architecture.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.460
Inclusion of architecture in
the list was a long time coming

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.980
and its implications are
still not entirely clear.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.200
Here's a bit of background.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.900
The original 1886 version
of the Berne Convention

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.900
included architectural
plans in the set of things

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.360
that member countries
were obliged to protect,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.580
but not architectural works per se.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.090
Application of this principle would
mean that if you copied the drawings

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.140
that an architect had prepared to
guide the construction of a building,

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.730
you would be liable for
infringement, but not

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.410
if you were able to construct an
identical building without use

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.830
of those plans.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.740
In 1890, the Belgian
scholar Jules de Borchgrave

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.210
published an article criticizing
this state of affairs

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.790
and arguing that works of architecture
deserve protection identical to that

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:47.170
employed by other works of art,
such as painting and music.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.970
Borchgrave's argument slowly took
root in European copyright systems,

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.950
first in Belgium, then in France.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.780
For a while, some countries,
England and Germany,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.100
resisted adoption of his
proposal on the grounds

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.250
that it could prevent replication of
ordinary, non-innovative buildings,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.650
and thus would retard development.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.720
But, when reassured that the
proposal would only apply to,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.650
quote, "original artistic work,"
closed quote, they acquiesced.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.380
A key step in this
campaign was the addition

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.561
of architectural works to Article
2(1) of the 1908 version of the Berne

00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:25.060
Convention.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.400
As you know, the United States
did not join the Berne Convention

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.650
until 80 years later.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.560
Until it did so, copyright protection
for architecture in this country

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.850
was skimpy.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.760
Architectural plans were shielded,
as they were in most countries,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.110
and a few cases took the position that
an architect whose plans were copied

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.110
without his permission could prevent
construction of the building using

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.720
those plans, but the
buildings themselves

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.460
were treated as useful articles, just
like the types of industrial design

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.810
we considered a minute ago.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.860
As such, they were subject to
the conceptual separability test.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.980
Only if the aesthetic
components of a building

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.760
were separable from its
utilitarian features

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.140
did they enjoy protection
against non-permissive copying.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.689
Rarely was this true.

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:21.230
When the United States did
finally join the Berne Convention,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.380
Congress considered whether formally
to extend copyright protection

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.390
to architectural works.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.020
It initially decided
not to do so, persuaded

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.500
that the protections available
for useful articles were adequate,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.540
but it commissioned a report
from the Copyright Office

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.480
which, when it was issued,
urged that the law be modified.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.000
And finally, Congress adopted
the Architectural Works Copyright

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.760
Protection Act, which
became effective in 1990.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.530
The key provisions of the new
statute are set forth on your screen.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.200
Notice that it's limited to
architectural works, which

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.290
are defined as the design of a building.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.840
Courts in the United States
have construed "building"

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.669
to be limited to
freestanding structures.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.920
The most important implication
of this new statute

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.460
is that in the United States,
architectural works no longer

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.400
have to run the gauntlet of the
conceptual separability test.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.250
To be sure, like all
types of copyrighted work,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:25.500
a piece of architecture must be original
to be protectable, but as we've seen,

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.605
the standard for originality is soft.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.260
Here's an example of a building
design that would clearly pass muster.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.380
In 1989, the Polish born
architect Daniel Libeskind

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.960
won a competition to design
the Jewish Museum in Berlin.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.540
Here's a photograph of the building
taken from directly above it,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.190
and a second aerial photograph
taken from a slight angle.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:59.520
As you see, the shape of the building
is unusual, a complex zigzag.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.220
Here's how Libeskind himself
explained the structure.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.550
His architectural partner
and wife, Nina Libeskind,

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.710
emphasized the theme mentioned at
the end of the second paragraph

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.200
on your screen, likening the
shape of the building to a, quote,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.520
"broken star of David."

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.770
In the late 1990s, the Australian
architect Howard Raggatt

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.620
was commissioned to design the new
National Museum of Australia, which

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:31.860
was to be located on this peninsula
in the center of Canberra.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.610
Raggatt's much celebrated design
is shown in these aerial photos.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.860
Until the Australian
museum had been finished,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.740
no one apparently
noticed the resemblance

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.370
between its central building
and the Jewish Museum in Berlin,

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.205
but once the connection was suggested,
the parallelism becomes unmistakable.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.350
This case never resulted in litigation.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.660
Had it done so, it
most likely would have

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:04.370
resulted in liability for
Raggatt and the Australian firm.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.980
Since 1968, Australian copyright law
has extended to, among other things,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.490
quote, "a building or
model of a building,

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.460
whether the building or model
is of artistic quality or not."

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.220
Certainly, if this standard
were construed in the same way

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.740
the current US standard is
construed, Libeskind's design

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.460
would qualify for protection,
and the Australian museum

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.890
resembles it sufficiently to
satisfy the legal standard

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.060
of substantial similarity.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.760
The fact that the case, nevertheless,
was not litigated bears emphasis.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.300
Why not?

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.750
We can't be sure, but probably
two factors were at work.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.620
First, copyright litigation is
very time consuming and expensive.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.350
As a result, only a tiny percentage
of potentially actionable cases

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.680
ever end up in court.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.200
Second, architects, at
least high end architects,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.400
seem especially loath to rely on
copyright to protect their work.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.935
Peer pressure and public
condemnation, they seem to think,

00:20:01.935 --> 00:20:06.280
are more effective mechanisms
for discouraging knockoffs.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.390
Indeed, such extra legal
sanctions were deployed

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.610
in this particular controversy.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.470
The Libeskinds publicly
expressed outrage

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.370
and the press, both in Germany
and in Australia, condemned

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.910
what one paper called, quote,
"architectural kleptomania."

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.570
The director of the Australian
museum, who apparently had not

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.350
known of the relationship
between the two buildings,

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.800
expressed misgivings,
publicly acknowledging

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.150
that, quote, "had we
known, we might well

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:41.210
have asked for that particular reference
not to be included," closed quote.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.970
Interestingly, however, Raggatt himself
seems to have had no such reservations.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.680
The overall design of
the Australian museum

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.770
is clearly postmodern in character,
alluding to many other structures.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.740
Raggatt readily admitted to having
been inspired by the Jewish Museum

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.420
and does not seem to resist the
inference drawn by many observers

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.320
that he intended to analogize
the treatment of Aborigines

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.950
in Australia to the treatment
of the Jews in the Holocaust.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.970
As one might imagine,
that suggestion remains

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.300
highly controversial in Australia.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.650
The more general point
latent in this example

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.440
is that there is not complete
consensus, even among architects,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.310
concerning the definition
and significance of copying.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.780
What to one person constitutes
plagiarism or theft

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.260
may to another seem
quotation or allusion.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.720
The law, as we've seen,
now sides with the former.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.050
Whether it should is
one of the questions

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:45.350
I hope you'll be in a
position soon to answer.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.440
This concludes lecture number three.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.490
Next week we'll return
to copyright theory,

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.060
examining in some detail
the utilitarian approach.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:59.760
The week after that, we'll return
to the law and discuss authorship.
