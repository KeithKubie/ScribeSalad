00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
In today's video,

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
we're testing if diamonds
really are forever.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What happens if we
try to burn one?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.700
[Music]

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.940
Previously, on this channel,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.799
we've showed you
how to make liquid oxygen

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:19.113
by taking liquid nitrogen,

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:20.873
putting in an
insulating container,

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:22.543
and letting it
just evaporate off.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:24.602
Once the liquid nitrogen
has boiled off,

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:27.400
you're left with a very
small amount of liquid oxygen,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.640
which is a very cold,
very pale blue substance.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.200
We should get a little bit
in each of these eight cups.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.350
And we already set these
up to start letting

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.800
the liquid nitrogen boil away

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.803
because it takes at
least an hour to do,

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:40.539
and we've gotten it to the point

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.600
where it's boiled
down most of the way,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.700
but we've still got at
least 30% left, I think.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.300
Hopefully, over the
next 15-20 minutes,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.766
that will boil off, and we'll
get that pale blue liquid

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.988
Calli was explaining about.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.300
That should be liquid oxygen,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.900
and we should be able
to just combine

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.649
that all into one cup
once we're done,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.100
and hopefully, do
some cool experiments with that,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.687
and our three forms
of carbon that we have.

00:01:00.687 --> 00:01:03.440
Pencil graphite,
charcoal, and diamonds.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.600
All three of these types
of carbon are things

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
that we see and use
in our regular days,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.900
and they all have
pretty different properties.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.749
Charcoal, of course,

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.300
comes from burning wood
in a low oxygen environment,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.900
and graphite and diamond

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.300
are both naturally
occurring forms of carbon

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.380
that are mined from the ground.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.700
So, while diamonds are
still as far as we know

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.320
the hardest substance,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.800
they're actually weaker
than graphite in one way.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.000
The atomic structure

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.140
of a diamond is formed
in a three-dimensional lattice,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.700
whereas a graphite
is actually formed

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.900
with tightly bonded sheets.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, it's actually
kind of interesting

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.128
because at a chemical level,
graphite is stronger.

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:42.300
However, in practical
use and size,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.900
and a way that we're
going to run into,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.111
you can crumble graphite

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.300
with your fingers, you can crush
charcoal with your hands.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.400
With diamonds, you're going
to need something stronger.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.300
I don't think I could crunch
a diamonds no matter

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.300
how hard I tried.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.200
I mean, you could try.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800
That'd be entertaining
for all of us.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.300
It's just not going
to go anywhere.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
So, once our liquid oxygen
is finished forming,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
we can start doing experiments
with our three forms of carbon

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.800
and that liquid oxygen to see
how they react.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.600
Here's the basic idea.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.702
We have three different
types of carbon,

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:12.374
and we want to see what happens

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.100
if we burn them
in liquid oxygen.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.440
All right, guys,
time for a quick update.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.600
We had our cups full of liquid
nitrogen, trying to extract

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.700
oxygen out of the air,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.200
and how much did we get
out of that, Calli?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.317
That would be none.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.080
Zero.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.417
Like not even a drip
down at the bottom.

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:31.326
Absolutely none out of that.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:33.100
So, we decided to scale up

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.480
to a suddenly more industrial
oxygen farming technique.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.500
We brought in our friend
Alexander to show us

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.820
&gt;&gt; how best do that.
&gt;&gt; Hello!

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.700
Alexander, tell us
just a little bit

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.500
about your experience
in this field.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.952
Well, I am currently
studying engineering

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:47.600
at the University of Utah,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.100
and sometimes,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.246
we do demonstrations in which
we might need liquid oxygen.

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:53.305
And so, the method

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:55.888
that we use is we use
an industrial oxygen tank,

00:02:55.888 --> 00:02:58.300
and then, a little bit
of liquid nitrogen.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.276
It turns out

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.600
that nitrogen boils
at about 77 Kelvin,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.000
and oxygen boils
at about 90 Kelvin,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.200
which means we can use liquid
nitrogen to condense oxygen gas

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.652
and form liquid oxygen.

00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:11.600
So, right here,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.800
we've got, this is
just a coil of copper.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.096
It was like 10 bucks
at the hardware store.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.940
We then wrapped it
around a piece of PVC pipe,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.600
being very careful
not to kink it anywhere

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.900
so there is still
smooth flow all the way down.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.900
So it comes in
through this hose here,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.400
and then travels all the way
down to the bottom coil here.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.300
And this part is submerged
in the liquid nitrogen?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.900
That's what freezing
the oxygen.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.100
Then, this comes
up back and hooks,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.040
and so, we'll have
liquid nitrogen in this,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.490
this gets submerged down
into the liquid nitrogen,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.900
and you can see it's just got
a little fountain spout,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.581
and we're just going
to pour that right

00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.600
into our styrofoam cup.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.600
So basically, the idea is
oxygen gas comes in here.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.618
This entire length

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.120
of copper tubing is going to
cool it down about 300 Kelvin,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.400
and then, right at the bottom,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.249
it's going to have
the right temperature

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.000
that it will condense
into a liquid,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.400
and the back pressure

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.000
from the oxygen gas
will pour it out.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.600
We'll get a nice little fountain

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.100
of very pale blue liquid pouring
down into our styrofoam cup.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.600
And that's when we
can really start the fun.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.334
So let's pour
some liquid nitrogen off,

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:10.809
and then turn on
our oxygen tank,

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.100
and get this fountain going.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.900
Most of the bubbling
has settled down.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.000
I mean, they're still
bubbles coming out of it,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but it's settled down

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to the point where it's
not like exploding all over,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.857
which means our copper has now
been cooled down by quite a bit.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.300
All right, so we're going
to start the flow of oxygen,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.800
and then, we should start
to see in like 10 seconds

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.800
a nice pale blue liquid
coming out of the spout.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.940
Just clearing the line, I think.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.680
Yep.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.174
So right now,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.860
we're cooling the oxygen
down about 300 Kelvin,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.136
and then as soon as it gets
to that temperature,

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.100
and we get a sufficient
amount of it,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.980
it will start pouring out
into the cup here.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.580
Awesome.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.700
Okay, so we can start to see
little bits of liquid oxygen.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.100
Oh my gosh.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.800
And now we're starting to get
a more consistent flow.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800
You can see as the oxygen makes
contact with the copper here,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.119
the frost recedes back

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:01.400
because it's actively
cooling it again.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.257
So one milliliter
of liquid oxygen expands

00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:08.300
to about 860 milliliters of
oxygen gas at room temperature.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.546
What you're seeing here,

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.614
once we've filled up
this cup is really

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.340
quite a significant
quantity of oxygen gas.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.900
So 1/4 teaspoon of it
would provide enough oxygen gas

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.900
to fill like a two-liter bottle
or one liter bottle.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.480
Yeah.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.500
Let's check this out.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.570
We now have a big old cup
full of liquid oxygen.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.700
It's a nice pale blue shade.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.952
If I stick my finger
in it real quick,

00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:31.291
it's going to freeze my glove,

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:33.300
pretty much the same way
liquid nitrogen does.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.260
It's also significantly more
dangerous than liquid nitrogen.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.056
So, liquid nitrogen, basically,

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:41.700
the worst it can do
is freeze your skin

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.500
and give you cryogenic burns.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.620
Liquid oxygen can do
that as well,

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.680
but it can also help things
become extremely flammable.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.700
So oxygen gas itself
is not flammable.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.960
That's a pretty
common misconception.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.100
Things like propane,
hydrogen, those are flammable.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.900
Oxygen gas is important
in sustaining fire though,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.746
and right here,
we have a cup of very,

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:08.160
very concentrated oxygen.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.180
The oxygen in the air
around us is about 21%,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.480
and obviously, the air
isn't very dense.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.700
This is about
as dense as water,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.400
and it is 100% oxygen,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.020
which means that it
will allow us to make things

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:22.400
that aren't normally

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.700
considered very flammable
burn extremely well.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.018
We've got some
liquid nitrogen here.

00:06:28.018 --> 00:06:29.300
We've got a clear cup,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.265
and I think we want to use
the clear cup do this in

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:32.900
so we can see things
a little bit better.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.200
But we don't want to lose too
much of our liquid oxygen,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.700
so we're going to use
the nitrogen to cool this down

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.400
before we put the liquid
oxygen into the cup.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.460
[Music]

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.820
That's so pretty.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.400
Yep.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.282
It's a beautiful pale blue color

00:06:50.282 --> 00:06:52.700
because it absorbs all
of the red wavelengths

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.800
from the atmosphere.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.620
Is that--

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.120
Wow.

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:56.205
I did not know that.

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:56.500
Yeah.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.000
So the quantum notation

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.300
for that is triplet sigma gerade
oxygen molecule goes with,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.700
added to the product
of Planck's Constant

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.400
and the wavelength
that you're going to absorb,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.900
then goes to a singlet delta
gerade oxygen molecule.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.720
You lost me a triple
singlet stigmata?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.940
This is charcoal.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.000
Charcoal is almost
entirely carbon.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.200
It's not going to be 100% pure.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.600
There's going to be residue left
from the wood, gas,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.061
and stuff like that,
but it's mostly carbon.

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:29.100
So what we're going to do is
we're going to get this burning,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.520
and then drop that down
into our pure liquid oxygen.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.800
And it's not going to explode.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.600
No, it shouldn't explode.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.000
The oxygen is going

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.400
to be stoichiometrically
in a very high excess.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.126
So it should burn very
readily and very bright.

00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:44.623
But it shouldn't explode.

00:07:44.623 --> 00:07:45.221
All right.

00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:46.000
Here it goes.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.500
We're trusting you, Alexander.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.200
Just gonna hit

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.700
this little tiny piece
of charcoal with a blowtorch.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.440
Here it goes.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.600
Yep, so you can see,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.972
even though it's currently
sitting in a cryogenic liquid,

00:08:01.972 --> 00:08:04.600
it is still burning
very, very brightly,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.700
and that's because there's lots
and lots of heat being formed,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.569
and that charcoal
is currently being converted,

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.900
and it's now been all converted
into carbon dioxide gas.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.500
That's cool.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.566
And there is no residue.

00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:16.935
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; There's nothing left.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.880
Since its acting
in a pure oxygen environment,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.880
there's going to be
nothing left but gas.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.600
That's amazing.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.300
Yeah.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.200
By the way,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.800
the super awesome slow
mo footage we've got today is

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.200
courtesy of Kuma Films.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.400
This is amazing.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.880
&gt;&gt; So even...
&gt;&gt; Look at the sparks.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.985
Even just right
as it was falling in,

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.019
like at when I was
at the top of the cup,

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:37.774
first filling in
for the first time,

00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:38.763
it was pretty dull.

00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:40.487
By the time it
reached the surface,

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:42.038
it was already glowing brighter.

00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:44.800
So you can see it's just in
the higher oxygen environment.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.500
It hasn't even hit
the liquid yet,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.800
and then, it
does hit the liquid,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.320
and just goes crazy.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.900
That's gorgeous.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.820
That is fascinating.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.800
The balance yet,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.100
and then all
the sparks that come off.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.900
It's like a
personal firework show.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.834
It really is.

00:08:56.834 --> 00:08:58.200
Fireworks in a cup.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200
Next up, we have our slightly
more ordered form of carbon.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.000
This is graphite

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.600
that has been pressed together
into the shape of a pencil core.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600
We broke a piece out.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.844
We're going to try
and burn this,

00:09:07.844 --> 00:09:10.090
drop it into the liquid oxygen,
and see if there's anything

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.660
different about it
than the charcoal.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.340
[Music]

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.860
In.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.600
It's not really doing
as much as I thought.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.720
Maybe it wasn't hot enough.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.440
Interest--

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.400
Well, it's bouncing around.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.011
It's not stopping though.

00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:26.300
It's still reacting.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.600
Is it going out?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.980
But only the part
that's outside.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.920
Yeah.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.900
It went out.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:46.820
[Music]

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.900
We didn't get any reaction
out of the graphite,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.400
and it's possible that
our torch wasn't hot enough.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.721
It's possible that
the configuration of graphite we

00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:56.600
pulled out of a pencil is maybe
a little bit the wrong formula,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.300
but there is one more type
of carbon that we want to try.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.000
Diamond.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
That's right.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.800
So, we have some diamonds.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.000
Calli, where's our diamonds?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.140
Okay, look.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.540
Fine.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:11.900
Okay.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.700
I believe, total,
I was wearing 1/8 of a carat.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.080
1/8 of a carat
of very low grade,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.200
but still diamond.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.200
Still counts.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.700
That's glowing pretty nicely.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.500
Glowing orange.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.300
That is our,
the tip of my forceps.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.800
What happened to
our last diamond, Nate?

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.540
What'd you do to it?

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.400
I burned it up.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.300
So, I was using these forceps,
and they were very cheap,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.800
and my torch actually
started to just melting them.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.500
So I was having a really hard
time holding onto the diamond,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.680
and I kept dropping it,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.291
and then one
of the times I dropped it,

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.300
there was just nothing
left to pick back up.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.300
So, here we go.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.800
I'll try not to burn this one

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.600
up until I drop it
into the liquid oxygen,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.000
at which point, I hope
it burns up spectacularly.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.420
Cool.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.640
It's already cool.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.000
Awesome.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.300
&gt;&gt; Oh my Gosh.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.900
There we go.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.600
It took some doing,
but it started naturally burnt.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.400
Shine bright like a diamond.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.480
It's a new meaning to that term.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:26.660
[Music]

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.060
That's so much cooler

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.000
of an ending than most diamonds
are going to get.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.470
Can you destroy diamonds?

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.900
You can destroy diamonds.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.500
Innumerably many ways,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.600
but this is probably
the most fun.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.500
We're just gonna show--

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.801
I'm not actually
going to drop this in.

00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:39.700
I'm just going to hold it.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.920
Oh, well.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.460
Just right over the top.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.840
Just that oxygen
rich environment.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.500
That's just charcoal
burning at its fullest.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:56.660
[Music]

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.500
This has been really cool.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.900
Alexander, thank you
for your expertise.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.400
Kuma Films, thank you so much

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.500

that we got today.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.600
It looked amazing.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.100
Beautiful.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.200
Amazing.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.000
