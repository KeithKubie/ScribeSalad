00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.880
What if you could add something to a food
crop that made it live a longer, healthier,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.560
heartier life?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:20.800
What if that thing… is a fungus?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.840
Howdy partners, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.080
Microbiome seems to be the word of the year,
doesn't it?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.930
If you haven't heard it, a microbiome is the
flora of bacteria that live, in, on and around

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.110
each of us -- and every one is different.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.750
The tiny microbes in our microbiome don't
hurt us, but live alongside and with us our

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.750
whole lives!

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.660
Your dog has one, you have one, and the plants
in your backyard each have one.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.640
If the last one comes as a surprise, you're
not alone.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.649
Microbiomes of certain people can help keep
us healthy, and the same goes with plants!

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:59.210
As a plant grows, nitrogen-fixing bacteria
in the soil help plants stay healthy.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.439
Rather than genetically engineering the crops,
or adding chemicals, scientists can tweak

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.789
the microbiome of a whole field and help the
plants live longer!

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.659
Or so the study says published in the journal
Cell and written up on Nature.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.310
Rater than using pesticides to kill the things
on our crops and fertilizers to replace lost

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.490
nutrients, scientists now believe they can
alter these microbiomes to encourage plant

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.079
growth and keep them healthy…

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.329
A company called Adaptive Symbiotic Technologies
is doing just that with crops that they say

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.619
will help plants grow better in the droughts
of the west.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.619
It's called BioEnsure!

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.289
It's a type of microbiotic fungi called an
endophyte.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.599
The discovery of the endophyte is nothing
new, they've known about them since the latter

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.049
half of the last century.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.329
They discovered that the endophytes could
change farming as we know it.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.719
When visiting Yellowstone National Park, they
found plants with this symbiotic fungi living

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:00.169
in terribly hostile conditions; the fungi
was keeping these plants alive!

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:05.759
BioEnsure is AST's adaptation of that symbiotic
fungi so it can work with more crops!

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.500
When it's put onto the seeds before they're
planted, these endophytes protect the root

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.579
systems, let the plant germinate and even
keep it healthy when there's a dought!

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:15.790
It's a pretty incredible claim.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.020
WIRED magazine reported "BioEnsure-treated
crops generated 85 percent more yield" during

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.549
the 2012 midwest drought.

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.269
That's ridiculous.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.750
It even helped corn, a notoriously difficult
plant because of the way it depletes the soil,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.959
use one third less water.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.120
Americans are wary about genetically modified
crops, pesticides, irradiated fruits and vegetables,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.450
but it might be that tweaking the biome or
microscopic neighbors of these plants could

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.819
be the simple solution scientists have been
hoping for.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.129
The liquid product will be available this
fall, and has been approved by the FDA.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.840
The studies show it's non-toxic, doesn't affect
the fruit, or get into the plant at all; just

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.150
like with you and MC Shaggyback the microbiome
lives alongside and in congress with the plant.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.730
It's not magic, it's science.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.870
And we wanna thank Subaru for making it possible
for us to report cool scientific innovations

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.870
like this.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.829
Special shout-out to the all-new 2015 Subaru
Legacy.

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.689
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:13.769
It’s not just a sedan.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:14.959
It’s a Subaru.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.280
Back to the fungus - Would you trust it?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.930
Would you put it on your plants?

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.370
Or eat plants you knew it was on?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.390
Germinate the comments -- yes that was a bad
pun -- aaaaand thanks for watching DNews!
