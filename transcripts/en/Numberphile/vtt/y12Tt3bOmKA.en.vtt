00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.680
What we're going to talk about today are sets of positive numbers, okay?

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.180
And a set is basically just a collection of positive integers.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.460
And what we're going to do is try to add sets together.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.200
So let's say we have a set that's called A.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.460
And we'll write the notation, and I'll give and an example.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.960
This set is 2, 3, 7.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.840
Let's have another example, we'll call it B.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.180
And we'll say that B is 1, 5, 8, and 9.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.720
What we want to do is add these two sets together.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.840
And so what do I mean by that?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.040
What we're going to do is add each number in the set pairwise.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.620
So I'll say that A plus B is equal to 1 plus 2, 1 plus 3,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.540
8 plus 3, plus 2, 9 plus 3, and 9 plus 7.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.800
RIght, we have a new set, and we would like to write out the sums so that we actually know what our set is.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360
So let's say 12, and finallly 16.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.100
Well, we have some repeated numbers here, so we would like to write the set in it's actual form.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.980
So I just struck out the repeated numbers that we had.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.500
So, another thing worth noting here is that in our set A we had 3 members, in our set B had 4 members,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.760
and our set sum of A plus B, we had  9 members.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.920
And this is something that will come up again.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.700
We can think of a special type of set that I'll call arithmetic progression.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.040
So, arithmetic progression could be P equal 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.540
We add 4 each time to the number before it and we have a progression

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.840
And it's called an arithmetic progression because we added the numbers.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.180
What we'll do is we'll add P to itself, and we'll see what happens.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.340
And something kind of interesting kind of happens.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.060
And so again, we have 4 plus 4, 4 plus 8, we have this large set of sums here,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.240
and in fact, the actual set will be much smaller.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.020
8, 12, 16, 36 and 40.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.380
Brady: "That's the final?"

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.300
That's the final set.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.260
Brady "It came down a lot, didn't it? Is it normal for sets to come down that much?"

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
No, it's not normal.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.060
So if we have a set of integers, we add all of the sums,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.060
we have, you saw we had a lot of sums.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.680
In most cases, maybe there's not too much overlap.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.000
And in that case, we have something close to what we had originally.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.540
This whole large grid of sums.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340
The nice thing about an arithmetic progression added to itself is that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.460
the size of the sum set will be less than two times the size of the original set.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.060
The sum set will never double the size of the original set.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.260
What you'll end up having is that the size of P plus P is always less than or equal to 2 times the size

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.360
and that's special. We can do another example where we get pretty much the exact opposite.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.640
Our size of P plus P is actually closer to what we would expect with no overlap.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
So what we're gonna do next are geometric sequences.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.960
I'll call it G this time. And this set will be 2, 4, 8 and 16.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.620
This is 2 to the 1, 2 squared, 2 cubed, and this is 2 to the 4th.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.520
So I'll add G to itself, it's a geometric sequence to itself,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.660
and what's special about geometric sequences it that their pairwise sums

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.040
we have some overlap. We have some overlap here.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.180
But we don't have overlap as much as we do in the case of the arithmetic progressions.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.840
So, the size of G, originally is size 4,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.060
the size of G plus G is now equal to 10.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.180
Brady: "So that's more than doubled."

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.660
Yes. Definitely more than double, right?

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.100
So now we have the size of G plus G greater than 2 times the size of G.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.560
And if we were to take a really large geometric sequence, we would actually see that

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.300
G plus G is about G squared.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.340
The first thing is a result from Paul Erdős, and it's about, it's a little bit about sum sets.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.300
Okay. So let's say we take a set, 2, 3 and 7.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.580
We can define the notion of a set being 'sum free'.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.460
And what do I mean by 'sum free'? I mean that if you take any pair of numbers in your set,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.080
including the number itself, add it to itself, then the sum of that pair of numbers is not in the set.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:20.000
So let's look at A plus A. So this will be 4, 5, 9, 10 and 14.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.100
You see that no numbers are shared between these two sets, okay.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.300
So A is sum free.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.122
Brady: "Are sum free sets common, or are they like a special rarity?

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:32.820
"Are the like prime numbers, or are sum free sets easy to find?"

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.020
You would think they would be maybe uncommon.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.960
But in fact, they're actually more common than you would imagine.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.720
So let's say you have any set, okay? Any set of positive integers,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.840
what Paul Erdős said is that there exists a subset of that arbitrary set that you picked

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.060
that is sum free,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.400
and that subset is greater than a third of the size of the original set.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.240
Yeah, I have a favorite, a fractal set, let's say,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.140
it's inside of an interval of real numbers.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.060
So let's say you have an interval of real numbers, 0 to 1,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.060
Brady: "So we're not dealing with integers any more?"

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.560
We're not dealing with integers any more. We have a set of real numbers.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.080
What I would like to, I guess, construct, is something that's called the Cantor middle third set.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.240
It's an iterative process. In the first step of the Cantor middle third set is, you take the middle third out of

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.820
the interval 0, 1, okay?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.780
So you find the middle third, 0, 1, and so this goes from one third to two thirds,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.040
and you erase that segment of the interval.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.440
What I have left is this set, okay?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.440
Brady: "Is it still infinitely big?"

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.340
Yeah. I mean, if you just count the elements in the set, it's huge, it's uncountable.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.400
So now, the second step is to take the middle thirds out of the segments that we have left.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.160
So, we take a third of this set, and a third, and so we end up with something a little smaller

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.980
You do it again, and you do it infinitely many times, I suppose.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.880
And the last, the limit set that you end up with is called the Cantor middle third set.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.880
Brady: "But you never get there. How would you ever get there?"

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.220
Well, you approximate it, basically.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.720
You say that it's, you know, the thing that, if you get close enough,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.320
or you take an arbitrarily large step in our progression,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.220
that'll be the closest set to it. That'll be the limit.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.940
Brady: "How many numbers are in the Cantor middle third set?"

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.820
Well, there are uncountably many, okay?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.420
And so, in some sense, you know, you can say that it's, we haven't

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.440
taken the size down any, at any point.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.100
But there is a way to measure how much we've taken away.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.080
In general, we'll say that, the interval, I suppose, is just a line,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.600
and if we want to measure the dimension of the interval,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.640
we can say that dimension is 1, right?

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.620
So the dimension, just like the dimension of this piece of paper should be

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.960
well, it's not actually 2, right? Because it has some thickness,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.660
but in some fantasy world, it's 2, right? And we're in 3 dimensions, right?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.500
So the dimension of the line should just be 1, or the interval should just be 1,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.660
and there's some way to measure the dimension of this Cantor one third set.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.640
And, what, I'll just say it here, and I'll call it dimension, in quotations.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.240
And I'll say that the dimension of Cantor set, log 2 over log 3.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.220
