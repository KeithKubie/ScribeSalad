This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
Pacifico Beer.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.160
Sharks: we can’t live with em, but we also
can’t live without em.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.940
Despite that, sharks are continuing to disappear,
so what’s causing that?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.380
And how do we stop it?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.999
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it’s
Shark Week here at Discovery, which means

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.390
that all week long, we’re gonna be bringing
you awesome stories, facts, anything interesting

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.480
relating to sharks.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.970
They are the ocean’s greatest predators,
after all - but they still don’t hold a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.490
candle to humans.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.630
And thanks to us, they’re disappearing in
vast numbers.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.420
According to a study published in January
of this year, almost a quarter of the world’s

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.070
cartilaginous fish - mostly sharks and rays
- will be facing extinction within the next

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.070
few decades.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.269
So what’s causing this?

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.920
Well, like I said before - it’s mostly us.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.260
Overfishing is a huge problem globally, and
in the past couple decades alone - the demand

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.010
for sharks has gone way up.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.120
People hunt them for their meat, fins, cartilage,
liver, skin, and teeth - and they often die

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.500
in brutal, inhumane ways.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.729
Shark fin soup, for example, is a delicacy
in many Asian countries, and it’s typically

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.100
harvested through a process called shark finning,
in which a fisherman cuts off the fins of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.119
a shark, and tosses it back into the ocean
afterwards, to die.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.130
It’s a horrible practice that kills anywhere
from 75-100 million sharks every year, and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.460
many countries are cracking down on it.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.330
In December 2013, China banned shark fin soup
from all official banquets - but it’s by

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.820
no means difficult to find anywhere in Southeast
Asia.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.189
I was in Singapore last summer, and I UNWITTINGLY
ate a bowl - before I knew what it was.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.030
And on a personal note - not that great!

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.290
It just tastes like a fishy egg drop soup,
although I’m told that the flavor isn’t

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.180
what makes it a delicacy - it’s the fact
that it’s so expensive, making it more of

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.090
a status symbol than anything else.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.690
Obviously, no animal should have to suffer
just so we can feel important about ourselves,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.700
but this is just ONE of the many ways we’ve
been destroying these populations en masse.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.240
And compared to other marine life, sharks
have been the MOST radically affected by fishing.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789
Part of that has to do with their biology.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.700
They’re at the top of the marine food pyramid,
so there are way fewer sharks, than other

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.179
kinds of animals.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.360
They also have long lifespans - some females
take up to 10 years to reach sexual maturity

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.260
- and they may only produce a few hundred
pups in a lifetime.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.360
So their reproductive rates are low.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.160
Adding to that, is the fact that millions
of sharks are killed every year, by fisheries

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.710
that don’t even hunt sharks.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.660
They just happen to get caught in the nets.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.440
Now you might be wondering, what impact does
this have on us?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.750
We don’t live in the ocean, so why should
we care?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.020
Well, shark conservation doesn’t just protect
sharks.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.220
It also protects things like coral reefs,
which are currently being destroyed by the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.290
effects of overfishing.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.210
A reduction in the number of sharks - leads
to an increase in mid-level predators, which

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.280
in turn, leads to a decrease in the number
of herbivorous fish.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.900
Herbivorous fish, are what eats the algae
that grows on reefs - so without them, the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.470
reefs get overwhelmed by algae, and die.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.360
Much like land, what’s beneath the ocean
abides by a delicate life cycle - and disturbance

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.290
to any part of that cycle, can disrupt the
entire balance.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.000
So what can we do about it, short of lobbying
our local lawmakers?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.210
Well that is one way to handle it - but you
can also take matters into your own hands.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.080
You can spread the word on social media, organize
local campaigns, or donate directly to shark

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.910
conservation charities.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.190
Conservation International is one such organization,
where you can donate $75 to protect 1 square

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.800
mile of the ocean from the devastating effects
of fishing.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.680
There are tons of other websites out there,
with many more suggestions on ways to get

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.100
involved - so if you’re interested, go check
out some of the links we’ve included in

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.100
the description.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.880
If all this talk of the ocean has you clamoring
to travel the world, then you’re in luck!

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.340
Pacifico launched a new campaign, that lets
you experience the world around you from the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.790
comfort of your home computer.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.200
Underneath every Pacifico bottle cap, you’ll
find GPS coordinates to one of 21 amazing

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.520
locations throughout Baja, Mexico, and the
U.S. west coast.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.570
So the next time you crack one open, just
hit up DiscoverPacifico.com on your mobile

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.240
phone or desktop computer, enter the GPS coordinates,
and from there, you can watch a 1-2 minute

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.340
video highlighting what makes each of those
spots truly incredible.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.380
Plus, beer.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.800
Who doesn’t like that?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.810
In the meantime, if you guys have any recommendations
on shark conservation charities or causes
