GIACOMMO BIGGIERO: --transit
agencies across the world.

00:00:03.287 --> 00:00:05.120
So what I'm going to
talk to you about today

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.264
is how we've gathered
customer insight and data

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:15.250
to build business cases and to
subsequently grow our company.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.631
This might be a little
different to some

00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:19.880
of the other presentations
insofar as some of the data

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.730
that we've been collecting
isn't just from analytics

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.170
but is from social behavior
and beyond, really.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.700
So a little bit
of flash history.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.940
We started writing
mobile apps back in 2002

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.811
when phones looked like that.

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:40.310
That was off the
back of the promise

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.630
that this was very imminently
going to become a huge channel.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.510
Of course, that didn't
really materialize

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.690
for quite a number of years,
which meant for the first years

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.490
we were really quite
basically poor, I guess.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.010
But it did give us a
lot of time to think

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.270
about the sort of reach
that mobile apps could

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.130
deliver once the
market was ready.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.484
And it was an opportunity really
to think about doing something

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:07.400
really exciting, something
really interesting,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.680
that could touch the lives of
so many different people in one

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.970
go-- through one medium.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.340
So how do we leverage
that kind of volume?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.890
So what kind of insight,
what kind of goals

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.940
did we set ourselves
at that time.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.070
So I guess there's no real
answer to how you leverage

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.040
large volumes in a
commercially viable way.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.120
But we set ourselves
a few rules.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.357
A few ideas.

00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:35.565
We thought that the apps
had to be really compelling.

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:37.310
And in order to be
really compelling,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.800
they had to be free and
available for everyone.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.550
We thought that in order
to leverage the scale

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.470
to its maximum, we would
have to have a model that

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.570
was transactional to generate
the recurring revenue.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.420
And we wanted to focus
on those environments

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.750
where mobile could become the
ubiquitous way of doing things.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.770
So how do we make it happen?

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.210
So our ethos has
been really to focus

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.479
on trying to solve
real world problems.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.140
Trying to build business
cases around solving pain

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.630
points that people go
through every single day.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.960
Sort of trying to focus
more on what people need

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.510
rather than what they want.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.410
So we started focusing
on the transit agency

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.007
because of the very
large-- I've disappeared.

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: You focus
on the transit agencies.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.290
GIACOMMO BIGGIERO: So I
focused on the-- we focused

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.560
on the transits agencies--
transit industry--

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.316
because the volumes
were so large

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:42.190
and because the customer
experience is really

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.820
quite clunky.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.846
And basically it's
ripe for innovation.

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:49.220
So the first thing we looked
at was the airline industry,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.910
which was the first mover to
move to digital ticketing.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.010
And that completely disrupted
travel agencies, et cetera.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.615
And everybody started
buying their tickets online.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.540
And I guess it's interesting
because with airline, people

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.740
have quite a big
financial commitment when

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.430
they buy a ticket.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.920
They're sort of planning
things in advance

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.280
with their friends or
family at destination.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.582
That takes some time.

00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:17.040
Plus the tickets
are yield managed,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.250
which means the
further in advance

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.720
you buy the ticket, the
cheaper it's going to be.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.380
So the likelihood, really, is
that users are going to be--

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.430
or prospective
ticket buyers-- are

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.380
going to be buying these tickets
at home, sat at their table,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.190
on a website, way before
they're going to travel.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.680
So we looked at other
areas of transit

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.940
where mobile could
be more effective.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.650
And that's when we
started to investigate

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.160
the data around railway and bus.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.950
Railway was
particularly interesting

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.350
because everyone was buying
tickets at the station.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.320
This wasn't for any kind of
lack of websites or ability

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.830
to buy tickets in advance.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.380
That's just what
people were doing.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.820
They were just walking up at
the stations and buying tickets.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.140
They were craving for a
last minute experience.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.480
Perhaps, it's because it's a
smaller financial commitment,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.340
they're going somewhere
for the weekend,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.230
they're seeing their
folks, whatever.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.029
It's a much simpler kind of
experience that they're after.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.110
So in the UK we saw
that 70% of tickets

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.485
were bought at the station.

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:29.520
But this experience is quite
a painful one in practice.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.970
So for those of you that
have lived in the UK,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.760
in London, or in any large
city for that matter,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.400
you'll see that
congestion and ticket

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.590
queues are really,
really painful.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.580
And that's only really
going to get worse

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.249
off the back of urbanization,
population growth.

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.540
We're only going to see more
and more people rocking up

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.870
at stations trying
to buy tickets.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.770
And the government's
very keen to make

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.790
sure the congestion
in the stations

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.510
is limited and mitigated
as much as possible.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.730
And the transit
agencies obviously

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.940
need to bear the cost of
all those ticket vending

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.330
machines and all that
equipment, maintenance,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.660
and overhead associated with
cash handling, et cetera.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.810
So we gathered a lot
of data and looked

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.150
at how this market was working.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.210
And there was quite a
big pain point here.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.190
Not just for the consumer that
wanted something last minute,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.890
on the go and
instead have to queue

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.170
up in this horrible
experience, but also

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.750
for the operator that was
spending a lot of money

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.890
in trying to sell these
tickets and giving up

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.390
a lot of valuable retail
space such as this image

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.310
shows in Gatwick Airport which
could be filled with shops

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.999
or a pub which is going
to generate revenue

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.540
for the operator and is going
to be a much more exciting user

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.406
experience, I think,
than queuing up.

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:52.966
So with that insight from the
user-- from the passenger--

00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:54.840
kind of data that we
gathered and the insight

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.800
from the operators'
commercial drivers,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.120
we came up with the
idea of transforming

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.650
the phone into the
ticket vending machine

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.570
and transforming the phone
into the ticket itself.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.300
That way we could deliver
some of that last minute,

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.160
on the go user experience that
the passengers are looking for

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.750
and that marries itself
so well with mobile,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.985
and at the same time drive down
the costs for the agencies that

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:22.190
are trying to sell
these tickets.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.000
So that way we saw not only the
adoption from the user's case,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
but also an industry
that's willing to back

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.455
this new technology.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.800
So that means no
ticket queues, no more

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.280
need to scale your ticket
vending machines as previously

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.780
planned.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.570
If you have a new channel
you can sell tickets through,

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.240
it doesn't cost you
anything as an operator

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.980
because you as a consumer
are bringing your own ticket

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.990
vending machine.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.120
And in this picture
alone we can see

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.900
about a quarter of
a million dollars

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.750
worth of ticket vending machine.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.220
And if we think that that
can service about four

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.410
to five people at
once, how much does

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.775
it cost to service
100 people that

00:07:08.775 --> 00:07:10.920
have got mobile
phones-- nothing.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.470
So the drivers there
are really obvious

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.500
and the operator can replace
these ticket vending machines

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.150
with any other
retailing activity

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.436
that would actually generate
direct revenue for them.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.730
So we did a lot of research
around the technology of ticket

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.660
vending machines and
what we were working with

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.030
to understand what
the price points were

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.380
to enable us to come up with
a commercial model that would

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.650
allow us to leverage the huge
volumes that mobile brings.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.970
And cash handling
turns out to be

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.540
an extremely expensive affair.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.270
And a lot of transit
agencies such as Transport

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.210
For London are actually
getting rid of cash

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.760
altogether, replacing it with
contactless EMV or Oyster card

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.310
or other technologies.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.820
So mobile is an
ideal channel for us

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.530
to look at to exploit that
volume because you are taking

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:14.660
all the boxes for the operator
as well as the passenger.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.870
So that was kind of what we
built our initial business

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.910
case off of.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:26.240
But I guess gathering
insight, executing on it,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.834
growing off the back of
that is a continuous process

00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:31.500
that we are going
through as a business.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.576
And it's something that you
have to go through continuously

00:08:34.576 --> 00:08:36.950
if you want to continue to
grow and fulfill your business

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.860
model.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.870
So once that business
model is in place

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.590
there are still more
things to learn.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.419
There's still more
data to gather.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.180
And there's still more things
to action off the back of that.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.310
So we developed our
own analytics package

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.780
that leverages some of
the existing tools, Google

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.220
Analytics, and a lot of
other things out there

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.520
and aggregates them together to
display something which really

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.720
gives us a lot of information
about passenger transit.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.970
How are they using
those tickets?

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.120
How are they traveling?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.240
When are they traveling?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.460
When are they buying?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.230
How can we start designing our
new features or our new updates

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.400
to really maximize
the user experience?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.500
So there's a lot of work
that's gone into that.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.450
But perhaps the most
interesting part

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.580
has really been
gathering the insight

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.340
from the industry itself.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.940
So in the UK, for
example, there's

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.110
a highly fragmented rail market.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.140
There's a lot of
private operators.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.890
And in order for mobile to be
the ubiquitous way of buying

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.130
tickets, we need to make sure
that those tickets are accepted

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.090
and validated by all the
operators in the market.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.980
So some operators might
accept it and others

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.970
might not because they need to
be validated in a specific way.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.700
So in order to
accelerate our growth,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.370
we kind of collected
all the information

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.210
and established relationships
with the operators

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.360
and decided to develop
another suite of mobile apps

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.800
that conductors could use
to validate those tickets.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.180
So the conductor would
come along with their app

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.040
and exploiting the onboard
camera on the device,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.410
take a picture of the bar
code or read the NFC tag

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.240
and validate the
ticket that way.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.310
Again, without the
need for the operator

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.160
to invest in further
infrastructure

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.750
to enable mobile ticketing.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.560
So it's again, leveraging
existing hardware.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.370
Users bring their own hardware.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.930
Conductors bring
their own hardware.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.590
There's no additional
investment.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.160
And that way we can
accelerate the adoption

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.000
of mobile ticketing.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:38.320
And what we learned from that
was that adoption is growing

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.340
but not at the pace
that we wanted to.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.450
So we started looking at a
new model for our business.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.260
We started looking
at other environments

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.090
where there was only
a single operator.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.260
So there wasn't this
need for interoperation.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.500
So people could have a
very simple proposition--

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.290
mobile ticketing
wherever you travel.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.530
You don't have to specifically
go on one operator or another

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.200
to use it.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.270
And so we developed
our JustRide product,

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.840
which is not only applicable
to large transit areas

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.926
but also can work across
different modes of transit.

00:11:12.926 --> 00:11:14.550
So this is a product
now we've launched

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.960
in markets outside the UK.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.870
It's live in Boston,
in San Diego.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.950
It also works in
non-rail environments.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.400
We recently landed a
contract with Thames Clippers

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.890
to do the boats on
the Thames as well.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.630
So learning from that
experience in the UK

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.710
has really allowed us to
design a product that's

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.545
much more flexible.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.470
So currently we have 18 agencies
and clients across the world.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:50.100
We currently service about 65%
of the UK market by operator.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.170
We have quite a few millions
of downloads and lots

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.950
and lots of requests
for per minute.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.050
And it's been really quite
exciting journey from us.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.480
And as of yesterday, we are
very excited to announce

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.660
that we landed a contract
to do mobile ticketing

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.700
for the Metropolitan Transit
Authority in New York.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.760
So that's a really exciting
turning point for us.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.800
So, yeah.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.280
That's kind of Masabi's
journey and how

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.010
we've use the insight
of how an industry works

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.850
and how passenger behavior
is to leverage the scale

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.160
that mobile ticketing
can deliver.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.026
Thank you.

00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:36.828
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:37.786
GIACOMMO BIGGIERO: Wow.

00:12:37.786 --> 00:12:38.750
That was really quick.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
now we'll have que--
