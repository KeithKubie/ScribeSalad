00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.710
Let's discuss the solution for the second performance

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.810
comparison quiz. Now the laptop that we had took

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.242
10 minutes, and the new one takes 4

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.434
hours because we are actually using the old laptop

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:14.540
to do this. The speedup is equal to

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.230
the latency of the previous thing, which is 10

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.470
minutes, divided by the latency of the new

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.160
thing we're using which is 240, so this time

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.960
the speedup is 0.04. So the correct answer

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.137
here is 0.04. Again, if there is an actual

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:35.295
slowdown from the previous thing to the new thing

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:38.144
we are using, then we can expect the speedup

00:00:38.144 --> 00:00:41.115
to be lower than 1. And if got instead

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:44.186
of 24 as our answer, that should mean that

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.920
whatever we are using now is faster than before.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.120
So that should tell us that something is wrong.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.294
So pretty much, by kind of checking if it makes sense,

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:56.951
you know, is the new thing actually having a speedup as opposed

00:00:56.951 --> 00:01:00.178
to slow down? If it is a speedup it should be

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:03.940
above 1, a speedup lower than 1 is an actual slow down.
