00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.040
*phone ring*

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.540
NC: Hello?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.600
Guy: What's up?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.180
I'm D-Bag!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.760
NC: Just get it over with.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.780
D-Bag: What?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960
NC: You're a character that somehow ties into the review

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.260
and you're gonna make my life a living hell,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.380
so just get it over with.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.860
D-Bag: What are you talking about?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm just your everyday '90s student a-hole!

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.760
NC: I knew it,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.400
and you're on your way home for Christmas, aren't ya?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.740
D-Bag: How'd you know?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.420
NC: Because you're the visual representation of why everybody wants to love assholes,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.480
like in today's movie!

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.140
D-Bag: But everybody does love assholes!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.280
It's cool to be hated!

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.500
NC: Look, just say your catchphrases for the trailer, and we can get on with our lives.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.200
D-Bag: Well,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.520
I did have quite a few,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.020
but...

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.740
screw it,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.520
I'm coming to your place for Christmas!

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.280
NC: What?

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.780
Don't do that.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.400
D-Bag: Yeah,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.220
you just need some time shag with the D-bag!

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800
NC: No, please, even a cameo is too mu-

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.180
D-Bag: I'm heading over right now.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.680
NC: Wait, what do I care?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.560
You don't even know where I live.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.460
D-Bag: I don't,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.500
but my nerdy sidekick I constantly bully does.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.960
Geek: According to the machines that beep,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840
the Nostalgia Critic lives precisely....

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.560
here.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.340
D-Bag: Thanks, geek.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.840
Now I'll give you back your pet hamster.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.480
Geek: Alive?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.980
D-Bag: Ehh.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.480
Geek: Oh...

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.480
D-Bag: God, I'm charming.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.880
I'll see you soon, Critic.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580
NC: No, you stay there, you walking trademark!

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.480
*sigh*

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.980
*phone smack*

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.700
It is true.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.600
We have a fascination with jerks.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
Perhaps because they do and say what we want to do and say,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.040
but we don't because we have too much of a conscience.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.480
Jerks, dickmunches and buttholes have been popular for years.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.680
Whether we boo them as the antagonists,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.060
laugh at them as the losers,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.680
or even cheer them on because we find that shred of humanity that we inspiringly connect to.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.400
And then there's jerks who have none of that,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000
but were eye candy for tween girls,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
so we gave them a holiday movie.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.660
Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.960
or JTT, as I refused to call him then,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.860
and proudly refuse to call him now...

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.760
was a bit of a heartthrob for a short amount of time.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.840
Acting as the middle child in Home Improvement,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.700
Thomas left his hit series to pursue a career in movies resulting in...

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.400
I think movies.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880
Yeah, most of them didn't do very well.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.340
But the one many claim to be his crowning achievement of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.280
UGGGH

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.600
is Disney's "I'll Be Home For Christmas."

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520
Appearing on many "worst Christmas movies ever" lists,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.020
this film suggests it's fine to be kind and generous to others,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.180
but first, you gotta ask,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.540
"What am I gonna get in return?"

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.340
Well, definitely not ticket sales,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.880
as this movie film so bombed they haven't even released a Blu-ray of it.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.700
And keep in mind,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.280
this is a world that allows THIS to have a Blu-ray.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.400
But, we have a habit of looking at the worst of the worst,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.000
so why break Christmas tradition?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Let's take a look at

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.800
what nobody put on their resume.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.040
So we start off I'll Be Home For Christmas with its matching song...

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.760
Steve Allen's "Cool Yule"

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.580
Hey! What do you know?

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.320
That doesn't fit!

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.940
That– that– that– that doesn't fit!

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.460
Just as you're waiting for Moon Man to appear,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.300
the film opens in high school...

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.900
university

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.100
...where our main character, Jake,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100
played by Thomas,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.900
agrees to let his nerdy friend Ian out of his locker

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.800
if he gets him his math test answers

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.300
and backstage passes to Dave Matthews Band.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.180
Ian: *inside locker* Let me out!

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.240
Jake: Did you get my mail?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.000
Math test?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.500
NC: Words can't explain how excited I am to be cinematically manacle to this prick.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.300
He wants to meet his girlfriend at her dorm room,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.540
but for some reason, her roommate won't let him in.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.400
Maybe she saw Man of the House.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.200
Jake: Unless...

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.980
What's this?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600
Girl: Cherry crunch?

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.860
NC: *blinking in confusion*

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.560
The

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.600
classic "girls like cherry crunch bars" joke.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.700
Jake: Shoo-shoo.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.900
NC: He's dating a freshly-escaped-from-7th-Heaven Jessica Biel,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.840
who tries to turn down Jake's charm.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.200
And by charm,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.000
I mean, tilting his head back like his eyes are in his nostrils.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.100
You can even see him doing it through the back of his head!

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.580
Jake: Looks like it's snowing.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600
NC: He also wanted to tell her that it's snowing outside,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.480
but it's just another one of his wacky schemes.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.800
Allie: Oh, hey Ian.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.200
Ian: Hi *voice crack* Allie.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.900
NC:(as Ian) They said they wanted someone less attractive than Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.800
In fact, I think that's actually how I'm credited in the cast.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.600
(normal) He offers her a trip to spend Christmas on a beach,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.440
but she's angry because she want to spend it with her family.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.000
This forces Jake to confront this weird sensation humans call emotion.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.500
Allie: My mom and dad would be crushed if it didn't come home.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.200
And what about your dad.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.800
NC: (as Jake) Which one?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.900
I'm ditching two at the moment.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.000
*ring*

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.720
*ring*

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Ian: Wilkinson residence.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.160
NC:(as Ian) Personal man-slave speaking.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.700
Ian: Jake!

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.680
It's your dad.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.300
Dad: Look, Jake, I'm calling to find out about you.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.420
Are you, uh...

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.500
still planning on coming home for Christmas?

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.000
NC:(as Dad) If you could cast me in a different movie,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That'd be greaaaaaat.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.280
Dad: You haven't been home for the holidays since Mom died.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.340
I think it's time that we become a family again.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.600
NC:(as Dad) I know it's difficult,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.500
but the mouse just does like mommies.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.460
Mickey: IS THAT A MOTHER ON THE PHONE!?

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.960
NC:(as Dad) NO! NO!

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.520
Just a distressed adolescent going through and arc.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.720
Mickey: Hmmm...

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.600
*fearful gasp*

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.920
(normal) His dad, sister and step-mom all say they want him to come home,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.880
but because liking a character is so lame,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.120
he still says no.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.200
Dad: I just really want you home, son.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.200
Jake: Well I just don't think I can get there.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.340
Dad: Not even if I, uh,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.500
give you the Porsche?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.400
*angel choir*

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.000
Jake: Excuse me?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.980
NC: Yep,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.900
*sigh* you're hearing this right, folks.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.540
Our main character is going home for Christmas

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.900
because of a bribe.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.800
Dad: If you're home by the time we sit down for dinner, 6 o'clock, Christmas Eve,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
the car's yours.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.600
Jake: Great.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.280
Bye.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.500
You are mine.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.300
All mine.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.200
NC: Oh hey, Mr. Grinch.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.220
What are you doing here?

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.920
Grinch: I just wanted to say this guy's an asshole!

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.560
NC: Yeah.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.760
Yeah, he's pretty bad.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.660
Grinch: Such an asshole.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.500
NC:This, of course, raises some quickly ignored concerns.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.900
Carolyn: He cashes in the tickets and you offer him a bribe.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.300
You see anything wrong with this picture?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.200
Dad: Yeah. Yeah, I do but,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.040
Jake's coming home for Christmas

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100
*laughing*

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.700
Carolyn: *laughing*

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
NC: Best Dad of the Year

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.800
or Best Dad of All Time

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.600
or Fucking Enabler

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.200
you pick.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.000
But that also doesn't stop him from making it look like he's going to see his family in front of his girlfriend.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.100
But, it gets even better.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.680
It looks like her family ALSO happens to live in the exact same neighborhood as his.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.620
I'm...

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.300
so glad that they both got accepted to the same out-of-state college that they both applied for after high school.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.600
But, what can I say.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.100
Dickhole University is pretty popular.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.000
Mini-Screech pages the correct answers to a bunch of jocks Jake promised to help,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.600
As,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.300
you know,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.800
the teacher's totally fine with pagers being used during a test.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.700
Jock 1: Sorry, Ms. Peterson.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.000
Jock 2: Coach likes to stay in touch.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
NC: (as teacher) Well, with an airtight excuse like that,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.300
I have no choice but to accept your reality.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.080
(normal) But another douche, who has the hots for Jake's girlfriend-

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah, let's just call him Douche 2, because

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.440
there's really no difference between them,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.660
they come in the same box.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.600
-stops Mini-Screech from giving the answers causing them to fail the test.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.100
Resulting in him being locked in his locker.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.400
(pounding on locker door) Ian: 3214!

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.660
Aw, man!

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.100
NC: We never see him again in this movie,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.120
so I'll just assume he died.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.880
*death bell toll*

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.120
Meanwhile,

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.100
during you're traditional Christmas party

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.300
with rave music, drinks,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.200
and public-domain cartoons for toddlers.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.100
(as student) Hey, Everybody! Quiet down!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.400
This fuckers playing RUDOLF!

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.400
Jake talks about how excited he is to be with his car.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.060
Jake: It, like, it knows you, and it's listening, and

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.260
just respondent.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.300
NC: (as Jake) Unlike people.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.800
God,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.940
I hate those things.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.520
(normal) But the jocks catch up, and want to make him pay for causing them to fail.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.820
So, they drop him of

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.940
in the middle of the dessert

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.080
in a Santa outfit they glued to his body.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.900
Um...

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.820
Is this a prank

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.740
or attempted murder?

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.380
*stutter* I'm pretty sure this would fall under attempted murder.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.440
Which, for this character, I'm totally fine with.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
*phone ring*

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
*phone ring*

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.060
Hello?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.340
D-Bag: Minor setback, Critic.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.940
I tried cheating some guys, and they stranded me on the side of the road dressed as the Easter Bunny.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.620
(confused) Why did they dress you as the Easter Bunny?

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.400
D-Bag: I don't know.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.100
Quirky?

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.400
NC: Well, *sigh*

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.220
at least you learned a valuable lesson.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:32.960
D-Bag: HELL NO!

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.740
I have a ton of other schemes in mind to get home while screwing people over.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.380
NC: What!?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.080
D-Bag: In fact,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.680
I practically blackmailed my family,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.900
lied to my girlfriend,

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.320
and left my geeky best friend in a horrendous situation

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.480
all before leaving.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.080
*fire*

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.380
Geek: I have no idea how this happened.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.780
D-Bag: Aren't I just likably hateable?

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.440
NC: Look, you seem to be wired to hurt anyone you come in contact with,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.880
just turn around and go home to your family.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.560
D-Bag: No can do.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.340
There's some much more despicableness to spread.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.200
*car honk twice*

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.040
D-Bag: Oh! Hey,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.720
a car that says

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.400
"Puppy's for Sick Kids" is pulling over.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.360
Gotta go.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.900
NC: NO, DRIVER!

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.800
DON'T MAKE I CONTACT!

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.120
*sigh*

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.040
*whimper*

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.640
So, Jake is stuck in the desert with literal vultures following him.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.800
Vulture: *squawk*

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
*squawk*

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.100
Jake: I said "I WISHED I were dead."

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.500
NC: (as vulture) I came to pick of what's left of your talent.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.800
I found nothing.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.480
Oh, look.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.480
Frankie Muniz was dropped of a mile down.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.700
Vulture: *squawk*

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.500
Jake: Sit.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.560
NC: (laughing) OK.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.700
This movie MIGHT redeem itself

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.460
if the rest of it is just a Road-trip Comedy

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.600
with the vulture.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.240
He's already the best actor in the flick.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.500
I'm sure they trained him better than they trained Thomas.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.480
Jake: Die.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.060
NC: So that leaves Biel with Douche 2 to get a ride with,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.560
because,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.600
surprise, SURPRISE,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.580
he ALSO lives in the exact same neighborhood.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.360
Again,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.660
Dickhole University:

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.700
Keeping people asshats,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.500
but close.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.760
Eddie: Just the two of us.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.360
Riding the crest of Destiny's Rainbow.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.760
Allie: First, the ground rules.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.540
If say too many stupid things like that,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.640
I'll have to slug you.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.760
If you make listen to any sexist,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.480
racist,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.560
or homophobic jokes,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.120
I'm *chuckles* gonna have to slug you.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.140
NC: Boy, the new disclaimer for Youtube comments seems pretty harsh.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.500
So, Jake calls his family to tell them what's going on.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.560
Jake: Get me Dad.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.360
Tracey: When did I become your slave?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.740
Jake: The day you were born.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.620
Tracey: Oh, right.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.360
Oh, DAD!

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.700
NC: Well, she seemed...

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.540
bizarrely accepting of that.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.360
(as Tracey) I assumed anyone born after Jonathan Taylor Thomas a forgotten pawn.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.220
(normal) His father,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.920
big shock,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.800
doesn't believe him,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.320
so, he manipulates an old lady to give him a lift.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.560
Jake: (high, fake sad voice) He's so worried about the operation.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.720
He's not thinking clearly.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.460
The whole family chipped in and got him a triple bypass for Christmas.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.480
NC: (as old lady) Sonny, are you trying to be funny?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.020
Jake: *fake crying*

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.700
NC: (as old lady) No, I'm serious.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.900
Are you TRYING to be funny?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.520
None of jokes are landing at all.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.480
Jake: I sent every last dollar I earned working as a shopping mall Santa.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.740
The operation's on Christmas Eve.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.100
NC: (normal) My God, is this bit dying.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.000
I don't know if there's anything we can do to save it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.120
Jake: And now, I won't be home until after the anesthesia wears off.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.340
*fake crying*

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.260
NC: NO!!!

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.280
I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE THIS JOKE!!

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.300
CLEAR!

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.040
*shock*

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.700
CLEAR!

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.200
*shock*

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.360
*flatline*

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.120
*flatline*
*death bell toll*

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.880
*flatline*
NC: A lot of death in 2016.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.200
*flatline*

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.880
He gets a lift, but it's not very long as one woman's teeth falls out,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.700
the Tom Jones music is too loud,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.540
pickles are spilled all over him, and...

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.400
*Critc.exe loading*

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.800
I don't know. Prune juice

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800
Wheel of Fortune

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.200
being racist about something.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.140
The Old Person Cliche Bag has it all.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.520
Old Lady: I never heard of such a-

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.020
*car door close*

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.100
NC: So, he walks to nearby Christmas attraction to spend the night.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.580
Jake: Ho ho ho, tubby.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.960
Secret Fat Man Handshake.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.700
Alright.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.900
You know, confidentially speaking just between us Santas,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.700
don't you ever get tired of wearing this suit?

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.300
I mean, every year, it's the same suit.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.600
RED, red, RED, RED, red.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.700
*breath*

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.600
I mean, does any guy really look good in red?

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.880
(whispering) I don't think so.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360
NC: (as director on megaphone) Uh, Jon.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.860
None of this is in the script.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.720
(as Jonathan Taylor Thomas) Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd do a little improvising.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.260
(as director) Please don't.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.160
(normal) He wakes up the next morning though to find something unexpected.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.500
Groundskeeper: (as Santa mannequin) Wake up, chief.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.400
Time to feed the reindeer.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.440
Jake: *relieved sigh*

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.100
NC: OK, can we replay my hearts reaction to that scene we just saw?

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.420
*Critic's heart beating*
Groundskeeper: Time to feed the reindeer.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.420
*Critic's heart beating*

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.400
NC: Yeah, that stopped.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.320
That stopped right in it's tracks.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.700
If we could avoid more scary imagery like that,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.500
the main character is scary enough already.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.620
Chester: Oh, that's nothing.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.120
NC: Ahh!

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.720
Chester: YOU ACT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SLEPT OUTSIDE NEXT TO A STATUE OF SANTA,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.920
WHO SUDDENLY CAME ALIVE BECAUSE OF AN ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE!

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.820
What? I didn't say that. Huh?

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.020
NC: Ya know, Chester, where have you been?

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.880
I barely see you do any Bum Reviews anymore.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.760
Chester: Well,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.020
I've been occupied.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.660
NC: Waking up next to statues of Santa.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.160
Chester: Partly.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.340
NC: What do I pay you for?

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.040
Chester: YOU DON'T!

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.360
I'M JUST ALLOWED TO BE IN A WARM, WARM BUILDING,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.720
which I am very thankful for.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.680
NC: Well, if you're not doing a Bum Review,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.520
how come you're set up like you're doing a Bum Review?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.200
Chester: I don't know.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.340
I just kinda thought this is how you like to talk to people.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.980
NC: GET OUTTA HERE!!

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.480
Chester: *scream*

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.400
NC: AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU DO ANOTHER REVIEW!!

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.040
Chester: BUT, I'M OCCUPIED!

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.800
NC: YOU'LL BE OCCUPIED WITH MY FOOT UP YOUR ASS!!

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.600
Chester: OH, PLEASE!

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.420
NOT LIKE LAST CHRISTMAS!

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.700
NC: So, he than gets a ride from...

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.580
Well, to be frank,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.160
not a bad actor, but a...

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.260
fascinatingly bad actor.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:12.760
I mean it.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.200
This guy should be studied.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.760
Nolan: Hang on, Santa. I'm coming.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.100
Ohh, maaaan.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.700
I have been happier to answer that question on my life.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.380
NC: Did Tommy Wiseau breed?

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.200
It's kind of amazing.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.640
Nothing this driver says sounds of this world.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.700
Nolan: Rot in a state correctional facility.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.740
Oh, no.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.540
I went and killed Santa.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.780
NC: He sounds like a human you buy at the store

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.000
and grows to lifesize

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.380
after you place him in water.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.680
Nolan: Aww, sugardoll.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.040
I won't if you don't want me to.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:39.560
Happy.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.000
NC: I have no idea what dimension would accept this as typical human speech.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.260
It's probably the same dimension that accepts this.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.540
Nestle Dogs: Nestle makes the ve-

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.040
-ry best
NC: AHH!

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.100
UNHOLY!!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.980
Meanwhile, Biel continues her adventures with Douche 2.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.000
Eddie: Uuh, look.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.900
I'm a millennial type of guy-

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.520
NC: Immediate minus 10 points for possibly giving birth to the term "Millennial".

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.860
Eddie: I dig world music,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.200
I think friance should be banned.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.400
What does just have that I haven't got?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.200
NC: (as Eddie) No, seriously.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.400
We are written as the exact same character.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.620
I literally don't know the difference between us.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.740
Allie: *chuckle* Amazing things.  Things that...

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.100
just give me the chills.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:16.920
NC: (as Allie) You know.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.420
The same way a series killer gives you the chills.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.440
(normal) By the way, here's a fun game:

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.360
Count How Many Times Her background changes in between Shots.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.420
*ragtime music*

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.620
*ragtime music*
*ding*

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.280
*ragtime music*

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.500
*ragtime music*
*ding*

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.200
*ragtime music*

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.320
*ragtime music*
*ding*

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.200
*ragtime music*

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200
*ragtime music*
*ding*

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.700
*ragtime music*

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.900
*ragtime music*
NC: (as Allie) Hey! At this rate, we'll be home by 7,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.400
*ragtime music*
9,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.480
*ragtime music*
and 12 o'clock.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.360
*ragtime music*

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.460
(normal) But, in yet another coinkidink,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.180
their car passes Jake's.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.460
Nolan: Are you saying that's Mrs. Claus in that car?

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.300
With another guy?

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.000
Mrs. Claus stepping out on Santa?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.600
Letting some other guy down the chiminney?

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.600
Why that two-timing hoe!

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.200
There's corpses in the backseat of that van.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.380
I just know it.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.260
They try catching up,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.080
but they caught by a cop for speeding.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.200
Jake tells the cop that he's handing out toys to the Children Hospital,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.300
which, of course,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.400
results in the officer escorting them there

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.100
and even walking to see him give the goods in the van out to the kids.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.500
There's even a boy,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.600
who's stilted acting brings them to tears.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.200
Jake: What do you want for Christmas?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.600
Kid: To go home.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.700
I want to be with mi mamá,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800
mi papa,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.560
mi hermana, Maribelle,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.080
mi hermano, Madio,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.460
NC: (as Kid) And not to be seen as the worst actor in the movie.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.520
Nolan: Chris this is Carolson

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.100
NC: (as Kid) Oh, thank you.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.080
Cutting to him will help.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.320
Nolan: I don't wanna a vend stolen goods no more. I-I just-

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.320
Officer Max: ...just wanna beg you to come home for Christmas.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.520
NC: (as Max) Yeah, I gotta call you back.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.460
I think the guy next to me said something about stolen goods.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.000
(normal) Even Jake calls home, but...

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.000
DOH! Shoot!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.160
It's his step-mom.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.480
That doesn't count.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.700
Carolyn: Where are you now?

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.080
*laugh* Are you on you're way home?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.920
Jake: Yeah, look. I gotta run.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.960
(over phone) So, uh, you take care now.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.500
OK?

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:52.520
Carolyn: OK.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.880
Jake: Bye.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.840
NC: You sure the original title wasn't

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.840
"I'll Be HORRIBLE For Christmas?"

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.460
As the driver decides to go back home,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.080
the cop has a bit of confession.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.440
Max: It's my wife,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.360
Marjorie.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.880
She left my last month and...

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.340
Well, if I could just get back for Christmas,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.440
I know we could start again.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.500
Jake: Why are you telling me this?

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.600
Max: She won't listen to me,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but I got a hunch she's listen to Santa.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.460
NC: So, this is what happens when a movie is written entirely by your toes.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.800
Your

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.500
idiotic,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.200
despicably mean-spirited toes.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.700
But, of course, it's on the way to where he needs to go,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.600
Soooo...

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.000
Jake: What's the matter with you, man?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.200
You lover her enough to marry her,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.500
but you won't take a little drive?

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.000
NC: If I could put that face on a dart board

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.700
and throw FLAMING PUNCHES AT IT-

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800
*phone ring*

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.100
*phone ring*

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.300
Abandon all hope ye who watch this movie.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400
D-Bag: Good news, Critic.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.500
I stool a car.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.800
NC: Oh. That's progress.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.100
D-Bag: I also ran into the sick kid, who said he just want to go home for Christmas.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.800
NC: Yeah?

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.300
*sad music plays*

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:49.800
Ya know,

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.500
I felt

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.720
bad.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.400
Like, really bad that he

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.900
wasn't able to go to that beautiful place he called home.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.000
NC: So, you stayed with him until his problem was solved.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.500
D-Bag: Nope.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.620
I burned his house down.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.620
That way he doesn't have to worry about it anymore.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.420
Isn't it adorable how much you're not supposed to like me?

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.240
NC: I am trying to be so patient with you,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.820
but you are not making that easy.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:11.560
D-Bag: I know.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.660
I guess I'm complex.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.660
See ya in a bit.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.180

*phone drop*

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.280
NC: Pray for everyone everywhere.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.280
*Theme play out*

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.040

*clap* Back to the show.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.900
*Intro music*

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.600
NC: So, while waiting to Jake to come home,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.280
his dad polishes the Porsche he promised him.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.780
Dad: There is not an obstacle in this world

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.500
that will keep my son from this car.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.380
Tracey: Oh MY GOD! THERE'S A SCRATCH! THERE'S A SCRATCH!

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400
Dad: Where? WHERE!?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.700
Tracey: Get a life, Dad.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.600
NC: (as Tracey) But it's nice to know that you care more about the car and Jake

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.000
than your daughter and your wife.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.200
Can I get a car?

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.300
(as Dad) Well, seeing as Jake proclaimed you as his slave,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.700
I don't think he would like that.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.500
(normal) This is a GOOD family.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.960
So, Jake goes to the restaurant and tries to win the cop's wife back.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.280
Marjorie: After he kissed that tramp in front of everybody at Smitty's?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:58.780
Jake: Well,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.580
you know, I'm sure it was a friendly kiss, right?

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.860
Like brother-sister.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.000
NC: (as Jake) Ya know, the kind you see Folders commercials.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.000
(normal) But, a county band drives by and...

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.900
completely off-screen,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.520
Jake convinces them to play for the cop to sing a song in order to win her back.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.140
Max: (singing badly) Oh, Marjorie.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.600
Oh, Marjorie.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.160
NC: No No!

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.700
I'm sorry.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.600
You NEED to show how that back-and-forth went!

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.800
If a kid in a Santa suit said,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.200
"Hey! This cop you never met cheat on his wife.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.180
Play for us."

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.300
I think I would ask him if there was dirt in my nail.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.980
Max (singing badly) I need to have you home

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.340
NC: Hey, look.  He's writing the script in front of us.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.600
Suddenly, this movie is adding up a lot more.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.000
Max: ("singing") Ohh,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.400
Baby

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.200
Oh Baby

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.100
Oh Baby

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.700
NC: I'm not even trying with this one.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.900
So, with one couple founded on adultery happy,

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.980
let's see if we can make another couple founded on adultery happy.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.780
Yeah, I guess she couldn't tell the difference between Douche 1 and Douche 2 either.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.200
Jake: I'll kill him

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.500
NC: (as Jake) Her, i'm fine with for some reason. But, him,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.400
I'LL KILL HIM!

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.100
He catches a bus, but he has to convince the driver to take him where he say his girlfriend kissing.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.380
So, he take a cooler,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.000
places places an unrealistic amount of meat some random person brought on,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.600
and says...

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.400
it's a liver that needs to be delivered to where she is.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600
*ree* *ree* *ree*

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.680
Passenger: Oi NO!

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.600
Old lady: We need to get to Adelbruck!

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.240
NC: Christ.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.200
Why don't you just have it written in crayon while you at it?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.060
OH MY GOD!!!

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.960
IT'S CRAYON!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.780
IT'S CRAY-

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.020
*stutter* Were the magic markers too credible?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.200
Were the color pencils just too realistic?

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.900
What the hell else would this crowd fall for?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.600
(as jackass) QUICK!

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.740
I have a pirate hat with a human heart for a little girl written in whiteout!

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.420
(as jackass 2) THAT'S NOTHING!!

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.840
I have a pizza box with a kidney for a little girl written in DOG FECES!

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.340
(as jackass 3) SCREW YOU!!!

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.540
I have a binder with a human skull for an octopus written entirely in BRAILLE!

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.420
IT'S REAL!!!

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.960
(as self) Of course,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.400
they all fall for it,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.000
because madness doesn't take a break,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.100
and Jake get to the hotel where they're staying at

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.400
I'm assuming called

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.000
"The Yodeling Tweety Bird."

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.960
Jake: Tell if there is a Allie Henderson or an Eddie Taffet checked in here?

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.160
Clerk: I'm sorry, santa.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.420
I'm not allow to give out information on our guests.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.780
Jake: Policy does not apply to me!

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.280
I OVERRIDE POLICY!

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.380
I wanna know where my girlfriend is!

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.860
NC: (as Jake) DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!?

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.500
I WAS THE KID WHO WAS FORBIDDEN TO SING FOR DISNEY!!

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.000
(normal) Oh, come on.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.600
Couldn't you rough him up a bit?

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.340
Surely, you have some spiked wooden clogs or something.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.560
But, he finds his girlfriend and she tries to explain herself.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.100
Jake: I saw you kissing her on TV, you dirtbag.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.640
Allie: He caught me under the mistletoe for 2 seconds.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.400
Big deal.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.300
NC: You're honor,

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.720
Mistletoe Law is very clear on 1st-base adultery.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.700
Eddie: And they were good.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.960
NC: Na na na na naaaa.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.300
Allie: What was I supposed to do?

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.380
Beem myself home?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.140
Jake: Allie, I was stuck in the desert.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.260
I couldn't get to you.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.820
I had no choice.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.920
Allie: Ok, I forgive you.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.220
NC: for-give - him?

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.760
First of all, there was no apology.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.260
Second,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.300
YOU KISSED SOMEONE ELSE!!

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.920
You're BOTH awful!

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.260
Are Jake's bullshit arguments contagious?

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.240
But, he lets slip that he has to be home by 6 in order to win the car.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.400
Allie: Why do you have to be home by 6?

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.500
Jake: Because, that's when dinner will be ready?

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.800
OW!!!

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.800
NC: Oh, that felt good.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.200
Can I just watch that on a loop?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.860
Jake:OW!!!

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.460
OW!!!

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.080
OW!!!

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.740
OW!!!

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.580
NC: Now THAT I would proudly play at a Christmas party.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.860
*scene looping as music plays*

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.680
So, Biel ends up leaving him.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.900
Jake: I care about you!

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.460
You gotta believe me.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.100
Allie: Santa, if you showed up on my doorstep in a one horse open sleigh,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.340
I wouldn't believe you

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.180
Can't tell if that's bad foreshadowing or bad humor,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.180
but we can all agree that's bad writing.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.580
Allie: You might be a fake boyfriend Jake,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.720
but I'll tell you one thing,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.100
YOU'RE A GENUINE BUTTHOLE!

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:47.800
NC: (chuckling) Wow.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.020
That's like the f-bomb in a Disney film.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.560
But it's alright,

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.300
because now the really romance can begin.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.700
Eddie: I would have never thought I'd ever help you out.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.100
After that massacre,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.100
Man, I just wouldn't to be human.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.420
Jake: God, I never thought I'd be driving home with you either.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.860
NC: (as Eddie) It does seem impractical.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.980
Even lazy.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.360
But, from piece of shit to another,

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.600
we gotta look out for each other.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.100
(normal) But Douche 2 changes his mind and drops him off.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.400
Why?

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.760
Because he forgot he's a one-dimensional character.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.840
No. Honestly. I'm not even kidding.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.100
Eddie: I'm sorry man, I

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.400
just can't do that much good stuff for another person, ya know?

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.600
It'd be way bad for my rep.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.300
NC: (as Eddie) I really trying out for the next Steven King movie

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.600
to be Bully #5.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.680
(normal) But, coincidence #30,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.800
he's dropped off at a Santa 5K.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.700
First place gets $1000,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.360
and last place gets to be an extra in Jingle All the Way.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.000
*audience cheering*

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.140
I'm so torn.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.800
I don't want him to get shit,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.160
but until he does, the movie won't end.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.360
Why couldn't this be written by George R. R. Martin?

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.620
One of the Santa's to slow down to give him a fair shot

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.100
resulting in Jake winning.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.660
But, he finds out the Santa he beat was the mayor

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.320
and he usually give his winnings to feed the hungry.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.580
So, he drops by his house of white potato flakes to give it to him.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.420
Well, that's nice.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.060
*ding*

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.140
That completely balances out.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.400
So, he tries every way he can to get back

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.200
as his father starts to sulk that it's not gonna make it.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.000
Dad: Even a bribe couldn't get him home.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.760
NC: Now that's a line I like to hear in a Christmas movie.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.300
"God bless us everyone."

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.600
"Every time bell rings, an angel gets his wings."

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.760
"Even a bribe couldn't get him home."

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.300
Can't you just feel the magic?

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.400
*phone ring*

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.800
*phone ring*

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:28.780
*phone rin-*

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200
(concerned) What have you done now?

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.260
D-Bag: I'm in a rocket ship heading over!

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.140
NC: Wait. A rocket ship?

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.400
The only person I know who has rocket ship it Santa Christ.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.040
D-Bag: Yeah, I manipulated him for it.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.000
NC: (under breath) oh my go-

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.300
Well at least you didn't hurt anybody.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.280
D-Bag: *chuckles* Oh, no.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.060
I still kicked him in the balls for the hell of it.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.060
Santa Christ: HO Hooooooo

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.940
WHY would he kick me in the Jingle Balls for no REASON?

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.300
Oh, well.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.100
At least he'll get that pizza box to that little boy.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.740
NC: THAT'S ONE OF MY FRIENDS!

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.900
Why are you doing everything you can to be so awful!?

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.060
D-Bag: It's OK. I gave pocket change to a homeless person.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.300
Homeless Person: Oh. Pennies from heaven. *laugh*

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.080
D-Bag: I figured that more than makes up for it.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.920
So,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.640
do you hate me yet?

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.600
NC: Forget coming home.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.060
Just COME HERE before you do anymore damage.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.020
D-Bag: Will do.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.340
*series of explosions*

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:15.980
*phone slam*

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.860
NC: (defeated) I really hope he's not in many episodes.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.300
Thankfully, Jake keeps getting dropped off at stupid places

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.360
and he finds a one horse open sleigh that he can steal.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.080
Because compared to everything else he's done,

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.860
stealing is like a drop in a bucket.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.460
Carolers: Round yon Virgin, Mother and-

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.140
NC: (as Jon) Fuck you.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.320
I'm Jonanthan Taylor THOMAS!!

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.000
(normal) And for someone who claims to have little time,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.700
he still manages to drop by his girlfriend's house.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.800
(as Jake) Hey, babe.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.100
See this one horse open sleigh?

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.960
It ain't for you.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.640
BYE!

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.280
HA HA HA HAAAaaaa.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.500
(normal) No, of course he talks to her

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.100
and says her realizes the most important thing in the world is family.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.880
So, he of course take him away from HER family to go to his.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.140
The thought I guess.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.640
*desk smack*

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.600
Jake: Tell me when it's after 6, OK?

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.100
Allie: But, I thought-

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.800
Jake: *shush shush shush*

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.820
Just watch.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:06.700
Allie: Watch what?

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.380
Jake: My family.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.080
NC: (as Jake) Watch

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.260
before I kill them.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.600
They seem pretty happy in there without me, don't they?

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.800
I'll show those bastards.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.500
I'll run them all over with my Porsche.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.700
(normal) So, of course he shows up 1 minute late to prove a very confusing point,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.900
but it does matter

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.940
because the father gives him the car anyway.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.220
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS IDIOT!!!

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.700
Dad: Just a few seconds late, here.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.800
Jake: No, a deal's a deal.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.420
And I'm sure it's gonna take us a bunch more Christmases together to get all the work done.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.040
Dad: Yeah.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.560
30 or 40 at least.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.440
NC: (as Jake) Wow, Wow. 2.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.840
I'll give you 2 years, Dad.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.060
I'm not running for Jesus.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.280
Thus, the always popular

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.680
Christmas Eve parade at night

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.320
in the backstreets of suburbia plays,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.620
and our hero is happy that he did only one nice thing,

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.300
and one standard thing

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.380
he should have been doing for years.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.480
So,

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.020
by this film's definition,

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.120
Christmas Carol would have been a happy ending if they just stopped at

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.640
because that was one nice thing,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.300
AND one standard thing he should have been doing the whole time.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.000
The rest was just filler.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.160
This movie gets Christmas.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.320
*crash*

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.560
*burning*

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.360
*sigh*

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.300
D-Bag: Hey!

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:20.900
NC: Nyah!

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.700
D-Bag: I made it.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.320
I crashed into several buildings, no doubt ruining hundreds of jobs, but I made it.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.980
NC: And that makes it okay, huh?

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.480
D-Bag: Aw, no, I gave another homeless person a $10-

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.820
Chester: Hey, this isn't change!

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.700
D-Bag: So that more than makes up for everything.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.000
NC: Yeah, you know it doesn't.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.900
D-Bag: What does it matter? It's like in the movie:

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.100
NC:*sigh*
it's fun to hate people.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.400
It's downright cool!

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.320
NC: No...

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.200
D-Bag: Come on.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.740
You know you wanna hate me.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.420
NC: I don't WANT to hate you!

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.860
I don't WANT to hate anybody!

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.860
D-Bag: COME ON!!

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.940
I've done every possible thing to piss you off!

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.840
NC: *sigh* Yeah, but-

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.800
D-Bag: I've ruined lives,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.700
hurt your friends,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.760
destroyed jobs.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.720
NC: *sigh* I know, but-

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.820
D-Bag: So why don't you hate me?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.720
NC: Because-

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.420
D-Bag: Come on.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:57.920
NC: (strained) I just-

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.220
D-Bag: What conceivable reason could you have not to hate me?

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.600
NC: BECAUSE IT'S TOO EASY!!

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.680
It's the easiest thing in the world to do!

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.860
Any imbecile can hate!

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.100
IT'S LAZY!!

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.480
You wanna know what takes effort?

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.400
Being nice.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.440
(angrily) It is so hard to be nice to some people!

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.880
(normal) But what am I supposed to do?

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.000
Call you a jerk over and over and over, and hope that one day, you'll wake up and go;

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.380
*head smack* "I'M CURED!

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.020
Yeah, the first million times didn't work,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.140
but the millionth and one,

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.440
that was the magic number!

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.360
That's what got through!"

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.340
How likely is that gonna happen!?

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.040
A-And don't get me wrong,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.620
there's times when we need to be angry.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.560
We need to fight.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.160
If not, we'd be goose-stepping our way to work right now.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.560
But, it should be one of the last options,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.920
not always the first!

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.260
Because when you get angry, you don't think straight,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.200
and people take advantage of that.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.060
And maybe you disagree with me.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.960
Okay, fine.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.780
You know what?

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.680
I'll listen.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.000
I'll listen to what you have to share.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And even though so much of what you say feels wrong,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.300
I'll still keep it in my mind that you could possibly be right,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.600
because if I'm not willing to change for you,

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.880
how am I supposed to expect you to change for me?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.020
I want to be patient enough to see more how we're similar

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.480
rather than fear how we're different.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.500
And you know what? It's gonna be hard.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.500
It's gonna be so hard,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.400
and I'm gonna fail a lot.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.700
Hell, I've failed a lot already,

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.340
but this is the one thing I'm certain the more I do it,

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.640
the better I can get at it.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.060
*inhale*

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.460
I may be a screw-up, but I'm tired of being lazy.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.840
And if you're tired too,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.040
maybe we can...

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.360
work on being screw-ups together.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.160
D-Bag: Nah.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.020
Not today.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.180
NC: Yeah, I figured as much.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.660
You know what, if you need to talk,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.600
we can talk.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.180
D-Bag: I think I should just go home.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.280
*explosion*

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.240
Devil: Ah, my wonderfully disgusting nephew!

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.200
Good to see you.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.920
NC: Huh.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.820
The Devil was his uncle.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.640
Okay, that makes me feel a lot better.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.380
That's like a pebble going up against a (chuckles) tank.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.920
(shouting) Hey, just remember if you ever need to talk!

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.140
D-Bag: Will do.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.600
NC: The important thing about any character were supposed to despise

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.800
is they have to connect to something we relate to.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.000
Whether they're someone were supposed to have no sympathy for

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.400
or someone were supposed to see humanity in,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.680
something has to be recognizable.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.680
Because, it all comes from real places.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.680
And if there's no attempt to understand those real places,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.280
you lose the connection.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.700
This why the jerk in this movie doesn't work.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.400
He's a shell of what other great jerk's were

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.740
except with none of the understanding of what made those characters interesting.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.240
We're always supposed to connect whether were supposed to like the character or not.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.720
If no attempt is made to understand negativity,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.760
you'll never be able to give a direction.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.800
This

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800
is why this goddamn movie

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.700
fails.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.040
Especially at understanding

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.200
the important things

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.200
at Christmas.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.340
*doorbell*

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.020
Chester: Hello, Mr. McCritic.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.880
I would like to speak with you for a moment.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.580
NC: OK.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.800
Chester: I, uh,

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:05.100
wanted to explain why I've been so occupied recently.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.580
NC: Alright.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.760
Chester: COME IN, HONEY!

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.540
I've, uh, met someone,

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.760
Mr. McCritic.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.680
This is D'oh.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.680
D'oh: HELLO!

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.720
Chester: I've, uh, never been in love before, Mr. McCritic.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.360
At least, to a human.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.240
And I

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.720
humbly request time to have to spend with her.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.160
I, uh,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.920
don't know how often I'll get to reviews, but uh-

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.140
NC: Take all the time you need.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.160
Chester: Really?

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.680
D'oh: Really?

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.340
NC: You've always been nice to me and I...

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.580
haven't.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.880
And this clearly means a lot to you, so

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:41.800
ya know.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.360
Just do it when you have the time

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.020
IF you have the time.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.160
D'oh: Oh, good!

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.440
Then, we can give you this.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.720
Chester: That is we were GOING to give you this, regardless of what you said.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.320
NC: Oh, you didn't have to do that.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.220
D'oh: Well, someone gave us quite a bit of money

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.700
so, we had a little extra.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.340
NC: Yeah, but guys you really

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.220
shouldn't have.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.340
D'oh: Do you like it?

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.020
NC: I know I'll love it.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.080
Chester: Oh! That's good!

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:11.700
Well, *clears throat*

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.760
I suppose we, uh better get going.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.480
NC: Well, wait, wait

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.240
can you stay a bit?

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.260
D'oh: Oh. We don't wanna impose or anythin-

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:19.980
NC: Nah, nah.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.780
You two are welcome anytime you want.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.980
Chester: Oh!

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.380
Well, um,

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.340
Thank you.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.300
NC: Alright, let me just finish up this review real fast.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:27.800
Have a seat.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.780
Chester: Oh! OK.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.360
D'oh: Alright.
Chester: That's a real couch.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.940
D'oh: *laughing*

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.800
NC: Nobody know what the future holds.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.760
But, there's 2 things that are guaranteed:

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.960
There's gonna be a lot of anger;

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.920
and there's gonna be a lot of love.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.040
D'oh: You're hat's prettier than mine.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.520
Chester: Oh! I know I like- your hat's pretty cute too.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.080
oh I love it.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.220
Y'know I'm not even a Bears fan.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:47.780
D'oh: Oh!

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.780
Really?
Chester: No, no. try to eat me in the forest.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.760
NC: Use them wisely.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.920
*sad music plays*

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.360
(Happy Holidays)

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.580
Nolan: Why that two-timing HOE!

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.900
Doug: Hey! Doug walker here. Just doing the Charity Shout-out.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.520
This week we are doing Modest Needs.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.860
Founded in 2002,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.100
Modest Needs is a non-profit organization with a unique mission:

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:14.280
