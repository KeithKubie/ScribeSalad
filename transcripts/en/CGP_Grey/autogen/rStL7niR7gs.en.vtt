00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 Would you like to rule? Do you see problems in your country and know how to fix it? 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.820
 Because you had the power to do this. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.860
 Well, you've come to the right place. 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.480
 But before we begin this lecture on political power, ask yourself why rulers do not look at things as clear as you ... 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.880
 ... on the contrary, behave in a manner, selfish, self-conscious and short-term? 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.520
 Are they stupid ... the most powerful people in the world? 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.440
 Or is it something else? 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.720
 The throne seems omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.120
 Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 Accept this or go back now before discussing the rules for the ruler. 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.800
 * gloomy music * 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.360
 As bright as the rays of any sunny king: No one rules alone. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.800
 A king can not build a street alone, can not enforce the law alone and can not protect the state alone. 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.400
 The power of a king is not to act, but to do others act on his behalf, using the treasure in his ark. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.960
 The king needs an army and someone to run. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.720
 Treasure and someone to collect. 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.280
 Law and Someone to Ensure Its Implementation. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.260
 Individuals needing to do these things are the keys to power. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.520
 All the changes you want to do are just thoughts in your head if the keys do not apply your commands. 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.080
 In a dictatorship, where power is right, the number of power cords is small, ... 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.520
 ... maybe just a dozen generals, bureaucrats and regional leaders. 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
 Move them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but ... 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 ... never forget: burn them and they will replace you. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.400
 Every country lies in a spectator ranging from those in which the ruler is called for only a few key supporters, in those who need more ... 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 ... this foundation of power is why states are different. 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.400
 But many keys or less, the rules are the same: 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.280
 First, take the key supporters on your side. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.840
 With them, you have the power to act; you have everything. Without them, you have nothing. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.160
 Now to keep these keys of power, the second rule is: 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 Check the treasure 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.920
 You need to make sure that all the treasury is gathered and distributed to you - for all the effort you have made 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.840
 - and keys to save your position 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.120
 This is your job as a ruler: to discover the best way to gather and distribute resources, 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.640
 ... so as not to rupture the bed of letters on which the thrust is supported. 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 Now you, a loving aspiring dictator, may have the desire to help the people, ... 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.720
 ... but your treasury control is one that draws rivals, so you have to keep the keys faithful. 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.320
 But there is only a limited amount of treasure in your arena, a limited amount of treasury that your kingdom produces. 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.880
 So be careful: every small amount you spend for the people is a treasure not spent on loyalty. 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.000
 So, making the right genes, spurring the wealth of a state to the citizens of the state, ... 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.440
 ... you are your rivals a tool to take power. 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.240
 The treasure trove in the streets, in universities and hospitals, is a treasure that a rival could promise the key supporters if they would turn away. 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.120
 The loving dictators can spend their share on the citizens, but the keys need to get their rewards ... 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.200
 because * even if * you have gathered faithful and angelic supporters, they have the same problem, just one level below ... 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.960
 Being a power key is in itself a power position. 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:41.240
 And they are guarded by rivals from below or from above: so the treasure they take will spend it to preserve their position. 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.760
 Loyalties and fools can stand by your side in any situation, ... 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:55.240
 ... but smart supporters will always look at the balance of power, ready to change loyalty if you look like a lost candidate in a mobile alliance network. 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.920
 In countries where the celsat are packed, so big bonuses ... 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.680
 ... and where violence rules, the most ruthless gathering; and the angels who do good are lost against the devils who do not. 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:14.440
 So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty to dictatorial organizations of all kinds is all. 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.280
 For rulers at least. 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.200
 So, the exposed dictatorship: 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.400
 A king who needs a royal court to collect the treasure, to keep the courtyard loyal and to continue the treasury collection. 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.080
 This is the self-supporting core of power, everything beyond it is secondary. 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.560
 A king with many key supporters has real problems: 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.840
 not just spending, but also their competitive needs and rivalry are difficult to balance, ... 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.560
 ... the more complicated the social and financial networks between them, the more likely there is a rival to shift a critical mass. 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 The more supporters of the key have an average king, the shorter his rule. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.840
 What brings us to the third rule for the rulers. 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.120
 Minimize key supporters 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.480
 If a key in your yard becomes unnecessary and your skills too, you must debit it. 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.000
 After a successful coup, the new dictator will cleanse some of those who helped him come to power, ... 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.480
 ... as well as cooperating with the support of the previous dictator - which from the outside looks like a terrible idea. 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.240
 Why to abandon your revolutionary friends? 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.800
 Are not they a threat to the old dictator's support? 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.160
 But the keys needed to gain power are not the same as they need to keep it. 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:38.520
 To pay someone who was necessary in the past, but futile now is the same as spending money on citizens: treasure worn for irrelevant. 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.400
 By definition, a dictator taking a coup has promised more treasure to those who take his side. 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 The size of the ark has not changed, so the treasure should be shared with few. 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:00.720
 A dictator who moves the right keys, takes control of the treasury, shortens unnecessary expenses and kills the useless keys, will have a long and successful career. 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.520
 Seeing the structure to be revealed, you may be excited to start and control a site for your own good and your friends. 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:17.440
 ... or you may be exhausted, wanting to do well, but seeing the structural difficulties now return to democracy for salvation. 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.840
 So let's discuss the rulers as representatives. 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.960
 You can still have great dreams of utopia you want to build, but: no one rules alone. 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.800
 And never less than in democracy. 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 Presidents and prime ministers should negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa. 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.440
 And they all have their key backers to manage. 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.320
 In a well-designed democracy, power is fragmented among many members and taken not by force, but in words, ... 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.160
 ... Which means you have to convince thousands or millions of citizens, even if you like on the polling day, ... 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.120
 ... at least you like more than the other alternative. 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.160
 With so many voters and such fragmented power it is impossible to become a dictator ... 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.560
 ..., follow these rules and buy loyalty. Or is it not? 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.560
 Of course not. 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.240
 Do not think citizens as individuals with their individual desires but as divided into blocks: 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.520
 ... Older people, homeowners, business owners, or the poor. Blocks you can reward as a group. 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.760
 Democracies have exceptionally complicated tax codes and laws, not by chance, but as rewards 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.240
 for the blocks that raise and hold the representatives in power: 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.280
 agricultural subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with food for which a nation needs ... 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.000
 ... But entirely with the importance of the bloc's agricultural vote. 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.400
 Countries where farmers' votes do not affect the election, do not have agricultural subsidies. 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.920
 If a bloc, as a new citizen, can not vote, then there is no need to divert rewards to them. 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.200
 Even if they are large in number, they are irreversible to gain power. 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.960
 This is good news for you: a little block to win and anyway, the treasure should come from somewhere ... 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:10.120
 If you want long years in the office, the three rule is your friend in a democracy just as much as dictatorship. 

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.200
 You can not eliminate those who do not vote for you, but there are a lot you can do. 

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.480
 Once you are in power, make it easier for your party blocks to vote and make it harder for others. 

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.800
 Create voting systems that reduce the number of blocks you need to win as many rivals as you can ... 

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.080
 ... really very useful. 

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.520
 Put the boundaries of the election to predetermine the outcome for you and your friends, ... 

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.680
 ... And do the party's default with Byzantine rules to determine which blocks * can * vote. 

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.880
 Combine the above methods for even more pronounced power extension. 

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.400
 When the satisfaction level can not be lower, but the re-rate may not be higher, ... 

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.880
 ... you will know that you have achieved. 

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.760
 Now, quite with the opinion of the citizens. 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.240
 Even in a democracy there are individual supporters with more influence 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.360
 ... who you need on your side because your money, influence, or favors hold you in power. 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.280
 So you can promise to give it straight to the treasure as a dictator would do ... 

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.320
 ... You can create opportunities for their investments, adopt laws they have written, ... 

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.240
 ... or allow them to leave the prison freely. 

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.640
 Not a full cart with gold at their door but a contract for their business. 

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.600
 You as a ruler have the way to build, store computers or rebuild buildings. 

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.040
 No one rules alone, ultimately. 

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.120
 Or you can get the moral path, and ignore the big keys. 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.760
 But you will fight against those who have not done so. Good luck with that. 

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.080
 Corruption is not a kind of crime, in contrast to a power tool, ... 

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.160
 ... In democracy and dictatorship, but more on this at another time. 

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.200
 So, please favor, move the key blocks and you will get the power, ... 

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.040
 ... to rule with actions that seem contradictory and thick for those who do not understand the game - 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.520
 to privately support the industry you have denounced publicly, ... 

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.600
 ... Or to adopt laws that hurt a block that voted you. 

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.040
 But your job is not to have a stable and understandable policy, ... 

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.000
 ... But balance the interests of your power keys, big and small. 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.960
 That's how you stand on duty. 

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.200
 Now with all this headache to being a representative, you may wonder, ... 

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.200
 Looking at three rules, why can not you avoid all this building blocks and the exchange of favors ... 

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.080
 ... and just corrupt the army to take power? 

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.600
 We must finally return: taxes and insurrections. 

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:36.760
 You need to understand the rule two and how the treasure is collected and used to hold a unified place. 

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.800
 If we put the state tax rates in the graph against the number of key supporters that the ruler needs, ... 

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.360
 ... There is a clear relationship. More democracy, lower taxes. \ 

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.600
 If you are in a comfortable democracy, you will perceive this, ... 

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.440
 ... but your co-citizens who do not earn enough do not pay their income tax and even receive compensation ... 

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.600
 ... Taking the * average * tax rate down. In dictatorships, this does not happen. 

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.680
 Dictatorships often abandon indirect taxes in favor of getting wealth straight. 

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.400
 It is common for a dictator to force farmers to sell their products for a bit, ... 

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.120
 ... then turn and sell them to the free market, 

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.440
 ... keeping the difference as an equivalent to an exceptionally high tax. 

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.560
 So taxes on democracy are low compared to those of dictatorships. 

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.240
 But why do the representatives lower the amount they receive? 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.800
 Well, tax reduction is a thrill of crowds. 

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.920
 Dictators do not need to please the crowds and so they can get a large percentage of their poor citizens to pay for key supporters. 

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.440
 But representatives in democracy can take a smaller percentage ... 

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.920
 from each to pay their key supporters, ... 

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.840
 ... because their educated and free citizens are more productive than the peasants. 

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.880
 For the rulers in a democracy, the more productivity the better. 

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.720
 That is why they build universities, hospitals, roads and guarantee freedom, ... 

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:05.120
 ... Not only by the goodness of their heart, but because it increases the productivity of citizens, ... 

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:13.120
 ... which increases the treasury for their rulers and their key supporters, even if they take a lower percentage. 

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.360
 Democracies are the best place to live that dictatorships, ... 

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.240
 ... Not because representatives are better people, ... 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.960
 ... but because * happens that * their needs are compatible with most of the population. 

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.800
 Things that make the citizens more productive make their lives better. 

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.160
 Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone takes the freeways. 

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.080
 The worst dictators are those that match the interests with the smallest share of citizens, ... 

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.040
 ... those who have the smallest amount of power keys. 

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.160
 That explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common. 

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.920
 Gold, oil, diamonds or the like. 

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.480
 If the wealth of a nation is mainly exported from the earth: this is a terrible place to live ... 

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.160
 ... Because a gold mine can operate with slaves who are dying, and yet produce a lot of wealth. 

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.240
 Oil is more difficult, but fortunately foreign companies can extract and process it without the need for citizen involvement. 

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:18.720
 With citizens outside of this cycle, they can be ignored, while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power are kept loyal. 

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.120
 So we live in a world where the best and smart democracies are sustainable, ... 

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.320
 ... the worst and richest dictatorships are sustainable and in the middle of a revolutionary valley. 

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.400
 Resource-rich dictators construct roads only from ports to rescues and from their palace at the airport, ... 

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.480
 ... and people stay calm not because it is acceptable or that they are afraid, ... 

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:47.840
 ... but because the bitter truth is that: disconnected and hungry illiterates are not revolutionary. 

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:57.280
 Now an average dictator with no resources should, as mentioned before, need to take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers. 

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.160
 So two ways are not enough and he has to maintain some living standards for the citizens. 

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.320
 But keeping the work force somewhat united, somewhat educated and somewhat healthy ... 

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.280
 ... makes them more capable of revolting. 

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.560
 Now, understand: the romantic image of the people by attacking the gates and by knocking down the dictator is mostly just a fantasy. 

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:26.840
 If you have an average dictatorship, people will attack the palace only if the army allows them to take you away ... 

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.720
 ... because you have lost control over your keys and are being replaced. 

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:39.840
 That is why after the "popular revolts" in the average dictatorship, the new ruler is often the same as the oldest, if not the worse. 

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:48.000
 People did not replace the king, the yard replaced the king by using the people's protest to do so. 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.400
 The bridges that a loving dictator wants to build to overcome the valley ... 

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.640
 ... take the treasure from the keys of power and make the citizens capable of revolting, ... 

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.640
 ... often ending with a stricter ruler, loyal to the keys, and less likely to build bridges. 

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.840
 On the other hand, the best democracies are stable not only because the large number of keys ... 

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.240
 ... and their competitive desires that make dictatorial revolts almost impossible to organize, ... 

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.200
 ... but also because the revolt would destroy the wealth that was intended to be taken. 

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.080
 High productivity of citizens themselves. 

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:30.200
 Plus: those who would help the future dictator in a democracy know that he plans to get rid of some keyboards when he gets into power. 

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.320
 This is the meaning of a state coup. 

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.120
 So, potential key supporters need to weigh the probability of survival and potential rewards ... 

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.320
 ... against the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship that helped create. 

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.600
 In a stable democracy, this is a terrible gamble: 

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.720
 maybe you will be too rich, ... 

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.800
 ... but most likely you will be dead and you will have wiped the lives of everybody you know. Mathematics says no. 

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:01.920
 Being in the right arm in a coup is meant to have the resources to secure for yourself and your family what the peasants do not have. 

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.200
 Health care, education, quality of life - these are the things that make the race for fierce power. 

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.320
 But in a democracy most have these things, why not risk it? 

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.600
 So, the more a nation's wealth comes from the productive citizens of the nation, ... 

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.680
 ... the more power is dispersed, and the more the ruler must preserve the quality of life for those citizens. 

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.320
 The less, the less. 

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.240
 Now if a stable democracy becomes too poor, ... 

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.840
 ... or if a source is found that leaves behind the productivity of citizens, ... 

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.720
 ... the chances of this game change, and it is possible for a small group to take power. 

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:48.920
 Because if the present quality of life is terrible, or wealth does not depend on citizens, it is worth risking the coups of the state. 

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.000
 When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons. 

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.960
 Conclusion * Gloomy music * 

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.840
 These rules for rulers explain not only why some people are monstera and others are merciful, ... 

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:07.360
 ... but everything about politics: from war to international aid, political dynasties and corruption. 

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.240
 We can all talk about it all at once. 

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.120
 But for now, you, inspirational ruler, can be tired of the world of politics, ... 

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.360
 ... And you decided to avoid it altogether, but you can not do it because the rulers come in many forms. 

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.520
 Yes, kings, presidents and prime ministers, but also deans, mayors and chiefs. 

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:34.000
 These rules apply to everyone and explain their actions: by CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate ... 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.480
 ... who has to hold his happy board, chairman of the smallest association of house owners, ... 

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.280
 ... who manages votes and expense of membership fee. 

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.080
 You can not avoid the power structures. 

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.480
 You can only turn a blind eye to their understanding, and ... 

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.960
 ... if you ever want the change you dream of, there is a rule that you can not ignore. 

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.080
 Without power you can not influence anything. 

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.680
 You may not like these rules, but surely, you better thrust than someone else. 

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.680
 And who knows, maybe you will be different. 

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.280
 * Gloomy piano music, which slowly disappears * 

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:20.760
 This video and its posterity are mostly based on The Dictator's Handbook by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alistair Smith, ... 

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.120

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.080
 There are many more details and many more examples that I can hope to show in a series of videos.
