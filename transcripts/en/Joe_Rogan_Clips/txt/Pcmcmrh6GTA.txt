Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, I'm, I'm such a sucker for a specialist, whether it's a style vendor, specialists who are striking specialist or Damien Maia specialist. I love watching the guys that are like at the tip of the, the ability in whatever their disciplines, instyle, bender, man, he seems to be getting better every time. Yeah. Yeah. Well for him it was just about avoiding take downs. Like he was so high level as a kickboxer. He's so clever. Like he's, he's like, in my opinion, probably the very best in the sport. It's setting traps. He like gauge you see what you're doing and it'll switch dances and some information. Yeah. It's not, it's not random. And I liked the way he dealt with the take downs. I mean, he knows where he safe and where he's not, you don't see that he's panicking. He's like, yeah, it's got a minute and let this cook a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:44          But I seen him, I seen with this attempt, looks like, I see what this one looks like walking it through. All right, now my party's going to start. Yeah. Here's a guy I talked to, one of his guys he trains with, um, I was referenced some fights in China and uh, it's one of the guys who trained with New Zealand and this guy was telling me so much and show me different things about angles they do and things that they set up in their striking that I had never knew or thought about. And this was before I saw him start fighting in UFC. I, you know, just everybody was aware of him but he hadn't been in the UFC. Yeah. And Man, these guys, these guys are really smart. These, the techniques like this sport is growing so much, you know? Yeah, yeah. That's what I was saying.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Like when you're seeing like really high level super technical strikers like him, like who's a worldclass lobbying as good, he easily could be world champion in many organizations as kickboxer to see him now in the UFC and see guys having to deal with that. It's like, okay, this is like the Anderson fights a great, great example. We know how great Anderson is. Yeah. And it's still look pretty good. Again, style bender. But you could see why style bender was special in that flight. He, I'd like another level of trickery. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean and stuff John Jones is doing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so you can't call him a specialist cause man, he does so many different styles. Right. It's like a, it's really like a Kung Fu movie, right. Where he changed styles. Yeah. Yeah. And then they do they do something. Yeah. Yeah. Well John, such a good kicker too.

Speaker 1:          02:12          I mean that's, that's interesting that he started out as a wrestler. Cause like how, how much of his style now is kicking you. It's a giant part of his game, his utilization, those long ass legs and knees. It's interesting like how, how much time he did. It looks like he's getting information a lot. Right. And then all of a sudden they have them. Then when he shifts gears it's like, okay, I've gotten a lot of information. Here's what to do with it. Yeah. Yeah. He's gonna Fight Tiago Santos, right? Yeah. Yeah. That guy goes for broke. I mean he goes for broke. It's interesting to watch him fight because you want to talk about like a, a wild reckless dude. Like Santos is dangerous. Uh, Jon Jones should and probably will be a heavy favorite, but Santos, he does w he throws some, Hey, make no, no, it's gonna be, it's going to be a, it's a great fight to watch.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Yeah. That guy's going to go out on his shield. No, he and he puts pressure. I think the interesting thing about, uh, well for me with interesting when I watched any of the heavier guys fight is that they really have to understand where they're safe and whether or not that's something that John does really good. How to be in the pocket and the places where he's safe and you know, knowing where he's, yeah, he's the best Everett utilizing his reach. Like no one's ever been better at controlling reach and then never letting a guy reset. When guys try to reset Bam, he kicks him, Bam. He kicks him again. Bam. He kicks him again. He's like, he knows when you're trying to get comfortable, when you're trying to settle in, and that's when he kicks you like ass. Like he senses it. I just started to battering you like you sees like, no, no, no breaks, no brokers, no breaks, no breaks, no breaks. Like the Anthony Smith. What about a man? Um, Max Holloway. Oh Dude, he's the king of no bricks. Max Holloway is no break. Oh, pours it on you. He's just keeps coming. Yeah.
