00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.370
Airplanes are not all that different from
tall blue police boxes… they use psychology,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:12.430
design and research to make you think: it's
totally bigger on the inside!

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.240
Early jet airplanes like this 707 had interiors
designed for comfort, but based on research,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.689
psychology, and design… planes today are
completely different.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.529
We visited Boeing's Customer Experience Center
in Washington state to see how they conceptualize

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.660
a space, that's essentially a flying tube
-- into something more!

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.489
When you're flying in an airplane, one of
the needs you have is really to be quite connected

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.010
to the sky.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.769
So, there's many ways that you can have that
manifest in your designs.

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.719
That's Blake Emery, he's the Director of Differentiation
Strategy for Boeing.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.969
in the airplanes that we're creating now,
we're moving the windows to a different place.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.969
We're making them larger.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:58.969
So now, if you look around this airplane,
as an example, 787 Dreamliner, it doesn't

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.289
really matter where you're sitting, you have
access to a window.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.289
You can look out the window.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.059
Therefore, you have connection to the sky.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.770
Something as simple as reminding people they're
skybound makes people more comfortable -- surprisingly,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.390
even if you're afraid of flying.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.300
A 2005 study done for the European Space Agency,
found living in confined spaces can cause

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.660
strain, unless there's a window…

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:25.800
It's somewhat counterintuitive, but the idea
of having the windows accessible to everyone

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.720
actually can help relieve some of that fear.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.020
Because a lot of that fear is actually related
to the claustrophobic aspect of it.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.710
When Yuri Gagarin became the first man in
space in 1961 his spacecraft -- Vostok 1 had

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.710
a window!

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.740
It turns out, that was one of the most powerful
parts of that flight.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.790
For some reason, humans need to see the outside.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.190
While airplanes can feel small they are actually
quite large.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.520
A Boeing 747, has

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.190
over 31,000 cubic feet (876m3) of space, larger
than the area of a six bedroom house.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.750
Imagine 250 people in a six bedroom house.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.870
It would feel crazy crowded.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.810
To make a space that size feel livable for
hundreds of passengers involves a lot of psychological

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.560
"tricks," as Dr Rachelle Ornan-Stone says...

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.220
A lot of it has to do with perception...

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.870
So something that I've been completely fascinated
by is visual perception, um, so tricks of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.129
the eye, if you will.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.109
Dr. Ornan-Stone works in Cabin Experience
at Boeing; she helps design the parts of the

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.959
plane that people interact with.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.739
So, she's always thinking about how we use
the space in an airplane.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:35.260
we've looked at the correlation between satisfaction
ratings of passengers with the width of the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.260
cabin

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.670
at 50 inches above the floor.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.670
Why 50 inches?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.650
Because when you're seated in an airplane,
your eye line is about 50 inches from the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
floor.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.249
So, the engineers made that, the widest part
of the airplane's cabin.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:51.659
We also use light as a really interesting
way of drawing the eye to the locations that

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.540
we want people to, to look at.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.359
we think about all these subtle ways to affect
emotion.everyone appreciates a change of scenery

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.609
once in awhile and when you're on a really
long flight, um, to match lighting to the

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.319
activity that's going on is really important
and it marks parts of the journey for the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:47.030
passengers as well.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.219
When you enter a confined space like an airplane
cabin, engineers and designers use light and

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.730
structure to draw the eye upward.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.629
But that's not all the lighting is for…they
can actually make these colors do anything.

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.680
Now, if an airline wants to do something different
or something wild, or have rainbows or have,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.930
you know, crazy light shows, or something
like that, uh, that's fine too.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.240
But you take something, you know, dynamic
like an Aurora Borealis, okay, I mean that's

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.489
something that's moving, it's beautiful, um,
and at the same time, it's still sky.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.740
And these are just a few of their tricks.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.340
See those indentations around the windows?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.330
They draw the eye toward the window, so you
can see outside, it psychologically makes

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
your brain feel the space is larger.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.150
They even designed the overhead bins to move
up and get out of the way adding to the visual

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.150
space…

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.030
You have all the stuff up and out of the way
and you have this beautiful light that draws

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.020
your eye up and, and above.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.140
We know that from perceptual research, a well-lit
interior always looks more spacious.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.390
As airplanes get more efficient and can stay
in the air longer, it's important to make

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.760
the airplane feel more comfortable.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.470
Even making see-through curtains and barriers
can help you feel like you're in a bigger

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.470
space.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.480
I love it when science is truly practical.
