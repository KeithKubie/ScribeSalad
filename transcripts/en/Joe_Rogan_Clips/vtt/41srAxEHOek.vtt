1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
They just said that,
but I mean,
how many rape jokes,
like overall,
do you have

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.890
many times I say the rape or is it no bits.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
<v 0>I mean really just that one raped.
It's with long bit though.</v>

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.270
So it's a lot of jokes within it and I'm being raped in the joke most of the

6
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:20.790
time.
Okay.
So that's,
you know,

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.620
think that's why a guy being it helps.
But I,
you know,
I don't want,

8
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.680
I don't want to ruin the bid either,
but I think you have to.
Um,
I,

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.680
I respect the fact that people can be triggered,

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.740
but it's a very strange thing to me because for me,

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm always trying to find something really funny from this dark shit,
right?

12
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.620
Whether it's a personal experience or whatever it is.

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.220
And the way we're looking at as comics is we're trying to find something really

14
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.040
positive out of something really shitty.
And then you have like a movie,

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.790
which is just,
there may be so fucked up seem,
there's nothing.
It's,
I mean,
look,

16
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.430
it's,
it's a positive piece of content.
Tag it to one person talking.
Yeah.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
It's a scene.
You're watching people act out a scene.
You're right.

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.260
There's something very personal about one person talking.
That's why this is,

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.123
I mean it's not,

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.700
this is how some people would look at it like you should talk about things that

21
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.370
you really care about while you're doing that because you only have a certain

22
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.330
amount of time to do it,

23
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.863
<v 1>you know?</v>

24
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.130
<v 0>And some sometimes,
yeah,</v>

25
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.370
sometimes sometimes you,
you have a bit,
it's just not worth it.
You know,

26
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.700
like the way people react to it,
just like,
yeah.
Even though you have a point,

27
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.160
it's like even working this bit out,
people are getting so upset.

28
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.190
It's almost not worth it.
No,
it has to be a net positive.

29
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.110
The crowd has to be laughing,
so there's no,
you know,
I'm okay.

30
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.840
I will defend somebody.
Right.
To tell a shitty joke.
You know what I'm saying?

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.740
But at the same time,

32
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:44.910
I understand if as a performer you have to gauge the audience and put your

33
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.250
finger in the air and go,
okay,
which way is the wind blowing right now?

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.880
The reality is you can't say things you used to say.

35
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.150
You can't say faggot onstage anymore in a crowd in New York or la.

36
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.460
You can't say that word.
The crowd will tighten up and shut down.

37
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.120
You'll ruin the rest of whatever that joke is.
So it's,
it's obviously,

38
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:04.350
I haven't seen Dia's recently.
Maybe they say pack a lunch.

39
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.180
Oh,
he's awesome.
He'll say whatever he wants.
But I got a point.
I,
you know,

40
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.400
I have a joke about,
you know,
my,
uh,

41
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.300
my dog and I used to say my faggot dog because he's looking at another male dogs

42
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.370
asshole on the joke.
And uh,

43
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.480
and people would shut down at that word and it's really two months with the New

44
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.450
York in La.
That's where the biggest fat gets live.
Um,

45
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.330
the rest of the country is cool.
If you go anywhere else,

46
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:30.300
they don't really give a shit about where it's like that.
But in New York and La,

47
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.390
it's become a particularly hard thing to,
you know,

48
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:35.640
there's certain words and certain things.
It's not even the content necessarily,

49
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:38.610
it's just those words that sort of set people's sensors off.
Well,

50
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.160
there's always going to be a bunch of words like that.

51
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.210
What's really interesting is what does happen when you stop people from saying

52
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.950
it,
cause it's Kinda counterintuitive because those words become these forbidden

53
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.190
words.
Just give him more power.
They,

54
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.260
there's so much more power if you don't send,
I don't just,

55
00:02:55.261 --> 00:03:00.220
I just don't think you ever get to tell people that you can't say certain words.

56
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.710
They used to be able to say all the time,
you know,

57
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.190
I mean the idea behind those words is still the same.

58
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.760
Like if you say to someone you shouldn't say retarded anymore,

59
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.110
even though that used to be like a term that they would use for things being

60
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.340
slower,
like their growth being slower,
their growth was retarded.

61
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.210
But now if you even use it as a technical term,
like in,

62
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:25.330
in the growth was retarded.
People get upset at you don't use that anymore.

63
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.310
Now that's a forbidden sound.
Even if it doesn't mean what they think it means.

64
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.670
We're talking about a person with down syndrome.

65
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.500
They don't like hearing the r word.
The yeah.
You,

66
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.810
you talked about in your special,
I thought it was a great bed where you're like,

67
00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:39.270
just these sounds from your face,
like what do we,
what are we doing?
You know,

68
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:42.260
it's just the,
you're making these different sounds with your mouth,
so you're,

69
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.330
yeah.
It's just sounds,
well,
it's a,

70
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.340
it's a buy product of speech being shitty way to really clearly convey intent.

71
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.300
And that's why when someone is good at speaking their mind,
we kind of get,
uh,

72
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.320
we get a real sense of,
we enjoy it.
Someone's good at speaking their mind,

73
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.410
but if someone's sucks at speaking their mind,
you know,
if they're,

74
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:05.840
if they're they're clunky at it,
then it's not enjoyable.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I agree.

75
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.733
Um,

76
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.340
and there's too many people that there's no barrier of entry and we're exposed

77
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:16.580
to a lot of horseshit very quickly now.
Whereas like,
I think back in the day,

78
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.940
comedians had time to grow in a club.
You know,
you look at Bob Saget,
right?

79
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:24.941
Bob Saget was like a dirty fucking filthy comic who ended up getting on the

80
00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:29.720
cleanest television show ever.
Right.
The Dad,
you know,
Danny Tanner was,

81
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.170
you know,
but then you,
if there was cell phones out back then,

82
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:34.860
he would have never gotten that Gig.
Well,

83
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:38.200
I think he stopped doing standup for a long time because that too,
right?
Yeah.

84
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.740
I think that'll take,
you didn't stand up while he was doing that show.

85
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.380
I might be wrong,
but if he did do it,
maybe did let go and abridged,
uh,

86
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.420
you know,
uh,
PG 13 version or something.
Yeah.

87
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.780
You know,
I don't know,
man.
It's,
is it worth it?

88
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.220
He knows it works.
It censoring telling me,

89
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.780
I think one day it seems like the more time goes on,

90
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.990
the more words they're sneaking into network television.

91
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.780
You hear like shit every now and then I think,

92
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.800
I think you're allowed to say shit and asshole on a network show now.
Yeah.

93
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.500
There was like a big episode once on something.

94
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.900
You say shit in my asshole though.
No,
you can't say that.
Yeah.
It's just too,

95
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.710
you can call somebody a dick,
but you can refer to your deck.
That's the idea,

96
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:26.310
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You can call someone a pussy.
I think even too,

97
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:29.960
which is weird.
You know that one's on the way out.
Yeah.

98
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.020
That's one that's become a thing where you're feminizing a man and now that's

99
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:36.560
offensive to women and fuck you,
bitch.

100
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.580
Now I'm calling my buddy a pussy and you get to take the offense on that.

101
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.490
That's some crazy woman shit that's actually right there.

102
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:46.160
That's how crazy women are.
It's not how crazy women are.

103
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.990
It's how crazy some women are.
It's like,
like some men are fucking crazy too.

104
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:53.150
You're just dealing with a giant number of people,

105
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.860
but if people find a little thing where they can pick on it and go after it like

106
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:02.710
that.
Yeah.
I Dunno.
I have none.
There's nothing.
There's no,

107
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:03.550
it's very funny to me.

108
00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:08.260
There's no words feminizing that could possibly offend me.

109
00:06:08.261 --> 00:06:09.220
That could ever,
right.
