00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:04.323
- [Voiceover] Let's multiply 40 times 70.

00:00:04.323 --> 00:00:07.240
So 40 times, we have the number 70.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.465
So we could actually list that out,

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:13.876
the number 70, 40 different
times and add it up.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:16.843
But that's clearly a lot
of computations to do.

00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:18.992
And there's gotta be a faster way.

00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:22.343
So another way is to
stick with multiplication,

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:24.661
but see if we can break these numbers up,

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.800
this 40 and this 70, decompose them,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.149
break them up in some way to get numbers

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.324
that might be a little
easier to multiply with.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.974
For me, multiplying by
10 is the easiest number,

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:38.374
because I know the pattern to add a zero.

00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:42.457
So, I'm gonna break up 40
and say, instead of 40,

00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:44.825
four times 10.

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:49.464
Four times 10 and 40 are equivalent.

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:52.194
They're the same thing,
so I can replace the 40

00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:53.944
with a four times 10.

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:57.614
And then for my 70, same thing.

00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:02.095
I can break this up and
write seven times 10.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.771
Seven times 10.

00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.304
So these two expressions, 40 times 70

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:10.661
and four times 10 times seven times 10,

00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:12.150
are equal; they're equivalent.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.836
So they'll have the same solution.

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:17.023
But for me, this one down here is simpler

00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:19.539
to work out because of these times 10s.

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.385
So I'll solve this one, knowing

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:23.900
that I'll get the same
solution as I would have

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.345
for this top expression.

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:30.213
So what we can do is we
can re-order these numbers

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:32.641
in a different order to, again, continue

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.590
making this question
easier for us to solve.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.393
Because in multiplication,
the order doesn't matter.

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:41.481
If we have five times two, for example,

00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.124
that would be the same as two times five.

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:45.420
They're both 10.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.490
Five twos or two fives,
either way, it's 10.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.350
So we can change the order of the numbers

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.104
without changing the answer.

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:55.657
So again, we're going to change
our expression a little bit,

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.132
but what we're not going
to change is the solution.

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:01.954
So I'm gonna put my
one-digit numbers first.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.371
Four times seven.

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:09.839
And then, I'll put the
two-digit numbers, the 10s,

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.506
times 10 and the other times 10.

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:17.424
So we have all the same factors,

00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:20.108
all the same numbers, in
both of these expressions.

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:23.124
They've just been re-ordered.

00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:25.363
And now, I'll solve going across.

00:02:25.363 --> 00:02:27.280
Four times seven is 28.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.123
And now we have 28 times 10,

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:33.873
and times another 10.

00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:37.644
Well, the pattern for
times 10 that we know

00:02:37.644 --> 00:02:42.201
is when we multiply a whole
number like 28 times 10,

00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.113
we will add a zero to the end.

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.475
One zero for that zero in 10,

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:48.975
because 28 times 10 is 28 10s,

00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:51.096
28 10s,

00:02:53.024 --> 00:02:53.857
or 280.

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:57.319
And that multiplied 28 times 10,

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.086
and then if we multiply by this other 10,

00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:01.662
well we have to add another zero.

00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:04.490
Multiplying by 10 adds a zero,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.534
so if we multiply by two
10s, we add two zeros.

00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:11.451
So, 28 times 10 times 10, is 2,800.

00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:17.508
Which means that this
original expression we had,

00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:21.008
40 times 70, also has a solution of 2,800,

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.288
or two thousand, eight hundred.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:28.447
Let's try another example

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.684
where we're multiplying 10s like this.

00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:32.667
Let's try, let's do
something like, let's say,

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.834
maybe 90 times, how about,

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:38.689
30.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:39.689
90 times 30.

00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:44.046
So the first thing I'm gonna
do is break up these numbers

00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:46.703
so that I have 10s, because again, for me

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:50.976
10s are easier to multiply
than numbers like 90 and 30.

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:54.488
So for 90, I'll write nine times 10,

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:57.571
and for 30 I'll write three times 10.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.089
The expressions are equivalent.

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.655
We've just written it in another way.

00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:07.030
And now, I'll re-order these numbers

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.150
to put the one-digit numbers first.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.900
So, nine times three,

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:18.860
and then I'll put the
10s: times 10, times 10.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.660
Because we need to have
all the same numbers,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.583
even if we change the order.

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:24.833
So we have the nine, three,

00:04:26.782 --> 00:04:29.365
the first 10 and the second 10.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.237
And now, finally, we multiply.

00:04:34.237 --> 00:04:36.154
Nine times three is 27.

00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:40.263
27 times 10 will be 27 10s,

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:45.842
or 27 with a zero on the end.

00:04:45.842 --> 00:04:48.592
And 270 times 10 will be 270 10s,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.640
or 270 with a zero on the end.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.982
So going back to the original question,

00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:59.482
90 times 30 is equal to 2,700.

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:06.516
Or two thousand, seven hundred.
