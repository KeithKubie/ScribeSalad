[inaudible].

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 1>I'm on a one day break from touring with Jordan Peterson and joining me in</v>

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:13.191
studio today is a free speech lawyer and the director of the Individual Rights

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.860
Defense Program at the foundation for Individual Rights in education,

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.520
Aka fire are in code.
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.850
That was a wordy intro.

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.770
A lot of freedom stuff in there and that's all the stuff that I like.

8
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:28.740
So I'm looking forward to this same.
So you guys,

9
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:33.741
fire as an organization is one of the few bastions of sanity these days.

10
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.760
Like when I see what you guys are tweeting about and consistently defending the

11
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.300
principles of free speech and free expression and open inquiry,
I'm always like,

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.340
ah,
there are some good guys left.
So first,
uh,

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.290
can you just tell me a little bit about the organization,

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.070
why you guys got started,
how you personally got involved?
Well,

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.600
we got started in 1999,
uh,

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.710
with a professor at Penn and a civil liberties lawyer in Philadelphia who were,

17
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
you know,
they both decided that there were,
uh,
there was a problem,

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.210
there was an epidemic at our colleges and universities of the core individual

19
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:15.810
rights that,
that make up,
you know,
our,
our constitution,

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
if you will.
Um,
as individuals,
as people,
as citizens of the United States,
uh,

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.310
broke being respected on campuses across the,

22
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280
the country back in 99 they nine.
Yeah.

23
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.440
That's interesting because a lot of people say this is just the totally recent

24
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:32.130
phenomenon.
Well,
I think is,
you know,
a lot of it there,

25
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.180
the political correctness movement of the eighties and nineties,
a little bit,

26
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.010
you know,
that might've had something to do with it,

27
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:41.360
but this has been a problem since the free speech movement back at Berkeley.
I,

28
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.070
you know,
long before even the eighties or nineties,
you know,

29
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.860
censorship is an age old problem,
predates the United States of America.
Really?

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.120
Uh,
and as Alan and Harvey,

31
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.910
you know,

32
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.540
went about creating fire and they decided to locate it and like located in

33
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.450
Philadelphia,
which is the birthplace of our nation,

34
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.310
they really got an outpouring of people saying,
Hey,

35
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:10.570
this happened to me too.
Uh,
and they said,
well,
this is,
you know,

36
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.490
this is a problem.
This is an epidemic.
We need to fix it.
And then fire was born,

37
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.620
um,
or,
or lit,
if you will.
And uh,

38
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.920
over the years getting close to 20 now,

39
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.010
crazy enough that has actually just gone up every year more and more people

40
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.830
reach out to fire for help.
Um,
you know,
when I got to fire for the second time,

41
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:37.550
I actually was a legal fellow at fire after I graduated from law school,

42
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.940
before I started in private practice.
Uh,

43
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.980
but when I came back in 2013 getting several hundred case submissions a year,

44
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.650
um,
and now we are getting damn near close to a thousand a year.
Wow.

45
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.720
Credible.
And that's just the stuff that we hear about.

46
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.230
Can only imagine how much other stuff is going on around the country.

47
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:00.580
For people who don't know that we're out there to them.
Uh,
or you know,

48
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.970
people who perhaps go about it themselves.
It's,

49
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.510
it's crazy to think about how much is going on.
Yeah.

50
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.090
So I want to talk about some of those cases and some of the specific work that

51
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.810
you're doing,
but foundation for individual rights in education.

52
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.840
I am a believer right now partly because of Kanye West and because of a lot of

53
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.980
people online right now that the individual is making a comeback,

54
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:28.120
that the idea of the individual versus the collective is actually making a

55
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:31.780
comeback.
Do you have any idea when they came up with the name for fire,

56
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.750
why it was so important to put the individual front and center?

57
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.580
I think it's,
you know,
and I'm speaking,
you know,

58
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.850
out of some level of ignorance because I haven't actually discussed this with

59
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:47.410
either of them personally,
but you know,
if I had to guess,

60
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:51.460
it's because the individual qualities,
the freedom of conscious,

61
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.461
the freedom of speech for things that allow us to participate in society.

62
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.270
We don't get to the collective unless we have the individuals.

63
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.560
One is necessary to have the other because what is a collective other than a

64
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:10.561
group of individuals and consensus is a bunch of individual opinions that

65
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:16.141
throughout the process of winnowing and debating different good ideas and bad

66
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.950
ideas,
we reach a common understanding.
We reach a,
uh,
you know,

67
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.800
in norm for society.
And that's how,

68
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.430
that's why free speech particularly is so important just because that's how we

69
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:30.700
get to the optimal resolution,
the optimal conclusions.

70
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.060
That's how we reach these communal positions is only through our own personal

71
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.380
expressions of what we believe,

72
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.670
which exposes us to criticism or agreement or just flat out discussion with

73
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.420
other people.

74
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.890
So how do you think the ideas of the collective took root so much a college

75
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:49.780
campus then?
Well,

76
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.870
I think there's the given take in society at large that we really go through

77
00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:00.901
every once in a while in terms of thinking about things as individualistic and

78
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.560
then worrying about broader concerns of the community.

79
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.920
And it's not altogether a bad thing.
And I think the college campus,

80
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.690
and it's always been this way,

81
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:14.260
it's a microcosm of what we're experiencing in the broader society.

82
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.560
And I think that's another reason why it's so important to protect individual

83
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:21.310
rights on college campuses,
uh,
because where they fall on college campuses,

84
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:25.750
there are almost certainly short to fall in society writ large.
Yeah.

85
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:28.870
So that actually we discussed this briefly right before the camera's turned on.

86
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.720
That's my concern about this.
When people say,
Oh,
you know,

87
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.680
there isn't a free speech issue on college campuses and even though I keep going

88
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:36.431
to college campuses,

89
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.860
and it's very clear to me that there is a free speech problem there,

90
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.660
that it's not what's going to happen.
It's not just the screaming kids right now.

91
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.690
It's not that it's that these are the people that are going to be in leader ship

92
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.740
positions five,
10 15 years in the future and further than that obviously.

93
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.010
And if those ideas take root because they were able to silence us once they are

94
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.140
the lawmakers,
once they're in charge of public policy,

95
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:08.141
they're not going to be too kind to the people who they were silencing way back

96
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.350
when.
Right?
Yeah.
I mean,
that's really one of the key problems.

97
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:16.010
And it's not even just if they get elected to power,
even if they aren't elected,

98
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.880
uh,
and they don't rise to power and they can impose these views on other people.

99
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.340
These are future citizens,
even if they're not necessarily future leaders.

100
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.920
And then discourse of the nation,
if that is the,

101
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.140
the prevalent feeling in society is going to suffer tremendously as a result if

102
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200
even if they're not in Congress or in the state legislatures,

103
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.420
if 50% of the country's population thinks that we shouldn't be talking about

104
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:45.051
certain things,

105
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:48.920
we're not going to talk about these things and it's going to be a societal

106
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.570
societaly imposed,
if nothing else.

107
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.310
And I think that's incredibly damaging to just about every aspect of our life is

108
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:58.040
as a country.
Yeah.
It's so interesting to me because I know you,

109
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.091
you read about this,

110
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.780
but I was at the University of New Hampshire a couple of weeks ago and you know,

111
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.030
first we were supposed to give a speech on campus.

112
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:09.080
Then about two hours before they announced that they couldn't secure the room,

113
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.030
that they felt there were too many threats.

114
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.480
So there were about 200 or 250 people is supposed to be in the room.

115
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:17.060
They moved us to the hockey rink,

116
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.720
which seats 7,500 people.

117
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.060
So I stood in front of a little,
you know,

118
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.700
backdrop and I talked to about 200 people.

119
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:29.720
It was about 150 people that were there to listen and be respectful and all that

120
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:32.270
stuff.
And then they were about probably about 50 protesters roughly.

121
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.160
Those are the rough numbers.
Um,
but the desire just to shout down,

122
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.750
to use noise makers to scream to chant like robots,

123
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:45.650
they love robotic chance,
all of these things.
And I kept saying to them,
guys,

124
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.120
do you have any direct questions?

125
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.650
Is there something that I've said that you disagree with or is there something

126
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.900
you directly like to ask me and time and time again,

127
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.170
the answer was no and I don't know how you break them out of that other than

128
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:03.200
keep having these conversations and hope that the refugees make it to us and

129
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:04.220
that's a common problem.

130
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:09.110
I think it really comes down to ideological purity that people are after the

131
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:12.310
idea that if I disagree with you on something,

132
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.750
whether it's small or even fundamental,
if I disagree,

133
00:08:15.751 --> 00:08:17.390
I disagree with you on that one thing.

134
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:22.391
That means nothing that you have to say could possibly be a value to me and that

135
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:27.830
is completely false.
You couldn't be farther from the truth.

136
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.710
We can learn so much from the people we disagree with the most.

137
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.770
Even if I disagreed with you on absolutely everything,

138
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.450
it would still be incredibly valuable for me to talk to you if only because that

139
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:43.220
helps me sharpen and really understand why I believe what I believe in and

140
00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:47.150
people really discount the importance of understanding why you believe
something.

141
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.760
Yeah.
So the argument that I've been making for a while is that,

142
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:51.230
and I do think right now,

143
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:54.200
at least in 2018 and this is more of a problem on the left,

144
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.860
that they've owned the ideas and the narrative and the college campus discussion

145
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.450
and academia and media and all that.

146
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.170
They've owned that for so long that the reason these kids end up be,

147
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:07.890
are these students ended up being so hysterical is because they never hear a

148
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:08.880
counter ideas.

149
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.260
So then you get a pretty moderate guy who's arguing about liberty and freedom

150
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.090
for everybody and live and let live.

151
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.450
And that actually offends them because they never hear anything outside of what

152
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.180
they're being taught.
That goes to the academic part,
I think mostly.
Well,

153
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:28.650
I think we're doing a really crappy job of educating students before they get to

154
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:33.180
college about why free speech and our other rights are important.

155
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.910
Civics education is clearly in the toilet right now.
Uh,

156
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.500
and it's bizarre to me.
I grew up in Skokie,
Illinois,

157
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.910
one of the sites,
one of the most famous free speech cases,
you know,

158
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:47.910
in recent history.
Yeah.
Can you lay it out for those that don't know this,

159
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.670
the story in the 70s,
the American,

160
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.710
the American Socialist Party,
that Nationalist Party,
the Illinois Nazis,

161
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:59.190
if you'd ask the blues brothers wanted to march through Skokie,
Illinois,

162
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:02.790
which outside of New York had the largest concentration of Holocaust survivors

163
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:07.420
in the United States.
Uh,
and Skokie tried to stop them.
And uh,

164
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.640
they sued with the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.

165
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.160
And it went to,
well,

166
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.280
both the Supreme Court of Illinois on the Supreme Court in the United States.

167
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.740
And the Nazis had the right to March and the courts held so,

168
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:27.660
and there were threats of violence and disruption and all,
you know,

169
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.840
people out crying as to how this could be allowed.

170
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.270
But ultimately the Nazis had the first amendment right to march through Skokie.

171
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:39.780
And I grew up learning about that case from a very young age.

172
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:42.510
I can't tell you how many times I saw the movie they made about it.

173
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.030
And it really,

174
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.630
it got me thinking at a young age about why this is important,

175
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:52.710
how I think about it.
And I can't tell you that as a young child,

176
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.980
I completely agree that the Nazi should have a right to march.

177
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.870
When I was that young,

178
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:02.820
I part of me didn't grasp the overarching fundamental importance of free speech,

179
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.420
but I was thinking about it at least and I got there and I get the feeling that

180
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:10.860
sometimes we're not doing enough to make our students think about why it's

181
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:11.650
important.

182
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.390
It's such an important case and I'm glad you mentioned it because it goes really

183
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:19.740
to the heart of this that the people that lived in Skokie,
as you said,

184
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:23.130
the second largest amount of Holocaust survivors in the country,

185
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.460
these people literally survived a genocide.

186
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.220
Probably virtually all of them lost.

187
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.370
Some of them probably lost all of their family members and friends and all of

188
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:33.204
that,

189
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.480
and yet I would sit here as someone that lost Holocaust survivors on both sides

190
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:39.000
of my family and tell you it was the right decision.

191
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.360
You can't let the Nazis are the white supremacist or whatever they are.

192
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.430
You can't let them start ransacking property.

193
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:47.730
You can't let them start killing people or harming people,
but letting,

194
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.840
letting them march,
that's the exchange of free speech and it's kind of Shitty,

195
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:54.070
but you got to defend when it's hard to defend,

196
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.710
but you have to find it when it's hard to,

197
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.700
to defend because otherwise there's not going to be around to defend with.

198
00:11:59.701 --> 00:12:01.480
It's easy to defend.
Uh,
you know,

199
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.730
once you start creating exceptions and encroaching,
uh,
there's no end to it.

200
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:10.630
And you know,
we've kind of seen even in other countries,
uh,

201
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.700
that once the encroachments start,
it's always,
well,

202
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.240
we make that exception and just this one other small exception.

203
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.560
And then there's inevitably and another one and another one and all for perhaps

204
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.400
even,
you know,
good reasons in terms of,
you know,

205
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:31.900
ideals and the goals are,
are laudable.
Perhaps fight every show.

206
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.160
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Getting tired.

207
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.510
It's you and me both.
Yeah.
But you know,

208
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.290
it's really practically speaking,
it's inevitable.
Yeah.

209
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.320
How much of this is just a confusion as to what the First Amendment is?

210
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:50.320
That's also what I've started to realize because when I've gone on college

211
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.720
campuses and the protesters are there and I always say it,

212
00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:55.750
I welcome peaceful protests.
I completely welcome,

213
00:12:55.751 --> 00:12:59.170
I welcome the exchange of ideas,
the questions,
all of that.
But when,

214
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.610
when they're screaming about certain things,

215
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.660
I think there's just a disconnect as to what I think too.
Legal things.

216
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.661
I think what the First Amendment is and what hate speech is is or isn't a so can

217
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.510
you talk about that a little bit?
Yeah.
I,

218
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.730
if I had to have to hear one more person,
whether it be student,
uh,

219
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.200
Internet commenter,

220
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.120
even journalists are faculty members sometimes say hate speech is not free

221
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:25.050
speech.
I'm going to lose it.
Okay.
So let's do,
let's do that one first.
Cause I,

222
00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:28.030
I really,
I mean this'll be maybe what we promote for this episode,

223
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:32.350
but I really want people to understand this.
Why is hate speech free speech?

224
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.760
Well on a legal level,
hate speech is free speech because,
uh,

225
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.660
the first amendment and the courts have said nothing about free or hate speech

226
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:42.550
being unprotected by the first amendment.

227
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:46.690
Speech is protected by the First Amendment unless it falls under one of the very

228
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:50.060
few existing categories of unprotected speech.
Yeah.
What are,

229
00:13:50.061 --> 00:13:50.980
what are those categories?

230
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.220
There's incitement to imminent lawless action on these all have very high bars,

231
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.870
right?
True threats and intimidation.
Uh,

232
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.130
you can be sued for libel or slander.
Defamation is,

233
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:07.000
they're known that some states I think actually still have criminal statutes on

234
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:11.800
the book books,
but they're rarely enforced fraud obscenity,

235
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:15.280
which people often confuse with mere profanity or lewdness,

236
00:14:15.281 --> 00:14:18.370
but they are not the same thing by any stretch of the imagination.

237
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.380
What's the difference on those two?
Well,

238
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.740
profanity and lewdness are generally protected by the first amendment.

239
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:26.980
Obscenity is a very high bar.

240
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:30.010
It's speech that has to be our expression,

241
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.990
I should say more broadly than just speech.
Uh,

242
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.620
that has to appeal to the [inaudible] interest,

243
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:38.170
which is an inordinate fascination with sex,

244
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.800
describe or depict sex in a patently offensive way.

245
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.070
And have no social,
political,

246
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:50.071
literary or artistic value whatsoever and to get down in the,

247
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:54.260
in the mud.
Uh,
have you ever heard of crushed videos?

248
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.460
I feel like I have,
but I'm honestly not sure when that is.

249
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.520
They are videos of women wearing stilettos crushing small animals like hamsters

250
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:08.570
and journals to death and people apparently get off on that.
Yeah.

251
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.880
I don't pretend to understand it.

252
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.230
Even that is not wholly unprotected by the obscenity exception to the first

253
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:19.300
amendment.

254
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.330
That that's particularly interesting case I suppose because the idea of it

255
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.320
talking about it seems like a,
I would have no problem with that,

256
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:30.740
but the action itself,
probably there's some legal reasons,
right?
Like killing it,

257
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:34.400
killing animals.
There's some law I guess of Tri State Law,
right.

258
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.750
But if you have this,
ah,
pornography can call it that.
I just,

259
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:41.060
I have a hard time getting it.
Yeah.
Um,

260
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.360
if you have it in you to possess it,

261
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.190
you can't be prosecuted for possessing that obscene material.

262
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.600
It's an interesting distinction that the act is the crime or the act is what is

263
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:54.111
illegal,

264
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:58.580
not the depiction depiction or the disseminating of the information or that sort

265
00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.450
of thing.
Right.
Uh,

266
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.220
child pornography obviously not protected by the First Amendment,
uh,
you know,
but

267
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.650
there's,
well,
there's the one additional wrinkle of the fighting words doctrine,

268
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:14.100
although there's considerable doubt that it remains a viable,
uh,

269
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.010
exception to the first amendment,

270
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:21.080
but it really gets brought up a lot in the hate speech debate.

271
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.320
Um,
to the extent it still exists,

272
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.330
it's limited to face to face interactions where say I say something to you that

273
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:34.331
is so insanely abusive that you are likely to punch me in the face without

274
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:40.121
thinking twice about it instead of taking a deep breath and either ignoring me

275
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:44.930
or coming back at me and there's reasons why it's fallen into disuse.

276
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.010
And it's worth wild to note that the Supreme Court has upheld a fighting words,

277
00:16:49.011 --> 00:16:52.940
convictions since the case in the forties when it created the fighting words,

278
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:56.900
et Cetera.
It's interesting just how far it's fallen into disuse.
Uh,

279
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.620
it incentivizes punching people in the face.
Right.

280
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.270
It creates an easy way to sensor the people that you disagree with.
And it would,

281
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:10.271
I assume be some level of a subjective piece of information as to what you think

282
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.370
is offensive at the highest order is different perhaps than what I think or

283
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.770
exactly what some of these other people,

284
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.640
it creates terrible incentives and it would basically lead to an

285
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:24.170
institutionalized heckler's veto.
Uh,
so it's really not tenable.
Yeah.
So on the,

286
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.550
on the hate speech front,

287
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:28.640
which it's clear what the Supreme Court has said about hate speech,

288
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.730
you're allowed to do it with,
with these exceptions that you've just laid out,

289
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:33.220
you're allowed to see me in things.
What I,

290
00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:37.220
what I'm realizing on college campuses is they really don't like that.

291
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.110
The people,
the set of people that we're talking about,

292
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:42.410
they really don't like that.
So like they think if you like,

293
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.730
it's just the fact you are allowed to say bad things.
You can say,

294
00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:47.840
I hate all the Jews.

295
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:51.840
You can say I hate all the people or all the gays or whatever.
You can say it.

296
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.390
You can't cause direct call to violence.

297
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:58.440
But what I think they think is that if you keep saying those things,

298
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.080
I hate these people that it's going to incite violence.

299
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.730
Now my counter argument would be no,

300
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.180
you have to use free speech to counter those bad ideas.

301
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:09.390
That's the whole purpose of free speech.
But do you see that,

302
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:13.260
that that seems to be the slope that they consistently are on that if we allow

303
00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:15.480
you to say,
I hate these people,

304
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.730
which is bigoted and prejudice and all those things,

305
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:20.580
but it's afforded to us by the bill of rights,

306
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.130
they think that that's going to get you to violence.

307
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.470
How do you combat that notion if you agree with the premise?

308
00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.640
Well that is something that we tend to hear a lot in the first amendment world

309
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:32.460
to have.
And you know,
first of all,

310
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.530
generally speaking in this country,
we punish the people who do the bad acts.

311
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.600
If I watch your show and I get some Kooky idea and go off and you know,

312
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.040
commit some crime,

313
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.750
we're not going to throw you in jail because I'm an idiot and took a terrible

314
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:51.450
idea that you didn't even intend me to take right now.
It might be,

315
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:54.660
it might be different though if I was up here saying you should violently attack

316
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:56.700
these people,
et cetera.
It's right.
Exactly.

317
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.140
That's why the incitement standard is so high.
Yes.

318
00:18:59.141 --> 00:19:04.141
Has to be likely to insight and intended to incite immediate criminal action.

319
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.420
So if I tell you,
hey,
you know,
it'd be fun to burn down a building,

320
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:12.780
but you're not likely to do it,
you're going to take it as a joke.

321
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.700
I probably haven't committed any kind of,
uh,
you know,
unlawful expression.

322
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.930
If I know you're a pyromaniac and I say,
Hey Dave,
let's go burn down a building.

323
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.200
Right?
I might find myself in a very different situation,

324
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.990
sort of left that phase at about eight years old.
But,
um,
but you know,

325
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.250
I think that
if you take a look,

326
00:19:33.251 --> 00:19:36.340
one of my colleagues actually wrote a piece for Colette.
Uh,

327
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.520
not so long ago about the Rwandan genocide and looking over the claims that the

328
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:46.150
radio broadcasts actually,
you know,
caused more violence.

329
00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:50.920
And what it turns out is that the radio broadcasts first of all,

330
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.970
only incited people who were already predisposed and who already felt that way.

331
00:19:59.411 --> 00:20:03.580
And it made it marginally easier for them to find people and you know,

332
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.670
be taught how to do certain things,

333
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:12.060
but it was relatively ineffective as it turns out in convincing people who

334
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.290
weren't already in a murderous rage to go out and commit violence.

335
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.470
Uh,
and so,
you know,

336
00:20:20.471 --> 00:20:25.471
I think that the fear that allowing these views to be aired is going to

337
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.600
indisputably cause actual violence is somewhat overblown.

338
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.820
Now there's a second part to it,

339
00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:38.821
which is that people expressing these views might lead to more people adopting

340
00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:44.230
those views and having prejudice views.
Is that possible?

341
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.920
Absolutely.
Right.
So that's the part I was referenced,

342
00:20:46.921 --> 00:20:51.921
but kind of the point is that we put those use out there so we can fight them.

343
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.040
If we don't have them in public and we can't fight them,

344
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.200
they're still going to spread nothing.
No idea.
Ever went away because we said,

345
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.650
you can't say that.
It just doesn't work like that.

346
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.920
How does the heckler's veto fit into all of this?

347
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:13.490
Because one of the things that I again see on college campuses is when hecklers

348
00:21:13.491 --> 00:21:16.600
starts screaming at you and then you say,
just a second,
you know,

349
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:20.710
if I'll get to your question or calm down or whatever you might say,

350
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.280
um,
they'll say,
well,
I have a right to free speech too.

351
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.190
They try to flip it on you to make you look like a hypocrite.

352
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.980
That actually kind of kind of gets me,

353
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:32.770
but I will give them a little bit of credit.

354
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.830
I think you say a university event and somebody comes in and they chant for 30

355
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:44.581
seconds or they stand up and turn their backs and that's the extent of it.

356
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.030
I think that we should protect that technically.

357
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:51.370
Are they causing a disruption?
Yes,

358
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:55.570
but it's minimal and it's actually maximized the amount of free speech.

359
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:58.990
There has to be some room for very minimal disruption,

360
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.260
but when it gets to the point where they are substantially interfering with the

361
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:06.340
speakers ability to get their message across or the audience's ability to hear

362
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:10.570
them through repeated shouting or noise makers or you know,

363
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:14.800
standing in the front and blocking everyone's views and things like that,

364
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.840
obviously that's a problem.

365
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.520
And last year we just saw a rash of,

366
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.480
of the heckler's vetoes going on and it kind of all started with Berkeley and

367
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:30.481
Milo Yiannopoulos when they protestors were successful in shutting down the

368
00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:35.881
event through of what had bef before that been unfathomable on a college campus

369
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:37.600
for an invited speaker.

370
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:41.200
We've seen invited speaker controversies since fire was founded.

371
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:46.201
Basically never ever am I aware of any incident that came close to something

372
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:53.030
like that.
It was just madness.
Yeah,
and they got away with it.

373
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.180
So few arrests were made,

374
00:22:55.181 --> 00:23:00.181
and I can't help but wonder if the students out at Middlebury College where

375
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.410
Charles Murray was speaking,

376
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.190
sees done that and looked at the Berkeley students and said,
well,

377
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.840
they were successful in stopping that event with speech that we also did tested

378
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.300
and they got away with it.
So let's try that.
It's a viable tactic.

379
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.940
This might be a solution for keeping this speech.

380
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.840
We disagree with off campus and ideas like that,

381
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:27.841
that the tactics that students are able to successfully utilize,

382
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.770
they will.
Behavior that is rewarded essentially is going to be repeated.

383
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.770
Yeah.
And I see that all over the place right now.
So for example,

384
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:40.000
just a couple months after Milo went to Berkeley in that happen,
uh,

385
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.570
Ben Shapiro's spoke there and it was largely nonviolent,

386
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.600
but it costs the $600,000 to make that happen.

387
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:52.580
I mean,
I think an ATM was broken in a couple of windows and that's it.

388
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.270
But that's part of the tactic is if we can keep ramping this up,

389
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.940
we'll keep pushing the security costs.
And as I said,

390
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:02.060
they had to move my event to a freaking hockey theater that uh,
you know,

391
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.040
hockey arena that couldn't have been cheap and,

392
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:05.570
and several other than these I saw,

393
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:08.600
I'm sure you're familiar with the case of Lindsay Shepherd up at Wilfrid Laurier

394
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.010
in Canada and she just had to crowd fund I think around six grand to get

395
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:17.030
security for one of her events.
So that almost seems like the new tactic.

396
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:18.320
It's almost like we don't have to,

397
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.160
we can scare them with some threats of violence and some other stuff and then

398
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:26.420
will cause the security costs to be so high that you guys will just give up.

399
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:26.961
Well,

400
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:29.840
and that's another problem we've been fighting since even before all of this

401
00:24:29.841 --> 00:24:31.480
came to a head is uh,

402
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.690
colleges and universities trying to charge student groups security fees for the

403
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.530
speakers based on the anticipated protest or controversy.

404
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.680
And that's plainly unconstitutional.

405
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:47.180
It has been for a long time since the supreme court said that a listener's

406
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:51.320
reaction is not a content neutral basis for regulation.

407
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.770
You cannot charge more for controversial speakers because they might drop

408
00:24:56.781 --> 00:24:57.614
protest.

409
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.940
That place is a price tag on expression and prices.

410
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.840
Like you said,
it'll price the controversial expression out of the marketplace.

411
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:07.310
They're not going to be able to afford it.

412
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.930
What student group has $17,000 to spend on security?
None of them.

413
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:17.510
And you know what it comes down to is administrators at the university itself

414
00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:22.511
has to be the guarantor of last resort when it comes to speakers and ability to

415
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:25.130
speak.
And this is the business they are in.

416
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.550
And sometimes it's unpleasant and sometimes it costs a whole lot of money.

417
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.480
But if you're not going to have a campus where we can discuss things and we can

418
00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:41.630
debate things,
even if it gets loud and boisterous and rockets and contentious,

419
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:43.580
which is everything free speech should be,

420
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.900
if your campus isn't going to be a place where that occurs,

421
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.200
then what are you,
what are you doing?

422
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.780
So I do want to make a point of saying that some of the campuses are getting it

423
00:25:56.781 --> 00:25:57.800
right and I'm sure you know,

424
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:01.010
some of the campuses that are doing a little better than some of the others.
Uh,

425
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.910
but for example,
uh,
at the beginning of September,
2017,

426
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:07.160
I spoke at Claremont Mckenna at there,

427
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.580
they're doing a big free speech push because of what happened the semester

428
00:26:10.581 --> 00:26:13.790
before with Heather McDonald and all hell broke loose and on the campus.

429
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.090
And I was completely welcome there and they,

430
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.310
even some of the students who disagreed with me,

431
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:22.070
I mean they asked healthy questions and all of that good stuff.

432
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:25.970
So it's where I always think it's worth mentioning that some schools are doing

433
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:29.090
their best to manage some of this stuff.
Absolutely.
And on two levels,
I think,

434
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:31.700
you know,
first of all,
fire rates,
policies at schools,

435
00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:35.630
we raised over 400 different colleges and universities on our red light,

436
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:38.180
yellow light,
green light level,
a red light being,

437
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:43.181
you have policies that are clearly in substantially unconstitutional yellow

438
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.940
being you have policies that are susceptible to being applied in bad ways and

439
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:52.740
greenlight schools where none of their policies poses a serious threat to free

440
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:54.630
speech.
In the past couple of years,

441
00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:58.410
the number of greenlight schools that we have has nearly doubled,

442
00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.970
which is tremendous.

443
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.810
Now still close to 60% of schools have a yellow light.

444
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.310
So there's work to be done.

445
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.850
But you combine that with the 38 schools that have now put out statements

446
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.060
expressively committing themselves to free speech.
Uh,
something that,
you know,

447
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.550
the University of Chicago kicked off a while back.

448
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.320
There's reasons to be hopeful and we work regularly with administrators who are

449
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:26.760
happy to have us,
you know,
consult on their policies and say,
you know,

450
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.700
here are the changes we would make a and we are,

451
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.640
we have amicable relationships with so many administrators,

452
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:36.390
which is really gratifying.
But on the student side also,

453
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.740
part of it is overblown.
I think by media.

454
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.770
There are a lot of students out there who do get it and people of all ideologies

455
00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:50.550
and all political,
uh,
you know,
sides.

456
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.860
There are a lot of students out there who get it.

457
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:55.880
I speak to them on a daily basis and I,

458
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.700
there is a lot of reason to have hope.

459
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.210
This is not a lost cause.
No,
I agree.

460
00:28:02.211 --> 00:28:05.480
I think it's important talking about it because even again at that University of

461
00:28:05.481 --> 00:28:05.870
New Hampshire,

462
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:10.430
I 75% of the crowd at least was there respectfully decently to hear ideas and,

463
00:28:10.431 --> 00:28:14.240
and do that what I felt was important after and why I still want to talk about

464
00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:17.570
it and have you here and all that is because I want people to be armed with the

465
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:21.230
right arguments so that when these,
this set of people,

466
00:28:21.231 --> 00:28:23.840
even if it's just a smaller set that's just really loud,

467
00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:25.370
who has a disproportionate amount of influence,

468
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.650
I want people to understand there are tactics you can use to,
to fight it.

469
00:28:29.651 --> 00:28:33.350
So I'm curious on that list of 38 schools that's kind of doing it right right

470
00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:35.450
now when they've instituted some of these policies.

471
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:39.110
And I remember when University of Chicago did it about a year ago,
um,

472
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.670
is there evidence that things actually get better?
Cause I,

473
00:28:42.671 --> 00:28:47.120
I'm going to guess that when you give some rules,
some of these students,

474
00:28:47.121 --> 00:28:51.540
they don't want to be kicked out of school and they might actually behave
better.

475
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.340
Well,
so I think you know this,

476
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.590
there's a lot of conversation right now about some legislation even that's going

477
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:00.900
on about disrupting speeches,

478
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.800
mandatory punishments for students who do sell a certain number of times.

479
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:08.190
And you know,
I think that's actually less important.

480
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:12.720
And I actually have somewhat of a problem with the laws that create mandatory

481
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:16.680
punishments for vaguely defined terms like disrupt,

482
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:21.150
which could be applied to pretty much anything that a sneeze.

483
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.880
Um,
but

484
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.880
I think more important is when administration is saying,
Hey,

485
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.580
these are the values that really,

486
00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:37.581
that this is the wellspring of intellectual vitality that our institution relies

487
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:41.590
on.
These are the,
the ideals you should be paying to.

488
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:44.860
This is what's gonna make your experience really worthwhile.

489
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.820
I think students will listen to that instead of maintaining the policies that

490
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:53.500
say thou shalt not say mean things about you or your classmates.
Uh,

491
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.800
that gets students in a very different mindset when they come to college.

492
00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.220
What are the statements are,
or what are the principles that you add?

493
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:04.060
You guys want to see in those statements?
The principals are just largely,

494
00:30:04.061 --> 00:30:08.560
this is a place of debate.
This is a place of intellectual exploration.

495
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.740
It is not our job as administrators or as faculty members to silence ideas that

496
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:19.390
we find controversial or protect you from them.
It is our,
uh,

497
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.670
our job.
It is our,
you know,

498
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.700
mission to expose you even two ideas that you might disagree with and give you

499
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:31.570
the tools that you need to analyze them,
think critically about them,

500
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:35.530
formulate your own ideas and participate in the conversation because that's what

501
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:39.460
you're going to have to do when you leave after four or however many years

502
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:44.110
you're here.
That's part of life in our democracy is participation.

503
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:47.170
If you don't participate,
then you know,
as the saying goes,

504
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.910
if you don't participate,
you have no grounds to complain.
Uh,
we have to,

505
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:52.540
you know,

506
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.540
really get students in the mindset that these are important life skills and

507
00:30:57.611 --> 00:31:01.120
they're important.
Even in other instances in the workplace.

508
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:05.320
That can be important if you have a policy position,

509
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:08.680
if you're working at a company that you think is either bad or is one that you

510
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:09.514
want to promote,

511
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:13.360
you have to be able to think about the people who disagree with you.

512
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.610
And what they're going to say,

513
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:20.140
anticipate their response and formulate an argument that resolves it.
You know,

514
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.940
there's countless situations in the world outside of college where being able to

515
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:29.740
think critically is incredibly important and,
and really,
uh,

516
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.760
I think that you've got a lot of value out of doing that outside of the

517
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:38.230
classroom because it teaches you how to contextualize the skill that teaches you

518
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:42.760
how to apply it,
not just in the,
I read this assignment,

519
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.200
let's talk about it kind of way.

520
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.830
Cause that's really not how life works once you graduate.
I wish it was,

521
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:51.320
it would make things a whole lot simpler,
but you'd be out of a job probably.

522
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.800
That's true.
I would have to find something else to do.
