00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.370
At today's talk will be speaking Coca Cola

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.660
A top level league in Japan

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.450
We have 
their analyst Mr. Funato here today

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.000
Because I've also been playing rugby a lot

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.579
I think data analysts are the types that can
bring in talks that those in Google would

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.930
find interesting

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:52.660
There may be some who do not know that rules
of rugby

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.110
By the way, who here has no idea of the rules
in rugby?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.700
Good, good, that's good

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.229
How about those who really like rugby?

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.340
I would like to talk about the type data we
deal with, something you might be interested

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.340
in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.460
And hopefully we can receive input from you
Googlers

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.150
Where you can give suggestions on what we
can do with some data

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.830
The rugby industry is also trying to try out
different things

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.650
After today's talk, if there's a chance it
would be great we can talk more

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.670
So, shall we start?

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.670
Yes

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.670
Good evening.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.670
I'll start with my introduction.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.510
My name is Funato, an analyst for Coca Cola
Red Sparks

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.631
For the name Coca Cola Red Sparks

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:51.020
The base is in Fukuoka, and it's called Fukuoka
West, and it is under a Coca Cola franchisee

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.460
There is a rugby club there and that is where
I work as an analyst

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.830
This is my 9th year

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.220
I didn't play rugby as a child, but only started
playing it in high school

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.960
My height is the one thing I can't shed off,
and I stand 192 cm high

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.550
As of now, I have a slim figure

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.540
but when I was playing, I weighed about 120
kilograms

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.890
I was able to freely play rugby from high
school

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.560
And until now, I am still able to work as
an analyst for a sport that I enjoy

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.390
I have known Sori, for quite some time now

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.599
Thank you for giving me this opportunity

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.290
I would like to talk about the characteristics
of data in rugby

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.300
Earlier we've seen that some people don't
know much about rugby

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.580
So I would like to show you video clips

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.040
To understand what rugby is

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.890
This is from last year, and it is the highlight
of the Japan team from the Word Cup in England

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.740
There was also one analyst then, and his work
helped a lot for the game

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.780
For those that has never seen a rugby match
before might find it confusing

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.790
And to be honest, it is a 15 against 15 match

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.580
But it is all over the place

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.210
This is Goromaru from the TV CM that's always
playing these days

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.569
He will be going to France this year

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.980
The opponent is Scotland

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.650
We have scout the opponent and push their
weakness

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.080
He is also a professional player in Japan,
and plays with power

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.650
This is the match against America

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.760
This is a type of attack called maul

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.140
The Japanese team will gather like this, because
they are weaker in terms of strength

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.200
There are over 10 players, and when most of
the players get in there, and try (score)

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.370
The player that you saw in the last part,
he isn't very strong in the backs, but he

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.269
goes in and mixes with the rest

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.890
This is also from the match against America,
they are physically smaller, but they are

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.890
powerful when they get together

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.080
The opponent here is Samoa

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.239
Since they're islanders, when they get rough,
a lot players leave the game

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.950
But in this match, Japan managed to hold their
score at 0

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.650
This one, this is just looks like a bad accident

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.640
Even when I see it, this is a player I know
very well

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.420
I felt the intensity of the match seeing him
do that victory pose

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.849
He is a professional player that also plays
American Football, he has smooth movements

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.519
that allows him to doge opponents

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.600
That was a player almost 150 kilograms heavy

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:23.340
This one is a match against South America

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.550
The South American Team is about 3rd or 4th
on the global ranking

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.369
They were also one of the favorites

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.560
Japan got lucky in this match, and to be honest,
it was a messy game

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.330
Even the analyst didn't know who was taking
part in where

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.110
they would huddle together, get in one circle,
and get in a pack and attack forward

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.879
This is an example of perfect scouting, it
is a sign of perfectly seeing through the

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:50.879
opponent's information

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.669
This is a try that was chosen as one of the
best plays

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.629
This is where data played a big part

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.839
Eddie Jones was the coach here

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:03.749
They studied which players in the South African
team was weak at left tackling, which player

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.439
was weak at right tackling, and came with
complete statistics

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.909
As a result, it was a perfect assign where
they knew where to go to get score a try

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:17.860
If you get to this point, it's just all the
spirit working, and it's just fully passion

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.860
playing

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.909
This was the final try that became famous

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.219
The video you just saw

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.520
It is actually an unbelievable game that would
give you the chills

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.030
Japan played against South Africa who was
unbeatable, and prepared the best we could

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.899
They perfectly extracted data, and came up
with statistics of the South African team's

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:36.899
weak points

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.949
This was a well prepared for match where they
knew exactly what kind of game to expect when

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:41.949
they do what

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:48.990
On the actual game, with one minute remaining
on the clock, they scored a try and won

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.149
Everyone went wild with joy and surprise

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.669
This blew up the rugby industry in Japan

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.610
Rugby is a 15 against 15 game, and it has
the most competitive sport, the number of

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.180
players

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.889
Compared to other sports such as soccer, hockey
has 11 players, and rugby has 15

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.389
The ground is 100 meters by 70 meters, and
30 players would mix in this game

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:18.339
The quote at the bottom is by Ueda former
coach at Keio University

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:27.830
In soccer you cannot use your hands, in basketball
you can only use your hands, but in rugby

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.009
you can use all

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.289
You use the ball with your hands, with your
feet, and you hit with your body

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.569
It's like getting in a road accident, as you've
seen in the footage, it is a very aggressive

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:41.569
sport

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:48.460
With that said, it has very strict rules,
and it also keeps the spirit of fair play

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:55.669
With also the spirit of self-sacrificing,
and spirit of no side

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:57.709
It is the gentleman's sport, and originated
in England

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:01.339
We analyze and extract data of such an aggressive
sport with this number of players

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:07.629
As an example where I deliberately chose a
very big person

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.189
This is a foreign player that stands about
190 cm tall

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.639
With about 110 kg, and they have 130 kg players
too

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.809
But, of course, there are also players that
aren't even 180 cm tall, and less than 80

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:19.809
kg

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:22.059
With Japanese national team there are more
of these types of players

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:24.029
There are a lot of this level overseas

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.509
England's player Haskell played for Ricoh
in Japan

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.330
Spies also played for Kintetsu a Japanese
team, and we played against them

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.860
When I found out they were coming, honestly,
I felt bad for the players

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.499
Because, can you imagine, this would be coming
towards you

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:45.409
But the strategy is to dodge them well, and
we would come up with data on how to do this,

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:48.759
this is the Analyst's role

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:55.919
In rugby, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia,
Argentine, teams from the Southern Hemisphere

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.499
are usually strong

00:07:57.499 --> 00:08:01.509
Islander teams such as Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga
are also strong

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:05.279
Then there's England, Europe, since it was
originated in England, there's England, France,

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.279
Wales, Scotland

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:13.139
These are the strong teams, and of course,
they are physically big

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:17.909
Plus, we see the U.S. flag here, but rugby
isn't actually that popular in the U.S.

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:20.749
When you say the 4 major American sports,
rugby won't really be mentioned

00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:23.910
But, since this year there is the Rio Olympics

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.020
And rugby sevens became has officially been
recognized

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.219
What the U.S. first thought of was not to
get a Gold Medal, but to take advantage of

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:36.219
the business opportunity

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:40.279
So now, in the U.S., considering also the
business aspect of it, rugby is becoming very

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.279
popular

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:47.440
Of course, as we all know, with that population
size, there are a wide range of levels

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.019
If players from American football shift to
rugby

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:55.029
there are a lot of players in this level

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:58.589
That's why they are getting stronger and stronger

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:00.810
It's actually a threat globally

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.810
In Japan

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.259
The 2016 Japan team's performance you saw
earlier

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:08.210
I think you might have seen this

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.100
This is the Ninja pose of Goromaru who boomed
in Japan

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.199
I have 2 kids, and they do the pose all the
time

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:20.300
He is actually in an opposing team and it
is actually a bit troubling for myself

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:26.329
They would imitate him all the time, and would
ask me if he was around

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:28.879
He is from the team, Yamaha Hatsudouki

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:34.829
And my kids came when my team played against
him, and after the game they kept asking,

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:35.829
"Where is Goromaru?"

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:40.149
They don't even know the names of my team's
player, but they constantly mention Goromaru,

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:41.149
that is how famous he became

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:43.329
But thanks to him, rugby became very popular

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:48.000
If you all know, the world cup will be hosted
by Japan in 2019

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.040
There will be games all over the country,
and it is a great opportunity in terms of

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.060
business and rugby as a sport

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.170
Also, this year, actually this month, there
is also the Olympics

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.009
Both male and female team will take part in
the rugby seven games

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:09.490
I've mentioned earlier that it is a 15 against
15 game, but there are actually 3 types

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:15.620
The 15 against 15 is called union, and it
is the most famous type

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.089
Then, there's also the 13 against 13 called
League rugby

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:24.440
After that is the rugby seven, which also
uses the same grounds

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.240
In a 100 meter by 70 meter field, 7 against
7 would be playing, so the running ability

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.911
of the players is key

00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:36.290
the players in the team is a collection of
all the speedsters

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.899
With these elements, rugby has become very
popular

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:41.149
In Japan, we have the Japan Rugby Top League

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:45.939
It is not the world's best, but it is Japan's
best rugby league with currently 16 teams

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:53.110
Our team Coca Cola Red Sparks is also in there,
and we are taking part in the matches

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:58.389
I assume there are some of you who have played
different types of sports

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:02.060
Not only in rugby, but coaches talk about
3 things

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.689
Mental, Technique, and Physical

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:05.949
There is the body, then one learns the technique,
and trains the mental

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:10.050
Basically what it means is that you must prepare
well, when all three are present, that is

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.050
where sports becomes important

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.629
Our job as analysts means that you cannot
win with simply this

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:16.680
What comes to play is another factor which
is intelligence

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.439
There is the rugby IQ, utilizing data, using
this data in scouting opponents

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:22.510
By doing so, the intelligence to make the
sport smarter and stronger is necessary

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.870
So working as an analyst, I would like to
roughly explain what I do as one

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.130
I mainly do 6 things

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.459
The first thing is preparing to record video
footage of practices, and analysis

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:34.870
Preparing for matches, analysis of the opposing
team, creating motivational video

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.720
Analysis of the actual match, our own Team's
analysis

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.300
I mainly do 6 things

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.600
During the season, there is a match once a
week, even in Japan

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.050
There would be a match on Saturday, and after
a week another match next Saturday

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.589
This cycle would go on every week

00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:51.420
Simply put, we don't get to sleep much

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.900
And when there is a match, we don't get to
sleep at all

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.139
At the venue of the game, all we need is power
supply, and we can set up everything we need

00:11:57.139 --> 00:11:58.650
In Japan's case, we would set up a video camera

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.999
Set the computer, set the desk, and also set
the DVD recorder

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:04.580
An analyst's base would be full of equipment

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.009
We would keep recording the match in video,
and take down the stats analysis

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:13.420
When we would see a pattern, then we would
inform the head coach immediately

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.110
We can keep track of which parts of the field
is often empty

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.910
Based on this, the coach would make the judgment,
and make appropriate directions

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.430
In the world cup footage you saw earlier with
the last try scene

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.040
During that time, if you watch the video again,
you can see that

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.190
The coach doesn't have his ear piece on

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.230
There is actually a story behind this

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.290
The coach gave instructions, but the player
ignored this and chose to make that play,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.509
and as a result they won by scoring a try

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:56.920
The coach would ask why they didn't choose
to play the way he instructed, and he would

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:04.980
throw the headset in anger, and wouldn't be
able to make further instructions

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:13.899
The interpreter mentioned being questioned
by the fuming coach if they sent out the instruction,

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:18.670
and he said yes, but he said it was really
scary

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:24.160
That is how heated the players and the games
get, there's the data, but at the end of the

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.439
day, they go with the passion

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:28.170
Rugby is a game where you use data in this
way

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.430
Even after going to games all over the country

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.650
Even while in transit, on the plane, on the
bullet train, on the bus, will constantly

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.650
work on extracting data

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:42.389
It is all in here, with the analysis software
installed, we just constantly type those numbers

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.389
in

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:49.100
Even when we get home, we have to submit a
review to the coach by morning

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.009
So we just keep punching in those data

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:57.059
Aside from the matches, everyday during practice,
we have to video record

00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:01.480
We then put this in the analysis software,
and we report the stats to the coach

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.899
On whether the intended purpose of that day's
practice was met or not

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:15.879
In preparing for games, we work from setting
up the equipment to setting up the data

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:17.709
For analyzing the opponent team

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:21.449
we gather videos of 3 to 4 matches they've
had

00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:24.410
And extract information of what attacks they
make

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.259
And what defense they make

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:33.490
We also turn in the video footage as data
to the coaches

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:40.130
We also give them to the players so they can
see what attacks are made

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:51.329
The players would see the footage, and we
would go on to prepare for scouting

00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:56.529
For the next task, it varies on the situation
whether we make it or not

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:59.190
But we also need to increase the player's
motivation

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.430
So, before important matches, we create motivational
videos

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:09.170
We capture the team's atmosphere, put in words
from the coach, so we always take on these

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.170
things

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.910
We then pick out footage, and create an about
5 minute video

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:20.329
At the hotel, we stay before the match, we
would show them the video, and we also put

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:22.370
it in their smartphones

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.940
This helps them keep their motivation high

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.690
Which would then lead to the kind of game
you saw earlier

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:39.529
Then, let's go into the main topic of this
talk which is what kind of data does rugby

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:40.529
deal with

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:41.529
There are mainly 3 types, and the first is
competitive data

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:42.529
First of all, let's talk about what competitive
data is

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:45.790
There are actually 3 kinds hidden here

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.249
First is the competitive data

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:51.040
As mentioned earlier, we have video footage
we record, so there is the data from the footage

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.540
There is also the team stats, individual stats,
and scouting stats

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.360
This is all the data a rugby analyst extracts

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.569
So, there's the video footage first

00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:09.439
There is the team stats, where we come up
with data on the team's trend and patterns,

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:10.930
and what type of action or movements did the
team have

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.829
Then there is the individual stats

00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:15.610
It might be a bit hard to see the specific
details

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.610
This is the team stats

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.899
This is the match when Japan was completely
defeated by New Zealand in the 2011 World

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:21.899
Cup

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:24.869
We will have to keep track of how many minutes
into the game was there a scoring through

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:26.839
try, and what kind flow the match had

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:33.879
There are types of play in rugby such as scrum
and line out

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:40.649
We track what was the success rate those had,
and how many times were there a tackle

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:46.309
Also, there's the possession rate, how often
did the players hold on to the ball

00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:47.610
How much of the territory was gained

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:48.854
We single mindedly input this in the analysis
software

00:16:48.854 --> 00:16:49.854
And more often

00:16:49.854 --> 00:16:50.854
It would take 1 to 2 hours live

00:16:50.854 --> 00:16:52.939
After that, it would take about 8 hours to
10 hours to extract all the data

00:16:52.939 --> 00:16:55.760
We just keep going on and bringing in the
data

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:02.749
After doing so, we then work on the individual
stats

00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:06.819
The individual stats are of the 15 players
I mentioned earlier, plus 8 reserves

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.091
That's a total of 23 members

00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:09.260
So, as a strategy they all take turns

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.449
Basically, all 23 members take turns

00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:15.850
We need to keep track of who was doing what
where for all the 23 players

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.640
This, to be honest, for us analyst, it is
dreadful

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.880
But we just keep on inputting that data

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.380
What happens is, as you have seen with rugby
in the footage

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.189
It gets all mixed up

00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:32.680
Soccer has a tracking system, and as long
as you put a certain number of cameras

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.970
The video can distinguish the players in contrast
to the color of the field

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.000
So it is easy to extract data

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.400
But with rugby, it gets very confusing and
messy

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
Even for us

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.529
We end up constantly rewinding the tape, zooming
in, then checking who is doing what

00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:50.100
Once we check then we input the data for each
player

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.781
So, as you can imagine, it is an extreme amount
of work

00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.740
But, to improve the player's performance,
it is an essential factor

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.010
If there is work rate with low quality, then
we would need to work on eliminating this

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.940
Improvement would be necessary, so we just
have to keep bringing in the data

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.950
I am not sure how many hours it actually takes

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:10.580
I prefer not to count, because if I do, I
would just hate it more

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.320
We keep creating data

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.070
And, this is the competitive data

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:19.200
Plus, aside from our own team, we would also
work on analyzing the opponent's team

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:30.080
Aside from our match, and the ??? Of the next
opposing team there are 3 matches

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.860
There are about 4 matches to retrieve data
from

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:39.540
Then we find the patterns and trends, and
come up with the statistics

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:51.860
What will the opponent do, what kind of trend
or pattern we have, all of these are reported

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.309
to the coach

00:18:56.309 --> 00:19:03.649
The second type of data is the mental and
physical type of data

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:06.630
In terms of the the mental, frankly, this
is quite hard to put into data

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.130
But in the physical side, we manage everything
in data

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:14.309
But we don't use a software for it

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:20.700
We don't have the go to software to manage
this

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.090
Basically, the height, weight, and body fat

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:28.970
Then there's the weight and muscles, how many
kilograms did they bench press lift

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.669
We also manage all the food they consume

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:32.950
Our team isn't really pro

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.000
Most of them are Japanese employees, and half
of them have families

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.470
We would get the permission of their wives

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.669
And we would rent out a whole dining hall,
and feed them dinner that our nutritionist

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:45.669
prepared

00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:51.010
There's a time, 30 minutes after training,
that we call the "golden time"

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.679
How much we can feed them high protein and
low calorie food is what is important

00:19:54.679 --> 00:19:56.890
So, that is what we feed them

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.190
It's been about 4 years since we started this

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.049
When we first started doing this, our team
players were physically small

00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:07.539
Their bodies were small, and other teams had
190 cm and 100 kilogram players

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:09.350
And we didn't have a lot of players like that

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.500
But, these are the types of players we had
to play against, so what we did was

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.610
Just for dinner, we would make them eat 3,000
calories worth of food

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:22.600
These days a lot of people are conscious of
tracking their calories

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.921
So you could probably imagine what 3,000 calories
is like

00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:26.921
Our players

00:20:26.921 --> 00:20:27.921
Would have a hard time eating

00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:33.200
It's easy to consume 3,000 calories when you
eat tempura or tonkatsu

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.740
but when the menu consists of boiled pork

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.740
Or white meat

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.390
When the food you have to eat is low calorie
high protein, and you have to consume 3,000

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.450
worth of calories

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.519
The players struggle to finish the food

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:49.909
But to finish their food is also part of the
training

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:53.860
And we ask them to also have control on these

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.000
When they feel hungry, the moment they feel
hunger, it means that their muscles are burning

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.230
So, they always carry nuts

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.490
Whatever they do they have nuts with them
to snack on

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.549
We joke about telling them they're like monkeys

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:05.690
But they are desperate

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:11.850
It's the same story during the Japan matches,
I have experience in working as Japan staff

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:12.870
It is just there

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.450
There are dried fruits and nuts put everywhere

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.740
It probably makes sense

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.640
But I'm not sure if people at Google train

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.820
They carry it around all the time, when we
headed to the plane, they would take it out

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.810
And when I asked what they were, they said
they were Almonds

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.580
And, this is typical during road trips

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.779
But this is something they do to train their
body

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:39.500
And lastly, there is also the subjective degree
of fatigue

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:47.670
There aren't a lot of data that measure the
degree of fatigue

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.780
The more well-versed the player is, the more
their perspective becomes objective

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:59.850
They would know how tired their body is and
which part is tired

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:07.730
We would ask them to rate from 1 to 5 of how
much which part hurts

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:12.710
When we continuously ask this, well-versed
players manage their bodies very well

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.780
There are also players who

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.930
Wear wearable watches, and manage their body
using their smartphones

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.850
We push them, and keep building the statistics

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.519
We also gather data that would prevent them
from having injuries

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:26.519
This also links

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:29.380
But we measure the speed that they run in
and their heart rate

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.710
Sorry if it's a bit hard to see but

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.030
This is made by the trainer that we use

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.150
Of individual physical data

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.660
There is no system for this, so currently

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:43.080
Our trainer, the S&amp;C trainer we have made
this in an excel sheet

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:51.320
We would paste pictures from the top, and
there would be the name, position, age, and

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320
height

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.220
The body fat of a certain weight would be
recorded

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.350
This is 24.5 close to 25, I think it's too
much

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.309
Then, if we keep focusing on the medical data

00:23:03.309 --> 00:23:06.320
We end up wasting money, and also time

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:13.130
Actually we weigh them using just a standard
body fat scale you buy for your home

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.669
Then, once or twice a year we weigh them precisely

00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:20.799
What we try to do here is to avoid any large
fluctuations

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.669
In his case when he gains here, he instantly
reduces

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:26.679
With this, if they gradually reduce body fat,
and increase muscle

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:35.740
You will be able to create a good body, and
as you can see here the target is 19 percent

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.230
To get close to the target 19 percent

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.330
When you work in being in the condition earlier

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.590
This is the muscle test

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.659
There's the power clean, squats, bench press,
pull ups

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:56.919
We measure the muscles that is our indicator
on how much it has been trained, and also

00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:57.919
yearly

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:03.260
How much they have grown, how much they have
trained

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:09.360
This one is the speed related data

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.030
How much they can run

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.309
This is the kind of data we extract

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:23.200
Even for bench presses, there are no players
that don't not lift below 100 kg, for rugby

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.200
players

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.520
There are also those that lift more than 200
kg

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.480
They all have abnormal bodies

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.409
But to protect themselves from road accidents
as seen earlier

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:36.019
They have to put on muscle, and also extra
flesh

00:24:36.019 --> 00:24:41.200
This is not American Football, with American
Football, you get to wear the head cap or

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200
the helmet

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.470
There is a layer of protection, but in rugby,
there is nothing but flesh

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:51.230
To protect your body, we have to keep inputting
numbers and building the statistics

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.210
And manage your body

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.169
It was a bad example but

00:24:56.169 --> 00:25:00.179
This is his medical history, and his injury
history

00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:05.679
With this player, he had many injuries, and
he was very troubled by it

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:09.309
Players go through various injuries, with
that kind of play

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:14.769
In actual, even when they don't hit each other,
injuries happened even by just running

00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:19.250
The moment they sprint, they can pull a muscle

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.290
These types of injury can also happen

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.370
He had been troubled by these injuries

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.450
And, he would constantly consult with the
trainer and doctor

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.800
Yesterday, we went to Hokkaido for training
camp

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.240
He was able to go through the camp without
any injury, and this year, might be a good

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240
year for him

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.150
We record data like this

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.169
And we do take physical data like this

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:43.360
The body parts of the injury would show up

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:52.950
For this player, most of it is on his legs
and feet, so this indicates that he will need

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.070
to train these areas

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.140
Then, we would see how much he lifts during
squats

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.600
If we see that he lifts 190 kg

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.370
this may mean that he needs to lift more

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.789
If they were able to lift 135 kg during bench
press, then we see that it went down to 130

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:08.049
kg, we would ask the player why

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:15.020
We also pressure them because they need to
create a body that can endure a road accident

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.020
like game

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.419
With that said, this is how we manage physical
data

00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:19.419
Finally

00:26:19.419 --> 00:26:23.880
We would take both competitive data and physical
data

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.330
Player put on GPS

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:30.140
Nowadays, everyone uses the run meter on their
iPhones and smartphones when the run

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.260
There are also GPS devices in watches now

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.260
In rugby

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.260
It is about

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.400
A smaller size than this

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.870
There is a GPD device that is about 4 cm by
3 cm

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:45.850
They would put it on their shoulder blade,
and wear with something that resembles a sports

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:46.850
bra

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.649
The jersey used in regular games have pockets
to put them in

00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:53.470
All the players would wear them

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.500
All 23 players

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.679
That would be 40 minutes times 40 minutes,
plus a little more, so the match would be

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:01.070
about 90 minutes

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:06.330
In 90 minutes, the player's running distance,
running time, the running time would be around

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.330
90 minutes

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.049
The running distance is how many km they run

00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:12.460
The running speed, how was the intensity

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.200
What was the running speed at top speed

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.320
The average speed, the global average in rugby

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.510
For 1 match that runs for 80 minutes to 90
minutes is about 6.5 km to 7 km

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:30.679
With that said, since they are not marathon
runners, it doesn't mean that simply running

00:27:30.679 --> 00:27:32.720
10 km or 20 km is enough

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.500
Within that 6.5 km, what is most important
is

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:42.159
The average speed, what this means is you
don't simply run 7 km

00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:45.770
But a player must sprint and be on a constant
high speed to catch the ball that goes to

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.770
different places

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.080
A player that can continuously follow the
ball is the most clever player

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.909
By distinguishing the game everything appears
on the GPS

00:27:53.909 --> 00:28:00.320
Then, of course, the speed increases, during
practice they would have they wear a heart

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.610
rate meter to count their heart rate

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:11.960
So, they would be pushed to increase their
heart rate to 180 to 200

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.450
When you try this out, you will understand
the intensity of 180

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.530
I'm sorry to assume, but I don't think anyone
can reach this

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.130
If you would, then you would probably be sent
to the hospital

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.309
That is how hard 180 to 200 is

00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:28.309
The players are just panting and gasping at
this point

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:30.529
When I was a player

00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:38.080
We would just get on our knees in exhaustion
and tell our coach we couldn't take it anymore

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.490
And it would look like we were exhausted

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:47.350
But now, since you can see everything, even
if the player begs you

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:54.150
We can see if the heart rate is only down
to 140, and we would tell them so

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.889
It might be a negative thought

00:28:58.889 --> 00:29:00.740
But this is something that we can also manage
now

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.750
In a way, if it goes over 200, then we know
when it's too dangerous

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.730
We would tell them to stop, and go home to
rest

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:13.820
Or, we could ask them to skip practice the
next day

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.610
It also functions a barometer where we would
let them rest so they can manage their health

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:19.610
and condition themselves

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.110
There are different types of GPS software

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:26.240
In the software our team uses, this is the
GPS data of a player during practice

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.700
This green wave, is the speed data of the
GPS

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.340
The top orange line that fluctuates is the
heart rate

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:37.160
The higher it goes, it means the faster the
speed is

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:43.610
So, you can see that he runs, then at this
point he sprints

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:48.580
Then, he goes back then sprints again, and
goes back

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:53.049
Most likely, this pattern goes on for 3 times

00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:58.190
This is probably a practice when the strength
coach gave him a heavy menu

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.690
The speed goes really fast, then they do it
for 3 rounds, and the heart rate continues

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.690
to be high

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.340
This practice probably goes on for 70 minutes

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.721
When it reaches the middle, they probably
have already warmed up

00:30:08.721 --> 00:30:13.340
Then, the coach gave them an intense menu

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.919
This goes on for 3 sets

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:20.770
At the last part, they cool down, then the
heart rate also starts to go down

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.600
Every part of it is documented

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:30.510
They also wear this during the match, so the
running distance and speed during this would

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.510
show

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.460
And, this depends on the team

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.669
But there would be 5 different levels set
from low to high

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:39.890
Players that are consistently on level 4 and
5 are clever players

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.259
They regain their breath well, and can run
with strong intensity

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.950
If the player is weak, or not very skilled

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.480
They tend to stay on the lower levels

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.700
That's why they can't increase their speed

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.110
With this, it might not sound good if I say
that this is how we manage the players

00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:00.070
But we extract competitive data and physical
data

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.500
Along with the GPS data

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.130
With soccer, they also use GPS

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.130
Apparently, it isn't as well known yet

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.480
In J league, they have started to use it as
part of fan service

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.580
Rugby uses this technology

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:13.809
As training data to increate the physical
and rugby IQ of the players

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:17.639
And this is only with rugby

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:21.890
As an example, I might also be out of the
rank

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.000
For example, baseball has progressed the most

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.809
Major league is really advanced in this aspect,
as a business and as a sport

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:30.750
The movie Moneyball is a good example of this

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.740
This is the movie starring Brad Pitt

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.139
They would extract the data called Sabermetrics

00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:42.580
With baseball, there is no physical contact,
so it would be 1 on 1

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:51.260
This makes the data easy to come up with

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.490
They can come up with all sorts of data like
what is the on-base percentage of this batter,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:56.490
what kind of pitch are they weak in

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.960
All sorts of statistic are created in Sabermetrics

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.600
If you're a professional athlete, it also
becomes your personal evaluation

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.460
Which would also lead to your salary, that
is the story in Moneyball

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.600
In Japanese Baseball, with Softbank Hawks
and Rakuten also uses this well

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.110
They would put foreign players in important
positions to supplement the team

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.299
Soccer also works on data management

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:12.870
In Soccer's case, there aren't much contact
between players too

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.440
So, it is easy to track their movements with
a camera

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.250
There is also GPS for this, and there are
rules that prevent them from putting one

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.100
So, they basically use the camera to document
everything, and they would come up with the

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.100
tracking data

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.850
Soccer fans are actually more into the game
more than the players

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.960
What has happened is that, I personally don't
play this, there are games such as Pro Evolution

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.610
Soccer and Let's Make A Soccer Team

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.901
The gamer becomes the coach

00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:39.799
So when they watch a game live, they watch
it from the coach's perspective

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:43.120
There have been an increase in the number
of fans

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.779
That start to see if a player isn't being
productive

00:32:46.779 --> 00:32:50.590
From a business perspective these fans need
to be taken care of

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.500
And they have to be satisfied

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:58.480
What the association is doing now, is that
they show all those data during half time

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.700
So when you go see a J league match now

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.889
During half time on the electric bulletin
board

00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:06.690
You can see who has the longest running distance
and other data

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:12.389
But overseas they also put Sabermetrics here

00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:24.049
But the data that we extract is simply data
of the past

00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:27.720
It analyses a game that already ended

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.960
In a way, it's already ended so there is nothing
more to do

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:42.100
But, once these data are collected and you
build the statistics

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.720
The data that you extract from there, this
is actually what they do in NBA

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.649
You come up with the expected value

00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:57.450
This is future numbers

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:14.849
For example, there is player A who is a batter
in baseball

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:18.530
You would extract the data from him, data
of him when he stands in the batter box

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.190
This means, they can up with data such as
this batter hits the most during a 2-2 when

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.370
there is a person on this fort

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:33.170
They will be able to come up with the expected
value of when to use a pinch-hitter

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:41.380
This is also the case with soccer, there is
the number of shoots made, and number of actual

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.980
shoots that turned to scores

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:49.490
Then they would know in which angle he has
a higher score rate

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:51.620
When his expected value is shown

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.480
They will see data of where and when he should
be used

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.650
A little while back

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.200
At that time, Okazaki's salary was not much

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.950
And his selling price wasn't much either,
at the beginning, he was just this small Japanese

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:08.950
dude

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.880
And, wasn't very popular in European soccer

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.660
Leicester's coach, if you didn't know any
better this guy just looked like

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.680
A typical middle aged looking man, was eyeing
Okazaki to scout

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:26.510
He looked through all his data and said, Okazaki's
running was exceptional

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:31.610
If we have this small dude just keep on running,
he will suit Leicester

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:36.700
And, his salary was low and cheap to scout,
so he picked them out

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.180
He told him, we are relying on you, this is
your expected value

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.440
And if you work on this area, you will be
great for Leicester

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.670
And, as a result of Okazaki's performance,
Leicester won

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.510
This is a result from the expected value,
this is Sabermetrics

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.370
This has not entered rugby yet

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:54.170
Sabermetrics is already in soccer, basketball,
and baseball

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.560
You do not simply use the data from the past,
but you extract this data and come up with

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560
an expected value

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.680
This is the new way data is now being used

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.340
There have been talks that rugby will have
this too

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:14.600
But the system is still not built, and it
is still hard to build at this point

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.590
Before I talk about the next topic

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.840
If you have anything to ask about data, please
ask

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.090
I would like to answer the best way I can

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.990
About how data is used in sports

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.990
(Question)

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.480
Most of the time the strength coach manages
this

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:37.040
Of course it is not good to just keep bulking
up

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.090
But since it is the human body, it is hard
to give a set of standards

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.220
Of course they always consult with the doctor
and trainer

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.450
But there isn't a set standard

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.050
But what often happens in sports is

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:53.530
For example, in our team there is a player
that stands 160 cm

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:58.030
He states he is that tall, but we are not
quite convinced

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.400
His nickname is Tank

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.220
He weighs about 100 kg

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.990
And he bench presses about 165 kg

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.430
If there was a picture, I would like to show
you

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.170
But what happens to a 160 cm, 100 kg player
that bench presses that much

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.340
You end up looking like a tan

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.700
This is it

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.960
Just imagine having arms here

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:25.790
Since this is what he looks like, his arms
do not lift, and it just statistics

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:43.691
This would affect his performance, so we control
it

00:37:43.691 --> 00:37:44.691
We make him lose weight

00:37:44.691 --> 00:37:45.691
This is what happens in rugby

00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:48.570
For example, in other games, such as volleyball

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:54.170
In volleyball, if a player bench pressed and
put on muscle, you would think they can spike

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.170
well

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.240
But with bench press you can only gain muscle
at the front

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.100
When you train it too much, to exaggerate
a little, the shoulders would stiffen

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:07.360
When this happens, you would bring it to the
back when you perform a spike, but your shoulders

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.620
would be too stiff

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.730
If you don't control this, you're body won't
be able to spike anymore

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.330
It depends on the sport, and the individual
players

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.430
There actually isn't a standard to it

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.870
We look into the balance

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:24.010
And we ask them to train, and play in matches,
and based on the results we control

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.010
(Question)

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.010
We manage all of those

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.010
Usually the players know themselves

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.450
They would know what would match what kind
of weight

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:33.810
For example, for really professional players,
since it is better to be able to take up a

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:34.810
variety of positions

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:41.370
There are those that can manage how much weight
is needed for certain positions

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.060
There are players that are able to manage
in this way

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.150
We also have a player that holds on 3 different
positions

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.480
They won't be able to switch by week

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.696
We would ask him to take a certain position
by season

00:38:50.696 --> 00:38:52.890
Then he would say okay then I will do 105
kg

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.480
Then we would ask him to do a running positions

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.590
Then he would say okay I will do 98 kg

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.890
He can control it in this way

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:03.550
Kuwazuru is the rugby seven captain

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.840
He is a member in our team

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.840
When he was playing rugby union, he would
do 100 kg

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.160
In rugby union, there is a lot of running,
so he would lower it to 95 kg

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:21.610
He also lost weight for Rio, and we would
bully play with him that he wasn't part of

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.630
the team anymore

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:33.740
But to play in the Olympic, he will not be
able to run if he is too heavy

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.590
He manages the weight

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.480
The player works with the trainer to manage
this

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.590
Thank you

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.710
Yes, please

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.710
(Question)

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.710
Thank you

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.290
Actually, rugby has not progressed that much

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:53.020
It might be wrong coming from me

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.840
But we've always had high level analysts in
rugby

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.420
But because the association does not have
much influence

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.090
There were a lot of ignorance towards data

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.550
Currently, we are left behind by soccer, basketball,
and volleyball

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.770
I always check out soccer

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.150
About the data of soccer

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.640
Even though it is very different sport

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.270
How can we increase the winning rate, with
what we call a try

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:17.550
To be able to score a try, what are the procedures
we have to go through

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:24.640
Before, you had to have a high possession
rate of the ball to score a try

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.440
The time the ball is held within the 80 minutes
of game

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:36.330
It has always been said if a team holds on
to the ball 60 percent of the time, then they

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.330
would win

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:42.000
But in rugby these days, you can win even
without possessing the ball

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.600
This is also happening in soccer

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:51.640
The idea that if you possess the ball, you
can shoot or you can score a try

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.070
If you think about it this is common sense

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.310
Yes, this concept does not fade

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:02.110
But in actual, for example, currently the
strongest team is England

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.970
When England and Australia played against
each other

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.180
England had a landslide win with 7 against
23

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:15.870
But when you look at the stats, the possession
rate of Australia is 75%

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.990
England wasn't able to attack at all, but
they won

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.990
So, what is happening here, let's see

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.210
There is no ???, they want to come up with
the expected value

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:24.420
But in terms of if the coach's strategy and
the expected value is another issue

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.164
This is also one of the troubles an analyst
faces

00:41:26.164 --> 00:41:28.420
First thing is the coach has to have a creative
result ahead when they see the data

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.000
And, what is also difficult is

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.400
In Japanese sports, the coaching style is
still passion first

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.320
It is what they called having the balls

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.440
So regardless how much data we bring in

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:45.300
They would often dismiss it is as merely numbers

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:51.350
There was a NBA player named Brent Barry

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:57.490
The owner of the team he was in

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:03.990
Was actually a statistician, which was completely
unrelated to basketball

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:17.070
But there was the Sabermetrics we mentioned
earlier, and they named the owner the pro

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.080
in statistical science

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.110
The players did not take well that they were
being evaluated merely by two dimensional

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.110
numbers

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.210
And with this, what he said was, and this
is completely a sexist comment

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.090
Stats are just like bikinis, they are nice
to look at

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.340
But they don't tell you the whole story

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.430
There are a lot of women here so I feel very
rude saying it

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.430
He said it, not me

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.800
As a man, ultimately, they want to see a naked
woman

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.110
But stats is like a bikini that looks good

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:43.660
But since what you really want to see is a
naked woman

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.080
Stats is like that, it won't let you see the
truth

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.430
When he said this to the media, which poked
him a lot for this

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:56.420
But it is exactly as he said

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.440
Honestly, this is the agony of an analyst

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.920
Regardless of what numbers you come up with,
in the end, it is just numbers

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.570
In actual, when those players move in the
field, their passion comes first

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.940
During the South African match earlier, the
Japan vs South Africa

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.960
As per the data, Japan can aim for getting
a penalty goal

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.411
When they get 3 points, it will be a match,
and the world will see how great Japan is

00:43:10.411 --> 00:43:13.670
This was the intention of the coach

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.130
This is as per the data

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:24.960
But, when you're on the field, it's your passion
that comes first and say, I will score with

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.960
a try

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.370
As a result it turned out okay

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.330
And everyone celebrated it

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.780
But as for the coach, he was upset that they
didn't listen to his data and threw the headset

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.780
in frustration

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.500
This is honestly a distress

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.740
In our case, we have been playing rugby for
a while

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.740
Even before, the approach on strategy

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.740
Has always changed

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:50.940
If the opponent kicks, we would have to count
the number of counter attacks

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:57.000
Or it could be increasing the number of line-ups
within the 22 meter line

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.950
This changes through time

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:03.260
After a while, it becomes obsolete, and something
of the past

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.640
It consistently changes

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.560
So, it makes the approach very difficult

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.250
Especially in rugby, the rules change every
year

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:15.180
For those who started to like rugby

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:21.370
It might be wrong to say that it is a shame

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:28.500
But we also have a hard time keeping up with
the changes every year

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.390
Since turning pro is a trend right now, they
see rugby as a business

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:40.680
And they want to make rules to make the game
more interesting

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.800
So, since there are changes in the rules every
year

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.310
Even the referee cannot keep up

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.650
Everyone is having trouble with this

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.670
The audience aren't sure what happens in games

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:55.180
But it is something we cannot fix

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.190
As mentioned by Mr. Sorimatsu earlier

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.700
This goes with soccer too

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.230
But there is a play that the player can control

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.570
For example, in rugby, there is line-out

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.200
There is the ball the opponent kicks

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:17.140
Then the player can throw-in from the side,
this is a play where one throws the ball

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:24.860
This is something the player can perform when
they kick the ball and the opponent kicks

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.860
it

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.810
But in the case of scrum which is another
set play, the player cannot control it

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.700
With soccer, throw-in can be controlled

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:39.070
You can kick it to the front, put pressure,
then the opponent will start kicking

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.660
When the number of this increases

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.720
The strategy they make is to make a lot chances
to score by using a throw-in

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.130
Does anyone here know the England vs Iceland
match

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.010
This is the game Iceland won in

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.190
In soccer, England is one of the strongest

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.580
Iceland on the other hand, is not known for
soccer

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.580
Even when you look at their stats, their success
rate in passing is very low in rank

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.580
But they won 2 to 1 to against England

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.580
The whole country celebrated

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.345
Their strategy was to use throw-in to build
their strength and have control

00:46:01.345 --> 00:46:03.120
They came up with the stats and used this
as the source of attack

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.520
Then when they ride the waves

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.780
The players start to think that they have
what it takes to win

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.390
And finally they are driven by passion

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.190
This is the kind of data that was done in
soccer

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.190
Is everything alright?

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.190
Finally, I don't mean butter up

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.190
There is Coca Cola Red Sparks in Google app

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.190
Even before Mr. Sorimachi asked me to talk
here

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:19.190
My team

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:20.190
We ask all our players to install these 4
apps to their smartphones

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.010
Thanks to these, it has helped us a lot, this
is true

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.180
Firstly, we asked everyone to make a Gmail
account

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:30.870
And, if we need to announce or share something,
we can contact them immediately

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:34.860
These can be changes in schedule, or watch
this match

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.790
Or when something else happens, we can manage
everything in one place

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.171
There is Google Drive, but we put all the
compressed data in Drive

00:46:40.171 --> 00:46:41.171
The players use their smartphones, iPads

00:46:41.171 --> 00:46:42.171
Tablets or desktop to download these

00:46:42.171 --> 00:46:43.171
In this training camp, you will see the pictures
later, we also used it

00:46:43.171 --> 00:46:44.171
It has been very helpful

00:46:44.171 --> 00:46:45.420
There is also playbooks, we send all the files

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.420
Then we used the calendar for schedules

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.420
In meetings we also have foreigners and Japanese

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.420
We don't speak English at all

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.420
And we have an interpreter while the coach
is a foreigner

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.340
Then the coach would speak in English, and
we wonder what they talk about

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.730
We might understand some of it, then the interpreter
would talk straight

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:57.060
Then it would get confusing for the meeting

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.060
to be clear

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.060
We put the meeting agenda in the calendar
first

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.560
Then, it would be easier to follow the conversations

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.770
The meeting minute would then be uploaded
to drive, and send through Email

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.970
Finally, we use Youtube to share the matches
the players should watch

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:13.330
We would look through the videos to visualize
the kind of game we want to play

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.150
We ask them to check some pages

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:16.830
This is something we ask them to do

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:21.290
In actual, the AD Japan 2015 we saw earlier

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.290
They were all using this

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.440
What we did was called the analyst immediately
and asked to use it

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.100
Thankfully, everything else is free aside
from the communication fee

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.100
Thank you very much, it has been great help

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.100
This allows us to have very creative meetings

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.100
This is what it looks like

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.100
This is after getting back to the hotel yesterday

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.100
They would all put it in their tablets

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.100
And watch it right there

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.440
This is a foreign player, and there is one
spot in the hotel that has strong wifi

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.720
He was just watching all night

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.320
In the plane, since our base is in Fukuoka,
the time in transit is long

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.080
It takes 1 to 2 hours to Tokyo, to Hokkaido
it takes 1 to 2 hours too

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.790
Since we don't want to waste time in transit,
they would watch the videos they download

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:50.790
during transit

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.790
This is a very important time

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.360
Of course sleeping is also important

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.630
But we focus on maximizing the transit time,
and we ask them to download into their tablets

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.130
These 3, 4 apps have helped us

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:00.650
On top of that, our staffs and managers

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:01.650
We tour nationally

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.680
There are a lot places that we've never visited
before

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.400
So we open Google Map

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.860
From the moving bus we use, we check the remaining
time to arrive to the hotel

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.830
When we are about to get there, we call them
up and tell them to prepare the players

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.700
Sometimes it is also hard to get to the venue,
and we check if there are convenience stores

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.700
around

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.960
Or what are other establishments there are
close by

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.290
The traffic and all other information, we
research everything

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.170
Lastly, there is translations during communication
with foreign staff

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.390
It is hard to always have the interpreter
around

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.080
We use these tools

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.530
To read English documents, and also partially
for when communicating

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.780
It has helped us a lot in these situations

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.480
In moving around in the field, and coming
up with data

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.270
Thankfully, we just use Google apps

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:40.850
To finish it off, we continue to fight to
win

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:42.670
We say that this is how we utilize data

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:43.670
But your apps have managed to help us with
this

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:44.670
We would like to finish this year by winning

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:45.670
We also have games in Tokyo, we hope that
you can come and see us play

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.670
This is where I end my talk

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:47.670
This was about the utilization of data in
rugby

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:48.670
That is all

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:48.674
Thank you very much
