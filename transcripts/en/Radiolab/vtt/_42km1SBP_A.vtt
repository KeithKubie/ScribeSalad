1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.560
Yes.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.670
<v 1>All right, great. You're listening to radio,</v>

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.780
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio.

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.190
[inaudible]

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.500
<v 0>c. N. N. P. R. This is radio lab.</v>

6
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:18.500
I'm Jad welcome to the podcast this week.

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.920
We've got an event to commemorate 104 years ago on a coldish blustery day in

8
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.720
North Carolina on the beach.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.270
Two brothers figured out how to get a plane off the ground.

10
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.083
And because of this,

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.990
we can now take vacations in far away places we can, uh,

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.140
overnight packages to one another. But the,

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.020
the interesting thing is if you go back in time and you look at that moment,

14
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:48.650
you realize it was not inevitable. It didn't have to be that way.

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.800
Suppose that's true at any moment history. But in this one in particular,

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.820
and I'll just give you an example,

17
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.560
a German guy by the name of Auto Lillian Thall.

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.940
He would have been the first had it not been for, uh,

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.320
a Sunday in 1896 he tried to take off in his plane.

20
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.480
It soared for a beat and then nosedived and crashed.

21
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:15.050
He broke his back and story. Ghost is dying.

22
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:18.860
Words were sacrifices must be made.

23
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.603
<v 2>Oh,</v>

24
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
<v 0>in the story, you're going to hear a lot of voices from uh,</v>

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.990
the Smithsonian national air and space museum. A couple of experts,

26
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.760
some authors. And as it turns out, the great grand niece of Wilburn Orville.

27
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.223
Here it is.

28
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 3>There is something about being airborne, sort of an ethereal thing about it,</v>

29
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.930
about leaving this earth thing you burst out on top of a few little clouds.

30
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.010
Freedom, gorgeous, bright sunlight control. It's beautiful.

31
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.270
Light is such a deeply held dream. Perhaps even in [inaudible].

32
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.620
<v 1>Bye Bye. And my arrow. Bye.</v>

33
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.710
<v 0>Interesting to see how early the Wright brothers became interested in flight in</v>

34
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.550
1878 when Wilbur is 11 and Orville is seven,

35
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.430
their father comes back from another church trip.

36
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:10.120
Their father was a bishop and I brought a president

37
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.600
<v 1>for the some day when we own our own little helicopter,</v>

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.780
<v 0>there's a little helicopter toy. Ah, ah,</v>

39
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.190
it was a little propeller. You know, you wind it up and let it go.

40
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.170
And the boys played with this. Yeah,

41
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:26.260
they played and played and that broke pretty quickly. Broke it.

42
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.830
And then instead of going on to the next toy, I guess as most kids would,

43
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.120
these guys began building their own version, experiment, Ting,

44
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.440
making their own designs. Look,

45
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.150
any airplane is going to be a complex machine that's made up of three systems,

46
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.490
four forces going to have to have wings,

47
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:47.260
dynamic lifts that will lift you into the air.

48
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.620
It's for us propulsion that will move you forward fast enough,

49
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:54.370
aerodynamic drag of resistance and you're going to have to have a way to control

50
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:56.470
this thing once it's in the air.

51
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.010
Now flight control was one issue

52
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 3>that almost nobody else had given any serious thought to.</v>

53
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.570
Many of the folks that were also looking at this problem or are looking at

54
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.330
thrust and power sort of fell back on fat. Well,

55
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.830
if we just get a light enough engine,

56
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.010
then we can find and the Wright brothers right out of the bag did just the

57
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.260
opposite. The Wright brothers who are far more sophisticated,

58
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.050
Howard flight or anything like that, that could come later.

59
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080
They decide to design and build a heavier than air flying machine that can be

60
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.950
absolutely controlled by the pilot. Every second it's in the air.

61
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.770
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

62
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.350
<v 3>control was the most important, um, aspect of this.</v>

63
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.380
They watch the birds, they cited them a lot, the shapes of their wings.

64
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.480
Now when a turn of a bird would elevate a wing and dip the other wing,

65
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.560
increased the angle of attack on one side and decrease it on the other,

66
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.040
they were trying to find out, you know, how could we do that in a machine?

67
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.380
<v 0>Uncle will he literally, it is a true story.</v>

68
00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:02.600
He was literally holding an inner tube box.

69
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:07.601
Wilbur was in the bike shop and he started moving the sides of the box,

70
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.460
twisting it back and forth and opposite direction and he realized that that was

71
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.294
it.

72
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.000
<v 3>That's how you're going to achieve flight control.</v>

73
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.580
<v 5>Um, they could trip.</v>

74
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.940
Then my air ship come take a trip around the star

75
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.840
<v 3>and in the final version,</v>

76
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.090
the pilot's laying prone on the lower wing with his waist in a cradle and he

77
00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:39.500
shifts his weight to the right or left and that drags wire through the system

78
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.540
and puts a twist in the wing.

79
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.570
<v 5>Come take a trip and my air ship will visit the man and the moon</v>

80
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.400
<v 1>grew up in the fourth level of the Franklin Institute.</v>

81
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.650
And we have a storage area here.

82
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.863
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

83
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.790
<v 6>this is a photograph. Um, maybe the, uh,</v>

84
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.270
most recognizable photograph in the 20th century showing the first flight on

85
00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:15.800
December 17th, 1903,

86
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.450
they're basically at the shoreline and then you can see the,

87
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.840
the ocean in the background here.

88
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.970
See the waves being picked up here,

89
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.110
<v 1>a beautiful cold, crisp, clear day.</v>

90
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.620
A lot of wind in there.

91
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.840
The reason why they're in North Carolina is because of the great winds.

92
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.490
10 35 in the morning,

93
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.650
they've set up their little rail that they run ne right flyer along a little $4

94
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.000
set of timber that they use as a launching mechanism. But like a sled,

95
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.800
there are no wheels to this plane. And they set up their flag,

96
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.180
which was assigned to the folks at the lifesaving station to come and help them,

97
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.490
uh, set airplane on the track.

98
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.800
They look the airplane over very carefully as he did on every flight that they

99
00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:06.160
ever did. They'd flipped the coin and it was Orville's turn.

100
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.200
Orville got it on board before that,

101
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.410
they had had a moment of sounds where they shook hands when they started the

102
00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:12.244
engines.

103
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.530
And this little airplane of Muslin and bicycle chains and spruce rumbled down

104
00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:27.360
the track and took off.

105
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.180
Has it launches. Second Merkel occurs,

106
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:36.950
the man designated to snap the shutter on the camera does so precisely at the

107
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.760
point that Oroville breaks ground and is flying.

108
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.180
You can see it's maybe three or four feet off off the ground.

109
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.170
And here is Wilbur over on the ride running alongside of it. Yeah.

110
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.580
Goodwill ran along the right edge of one wing and held it steady.

111
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.920
Help steady it a bit and you can see his tracks in the sand and the s and the

112
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:01.890
famous picture or Valette only flown 120 feet and 12 seconds.

113
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.080
But on the last flight, the fourth flight, Wilbur flies 850,

114
00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:11.970
two feet and 59 seconds. Uh, he's in the air almost a minute.

115
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.680
<v 3>Well, they changed the world forever. I,</v>

116
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.810
I can't think of anything that is, um, uh,

117
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.230
until the computer brought our world closer.

118
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:35.231
We went from determining distance in the miles between two places to determining

119
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.420
it in ours.

120
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.050
It was a vast accelerator of progress had they feel on December 17th and quit

121
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:45.014
flying,

122
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.490
flying with probably have been postponed by 10 years because at that moment in

123
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:52.010
time, the rights were fully 10 years ahead of everybody.

124
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.200
Now that at 10 years doesn't sound like a great deal until you factor.

125
00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:00.740
In August of 1914, world war one began,

126
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.300
the French had about 140 airplanes. The British had about 180 airplanes,

127
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.400
German dead, about 250 airplanes.

128
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.680
They all had air forces that wouldn't have happened,

129
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:11.930
had rights not flown on that day at that moment.

130
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.670
But when you step back from that, even in a normal year,

131
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.380
10 million people will walk through the doors of the national air and Space

132
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.040
Museum. That's more people than go to the British Museum of the Lu.

133
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.040
They walk through the front door, that museum,

134
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.830
and there's the world's first airplane, the real thing,

135
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.950
and hanging right above it is the spirit of St Louis.

136
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.250
The first airplane to fly faster than sound.

137
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.260
That capsule in which John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth.

138
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.010
People just look around and they say, wow.

139
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.870
Before Wilbur and Orville give really good here,

140
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.680
ordinary people in the streets say, if God had wanted us to fly,

141
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:55.980
you would given us wings

142
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.180
<v 0>after the, what you hear people say is, if we can do that,</v>

143
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.190
if human beings can do that,

144
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.020
<v 4>okay,</v>

145
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.410
<v 0>can't we do the futures? Whatever anyone can dream.</v>

146
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:17.980
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

147
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.450
<v 0>104 years ago this week,</v>

148
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.640
the birth of flying that piece featured the voices of Tom Crouch,

149
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.420
who is the director of the national air and Space Museum. Walter Boyd,

150
00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:31.060
who's the former director of initial air and Space Museum,

151
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.100
Dr Jane Palace in Aeronautical Engineer and leader of the right. Again,

152
