you know one of the oldest questions I

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:07.229
you know one of the oldest questions I
 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.230
you know one of the oldest questions I
think humankind is asked is if there's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
think humankind is asked is if there's
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720
think humankind is asked is if there's
other life in the universe is it very

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
other life in the universe is it very
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.340
other life in the universe is it very
very different from us or is it very

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350
very different from us or is it very
 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.619
very different from us or is it very
similar and you know even when it comes

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629
similar and you know even when it comes
 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.570
similar and you know even when it comes
to the microbial level even like very

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
to the microbial level even like very
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.970
to the microbial level even like very
small like bacteria things you know

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
small like bacteria things you know
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.290
small like bacteria things you know
right now we're exploring the solar

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
right now we're exploring the solar
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.180
right now we're exploring the solar
system looking for evidence of life on

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190
system looking for evidence of life on
 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.640
system looking for evidence of life on
Mars or on some of the icy moons of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
Mars or on some of the icy moons of
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.410
Mars or on some of the icy moons of
Jupiter and Saturn there there oceans

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
Jupiter and Saturn there there oceans
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.170
Jupiter and Saturn there there oceans
underneath the ice and even if we found

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180
underneath the ice and even if we found
 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.910
underneath the ice and even if we found
a microbe I think one of the first

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
a microbe I think one of the first
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.770
a microbe I think one of the first
questions is does it have something like

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
questions is does it have something like
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.100
questions is does it have something like
DNA is it similarly put together the way

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
DNA is it similarly put together the way
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290
DNA is it similarly put together the way
we are or is it something very different

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
we are or is it something very different
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139
we are or is it something very different
even at the microbial level and then you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
even at the microbial level and then you
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000
even at the microbial level and then you
take that question and you move even

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
take that question and you move even
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680
take that question and you move even
farther I mean what would aliens that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
farther I mean what would aliens that
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569
farther I mean what would aliens that
are more evolved look like aliens that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
are more evolved look like aliens that
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.310
are more evolved look like aliens that
maybe even have advanced civilizations

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
maybe even have advanced civilizations
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920
maybe even have advanced civilizations
and this is one of these things where

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
and this is one of these things where
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590
and this is one of these things where
I'm very aware of the limits of human

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
I'm very aware of the limits of human
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.780
I'm very aware of the limits of human
imagination you know I mean Einstein

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790
imagination you know I mean Einstein
 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.370
imagination you know I mean Einstein
famously said you know the universe is

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380
famously said you know the universe is
 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.470
famously said you know the universe is
not stranger than we do imagine it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
not stranger than we do imagine it's
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.560
not stranger than we do imagine it's
stranger than we can imagine and I think

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
stranger than we can imagine and I think
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.600
stranger than we can imagine and I think
that a lot of times people say well we

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
that a lot of times people say well we
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130
that a lot of times people say well we
have one evidence of how life started

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
have one evidence of how life started
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.649
have one evidence of how life started
and how life can exist and it sort of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
and how life can exist and it sort of
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.029
and how life can exist and it sort of
makes sense that maybe something similar

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039
makes sense that maybe something similar
 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.620
makes sense that maybe something similar
would have started on on different

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
would have started on on different
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.440
would have started on on different
planets I think actually when when you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
planets I think actually when when you
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.029
planets I think actually when when you
when you think about civilizations

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039
when you think about civilizations
 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.309
when you think about civilizations
aliens out there that are advanced that

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319
aliens out there that are advanced that
 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.419
aliens out there that are advanced that
maybe even have more advanced

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429
maybe even have more advanced
 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.849
maybe even have more advanced
civilizations than we do the thing that

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859
civilizations than we do the thing that
 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.309
civilizations than we do the thing that
I really can't get around is that I

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:25.319
I really can't get around is that I
 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.620
I really can't get around is that I
think that the definition of being human

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
think that the definition of being human
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690
think that the definition of being human
is about to change a lot in the next

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
is about to change a lot in the next
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.529
is about to change a lot in the next
century I think that humans and AIS and

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539
century I think that humans and AIS and
 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.660
century I think that humans and AIS and
computers will begin to merge actually

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
computers will begin to merge actually
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190
computers will begin to merge actually
become somewhat indistinguishable from

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
become somewhat indistinguishable from
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.230
become somewhat indistinguishable from
each other this is not some Terminator

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
each other this is not some Terminator
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.209
each other this is not some Terminator
scenario of the AIS taking over and

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219
scenario of the AIS taking over and
 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.279
scenario of the AIS taking over and
destroying everything but you know for

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289
destroying everything but you know for
 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.779
destroying everything but you know for
example I have a friend who has cochlear

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789
example I have a friend who has cochlear
 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.789
example I have a friend who has cochlear
implants he was profoundly deaf and then

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
implants he was profoundly deaf and then
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.069
implants he was profoundly deaf and then
had cochlear implants put in and I've

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
had cochlear implants put in and I've
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289
had cochlear implants put in and I've
gone to classical music concerts with

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
gone to classical music concerts with
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.789
gone to classical music concerts with
him I remember I went to go see Carmen

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
him I remember I went to go see Carmen
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.849
him I remember I went to go see Carmen
and there were tears you know rolling

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859
and there were tears you know rolling
 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.469
and there were tears you know rolling
down his face as he was listening to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
down his face as he was listening to
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.969
down his face as he was listening to
Carmen and he knows that he doesn't hear

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
Carmen and he knows that he doesn't hear
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.699
Carmen and he knows that he doesn't hear
like a human being hears there are wires

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709
like a human being hears there are wires
 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.620
like a human being hears there are wires
that are directly implanted into his

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
that are directly implanted into his
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.180
that are directly implanted into his
brain that stimulate the auditory

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
brain that stimulate the auditory
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.380

section it never goes through an ear and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
section it never goes through an ear and

he upgrades his software every now and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
he upgrades his software every now and
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.320
he upgrades his software every now and
then and then he hears differently all

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
then and then he hears differently all
 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.730
then and then he hears differently all
of a sudden the sounds are different and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
of a sudden the sounds are different and
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.090
of a sudden the sounds are different and
he

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100
he
 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.650
he
here's different ranges depending on how

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660
here's different ranges depending on how
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.140
here's different ranges depending on how
his software has been updated but it's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
his software has been updated but it's
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.940
his software has been updated but it's
he always reminds me that what

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
he always reminds me that what
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.820
he always reminds me that what
technology did for him was make him more

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
technology did for him was make him more
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.140
technology did for him was make him more
connected more emotional I remember

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
connected more emotional I remember
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.520
connected more emotional I remember
somebody was colorblind but they

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
somebody was colorblind but they
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.810
somebody was colorblind but they
actually have an auditory cue as to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
actually have an auditory cue as to
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.220
actually have an auditory cue as to
color and so it sort of changed the way

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
color and so it sort of changed the way
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830
color and so it sort of changed the way
their brain responds the implants that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
their brain responds the implants that
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.570
their brain responds the implants that
are coming and they will be coming soon

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
are coming and they will be coming soon
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.630
are coming and they will be coming soon
you know once you could implant

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640
you know once you could implant
 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.160
you know once you could implant
artificial ears and people why just here

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
artificial ears and people why just here
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.990
artificial ears and people why just here
with the range of a human right why not

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
with the range of a human right why not
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970
with the range of a human right why not
here with the range of a dog or a whale

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
here with the range of a dog or a whale
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.490
here with the range of a dog or a whale
or a bird that can hear much higher and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
or a bird that can hear much higher and
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740
or a bird that can hear much higher and
lower pitch frequencies that we can that

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
lower pitch frequencies that we can that
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.170
lower pitch frequencies that we can that
will come soon and then when we can

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
will come soon and then when we can
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.240
will come soon and then when we can
augment our eyes why just see visible

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
augment our eyes why just see visible
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.520
augment our eyes why just see visible
light why not see x-rays and ultraviolet

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
light why not see x-rays and ultraviolet
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.960
light why not see x-rays and ultraviolet
and infrared light and everything that's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
and infrared light and everything that's
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.750
and infrared light and everything that's
out there I don't think there's any way

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
out there I don't think there's any way
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.020
out there I don't think there's any way
around this that the aliens we're going

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030
around this that the aliens we're going
 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.270
around this that the aliens we're going
to encounter if they are advanced from

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
to encounter if they are advanced from
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.810
to encounter if they are advanced from
us by many centuries of technology are

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820
us by many centuries of technology are
 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.610
us by many centuries of technology are
going to be indistinguishable from a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620
going to be indistinguishable from a
 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.730
going to be indistinguishable from a
eyes and I don't think we are looking

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740
eyes and I don't think we are looking
 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.610
eyes and I don't think we are looking
for a biological life I think we should

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
for a biological life I think we should
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.620
for a biological life I think we should
spend more time thinking about what life

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
spend more time thinking about what life
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.770
spend more time thinking about what life
really will evolve into it may be that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
really will evolve into it may be that
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.380
really will evolve into it may be that
the biological being that I am was just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
the biological being that I am was just
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.540
the biological being that I am was just
a first stage in evolution and a

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550
a first stage in evolution and a
 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.640
a first stage in evolution and a
necessary and and maybe even beautiful

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
necessary and and maybe even beautiful
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.340
necessary and and maybe even beautiful
next step in evolution is for us to be

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350
next step in evolution is for us to be
 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.350
next step in evolution is for us to be
augmented and maybe someday to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360
augmented and maybe someday to
 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.860
augmented and maybe someday to
completely design our artificial bodies

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870
completely design our artificial bodies
 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.720
completely design our artificial bodies
when you design your own body to suit

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
when you design your own body to suit
 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.600
when you design your own body to suit
any environment you want why look like a

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610
any environment you want why look like a
 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.150
any environment you want why look like a
human I mean maybe you want to maybe you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
human I mean maybe you want to maybe you
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.550
human I mean maybe you want to maybe you
want to be a piece of foil that spreads

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560
want to be a piece of foil that spreads
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800
want to be a piece of foil that spreads
itself across you know square kilometers

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
itself across you know square kilometers
 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.200
itself across you know square kilometers
to actually fly on solar winds and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210
to actually fly on solar winds and
 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.310
to actually fly on solar winds and
actually move around through solar

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320
actually move around through solar
 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.410
actually move around through solar
systems maybe you look nothing like a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420
systems maybe you look nothing like a
 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.820
systems maybe you look nothing like a
human maybe you have nothing like a

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830
human maybe you have nothing like a
 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.720
human maybe you have nothing like a
human life so this is not a scary

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730
human life so this is not a scary
 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.670
human life so this is not a scary
science fiction scenario I'm not saying

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
science fiction scenario I'm not saying
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.870
science fiction scenario I'm not saying
that we're going to be overrun and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
that we're going to be overrun and
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.350
that we're going to be overrun and
destroyed by the AIS but I don't know

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360
destroyed by the AIS but I don't know
 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.660
destroyed by the AIS but I don't know
how you get around very advanced

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670
how you get around very advanced
 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.730
how you get around very advanced
civilizations having gone through an

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740
civilizations having gone through an
 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.039
civilizations having gone through an
augmentation stage and I think the next

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
augmentation stage and I think the next
 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.390
augmentation stage and I think the next
stage in our evolution will most likely

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
stage in our evolution will most likely
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.210
stage in our evolution will most likely
be that and I think maybe we shouldn't

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220
be that and I think maybe we shouldn't
 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.190
be that and I think maybe we shouldn't
be looking in environments just like the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
be looking in environments just like the
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.350
be looking in environments just like the
earth that maybe where life started but

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
earth that maybe where life started but
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.210
earth that maybe where life started but
truly evolved civilizations left that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
truly evolved civilizations left that
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.120
truly evolved civilizations left that
that biological necessity behind long

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130
that biological necessity behind long
 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.740
that biological necessity behind long
ago as fury

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750
ago as fury
 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.600
ago as fury
but like I said this this guy his name

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
but like I said this this guy his name
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.040
but like I said this this guy his name
is Michael with the cochlear implants I

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
is Michael with the cochlear implants I
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.480
is Michael with the cochlear implants I
mean he's like you know why do we assume

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
mean he's like you know why do we assume
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.160
mean he's like you know why do we assume
technology's gonna keep us apart from

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170
technology's gonna keep us apart from
 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.990
technology's gonna keep us apart from
each other and make us less human it

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000
each other and make us less human it
 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.260
each other and make us less human it
might make us even more human

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270
 
 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.510
