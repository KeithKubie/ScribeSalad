00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.610
Alright, so I want to relate my band object to my stage object.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.920
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.990
&gt;&gt; So I'm guessing I'm going to drag either look up or master detail.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.670
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.020
&gt;&gt; And I know we're into some trouble

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.880
with that earlier so, which one should I use?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.020
&gt;&gt; There's are a lot of differences between the look up and the

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.260
master detail, but one of the core differences, is that a look up

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.160
relationship is not a required field

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.110
whereas with the master detail, its automatically

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.350
required. And since, in the case of our schema, a band might necessarily

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.460
be created without already being booked, to a

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.920
stage or scheduled for a stage, so we'd want

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.750
to choose look-up in that case, so it doesn't

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.710
require that field when you create a band record.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.
