up happening is you're constantly saying
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.830
up happening is you're constantly saying
yes and maybe resentment builds up and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
yes and maybe resentment builds up and
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.620
yes and maybe resentment builds up and
then instead of actually engaging and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
then instead of actually engaging and
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.839
then instead of actually engaging and
having a conversation we might just end

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

because there's just too much pressure
in it so there are three boundaries that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
in it so there are three boundaries that
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.209
in it so there are three boundaries that
are useful one is simply saying I'm

should know the potential consequences
and then the last piece of it is to be

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070
and then the last piece of it is to be
 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.880
and then the last piece of it is to be
is to get their assent in other words to
