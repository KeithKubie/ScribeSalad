00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.270
I'm really interested in and terms and
conditions

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.569
and I don't think most people know what
the terms and conditions are.

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.389
[When you say terms and conditions explain to
people that typical moment so they can

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.809
really think "I know what he's talking

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.600
about.]  I think of what is ridiculous--when you

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.529
try and buy something off an app store and a tiny window will pop up

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.539
and it will say "Terms and conditions do you agree to them?"

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.810
and you have page one of 312

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.910
and then a button that says "accept." Empirically what

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.290
appears to happen is people tend to
spend about one and a half to two

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.079
seconds

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.800
between opening the terms conditions and
clicking the accept button.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.520
[Say that again?]  This, roughly, this span, between one and a half and two seconds

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.010
between having these documents presented
to them and clicking the accept button.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.059
[Do you read the pages because you are
like this expert and you know the pitfalls.]

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.210
What do you do as an individual?
I am

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.930
an individual. I do exactly the same as
everyone else,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.879
with probably one caveat and the caveat
would be that

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.920
I minimize my risk by having little

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.740
presence on the web.  So I for example do not use Facebook

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909
don't use Twitter.  [But generally you say
you do what everyone else does, what does

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.740
everyone do?]

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.890
No one scrolls through those three
hundred and odd pages

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.450
or even sends the PDF no one's got time. They just say yes

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.920
And they presume that that's okay. Broadly speaking that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.049
kind of "buyer beware" model

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.340
is risky, and it's risky as more and more
personal information gets captured

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.400
and could be used for different
purposes and in different ways

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.750
so I think that we need to think much
more carefully about that

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.939
than we do.  By analogy

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.750
the last time you got a loan, what happened?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.100
[I had to fill out a lot of papers and
it took

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.000
couple weeks.]  Do you remember the sheet
at the front which said "key facts?"

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.020
[Yeah, they do give you like an idiots' guide.]

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.380
Yet we don't have that for these terms and conditions. So there isn't

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.060
so there isn't a kind of key facts for what you are agreeing to. [Like an executive summary.]

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.429
Yeah,

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.400
well it's like what all they can and can't do with the data

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.870
who will, and what your rates of withdraw are.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.030
[This sounds really fascinating, and it sounds
really important. It doesn't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.849
feel like Computer Sciences. Is this computer
science? Or is this

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.840
sort of the kind of interface?]  I think that the answer to that is that it is the computer science I do,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.520
I think it is fundamentally computer science, and I think it's fundamentally to computer science,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.440
because of a notion that I call
"responsible innovation" because

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.120
if we are building systems and tools that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.209
capture information off people, analyze those information

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.319
and make suggestions

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.820
which had profound impact on their lives,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.200
then we have to do this in the context of understanding their rights

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.300
and
responsibilities and engaging with them

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.810
as an individual as well.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.940
So part of this is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.680
building the tools to let that happen.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.440
So we have constructed a little plug in that you can get

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.840
for the Chrome broswer which will look at the terms and conditions and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.950
measure that complexity for you. There is an algorithm called SMOG

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.480
which stands for simple metric gobbledygook. It allows you to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.460
get a measure of how complex that text is and how dense that text is.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.420
We were able to then map that

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.620
in the UK context onto

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.690
educational attainment levels.
So essentially

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.830
how much education would you have to have done in

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.450
order to be able to read the document
that complex.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.209
The basic principle of this is that
what you do is you sample

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.500
the start of the beginning of the document and you look at particular measures

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.269
across this.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.540
Long words, how many are small.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.080
How long sentences are, how many secondary clauses there are.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.459
So what you actually do is develop a set of matrix which

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.790
allow you to measure those and you combine
those metrics together

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.189
and normalize them so that you have a
measure which

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.209
shows you that these are small sentences
with small words,

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.419
big complex sentences, large paragraphs,

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.320
with large words.  What we found was that
to be able to read

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.350
the terms and conditions, in this case for the utilities companies

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.100
for the people who

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.720
supply us all with energy, it meant that you actually had to have

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.790
a tertiary level education.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.520
So you need at least are bachelor's degree, most likely a master's

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.699
or post doctoral level of qualification.

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.060
So, you need this in order to be able to understand the density of that text.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.990
So that means for large segments of the
population

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.040
that haven't gone... they haven't got a
reading level

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.979
that will allow them read that text. 
So obviously the easy answers is, "But this

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.600
is a legal text and you need to be a lawyer to understand it."

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.410
Well actually it's written in such a
manner that it's just hard to follow.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.110
Okay so the second part what we did to
this was we

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.310
said, well how will people make sense of this?

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.550
We marked those then to books that
they may have read

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.320
so you know... so for example and books
like Beowolf or,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.470
Gulliver's Travels or

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.509
all these great classics that we all feel we should have read.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.530
They all just lie somewhere on our shelves.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.430
Because we got through the first few pages and thought "This is hard work."

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.380
We matched them to those and we found that that was really quite surprising.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.300
So, you know, for example Google's most

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.389
recent changes terms and conditions are

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.130
equivalent in complexity to Beowolf,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.419
which very few of us have managed to read all the way through.  [That is a complicated book.]

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.169
Too complex for me.  And similarly

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.449
and the banking sites--when we ran their text through this

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.780
they found the equivalent to Nietzsche.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.100
And again Nietzsche
is an achievement.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.280
So the point here actually is what are
we giving up

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.039
when we can't read the text?  To explain what is it we are giving up

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.250
And I think part we want to try and
understand is

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.350
How people make use of that data in a big data world

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.210
and how we may try and understand what we will give up

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.360
and what we will agree to.  [Professor, these are important deals though that have been done though.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.140
These are complicated concepts involving money and copyrights and licensing of products.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.520
I mean, these can't be "The cat sat on the mat."

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.840
or are you suggesting that they are deliberately hiding truth behind....]

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.289
So, I wouldn't want to suggest that they are 
deliberately hiding truth...

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.420
but to be honest, I think we have all been a bit too comfortable

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.759
and a bit too lazy about what we're doing here

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.729
and so I would like us to change how we
think about this before

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.910
legislation has to happen to make people
change these things.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.120
[From my watching a TV show yes I know
that when someone signs a contract if

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.319
they don't know what they were signing

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.960
the contract can become null and void
can't it?  If you just click after

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.410
one-and-a-half seconds you haven't
really made an informed decision.]

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.680
Indeed and actually legally whether
that even enforceable in the UK

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.080
is actually interesting question. So the so most
of the stuff is copy and paste from

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.479
the Midwest legally. However, there is a

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:33.370
notion of normal expectancy and what is normally expected and

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.199
normally sought.  And a lot of what happens in these terms and conditions

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.590
are principally about the second-order
right.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.780
Okay, by which I mean and you saying
with

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.069
uhm, a company, for example one of your
utility suppliers

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.560
and within the terms and conditions you
find that they will

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.900
have the rights to release your data in particular ways.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.009
So for example one in of the terms and conditions I read recently

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:08.550
has right to supply to any other families or to sell

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.830
the records of your bills

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.490
you bill payments and any additional
notes that they may have made about you.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.990
So therefore means that there is a kind of release of information out there

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.199
that you neither know of or can't control.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.020
[Does this scare you?]

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.360
Yes, as it should.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.020
[Alright before we...]  Well, well..it does me, and I think there in lies

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:41.209
actually the real issue... it scares me because

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:44.600
I've got lots of training to understand what data does and how the data

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.930
data was analyzed.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.740
My research is actually about
people don't have the

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.040
that risk perception.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.269
Actually what is interesting in terms of the legislation framework

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:58.540
that exists at present is we are undergoing a shift.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.880
We are undergoing a shift from the emphasis being

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.000
and responsibilities for these things
lying with

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.070
us to them lying with the data handlers.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.980
To lying with big business.

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:18.200
These are, at one point and this has been contended, but
at one point

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.110
created an algorithm which would with a
shared credit  link to individuals a

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.890
who were a couple and be able to predict
divorce within two years.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.430
Often before individuals himself has an
awareness themselves.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.540
[Other window] Delete all your files.  You run this
algorithm to rewrite all file contents

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.720
and erase them and lord and behold all the content
is still there.
