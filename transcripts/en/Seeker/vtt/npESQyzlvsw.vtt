00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.290
dung, doo doo, droppings, crap, scat.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.899
Whatever you want to call it.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.629
Poop is pretty useful.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.599
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.610
While we tend to think of excrement as extremely
gross and want to get it as far far far away

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.580
from us as possible, nature has a different
way of dealing with doo doo.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.150
In a closed ecosystem, nothing goes to waste.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.340
Not even waste.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
For some animals it’s normal and healthy
to eat their own poop, which is called coprophagy.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.100
Mice and capybaras eat their own waste to
get more nutrients that passed through their

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.060
body might have missed the first time.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.980
And farmers know the importance of waste in
nurturing their crops.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.310
but feces aren’t just good for fertilizing.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.940
According to some research millions of tons
of dung enters Africa’s aquatic ecosystems

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.070
every year.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.140
Some researchers think high concentrations
of excrement leads to fish die offs.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950
But new research suggests it might be good
for the fish!

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.230
A recent study published in the journal Ecosphere
found that hippo poop feeds river fish.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.800
Researchers from the UC Santa Barbara used
chemical markers to follow the trail from

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.150
beneath the hippos tail to the tissue of fish
in the river.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.360
Their research showed that the fish were getting
important nutrients from the poo.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.830
This was especially true when water levels
were low.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.870
Then the hippo poo was more concentrated and
the fish could make better use of the nutrients.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.040
The research confirms that hippos can have
a huge impact on the ecosystem.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.120
Some scat helps to spread seeds.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.570
Lots of birds eat seeds then drop them off
in some distant wood.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.340
This helps spread the species further than
it normally would.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.981
One study published in the journal Ecology
Letters found that passing through the gut

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:32.300
of a sky bird changes the seeds for the better.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.500
A small tropical bird, Elaenias, feeds on
the seeds of a wild chili pepper plant.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.920
After going through the bowels of the bird,
the seeds chances of survival increase 370

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.920
percent!

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.729
The researchers found that being eaten and
then passed made the seed less aromatic and

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.090
appealing to seed-eating plants and it removed
some of the harmful pathogens that could kill

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.090
the seed.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.560
Fish feces even builds beaches!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.350
You know how beautiful those pristine white
beaches in Hawaii are?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.350
Yeah.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.350
That’s fish poop.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.350
Seriously.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.910
Parrot fish, so named because they have sharp,
beak-like teeth, naw off algae that grows

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.910
on corals.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.670
Along with the algae, the fish gets a mouthful
of the coral’s calcium carbonate, which

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.140
it expels as waste.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.370
Some estimates say that a single parrot fish
can poop out 800 pounds of sand a year!

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.451
That’ll be fun to think about on your next
vacation.

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.340
And don’t think humans are immune to this.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.620
I mean we love our fertilizer.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.620
And um.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.819
Cat poop coffee exists.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.560
In the Sumatran Jungle lives a small-cat like
critter called the civet.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.060
This cat loves coffee berries, but its gut
doesn’t digest the bean.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.590
As the cat passes the bean, its anal glands
release a musky scent onto the bean.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.349
And this apparently makes for good, well..
at least expensive coffee.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.650
It can cost as much as 600 bucks a pound!

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.650
I…

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.650
I uh..

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.650
I think I’ll stick to my cup of Earl Grey.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.630
Speaking of all the good things poop can do,
human fecal transplants can save lives!

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.860
Get the scoop on this miracle cure from our
sister show Seeker Stories.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.810
Check out that video here.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:05.010
What do you 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.220
think about all the great things doo doo can
do?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.569
Would you drink a cup of crappy coffee in
the morning?

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:18.930
