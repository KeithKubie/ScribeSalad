00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840
&gt;&gt; MASTRACCI: My name is Matt Mastracci. I'm
the founder of dotspots. At dotspots, we allow

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.290
users to create dots or miniature blog posts
with media that are attached to news articles,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.470
and then we distribute those dots automatically
everywhere people are talking about the same

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.009
thing. We've, we've been using GWT for a couple
of years now. When we originally picked it,

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.760
the reason was because we, we wanted to share
code between our Java back end and whatever

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.480
front ends that we were going to build in
the future. So, GWT, of course, is an obvious

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.460
choice for this because you get to use one
language for everything, you entire code base;

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.829
back end, front end, and compile, compile
a whole bunch of things from one code base.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:02.460
So, why don't I--I'll show you our product
here. So I've got Firefox running, and you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.680
can see the small icon up here. This is actually
our GWT application compiled as a Firefox

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.320
extension. So, a Firefox extension is just
JavaScript and of course, GWT is Java to JavaScript

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.549
compiler so, we just take the output from
our GWT compile and we load it up in Firefox

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.530
and it appears in the browser. Now, what this
lets us do is we actually listen for selections

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.479
in the browser, so we bring up this tool kit
here. Now, I've done an article here, it was

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:45.200
written a couple of days ago on Google's busy
week. Now, if you look down here on Tuesday,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.439
they say that, the Chrome for Mac data finally
gets released. Now, you'll notice that there's

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.830
nothing about GWT 2.0 here so, I'm just going
to add a dot here just to, to correct this.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.190
So, you can see here as well. We've already,
we've, we've seen this article before and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.329
we know of three articles at least where people
are talking about this, this specific thing

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:18.829
here; so I'm going to add this dot. Okay.
So, I'm just going to--I took a picture earlier

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:26.049
these cool little campfires so, I'm going
say, here's a picture of the campfire, one

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:36.260
of the campfires. And I took this picture
as we were setting up. Now I'm going to upload

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.819
that file from the pictures directory, okay,
here we go. Try that up, and we'll publish.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:54.370
Oops, here we go. Okay. So now you've seen--what
I've done is I've actually added a dot to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.999
this article, that's going to be visible every
time somebody, every time one of our users

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:05.559
comes here. Now, it's actually distributed
to a bunch of other pages here a well. You

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:13.129
can see Washington Post seeking alpha.com,
so. Basically, that's what dotspots does.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:22.239
We try to, you know, magnify the stuff you're
doing as much as we can. So, one of the big

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.989
advantages of GWT is as I mentioned before,
you can compile a number of different targets

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.239
from the same code base. So, you can see here,
we've compiled our Firefox extension. We also

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.660
compile a Chrome extension. We've actually,
you can find that on the Chrome extension

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.239
gallery. We've got a script version that publishers
can include and basically, what that does

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.709
is it turns on dotspots on their site without,
basically so anyone coming to their site can

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.590
optionally add but definitely view dots on
their site. And, you know, we've got, we've

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.790
got something for our word press users as
well so they can do the same thing with a

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.230
very simple word press plugin. So what--another
big advantage of a GWT especially in GWT 2.0

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.440
is this new development mode plugin that they've
just launched. Now, development mode lets

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.630
us make changes very quickly without having
to felt having to go through the entire, sorry,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.850
the entire GWT compile process which of course
is slightly slower. But, anyways, let me just

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.450
quickly bring up our website here. Now you
can see our website is based on GWT. The dot

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.660
that I just created is sitting right here
at the very top. It's being rendered using

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.910
the same code that we use in the extension.
Let's say that we want to make through our

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.840
website; just the example here. The, if you
click on this profile image here, we actually

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.660
haven't hooked it up yet. So, I'm just going
to show you how easily I can change this behavior

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.980
of our website using this development mode.
So I'm going to back to Eclipse here. I started

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.900
the development mode from this run target.
I've actually I already got it running; you

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.440
can see down here the development mode console's
already going here. It gives us a URL that

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.930
we can copy. I'm going to bring that back
to Firefox and paste it in. Now, it just takes

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.750
a second to load here. Okay. So, you can see
this label up top here. We just add a label

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.810
while I'm running in development mode, it
just helps us to know, it just reminds us

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.840
that we're running. We're now running against
the code that's, the Java code that's in eclipse

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.870
rather than the live version of our website.
So, the change I'd like to make right now,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.750
we've got this small little profile image
here, you know clicking it doesn't do anything.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.580
We'd like to pop up a big version of this
profile image. Let me go over to eclipse here.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.800
Let's see how hard it is to make this change.
I open up the code for the sidebar that I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.210
just showed you. I'm just going to find the
part of the code where we're setting up that

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.810
profile image now. I've already got the code
written ahead of time here to make this change.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.500
I'm just going to uncomment it and save it.
So what I'm doing it here is, I'm just using

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.330
a bunch of GWT building blocks. So, I've got
a pop-up panel, I create an image, I stick

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.750
it in the pop-up panel, you know, set some
sizes. Set a flag to auto hide when you click

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.990
on the page, and then we show the pop-up panel
close to the user thumbnail. It's--you know,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.540
these are a bunch of really powerful building
blocks under the hood and you know, GWT is

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.580
taking care of a lot of really cool infrastructure
here. So let's just go back here, I'm going

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.500
to refresh. This is the refresh, you know,
the development refresh cycle they're talking

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.500
about. It just make things so easy because
now, after a simple refresh, I can click that

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.720
profile image and you can see the full size
version of that image that--this is the change

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.690
I just made now and eclipse is running live.
So I mean that, it's really fast, it's really

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:16.590
easy and you know it, it's made us super productive,
so we're so happy to use it. I guess if we

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:26.990
could just go to the slides. So, in summary
here, you know, GWT has given us a whole bunch

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:33.139
of really useful tools, you know, it makes
our life easier. We developed a lot of client

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.460
facing applications; the Firefox extension,
the Chrome extension, things like that, and

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:44.920
we literally have, you know, one code base
where we just set different flags on compile,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.460
and we get the Firefox extension, the Chrome
extension or the script version for the publisher,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.990
so it makes it very easy. It's all written
in Java. You know, we use JUnit for testing

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:02.570
and things like that; a very, very familiar,
convenient environment. Multiple browser debugging,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:10.100
you know, this, just being able to load up
any browser on my machine or as Andrew mentioned

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.010
in a virtual machine and connect it to your
local code. You can just kind of step through

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:21.500
it, it's, it's fantastically useful. I mean,
you don't actually have to run--you can run

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.770
IE on it just in a virtual machine on your,
and connect to you Mac, step through the IE

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:34.009
code which is often troublesome and it makes
life a lot easier having to work with those

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:42.180
browsers. And, of course, the code size savings;
I'm just kind of give you a taste. You know,

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:50.759
we saw a 20% reduction in the output size
of our appli--our website just by recompiling

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:58.300
with GWT 2.0, I mean, that was huge for us.
Like--and we didn't have to make any changes.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.550
Now when we actually did make the changes
for the code splitting which is coming up

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:09.180
later, we sat way bigger savings as well but,
you'll see a bit more of that later. So, anyways,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:16.509
if you want to know more about how dotspots
uses GWT, take a look at our website, dotspots.com/gwt.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:22.360
We've got a little bit more info up there
as well some small tips for Google web toolkit

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:29.959
developers that will hopefully help you out.
All right, thanks very much.

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:31.029
&gt;&gt; ANDREW: Thanks, Matt.
