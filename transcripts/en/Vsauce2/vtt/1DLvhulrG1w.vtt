00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.769
A massive leap in the autonomous vehicle revolution
has arrived with the brand new Velodyne VLS-128.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.230
Ten times more powerful and a third the size
of the previous model, it uses 128 lasers

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.340
and new auto-alignment technology to map the
surrounding area with a 300 meter range.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.480
And a new study from Kyoto University’s
Primate Research Institute sheds light on

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.400
the origins of our disgust mechanism.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.150
As it turns out chimpanzees will eat seeds
from their own family’s poop right away,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.350
but hesitate before eating from stranger poop.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.350
Vsauce!

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.350
Kevin, here.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.210
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.270
After years of work by The Seasteading Institute,
Blue Frontiers is set to unveil the world’s

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.770
first floating island.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.010
The island in French Polynesia, will consist
of floating concrete upon which homes, offices,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.570
shops, restaurants, and science research centers
can be built -- and re-arranged as needed.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.079
Blue Frontiers hopes to have a dozen floating
islands that can adapt to changing sea levels

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.670
ready by 2020 and to make sustainable communities
on the ocean a viable option for 1 billion

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.510
people by 2050.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.850
Researchers at Penn State College of Medicine
believe that we can better diagnose concussions

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.719
with saliva.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.630
By testing the levels of microRNAs present
in tiny molecules of spit, the team found

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.159
more accurate diagnoses and predictions of
how long symptoms would last compared to traditional

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.679
survey tools.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.479
The quick, reliable diagnosis of concussions
and their severity would allow doctors and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.340
sports medicine professionals to harness biomarkers
to implement appropriate treatment immediately.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.259
So maybe spit analysis will be coming to a
future football sideline near you.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.149
Pills with built-in radiofrequency emittors
will make sure you take your prescriptions.

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.200
Brigham and Women’s Hospital did a pilot
study involving oxycodone equipped with ingestible

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.889
digital biosensors inside gelatin pills.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.880
The pills communicated information to doctors
who were able to see how often patients used

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.750
the potentially-addictive medication.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.530
And these monitored patients ended up taking
only a fraction of the prescription to manage

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.019
their pain -- a breakthrough that could help
rein in the growing opioid epidemic in the

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.750
United States.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.030
Another new breakthrough could make organic
semiconductors a viable alternative to silicon

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.230
in phones, TVs, and flexible electronics..

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.069
By using a new method of “doping,” which
adds impurities to semiconductors to increase

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.700
their conductivity, researchers from Princeton,
Georgia Institute of Technology, and Humbolt

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.739
University in Berlin were able to increase
conductivity by 100,000 times.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.489
This would allow for a cheaper and greener
way to create the foundation of modern electronics.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.370
Which means, that phone in your pocket could
eventually be a carbon-based life form.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.060
Kinda.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.940
Buckypaper is looking to make wearable technology
cheaper.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.269
Researchers at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering
have developed durable, highly-flexible motion

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.049
sensors using “buckypaper”, which is a
sheet of carbon nanotubes 50,000 times thinner

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.579
than a human hair.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.670
Buckypaper would allow wearable tech to stand
up to the demands of the human experience

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.390
at a fraction of the current cost.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.060
Everything from bed sheets that monitor your
sleep to shoes that count your steps and track

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.540
your posture are on the table.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.099
Don’t know what to wear?

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.409
An artificial intelligence system can learn
your style and suggest outfits.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.560
A team at the University of California San
Diego worked with Adobe to develop a trainable

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.170
AI that uses your browsing data to present
images of clothing that you’ll want to put

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.780
on -- and it can also design new pieces of
clothing based on your preferences.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.049
This could be extremely helpful for those
of us who aren’t particularly fashionable.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.969
An algorithm can now diagnose pneumonia better
than humans.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.599
Pneumonia is responsible for nearly a fifth
of deaths among children under the age of

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.100
5 worldwide and notoriously difficult to diagnose.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.480
It took the Machine Learning Group just one
week to develop the CheXNet algorithm that

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.250
analyzes images to spot markers indicating
pneumonia.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.990
After a month of learning, CheXNet was better
at identifying all 14 pathologies.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.860
According to the World Health Organization,
lower respiratory infections account for over

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.760
5% of deaths worldwide -- a number that CheXNet
is poised to reduce.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.590
3D printing silicone allows for highly-durable
models with more realistic elasticity.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.840
The Disney Research Institute has pioneered
a method of injecting a variety of materials,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.560
including water bubbles, into MetaSilicone
prints.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.590
The result is output that mirrors the elastic
complexity of the world around us -- including

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.680
creating lifelike, multi-density models of
organs that can be used for surgical training.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.890
And bunnies that can safely withstand hammers.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.910
So that's good.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.390
For a clean and easy way to watch every episode
of Mind Blow I created a Mind Blow website

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.700
with Squarespace.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.670
I’ve made a lot of websites over the years
and this was by far the most stress-free process

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.780
for making a site that looks great and works
great.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.990
You just choose a template, make it your own
and you're done.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.180
So check out the link below to start creating
your website and in the process support Mind

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.210
Blow.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.070
Which is officially back.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:50.370
I’m gonna leave you with the Raven R, the
robot Baidu hopes will be dancing in every

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:59.150
living room -- and as always, thanks for watching.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.850
Okay, mom.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.700
Bye.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.550
What're you doing, Susie?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.040
She wanted to hear the voice going through
the wire.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.270
You can't hear voices in the wire!

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.720
Well, how does it work?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.010
How'd your mother's voice get in the phone?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.010
That's simple!

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.010
It...

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.010
That's funny, I don't know.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.560
I never thought about it before.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.810
We were talking as if we were in the same
room.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.150
How does the telephone work, Uncle Bill?

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.150
Magic?

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.150
No, not magic, susie, but science.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.350
Science of sound waves and electricity.
