00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.920
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.000
write the algebraic expressions
that represent the same thing

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.930
that these statements
are saying.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.250
So this first statement, they
say the sum of negative 7

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.140
and the quantity 8 times x.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.790
So the sum-- so we're going
to have an addition here--

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.590
of negative 7 and the
quantity 8 times x.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.770
So the quantity 8 times
x, well, that's just 8x.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.790
So I can just write
8x over there.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.750
So it is negative 7 plus 8x.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.060
Or you could view this
as the sum of negative 7

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.950
and the quantity 8 times x.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.410
Let's do the next one.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.165
Take the quantity negative
3 times x and then add 1.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.410
So the quantity
negative 3 times x,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.340
we can write that
as negative 3x.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.280
And then we need
to add 1 to that.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.240
So that's going to be plus 1.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.239
Now this one.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.760
Negative 6 plus--
so we can write

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
negative 6 plus something-- the
product of negative 1 and x.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.060
So the product of
negative 1 and x,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.410
that's just going to
be negative 1x, which

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.710
is the same thing as negative x.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.360
So we can write this as
negative 6 plus negative x.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.260
Or we can just
write this-- this is

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.480
the exact same thing
as negative 6 minus x.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.510
And we are done.
