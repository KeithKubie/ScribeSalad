OLIVIA WU: Thank you
for being here.

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:10.840
I have been looking forward to
this talk and to meeting

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.420
Daphne, and having all of
you meet her, since I

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.410
knew she was coming.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.215
She's a family physician.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.490
She's a writer.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.010
And she teaches in the
Department of Family Medicine,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.060
UC San Francisco.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.580
But first and foremost, I think,
it's just striking to

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.720
note that she's a doc.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.410
She sits in her office three
days a week and sees patients

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.550
all day long, from birth
to age 102, and she

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.480
takes care of them.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.590
And she's the first doc I've
taken around Google, and I've

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.890
taken many doctors around, who
said, let me take a picture of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.710
the size of your desserts.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.780
And let me take the picture of
the size of the cheese you're

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.890
serving, because I want to show
my patients how small

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.420
you're serving them.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.440
This is how she cares
about her patients

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.070
and about their health.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.390
And she prescribes good eating,
among other things.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.380
And as she said to me at lunch,
if you care about your

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.760
food, you ultimately have to
find out and care about how it

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.950
is grown and where
it comes from.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.860
So I'm so excited for her to
come and talk to us, to make

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.490
this connection between our
natural world, what's grown,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.170
how it's grown, and how that
connects with our health.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.430
I'm talked to quite often
by people who

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.900
say, there's health.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.560
Tell me what I should eat
and what's good for me.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.410
And then tell me about what's
good for the environment.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.900
They have nothing to
do with each other.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.670
And to me, they have
everything to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.500
do with each other.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.130
And I think Daphne's going to
talk to us about that, among

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.530
other things.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.085
So she's also a writer.

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:08.410
She's a columnist for the
"Washington Post," in the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.669
Health section.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.710
And she's got these two books.
"Farmacology" just came out.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.790
Very excited to see it
and to hear about it.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.690
I thought I'd end by reading to
you some of the titles of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.410
articles that she's written.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.737
"Locavorism vs. Salmonella,"
"Take a hike and call me in

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:38.862
the morning," "Prescribing
Food," "Farm-Fresh Goat-Milk

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:43.300
Lattes."

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.830
And to me, this is the
fascinating thing about her.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.120
She is comparing small family
farms, which I consider to be

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.150
in pretty fragile state, to
integrative medicine, medicine

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.920
for the whole person, and
drawing lessons from farming

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.150
when both of them are things
that are really kinda edgy.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.800
So I can't wait to hear more.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.465
Please welcome Daphne for me.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:16.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:17.890
DAPHNE MILLER: Thank
you so much.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.710
It's lovely to be here.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.000
I have to tell you guys
that you're kind of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.950
like my lucky penny.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.390
Because five years ago, when
"Jungle Effect," my last book,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.020
came out, it was at Google
that I gave one

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.160
of the first talks.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.370
And that book went on
to do quite well.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.360
And once again, this is one of
the very first talks that I'm

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.430
giving on "Farmacology," so
maybe I need to rub all of you

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.490
afterwards.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.250
So I'm going to tell you a
story about soil and your

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.570
health today.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.880
But first, I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how I

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.550
got into all of this
in the first place.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.250
Maybe one way to illustrate it
would be to tell you about a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.010
conversation I had with a
reporter a couple weeks ago.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.170
This was a reporter that
was interviewing

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.160
me about the book.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.970
And at the end of the interview,
he told me about

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.600
something that he'd seen down
at Stanford at their new

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.500
technologies, cool new
inventions expo.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.269
And what it was, was a box.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.480
And you could buy a cartridge,
just like you can for a

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.110
printer, and the cartridge
contained a plant and soil and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.670
a computer chip.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.900
And you would put it in the
box, and shut the lid, and

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.630
push the button, and you
would get a plant.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.850
And the inventors, they're
actually on Kickstarter, were

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.880
saying this is great.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.430
Now anybody can be a gardener
or a farmer.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.010
And the interviewer wanted
to know what I

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.680
thought about this.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.140
Well, the geek in me thinks
it's pretty darn cool.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.380
What is that computer
chip doing?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.200
And all you have to
do is add water.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.240
Are you serious?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.590
And this plant grows
on your counter.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.210
And you need light,
but you don't

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.570
even really need sunlight.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.400
And I was, like, on my phone
trying to find the website and

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.430
everything

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.610
But the healer in me had
some real hesitations.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.830
How do we think that we can
reduce something so

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.910
complicated, something that
nature does with so many

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.360
elements as growing our food,
down to a cartridge and push

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.630
the button, and a
computer chip?

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.960
It's the same hesitancy I have
when I think, how can we

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.870
reduce something so complicated
as depression down

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.650
to one neurotransmitter, or
diabetes down to one hormone,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.900
or cancer down to one missing
piece of DNA, or one excessive

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.920
piece of DNA.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.400
And in fact, it is exactly
that concern about the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.930
reductionism that sent me out of
my medical office to learn

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.440
from sustainable farmers.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.360
Because from my vantage point,
I actually saw them as being

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.640
professionals, who were in
charge of healing an entire

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.930
system, that had thought about
all of those pieces, sun,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.490
moon, bugs, rain, and brought
them all together to make

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.280
something grow.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.350
And that was what I was
interested in doing in my

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.370
medical practice, is that kind
of complexity thinking.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.980
So that was one of the first
things that started me looking

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.600
outside of the 8 by 10 walls
of my medical practice.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.930
It was also my interest
in food.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.090
And as Liv said, you talk about
food long enough, you

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.620
have to start to wonder
where it comes from.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.310
And you have to start to get
beyond those words like,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.470
organic or GMO.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.720
These are just kind of labels.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.540
You just have to understand
what's really

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.320
happening behind all that.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.180
But I'd be misrepresenting
myself if I told you that I

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.380
had no background
in agriculture.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.300
In fact, I was conceived
on a farm.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.470
That might be too much
information.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.350
You guys are just getting
to know me here.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.820
My parents were part of the

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.090
back-to-the-land kibbutz movement.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.330
They moved from a small town
outside of Massachusetts to

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.140
Israel in 1964.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.890
And they were living
in a little, tiny

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.920
shack on the kibbutz.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.220
I guess when you're living in
a single bed, the next thing

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.175
is you have a kid.

00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:27.170
I don't know.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.740
But my mother found out very
quickly that children on a

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.900
kibbutz are raised just
like the chickens.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.870
They're basically kept
in a separate coop.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.370
And she decided she did not want
a communal child, so I

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.870
was not born on the farm.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.330
But I have my roots
on the farm.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.640
But I was on this farm.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.570
And that's me that you
see in the corner.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.650
And this is a picture that was
actually sent to me very

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.230
recently when the farmer's
daughter found out that I was

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.370
writing this book.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.840
But this is a piece of land in
upstate New York that my

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.380
parents bought when they moved
back to the States.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.400
Actually, it was 150 acres.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.060
And I think they bought it
with their stipend from

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.340
graduate school at that time.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.080
But this was an introduction
to agriculture.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.660
But I don't know if any of you
grew up on a farm or do some

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.465
farming now.

00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:19.070
Is there anybody in the room
who is connected in

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.460
any way to the land?

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.260
OK.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.680
Even gardeners, you count.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.580
If you have a little box
out there, that counts.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.920
OK, wonderful, everybody
in the room.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.370
Well, this kind of farming, I
think you see what's happening

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.200
with the soil here.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.929
It's being turned upside down
so that all that little

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.760
architecture of bugs and roots
and all these things that

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.360
nourish plants on the top, are
actually being turned deep

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.730
down into the earth where
they can't do very much.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.060
But this was kind of what
farming had turned to in the

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.850
late 1960s when I'm standing
there in the corner.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.940
My next experience with farming
actually happened in

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.660
medical school, where my best
friend, it turns out, in

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.520
medical school, was a goat
farmer from Mendocino.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.960
And he'd been homeschooled all
the way until college.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.940
And we would sit in the back
of the lecture hall.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.950
And the professors would flash
these images or slides of

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.300
diseases up.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.990
And he would sit next to me and
say, my goats get that.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.790
Or, I know exactly
how that works.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.600
Because I've taken care of
it for years on my goats.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.210
And it was fascinating to me
that he was way more advanced

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.580
of a healer than I was because
of his experience on the farm.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.530
And that stuck with me.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.830
So then, my next experience
with farming--

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.300
I'm giving you sort of my
background in farming-- was as

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.380
an intern in the
Salinas Valley.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.820
I went from Harvard Medical
School, which was sort of this

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.650
tertiary care,
hyper-reductionist, focused

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.480
specialty training to a family
medicine training in the

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.700
Salinas Valley.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.750
And there I took care
of farm workers.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.160
And it was the first time in my
life that I saw something

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.410
called organophosphate
poisoning, which was a

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.680
pesticide that's now illegal,
but then, in the early 1990s,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.580
was still being used all
the time in the fields.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.870
And I remember one of my first
times in the ER, being on

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.520
call, and this woman coming
in, pregnant, her fingers

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.130
stained black from picking
berries, seizing from

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.360
organophosphate poisoning.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.730
And I saw an array of fetal
malformations in their busy

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.110
obstetrics ward that
I hadn't seen

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.860
during my previous training.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.760
And so there it was really the
dark side of farming that I

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.830
was exposed to.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.950
But my real interest in farming
probably happened the

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.950
same time as all of you, in
that I started to become

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.400
interested in sustainable
food, and this fantastic

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.700
movement of knowing your
farmer and going to the

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.830
farmers' market and hearing
about young idealists, people

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.830
in their 20s and 30s who were
giving up their fancy

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.070
educations and going back to the
land and starting to grow

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.170
vegetables, veritable
vegetables.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.060
And I heard these stories.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.550
And here I was, as a family
doctor in medicine, wondering

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.220
when are people going to be
clamoring for their medicine

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.810
to have a face the way they're
clamoring for their food to

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.850
have a face?

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.380
And when are we going to get
the same idealists who are

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.660
pouring into health and healing
and wanting to be

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.770
primary care doctors the same
way they want to be farmers,

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.690
underpaid primary
care doctors?

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.630
And I'm still waiting for
that movement to happen.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.220
But that is one of the reasons
I started to look at this

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.066
paradigm of complexity and
sustainable farming.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:46.030
But then, the more I started
to learn about farming, the

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:52.650
more I realized that farmers and
I have the same patients.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.290
I started to look at,
actually, what they

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.160
do on a given day.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.840
And you have to squint a
little bit here, OK?

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.450
But if you do, it's amazing, the
levels of the structures,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.820
the way, actually, that they
work and that the nutrients

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.250
are moved from top to bottom.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.860
And look at those hairs.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.450
Their hair follicles look
surprisingly like soil.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.470
I mean, there is a pattern here
that repeats itself not

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.690
just between the skin and
the soil but between the

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.670
intestinal lining and the
soil and the pulmonary

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.300
tree and the soil.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.770
And then you start to look on
the electron microscope level.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.980
Can you guess which one of
these is the villi in our

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.340
intestine interacting with
microbes and nutrients.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.200
And In which one is roots
interacting with

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.380
microbes and nutrients?

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.080
Can you guess?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.220
Don't read the bottom.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.050
You cheated already.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.940
But hard to tell, right?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.265
So the one on your left
is the intestine.

00:12:55.265 --> 00:12:57.010
And these are the intestinal
villi.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.350
And this is the glycan, the
nutrients that are being

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.880
processed and brought in.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.400
And this is the same with the
rhizosphere, with the roots

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.305
from plants.

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:07.560
And it works the same.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.610
The organic matter comes in.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.480
The microbes process it.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.430
They put it into these perfect
packages, and then it gets

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.290
absorbed through these
finger-like projections,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.330
whether it be in your
gut or in the soil.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:26.760
And then, I started to learn
that the ideal pH of soil and

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.370
the ideal pH of our bodies are
pretty much exactly the same.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.740
And the carbon-to-nitrogen
ratio of soil, and the

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.950
carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
that makes up our

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.590
being is darn similar.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.270
And then, all of a sudden, it
dawned on me-- and I feel

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.950
pretty stupid that it took all
these years for it to dawn on

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.380
me as a physician--

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.280
but you know all those
carbohydrates and fats and

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.440
proteins that make
up our body?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.220
Where do they come from?

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.660
They come from the soil
via our food.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.280
In fact, it's not too
much of a stretch to

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.980
say that we are soil.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.010
And when I started to think
about what that meant, all of

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.650
a sudden, my exploration
took on sort of

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.260
two levels of meaning.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.040
There was the model
for farming that

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.750
interested me as a doctor.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.050
And then there was the practice,
these things that I

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.660
could actually learn that I
call farm-to-body lessons,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.860
that I could go out and bring my
patients so that they could

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.050
be healthier.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.630
And "Farmacology"
is sort of the

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.920
culmination of all of that.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.620
It's a whole series of lessons
from everything from a

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.580
laying-egg farm and what it can
teach us about different

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.330
kinds of stress, to a cow-calf
farm and what it can teach us

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.900
about super immunity or how to
build our resistance, to an

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.160
aromatic herb farm that teaches
us, actually, how

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.230
plants have special
messages for our

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.430
metabolism in our body.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.280
But I'm going to tell
you one story today.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.560
And as I said at the beginning,
it is the story

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.700
about soil and us.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.150
And it starts, actually, with
this farmer here, Erick

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.510
Haakenson, and his wife Wendy.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.540
Erick was actually not married
to Wendy when he bought his 12

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.140
acres of land in the Snoqualmie
Valley in

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.920
Washington State.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.290
He bought it in the late 1980s
after having a varied career.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.640
Unlike a lot of farmers, he
wasn't born into farming.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.180
He actually had gone to Yale
Divinity School for a while.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.810
And then he became a salmon
fisherman up in Alaska.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.180
But then, in the late 1980s,
he wanted to fulfill a

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.890
lifelong dream, and he bought
12 acres in the Snoqualmie.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.320
And his goal, as he explained
to me, was that he wanted to

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.060
grow vegetables that had
nutritional punch.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.750
But as he started to farm the
land and plant his crops and

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.070
see what he was getting, he
realized that, in fact, his

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.220
soil was depleted.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.310
It was tired.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.480
It had no more nutrients
in it.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.970
And now, from what you've just
learned, when your soil is

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.110
depleted, that means that your
vegetables are not going to

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.340
have nutritional punch.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.000
And so he was a smart
man, a learned man.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.870
So he went to the
agronomy books.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.430
He went to the agricultural
science textbooks.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.250
And he started to learn about
how to replenish his soil.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.160
And he learned about what is
called testing and replacing,

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.990
where basically you go around
your property, and you take

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.660
samples in each one of the
fields that you're planning to

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.550
grow your vegetables in.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.400
And then you take these samples,
and much like a test

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.860
tube, like you would with your
blood when you go to the lab,

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.960
and you send it off to a
central lab, that's an

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.530
agronomy lab.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.670
And they send you back something
that looks very much

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.450
like this, very much like the
reports that I get in my

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.345
office for my patients.

00:16:58.345 --> 00:17:00.970
You get one for each area
that you've sampled.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.510
And it tells you if you have too
much of a mineral or too

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.910
little of a mineral.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.560
It also tells you how
much to replace it.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.020
And so Erick took all of this
information, being the dutiful

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.960
farmer, and he started
to follow directions.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.420
So I'm going to actually take
a second and just read you a

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.119
tiny excerpt from the
book about this.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.470
And it's Erick talking to me.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.980
"'I spent days following up on
those computer readouts.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.110
I used my John Deere cone
spreader and ended up putting

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.340
thousands of pounds of minerals
all on my 12 acres.'

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.740
He was not exaggerating.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.050
I estimated, from the reports,
that in the years Erick used

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.730
the Agricultural Testing
Services, he'd spread more

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.950
than 50 tons of imported
minerals over his land.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.390
'But somehow, it didn't
feel right.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.500
There were lots of minerals
that I wasn't sure

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.780
where they were from.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.250
They were probably taken from
developing countries where

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.610
their soil needed these minerals
more than we do.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.380
And I was also wondering, if
these are all so good for my

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.350
plants, why does the
manufacturer recommended that

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.930
I wear a mask while I'm
spreading them?'

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.820
Plus, despite all his efforts,
Erick was not seeing the

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.140
miraculous improvements
that he'd hoped for.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.300
He said, 'I couldn't help
thinking, yeah, I'm putting

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.740
these minerals on the soil,
but are they really

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.510
getting to the plant?

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.620
And if I happen to put down a
little too much of one thing,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.970
what did it do to all
the other nutrients?

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.690
I'd heard stories about how
adding too much of one can

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.460
lock up other elements.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.070
This could create soil
conditions that were even

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.180
worse than when I started.'"

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.910
So I'm sitting there, at Erick's
dining room table, and

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.920
he's telling me this story.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.540
And as he's talking, all of a
sudden, I flash onto a patient

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.990
that I had seen in my office a
week before coming to his farm

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.800
to do this internship.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.350
And her name was Allie.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.400
I kind of changed her
name for the book.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.920
It wasn't really Allie, but
we'll call her Allie.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.380
And she was pretty typical
for my practice.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.030
She was a woman in her 30s, who,
the best word I can find

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.330
to describe her, was depleted,
just like Erick's soil.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.440
And she had had some intense
things happen in her life.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.070
Her business had gone awry.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.020
Her father had gotten
very sick.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.980
She had been doing a lot of
traveling for her work.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.940
And she started to get
very fatigued.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.630
And she was going around and
seeing various physicians and

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.310
also seeing other healers.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:37.040
And each time she would
go and see someone,

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.425
what would they do?

00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:41.830
They would test her.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.270
And then, they would get the
readouts, and they would

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.930
replace her.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:52.730
And she was starting to be
this pharmacopoeia of

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.850
prescription medicines
and also supplements.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.540
Meantime, her digestion
was going to pot.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.800
She was just feeling terrible.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.010
There was, like, this limited
diet that she could eat.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.580
She'd get those bag things of
spinach and steam them,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.420
because she knew she
needed some kind of

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.830
vegetable in her diet.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.800
And then she would survive
on energy bars.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.700
They were the only other thing
that would make her feel good.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.800
And so she came to me, as sort
of this last-ditch resort, in

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.840
desperation, and wanted
to find out what I

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.460
recommended for her.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.680
So this is a description of
my first visit with Allie.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.550
"If Allie were sitting at the
table listening to Erick, I'm

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.030
certain that she would nod
her head in agreement.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.020
To her first appointment in my
office, she brought in not

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.220
only her thick file of test
results but also two shopping

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.080
bags filled with prescription
pills and over-the-counter

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.350
supplements.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.580
One by one, she unpacked them
onto my desk and a neighboring

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.790
bookshelf until my little exam
room looked more like a

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.840
vitamin shop than a
doctor's office.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.960
The pharmaceuticals I could
recognize right away, a

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.230
proton-pump inhibitor for her
stomach, an antispasmodic for

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.530
her lower abdominal cramps, an
antidepressant for her mood,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.460
an antihistamine for
her allergies.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.160
But a good proportion of the
bottles in Allie's pharmacy

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.082
were labeled with vague names,
like Vital Force or Woman's

00:21:20.082 --> 00:21:23.580
Thrive, rather than a
specific nutrient.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.960
And when I read the fine
print, I saw that some

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.140
nutrients reappeared on a
multitude of bottles.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.160
For example, I found five
supplements that contained

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.390
zinc and four others that
listed Vitamin A or its

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.070
metabolite retinoic acid.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.740
Looking at this impressive
array, it was not too much of

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.000
a stretch to think of
Allie as locked up.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Indeed, any drug or supplement
can have unintended effects in

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.760
humans, like soil can become
deficient in one nutrient as a

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.210
result of having too
much of another.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.710
For instance, excess calcium
can create zinc and iron

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.710
deficiencies in humans.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.800
Interestingly enough, Erick told
me that excess phosphate

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.720
in the soil can create the same
deficiencies in plants.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.580
I wondered how many adverse
interactions might be taking

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.740
place in Allie's fragile system
because of all the

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.360
drugs and supplements
she was taking."

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.290
So back to Erick.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.950
I asked him, so what did you do
to make this beautiful land

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.090
that I've been farming for the
past couple days, as I was

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.690
sitting at the table.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.180
And he told me the story about
how he actually ended up

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.500
rejuvenating his land.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.990
He went back to the books.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.590
But this time, he didn't go to
your standard agronomy books.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.000
He went to books by the
grandmothers and grandfathers

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.110
of organic agriculture, people
whose names you might

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.185
recognize, like Rudolf Steiner,
and FH King, and Lady

00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:54.170
Balfour, and Sir
Albert Howard.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.100
These are people who wrote about
organic farming very

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.680
early on and influenced
people like the

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.120
modern day Michael Pollan.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.670
These are the original organic
agricultural philosophers.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.930
And how did they get
their opinions?

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.340
They got them from watching
traditional farmers farm on

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.930
the land, farmers who had been
farming a piece of land and

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.880
received it from their parents
and their great-grandparents

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.150
and their
great-great-grandparents and

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.580
planned to hand it down to
their children, and their

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.310
grandchildren, and their
great-great-grandchildren.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.220
And so they had found a system
of preserving the soil and

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.830
preserving fertility
on the land.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.270
And it didn't matter if they
were in China, like FH King

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.970
wrote about China, or if they
were in Germany and Bavaria,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.870
like Rudolf Steiner, who wrote
about Germany and Bavaria, or

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.990
India, like Sir Albert Howard.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.480
What they were all doing was
pretty much the same.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.960
They were farming in the
image of nature.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.195
They were farming the way
that nature farms.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.300
How does nature farm?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.690
Nature farms with animals,
not just with plants.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.910
Animals are there to
replenish the soil.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.540
Think of a natural setting
like a forest.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.045
How does it happen?

00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:16.910
The animals are part
of that ecosystem.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.020
Nature always keeps
ground cover.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.910
Have you ever been to a place in
nature, in the wild, where

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.860
you just see bare soil?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.230
There's always something that's
protecting it and

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.750
preserving the moisture.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.340
Nature doesn't till the way you
saw in that first picture,

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.500
where you take that delicate
top layer and

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.680
stick it down lower.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.290
It can't do anything to
nourish the plants.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.760
Nature doesn't use chemical
additives.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.090
Nature conserves water.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.810
Nature uses seeds that were
grown in that place, because

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.840
they're intended to be there,
not seeds that are actually

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.570
refined for a distant land
or that have another gene

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.860
introduced in them, as
we're seeing now.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.790
So Erick became very influenced
by these writings.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.640
And he, too, started to farm.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.000
And his method is called
biodynamic farming.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.380
But it really is this full
cycle of farming in

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.200
the image of nature.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.280
And what he did, by doing this,
is he started to nourish

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.540
all of those microbes and all
of those worms and all of

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.400
those voles, the little rodents
that live under the

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.620
soil which are there to process
that organic matter.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.710
And in turn, these billions
of unpaid workers began to

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.710
nourish his plants.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:40.500
And he started to grow the most
amazing grass, because he

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.120
would rotate the animals
through.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.320
I mean, what better fertilizer
than a cow, right?

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.430
They deposit it.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.550
And then they plow it in
with their hooves.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.850
And then they move on.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.900
And they'll also disturb the top
layer just enough that you

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.170
start to get a little system
going on there.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.500
So does that grass look pretty
good to you guys?

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.690
I mean, I know you're not
necessarily experts, but

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.510
wouldn't you say that's pretty
good looking grass?

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.030
Yeah, good grass.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.690
And then he started to grow
amazing vegetables.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:13.100
And he's just this very, very
popular farmer up in the

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.370
Snoqualmie.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:19.230
But the true test is that
about 8 to 10 years into

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.240
having given up that test and
replace and changing his soil,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.100
he went back, and he did
those soil samples.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.990
And he sent them back
into the lab.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:34.470
And the results came back that
everything was perfect.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.320
And he hadn't bought an outside

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.690
additive in almost a decade.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.610
So his new system was
really working.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.070
So I'm sitting there, as a
doctor at the dining room

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.320
table, after having done a hard
day's labor in his field,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.380
and I'm thinking, how
does this apply

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.640
to Allie, my patient?

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.370
Here she is in San Francisco
suffering, eating her energy

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.810
bars and her wilted spinach
from Costco and, you know,

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:02.830
eating her bags of medicines
every day.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.120
Can I make the leap?

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.310
Can we start to say that when
Allie enters an eco-cycle that

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.370
she, too, can get healthier just
like his vegetables and

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.070
just like the cows and just like
the worms and just like

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.530
Erick and Wendy reported
for themselves

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:19.910
and their farm interns?

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.130
What would happen to Allie?

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.830
So I'm a woman of science.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.140
So I started to go to the

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.540
literature to see what happens.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.340
I mean, we have all of this data
now, telling us that if

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.820
it is a biodynamically rich
soil, if there's a lot of

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.810
worms and a lot of microbes that
are just teeming in that

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.260
soil, and there's a lot of
actual DNA in the soil, that

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.180
you grow a more nutrient-rich
and more varied crop.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.430
Can you guys tell which is the
biodynamically rich soil here

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.620
just from looking
at this slide?

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.020
What's your guess?

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.800
The one on the left, yeah.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.070
And you're not a
farmer, right?

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.030
You could just tell.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.780
If you just even looked, not
at the greenery, but at the

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.420
soil itself, what do you
see that's different?

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.356
How would you describe
the two soils?

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:14.308
AUDIENCE: Happy.

00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:15.750
DAPHNE MILLER: Happy.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.682
AUDIENCE: Moist.

00:28:16.682 --> 00:28:17.600
DAPHNE MILLER: Moist.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.531
AUDIENCE: Rich.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.710
DAPHNE MILLER: Rich.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.380
Yeah, there's something about
it that feels pliable, like

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.990
that it can give, like it can
allow earth to come through.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.080
You're not going to
believe this.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.910
But as a doctor, when I look at
my patients, I apply a lot

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.500
of these same values.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.430
This is what you learn.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.240
Is that recognized?

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.170
Healthy, sick?

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.710
And this was fascinating for
me to see that I had this

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.540
language, actually, in common
with farmers, our ability to

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.250
sort of evaluate things.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.700
But we have a lot of data now
showing us that microbes in

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.890
the soil, in this rich soil,
have everything to do with the

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.170
value of the nutrients
that come out of it.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.360
And I don't know if you guys
are familiar with the study

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.750
that came out of Stanford about
nine months ago, saying

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.190
that organic is no better
than conventional.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.950
It's because they were asking
the wrong question.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.070
If they'd been asking
about the soil--

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.380
because there's many organic
soils that look like that.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.560
In fact, that's an
organic soil--

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.400
if they were asking, does
microbial-rich soil and well

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.690
cared for eco-soil like Erick's
produce happier

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.060
vegetables, their study
would have had a

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.910
totally different result.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.490
Isn't it amazing in science, if
you ask the wrong question,

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.540
you really go down
the rabbit hole.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.900
So we have lots of information
about this.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.960
This is not disputed
at this point.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.210
And we have lots of information
that nutrient-rich

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.430
foods makes for healthy
people.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.040
We have that information, too.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.560
But we haven't completed the arc
from soil to our bodies.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.220
How do we relate to soil?

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.250
What happens if I put Allie
in that eco-cycle?

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.480
What happens if I put you in
that eco-cycle to your health?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.300
And these are the kinds
of cross-disciplinary,

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.530
big-picture questions that we
need to start asking and not

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.820
get caught in our click-and-grow
bubble, you

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.220
know, of putting the plant
in the box or the

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.390
human on the drug.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.370
So I called lots
of scientists.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.930
I asked them this question, what
happens to us when we get

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:20.910
connected to healthy soil?

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.450
Can we actually turn
our health around?

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.650
And most of them, there
was silence at

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.440
the end of the phone.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.080
I talked to people in health.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.960
I talked to people
in agronomy.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.250
But one day I called
Justin Sonnenburg.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.030
And he's a microbiologist
at Stanford.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.550
Do you recognize his slide
there on his desktop?

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.120
You saw that earlier, right?

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.800
That's the one I showed
you of the human gut.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.890
What Justin and his wife
Erica do-- they're a

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.720
team in their lab--

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.895
and they study the microbiome,
which is that massive colony

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:59.650
of bacteria that lives
in our intestine.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.540
Two pounds of us is bacteria
that we don't own in terms of

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.890
it not being part of our DNA
but that we're discovering

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.840
more and more has everything
to do with our health.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.680
It has to do with our propensity
for allergies.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.890
It has to do with our
level of immunity.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.130
It has to do with
our metabolism.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.020
It might even have to do with
whether we are heavy or thin.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.380
These are all things that are
related to the microbiome.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.920
And if you're interested in
reading more, "Mother Jones"

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.560
has a fantastic article that
just came out, I think, last

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.900
week but specifically on it.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.770
It's one of the best
pieces I've seen.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.350
But there's more and more coming
out about how much

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.910
these little bugs in our gut
sort of rule our health.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:48.870
And what we're discovering is
that a certain percentage of

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.660
these we inherit the same way
we inherit property or our

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.470
grandmother's candlesticks.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:58.060
They come to us within
our family lineage.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:02.310
But there's another percentage
of them that we get from our

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.460
environment and we get from a
variety of places, including

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.740
the places where our food is
grown, the soil and water.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.760
Water is the oceans or where
our food is grown, as well.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.350
Sometimes we don't think of that
as the water equivalent

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.240
of soil, but it is.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:24.170
And so Justin said, we're just
starting to discover how the

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.460
microbes, those microbes that
Erick is growing in his soil,

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.060
interact with our microbiome and
what effect that's having

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.470
on our health, and that that
might explain at least a good

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.000
part of what happens to someone
like Allie in terms of

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.260
her health when she enters
the farm cycle.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.690
But I'm just going to share with
you some of the research

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:46.690
that's coming out on this.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.380
And this is new stuff, guys.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.680
I've gone from ancient farmers
to sort of cutting edge

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.470
microbiology here.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.110
But what we're starting
to discover--

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.790
and this is a study that just
came out a couple months ago--

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.110
is that when your food is grown
in soil that's been

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.720
mistreated, that's been dosed
with antibiotics and

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.040
pesticides and fertilizers, the
bacteria that's encouraged

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.700
to grow in that soil, first
of all, it becomes very

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.520
monotonous.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.380
You don't get the huge variety
that you got in that slide

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.150
that you appreciated.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.110
You tend to get fewer
types of bacteria.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:27.290
And they develop antibiotic
resistance.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.700
And then what happens is they
hitchhike on your food into

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.170
your gut, and they give
information--

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.810
sometimes it's just
a segment of DNA--

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.030
to your microbiome.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.900
And they actually can
convert good guys.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.590
They can convert the nice
candlesticks that you got from

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:47.830
your grandmother into
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:51.900
And so we're starting to
discover that, you know, we've

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.870
known that when you dose animals
with antibiotics that

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.740
that affects your own resistance
to antibiotics.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.090
We're starting to discover that
soil is a whole other

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:02.040
piece of this.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.690
And we just don't even know what
other kind of negative

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:08.159
information can come in from
having your food grown in

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:08.699
negative soil.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:12.300
They're just starting to code
these strands and figure out

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.900
what this little invisible
exchange is that's happening.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.515
So now I've told you
the bad news.

00:34:18.515 --> 00:34:19.960
But the good news--

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.170
and this is a piece
that Justin wrote.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:26.239
It's about research that
researchers in France did--

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.590
but we're discovering that
good information gets

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.070
transferred, as well.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.850
So this is about a study that
was done where researchers

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.489
went and looked at a bacteria
that lives on

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.380
seaweed in the ocean.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.400
And this bacteria has a sequence
of DNA in it that's

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.040
really good at digesting seaweed
and processing those

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.030
nutrients and using it.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.550
And it's bacteria
that's called a

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.099
Bacteroidetes type bacteria.

00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:58.580
And so now that we can sequence
the entire genome,

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.680
and we're starting to be able to
sequence the entire biome,

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.990
they went in, and they started
to look at where they could

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:09.730
find that enzyme that digests
the seaweed in terms of all

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.220
living species.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.030
And they found it in the
intestines of cultures that

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.720
eat a lot of seaweed.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.240
And so what happened is
that that bacteria

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.120
passed its DNA on.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.680
It hitchhiked on the seaweed
into the microbiome of these

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.610
seaweed-eating cultures.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:33.540
And as a result, they have
a better ability than non

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.500
seaweed-eating cultures
to digest seaweed

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.500
and harvest its nutrients.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.350
They have these special
Bacteroidetes that are sort of

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.870
like seaweed gluttons, and that
give them all these great

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.290
nutrients from seaweed.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.350
But let's say, if your family
grew up for centuries in

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:54.060
Eastern Europe, you don't
have that ability.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.040
And as Justin Sonnenburg
said, this is just

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.610
the tip of the iceberg.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.130
How much of this information,
this pass-the-gene game, is

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.640
happening between us and our
soil at every given meal,

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.040
we're just starting
to discover.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.940
I'm not going to load you with
a bunch of this new research,

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.575
but I need to tell you
this other study,

00:36:12.575 --> 00:36:14.360
because I just love it.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.880
This is Italian researchers who
went to a tiny village in

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.816
Burkina Faso and, actually--

00:36:22.816 --> 00:36:24.870
it's kind of a weird study--

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.430
they took a group of healthy
children in the village and

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.650
collected stool samples from
them and studied the bacterial

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.020
content of their stool.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.100
And then they went and compared
these stool samples,

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.430
the bacterial colonies in it, to
a sample from kids who were

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.010
living in downtown Florence.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.290
And I don't know if any of you
have been to Florence lately,

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.920
but they have a McDonald's on
every corner, just like we do

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.670
here in the urban US.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.750
And those kids, they have the
same childhood obesity problem

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.450
in Italy that we have.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.470
So a really different
sample of kids.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.770
These are kids in Burkina Faso,
who, the best way to

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:03.050
describe it is that they
are eating this full

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.420
cycle form of farming.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.360
They are eating from land
and soil that's

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.025
very much like Erick's.

00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:17.210
So the result that they saw
was that the children in

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.380
Burkina Faso, the green
is that Bacteroidetes.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.920
It's that type of bacteria that
tends to be very good.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.520
There's many different
species of them.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.170
But they're all, in general,
very good at harvesting whole

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.930
grains and greens and taking
those nutrients and passing

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.290
them on to you, versus
firmicutes, which is what you

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.310
see a preponderance
of in Florence.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.310
And this looks much more like
our intestine, when they

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:45.650
sample people here
in the West.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.930
Firmicutes thrive on
a McDonald's meal.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.870
They're great at taking
saturated fats and lots of

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:56.530
sugar and harvesting
those nutrients and

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.640
moving them into you.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.010
Those are kind of the Homer
Simpson of bacteria.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:06.720
And so, also, from the children
from Burkina Faso,

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.310
they discovered that they had
types of bacteria that we

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:14.820
don't even have in our Western
guts and that look a lot more

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.520
like bacteria that they found
when they took these ancient

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.140
stool samples from
archaeological sites, from

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.260
people in Mesopotamia, and
looked at what their bacteria

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:25.590
looked like.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.470
They are able to code the DNA
in these ancient stools.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.660
The name for ancient stools, by
the way, is coprolites, in

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.870
case you're in a trivia game
ever, and you need to

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.460
come up with that.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.200
But they looked a lot more like
the Burkina Faso kids.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.750
So the point here is that part
of our microbiome is going

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:50.230
extinct as we move away from
these traditional soils and

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.410
these traditional ways
of farming and

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.020
these traditional foods.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.200
We're actually losing the
bacteria which are our friends

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.950
and can help us metabolically.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:05.570
And so learning all of this, I
really started to wonder, so

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:08.780
what would happen if Allie
really reconnected with the

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.760
farm and became a piece
of the farm?

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.930
And I started to talk to her
about this idea, based on what

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:18.920
I'd learned with Erick.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.800
And I kind of came up with this
little set of rules for

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.130
how to reconnect
with the farm.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.700
I came up with seven
ideas here for her.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.060
The first one was to eat
a little dirt and bugs.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.340
And it was obviously from food
that's been grown in an

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.800
authentic and full-farming
way.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.410
If you eat that food from the
farm that I showed you in that

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:43.280
slide that's causing antibiotic
resistance, the

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.580
dirt from that farm that's
causing antibiotic resistance,

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.280
that's not going to
be recommended.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.650
But eat a little dirt and bugs
from a farm like Erick's.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.450
Who knows what kinds of
information is coming along?

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.990
And someone, at a talk I gave
recently, told me that there

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.030
are some chefs that are starting
to serve sprinklings

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.290
of soil, actually,
on the plate.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.100
So this is becoming very
trendy, I guess.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.120
But for those of you who can't
stand the idea of that,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.170
fermented foods are really a
chance to eat soil bugs.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.520
Have you ever thought
about that?

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.430
Fermentation is actually just
controlled rotting.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.090
What it is, is you take
the vegetable, and

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.570
you put it in salt.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.300
And whenever you buy real
fermented food, it should just

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.290
be vegetable and salt.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.900
There should be nothing else
on the ingredients.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.370
If you want a couple herbs
in there, fine.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.920
But if it says vinegar, or
preservative, or sugar, just

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.660
put it back on the shelf, OK.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.230
It should be vegetables
and salt.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.360
And what happens is that
the bacteria--

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.540
the lactobacillus that's sitting
on the vegetable, that

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.330
came from where?

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.435
The soil--

00:40:49.435 --> 00:40:51.100
it starts to ferment it.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.130
It does its work.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.390
And when it ferments,
it multiplies.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.710
It grows.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:00.370
And so when you eat a little
tablespoon of sauerkraut,

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.510
you're getting billions
of bacteria.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.640
And they're not just some
bacteria that some scientists

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.970
dreamed up, which is what you
get when you take those

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.230
probiotics, they're ones from
the soil that you co-evolved

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.530
with for millions of years.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.030
And so it makes sense.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.710
Those are the ones
you want to get.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.910
Another pointer I gave to her--
we're always telling

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.180
people, buy food that's
locally grown.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.750
Buy food from a farmer
that has a face.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:28.750
You guys are busy.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.880
You don't know how to do that.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.130
Or you get it from your
cafeteria here.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.270
Let's say you're going to pick
out a piece of fruit or a

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.370
vegetable--

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:40.630
the best way is to look at the
piece of fruit and vegetable,

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.570
and smell it.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.850
And if you can take a little
taste, if it's a grape if it's

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.790
something like that,
take a taste.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:51.070
If it tastes wonderful, and if
it smells good, chances are

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.900
it's been grown in
a wonderful way.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.570
Because most of our
conventionally and mass-grown

00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:01.440
stuff and stuff that's been
grown through bad soil, its

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.970
seed has been either engineered
or hybridized to

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:10.330
succeed anywhere and to be
transportable and not

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.220
perishable and all
of those things.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.820
It's not a seed that has been
maximized for taste and for

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.230
nutrient value.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:21.460
And taste and nutrient value
often run together.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.380
So I really encourage people to
actually get to know their

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.160
vegetables through their nose
and their mouth and not

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.370
through their eyes.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:32.820
And when you use your eyes,
look for imperfection, OK?

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:35.990
Usually stuff that's been
grown in a local and

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.620
sustainable way, it's going
to be a little lopsided.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.150
It's not going to look like
some beauty queen that's,

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:45.310
like, puffed up and been given
lipo and Botox and is

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.490
completely the same
as the next one.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:52.150
And the vegetables and fruits
that are a little bug-eaten,

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.720
that's where most of the
nutrients are, because

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.570
antioxidants are basically
like a vegetable's

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.375
equivalent of a scab.

00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:03.320
They're the place that it goes,
that it actually uses to

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.450
fight whatever bug
or whatever.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.690
It's their immune system.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.735
So look for the cabbage leaves
that are a little moth-eaten.

00:43:11.735 --> 00:43:13.835
Don't throw those
outer ones away.

00:43:13.835 --> 00:43:19.050
Or if someone else is throwing
them away, you go eat them.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:22.210
Choosing food with a story is
a little different than

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.600
choosing local food, because
we don't have the luxury

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.220
around this country of getting
stuff fresh and local the way

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.670
that we can in San Francisco
or the Bay Area.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.760
But choose food where there's
something about the farm on

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.600
the label in the store that says
where it's grown, talks

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.150
about the farmer.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.820
I was speaking with Wendell
Berry, who's belongs in that

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.950
food philosopher category.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.480
And he told me one of the ways
that he vets his food is he

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.030
finds out does the farmer
live on the farm?

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.990
So much of our commercial food,
the farmer's wearing a

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.660
suit and working in
a city somewhere.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.260
And that farm is owned by
someone who really isn't even

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.070
invested in the soil, whose
grandfather and

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.480
great-grandfather wasn't part of
it or who doesn't have the

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.270
plans to keep it wonderful so
they can pass it on like an

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.680
heirloom to their children
and grandchildren.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.480
But the minute that the farmer
becomes invested in the soil

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.020
and preferably owns that soil,
they're going to take care of

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.030
it like the most precious family
heirloom, and they're

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.550
going to give you, and they're
going to give their own

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.720
family, delicious food.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.640
Another important thing,
and this is just

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.210
self-evident, is to cook.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.460
Because that's when you start
to use these materials.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.860
And I know here you have this
wonderful food served to you

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.820
during the day.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.290
And I know that your chefs and
your food procurers are doing

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.770
an amazing job here.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:47.310
But when you go home, use the
same kind of mindfulness.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:52.130
And another important
piece of it is to

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.260
give back to the soil.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.770
I don't know how many of you
live in a place where you can

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.090
do communal composting or you
have access to your own

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:00.210
compost bins.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.810
I mean, even if you live in a
high-rise apartment in San

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.580
Francisco now, you can
contribute to the green bins

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.480
with your food scraps.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.840
Saving water, taking a shorter
shower is a way to give back

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.490
to the soil.

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.950
Because any water you don't use,
in the global picture,

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.690
can be diverted towards
agriculture.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.830
And connecting with nature, in
the book, it's in the sixth

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.940
chapter of the book, I talk at
length about all of these

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.030
chemical connections that we
have with nature and how,

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.440
actually, there are messages
when we work with plants, both

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.790
olfactory messages and so on,
that can make us happy or can

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:38.850
change our outlook on things.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.780
We are actually having this sort
of secret conversation

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.870
with nature that we don't
even realize.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.530
So just getting around nature.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.690
Farming is great.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.340
Gardening can be great.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.490
I wrote a chapter that took
place in the Bronx in the book

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.870
with urban farmers.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.040
And one of the researchers, who
is studying urban farmers,

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.960
found out that they were
healthier and thinner even if

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.810
they weren't growing vegetables,
just because being

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.200
outside, perhaps connecting
with the plants.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.140
Who knows what it was?

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:13.950
And the most important thing is
to treat your body the same

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.440
way as you would treat
your food.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.990
So anything you put on your
body or put in your house,

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.710
think of it as something that
eventually is going to end up

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.270
in your soil.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.820
Because it will.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.970
So when you're buying shampoos,
or makeup, or

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:36.430
moisturizers, or cleaners for
your car, or detergents for

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:39.750
your laundry, or your
toothpaste, look for all of

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.330
those bisphenol As,
those VOCs.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:46.760
If it's something that you don't
want to take immediately

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.560
and eat yourself, don't put it
on your body, don't put it in

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:55.040
your house, because it will
end up back in your food.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:00.060
Vinegar is a fantastic
cleaning resource.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.350
I use it as a cleaning fluid
for everything in my house.

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:07.180
Believe it or not, baking soda
is the best shampoo I've ever

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.130
discovered, cocoa butter
for your skin.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.730
And these things have everything
to do with the farm

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:16.590
and have everything to
do with your soil.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.030
And the other thing that I
didn't write up there, and

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.680
this is really important, is
to treat your body the same

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.540
way as a mindful farmer treats
their soil, because sometimes

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.050
we care more about the soil than
we do about ourselves,

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.350
which is very interesting.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.960
So I shared all of
this with Allie.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.060
And we strategized about how
she, in her San Francisco

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.050
life, could start to do this.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.820
And she actually started
to get a CSA box.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.780
And she started to volunteer in
a school garden, and just

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.260
made more time to be outside,
and made more time to cook,

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.180
and started to have a different
idea about how she

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.790
was choosing her food.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:58.120
And she slowly started to get
herself off of those shopping

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.420
bags full of medicine.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.420
The one medicine--

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.270
because I saw her recently--
she still takes an

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.590
antidepressant.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:06.890
But everything else,
she stopped.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.410
My guess is that the
antidepressant, at this point,

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:10.910
it's a pretty low dose.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.200
But she holds onto it.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.420
And I'm totally fine
with that.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.320
I'm an integrative doctor,
and I like to

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.110
straddle both worlds.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.270
But who knows what piece
of all of this worked?

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.630
Was it the subtle messages
from the plants?

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.120
Was it the microbes?

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.550
Was it her just getting off all
those medicines that were

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.490
interacting with
her microbiome?

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.250
Who knows?

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:34.230
Was it her, just all of a
sudden, having a different

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.740
outlook, a different view?

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:41.850
But about six months after she
made these changes, just like

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:45.280
Erick, we sent lab
tests on Allie.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.530
And they came back.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.520
All of her labs-- all of the
subtle deficiencies in iron

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.630
and Vitamin D and so on,
that all of those other

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.990
practitioners had
been replacing--

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.510
they were normal.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.460
And so I called Erick and told
him, and he kind of high-fived

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.300
me over the phone.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.690
So we both realized that we'd
done pretty much the same

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.170
intervention.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:08.570
So this picture is just to show
you-- this comes from

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:10.060
another chapter of the book.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.320
It's about raising
resilient kids--

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.780
but this is the kind of
connection that other cultures

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.950
have with their farms and their
soil, and this kind of

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:21.770
trust that they have, that
there's real health there.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:23.810
And I just wanted to
show you that.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.640
But thank you so much
for listening.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.820
And please, spread the word
about "Farmacology." Go ahead

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.210
and Facebook me.

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.760
I just started on Twitter.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.880
But I've become a
Twitter fanatic.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.720
I think it's this great
way to learn things.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.340
And I share new studies
every day.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.910
Because I think you can tell,
I'm a little bit of a science

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:45.850
geek on top of being
a holistic healer.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:50.160
And any new research I find, I
like to put out via Twitter.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.340
So follow me on Twitter.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.850
And thank you so much.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:54.220
It was such a pleasure.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.270
And I'll take any questions
you guys have.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you
have a question--

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.070
AUDIENCE: So there's obviously
a richer microbiome in soil

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.480
than in air, sort of in the rest
of the environment where

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.110
people live.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.190
And I know there's some emerging
research in that

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.320
area, too, about what kinds of
microbes are in our different

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:17.930
environments.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.030
And are you familiar
with that?

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.985
How important do you think
that is, to our health?

00:50:22.985 --> 00:50:24.600
DAPHNE MILLER: We don't know.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.220
I mean, like I said, the ocean
is another enormous source.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.930
And soil, obviously, is
a very huge source.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:36.910
I think it makes sense that the
places where our food is

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:39.910
grown is where we're going to
get the most beneficial

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.300
influence from that.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.810
But in the chapter on resilience
and resistance that

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:49.240
I talk about, there's a number
of researchers that are

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.730
studying how farm kids have way
less allergy and asthma

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.660
than children who live
in urban areas.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.590
And they are discovering
that microbes in their

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:05.000
unpasteurized milk play a role,
that actual microbes

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.380
that are just in the hay
dust play a role.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.100
A lot of the yeast that they
are discovering, yeast that

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.360
even we thought were pathogenic
or bad for you in

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.100
these urban environments, might

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.700
actually be good for you.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:22.360
And they're even discovering
that types of bacteria that we

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.730
equate with poisoning or
disease, things like staph and

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.960
listeria, that in these little
doses in farm environments,

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.820
they're actually protective.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.760
So this is just a
wide open field.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.700
And next week, I'll have
something new to tell you,

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.076
because the literature is just
changing very quickly.

00:51:41.076 --> 00:51:42.990
AUDIENCE: I heard Mary Roach was
going to be talking about

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.780
her latest book.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.790
And she was talking about
transplants of, like, even

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.330
fecal matter into patients,
that kind of thing.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:50.280
I thought it was pretty
interesting.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.780
And I'm quite interested in the
whole rise and shine kind

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.490
of cleansing type thing where
people are replacing the biome

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:57.505
essentially in their bodies.

00:51:57.505 --> 00:51:59.670
I was wondering you if you
had a viewpoint on

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:00.835
people doing that?

00:52:00.835 --> 00:52:04.720
DAPHNE MILLER: Well, when things
go bad, then fecal

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.600
transplants actually can be
unbelievably powerful.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.780
Unfortunately, the FDA is coming
down on it, because

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.600
it's foreign tissue, and
that gets regulated.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.690
It used to be sort of this
underground thing that

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:18.070
gastroenterologists would
do in some weird

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.110
places in the country.

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:22.840
But now, as it's getting more
popular, I think, pretty soon

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.040
it's going to be a very
regulated thing, like

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.820
everything.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.990
But most of the time, we don't
need to go to that extreme.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:35.210
Most of the time we can actually
nurture our biome by

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.920
eating these correct foods.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.600
But there are some instances
in my practice where I have

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.220
referred patients for
fecal transplant.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.150
But those are people who are
really, really ill and where

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:48.220
all these other things
haven't worked.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.580
And the next question is, where
did they get the healthy

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.330
feces from?

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:55.080
They usually get it from a
parent or a family member,

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.790
someone who shares
the candlesticks

00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.010
with them, as well.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:04.220
But it's kind of a last-ditch
solution.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.650
And another question that I get
a lot is, how about those

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:10.460
over-the-counter supplements,
those probiotics?

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.500
And even people like Justin
Sonnenburg, what they're

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.580
really doing is trying to mine
all this information to come

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.080
up with the ideal probiotic.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.160
Because that's where
the biotech is.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.390
That's where the money
is, right?

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.000
What I'm talking about, eating
vegetables and getting to know

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.350
the soil, I'm never going
to get rich on this.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:38.280
But the problem with probiotics
is, because just as

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.600
I was talking about, a lot of
our microbiome is inherited.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.250
So yours might look very
different than the gentleman

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:48.120
in the red shirt behind you
and maybe different from

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.380
someone in the checkered
shirt here.

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.010
And so what is the
ideal microbiome?

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:53.990
We don't know.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:57.050
Should we be trying to look,
once again, like those

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.890
children in Burkina Faso?

00:53:58.890 --> 00:53:59.340
Probably.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.150
But it's going to be really hard
to get back there with

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.060
our modern-day diets,
you know.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.170
And it doesn't matter how
many probiotics you

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:07.290
dump into the system.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:10.740
That's just a living bacteria
that needs to be nourished in

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.770
order for it to continue
to grow there.

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:15.270
Does that makes sense?

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.390
Thank you so much.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:21.080
[APPLAUSE]
