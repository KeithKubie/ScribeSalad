00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.060
There’s a horror movie I love,
where no one’s allowed to talk

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
because scary monsters will hear them 
and eat them, and it’s fantastic,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.660
but a main character has a cochlear implant,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.960
and they get the depiction all wrong.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.500
Which is a shame, because cochlear implants
are fascinating and ingenious devices,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.060
and because it breaks the movie for me.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.460
So what are cochlear implants, exactly,
and how can they help

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.480
even the profoundly deaf hear?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.580
A cochlear implant is a medical device that
goes, as the name suggests, inside your cochlea.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.180
Quick refresher: that’s the spiral structure
of three fluid-filled canals

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.780
coiled up like a snail’s shell in your inner ear, past
the eardrum, hammer, anvil, and stirrup.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.340
In one canal, there are hair cells along the
length of the spiral.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.860
At the base of the spiral, the hair cells
respond to higher frequency sounds,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.780
and at the apex, they move at low frequencies.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.500
These movements trigger nerve cells, converting
the sound waves to electrical impulses

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.140
and passing the signal on to the brain for processing.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.820
That’s just a basic overview of how it all
works... assuming it does work.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.960
The most common form of hearing loss is sensorineural,
where the hair cells, nerves, or brain

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.340
aren't functioning like they do in a hearing person.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.720
Sensorineural hearing loss can be caused by
a lot of things, such as age, loud noises,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.920
trauma, disease, or genetics.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.420
Sometimes it can be treated with a hearing
aid, which is basically just an amplifier

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.000
that boosts the volume of speech while cutting
down on background noise.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But when a hearing aid is not enough, a cochlear
implant may do the trick.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Instead of getting the outer and middle ear
to transmit sound waves like a hearing aid

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.710
does, a cochlear implant goes straight to
the finish line.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.119
It consists of two parts: a speech processor
and the actual implant.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.800
The speech processor sits on the back of the
ear and is just what it sounds like: it takes

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.040
the sounds it hears and converts them to 
electrical signals.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.320
Those signals are sent to the implant, which
rests under the skin and connects to the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.020
speech processor outside via a magnet.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.940
The implant has a long array of electrodes
that actually curl up inside the cochlea,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.120
and when these electrodes go off, they trigger
the nerve cells like the hair normally would.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.060
Even though the device itself isn’t making
any noise, the brain interprets the electrical

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
pulses it pipes in as though it were sound,
and, just like that, people can start to make

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.920
out speech when before they were in a world
of complete silence.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
Hear that, John Krasinski?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.009
They make no sound!

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.899
I’m still really bothered by that.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.720
It’s not a perfect replica of speech, and
it’s not the same

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.360
as having a full range of hearing.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.620
The cochlea has thousands of hair cells, while
a cochlear implant only has a couple dozen

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.840
electrodes, and they can activate overlapping
regions of neurons, so the tones of speech

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.100
and music get blurred together.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.319
Programs that help the speech processor to
encode tone and timbre can aid music recognition,

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.769
and by mapping an individual's cochlea, scientists
can improve speech recognition by actually

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.420
turning off certain electrodes that were activating
unintended neurons.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.739
Cochlear implants are a topic of fierce debate
within the Deaf community, and plenty of people

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.540
who are deaf prefer not to have them, because
they live happy lives and are part of a community.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.090
For others, though, they can’t picture their
lives without one.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.040
Either way, I think we can all agree they’re
a marvel of science and technology.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.380
And that A Quiet Place was great, but they
could have spent five seconds

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.960
googling “Cochlear Implants.”

And, on the topic of audio, did you ever wonder
what's happening in your brain

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.360
when you hear someone scream?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.319
Trace explains in this episode why your body
goes into a whole cascade of defensive responses

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320
when you hear it.
