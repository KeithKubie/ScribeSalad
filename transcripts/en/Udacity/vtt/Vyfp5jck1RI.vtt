00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.880
All right, so our goal is going to be to
try to create learning algorithms that

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.580
are not quite as smart as you were in
that example, but trying to approximate

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.916
that, getting as far along the rock to
Charles continuum as we possibly can.

00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:16.890
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, we want algorithms
that are Charles complete.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.959
&gt;&gt; No, I think you're probably still
going to beat the algorithms that we're

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:23.001
going to talk about in this class.

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.719
Someday, someday.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:30.179
All right, so the important thing
is that we have to figure out,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.834
what it is that we are trying to learn?

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.778
So in this case what we're trying to
learn is a behavior, we're trying to

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:38.872
learn the way of interacting with the
environment that obtains high reward.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.165
And it turns out that there's different
ways to think about this depending on

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:44.530
what kind of behavior
you are looking for.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.340
So one classical kind of behavior

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.070
that is very common in the AI
literature is the notion of a plan.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.460
So plan usually refers to
a fixed sequence of actions.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.230
So the kind of thing that says,
okay I see where I am now,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.920
this is the sequence of
things I'm going to do.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.814
I'm going to go left, right, up, up, up,
down, pick up, left, left, down, down,

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:04.248
down, down, down, drop off.

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:04.885
Something like that.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:09.710
So that plan, once you've chosen
the plan, you can just execute it.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.500
It's just that fixed
sequence of actions.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.530
And this happens sometimes in real life,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.040
there's certain kinds of
behaviors that we just have.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.020
It memorizes a sequence, but
in fact what's the problem with this?

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.001
Why can we, in general,
just execute plans in

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.650
order to satisfy the kind of goals
that we're trying to satisfy?

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.981
&gt;&gt; Well, so, I'll say two things.

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:34.057
One is, I was actually executing a plan
once I figured out what was going on.

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:34.777
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:35.613
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:36.272
Particularly the-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:40.443
Right so, part of it is, during
learning, you don't know stuff, so

00:01:40.443 --> 00:01:42.860
you don't know kind of plan to execute.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.080
For this slide I'm talking about
behavior structures for after learning.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.924
So during learning also sorts
of weird things have to happen.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:50.772
You have to try stuff out.

00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:51.851
You have to adapt.

00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:53.942
But once you've figured
out what you want to do,

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:56.705
you could try to represent it as
a plan but the problem with that.

00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:00.735
Okay, so it is true the environment that
I showed you has a property that makes

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:02.250
plans actually okay [LAUGH].

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's deterministic for
one thing.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.192
So that was the second
thing I was going to say,

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:12.850
which is that the plan worked because
everything did as I expected it to do.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.150
It was deterministic.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.320
&gt;&gt; Good, good.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.180
And so in stochastic environments
you need to be at least a little

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.410
bit of aware of your surroundings, you
need to move around with your eyes open.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.900
And so one step in that direction is
something called the conditional plan.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.190
So you can think of a conditional plan
as actually being a kind of program

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.540
where plan is a fixed program where it
just executes a sequence of statements.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.670
A conditional plan can
have if statements in it.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.940
You can sort of see what's
happening in your environment.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.450
I'm going to do this,
this, this, and this.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.440
And if I get to this point and such and
such is true, then I'll go this way and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.930
start this action, otherwise I'll
start these things, these actions.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.430
&gt;&gt; Right, so
could one of your if things be,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.420
if everything works out the way
I expected, keep going.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.190
If it ever doesn't, then stop and
try to figure out a new plan?

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.780
&gt;&gt; Usually that's not
thought of that way.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.842
A conditional plan would be something
where you have that sequence, and

00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:05.650
then there's a branch point,
we ask a question.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.688
And we could, if everything's gone okay,
continue the way we've been going,

00:03:10.688 --> 00:03:14.927
but if not, then a conditional
plan has an else statement, right?

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:15.682
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:17.977
&gt;&gt; It tells you what you should do
in case that that's not true or

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:19.650
in case it's something else that's true.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.840
you're talking about is something
more akin to dynamic replanning,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.280
where the idea is exactly what you said.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.835
We're just going to
continue along the plan,

00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:29.947
making predictions about
what's suppose to happen next.

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:33.349
If those predictions are violated,
we just generate a new plan.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.962
So there's nothing in the plan that
says, here's what I do in case things

00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:41.100
break, instead, we wait for something
to break and then we react to it.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.268
So that's just in time
conditional planning?

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:46.391
&gt;&gt; Just in time planning really.

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:46.950
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.726
&gt;&gt; because again the conditionals
aren't in there.

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:50.140
&gt;&gt; Hm, fair enough,
fair enough, I like that.
