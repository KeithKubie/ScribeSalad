00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.760
Today, I'd like to talk about the bagel problem.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.659
Let's suppose that we are going to buy a dozen bagels, 12 bagels, and we go into the store and there are several kinds.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.009
There might be plain bagels and poppy bagels and sesame bagels and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.680
onion bagels and everything bagels, potato bagels. There might be even blueberry bagels. And the question is, how many ways

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.680
for a given number of

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.560
kinds of bagels,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.849
can we purchase a bag full of 12 bagels?

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.639
Let's say that I want to buy a dozen bagels and there are 4 kinds, plain, poppy, sesame and onion.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.489
I might buy 3 of each kind, and that would make a dozen. But it's possible that I really like poppy,

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.218
so I might buy five poppy, and then I would buy fewer of the other kinds. There's every possible combination. For example,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.879
I could just buy all onion, and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.960
none of the others. I can buy eleven and one, I can buy, you know, eight and one and one and one and one,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.660
whatever works out to be 12. So I have total freedom, and if I'm picking and choosing,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.570
the order in which I choose things does not matter.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.659
It's not like I'm gonna, you know, which bagel am I going to choose first?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.210
Doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the total outcome at the end of the game. You have to buy 12 bagels,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.159
and you're not required to buy at least one of any of the kinds. You can really just buy,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.559
ignore one of the kinds, or ignore all but one of the kinds. So the store will not run out. They have deep bins.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.489
Even if you're buying 4 dozen, or 10 dozen, they will keep supplying you with the bagels you need. How many different combinations

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.020
of bagels can I get in a bag?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.100
Okay, well, I think what we should really do is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.569
we should focus on numerical examples, and see what the point is, and then at the end, we'll have some formula.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.769
So think about a dozen bagels. Some people might think a baker's dozen is thirteen.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.040
But let's say 12 bagels, and we might, to start, vary the numbers of kinds. Like, suppose

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.939
we go into a store that just sells traditional plain bagels.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
How many different ways can buy 12 bagels? The answer is just one way. We might go into a slightly

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.509
more interesting store that has 2 kinds of bagels. Plain bagels and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.789
chocolate bagels, and then how many ways can we buy the 12 bagels? So now the answer is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.479
more interesting. We can buy 0 plain bagels.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.279
We could buy 1 plain bagel. We could buy 2 plain bagels.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.850
We can go all the way up to 12 plain bagels.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.600
And then of course the other bagels, the bagels that are chocolate, will just fill in, so that all together we get 12.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.850
How many ways are there to buy

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.019
the 12 bagels when there are 2 kinds? And the answer is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.939
given by this range of possibilities, and actually there are 13 choices. If I look at all the numbers from 0 to 12

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.980
inclusive, 13.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.940
When there are 2 kinds, namely, it's the number of bagels you're buying plus 1. That'll be the answer.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.029
Now, let's say there are gonna be 3 kinds. Blueberry, let's have

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.900
bubblegum,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.300
Brady: "A bubblegum bagel?"

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.570
That's gonna be tough. The third bagel will be

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.309
caramel. And then the number of blueberry bagels that we buy can be anything from 0 up to 12. And then the number of

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.480
bagels left for the other 2 kinds will go from 12

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.999
down to 0. Now, we already saw that if we're buying a dozen bagels

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.829
and there are 2 kinds, the number of ways of doing that is 13. If I'm buying

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.090
11 bagels

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.920
and there are 2 kinds, the number of ways of doing that is 12. And if I'm buying

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.000
0 bagels

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.649
and there are 2 kinds, the number of ways of doing that is 1. And so the total number of ways of buying these 3

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.929
kinds of bagels, when you're buying a dozen bagels, will be the sum of all the numbers

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.779
from 13 down to 1. And that number is the sum of

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.260
the first 13 positive integers. And there's a formula. If I have the sum of the first n

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.180
positive integers,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.180
that formula is given by n times

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.050
n plus 1 over 2. So in particular, here, the n is equal to 13,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.379
so the number of ways of buying bagels when there are 3 kinds will be

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.870
13 Times 14

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.849
divided by 2. If we were thinking about a general formula,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.549
we might think of that 13 as 12 plus 1,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.549
and the 14 as 12 plus 2. So it's a number like that. It's a fraction that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.859
involves a product of two numbers, and then you divide by 2. We could do this forever. So, for example, if there are 4 kinds,

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.969
then we might say that we have maybe onion,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.230
and the onions would go from 0 up to 12. And then whenever we have a number of onions,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.330
we would therefore have a number remaining for the other 3 kinds.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.190
So, if we have 0 onions there will be 12 remaining for the other three kinds,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.049
and if we go all the way up to 12 onions, there will be 0 remaining.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.310
And we saw that if there are 12 bagels to be purchased, the number of ways of buying 3 kinds is 13

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.780
times 14 divided by 2. And if there are 11 bagels, there should be 12 times 13

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.769
divided by 2. And we keep going in this way.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.189
If we have 0 bagels, the number is gonna be 1, and at least in this formalism,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.399
well, I have to take 0 and add 1 to it, and 0 and add 2 to it, and divide by 2.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.429
So that's also gonna be 1. So I'll have a sum of numbers like this. You might think that

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.729
there would be some way of evaluating that sum,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.310
but the answer is not obvious until you try to do some kind of

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.629
analysis of a formula. And in fact

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.089
what is really needed here is some other perspective, some other way of doing the problem.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.880
Let's say we're doing four kinds.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.699
So the first kind that I wrote down was onion,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.049
the next kind might be blueberry, the next kind might be bubblegum

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.940
and the final kind will be caramel. We have our 12 bagels,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.940
so I'm just writing 12 stars.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.579
So far these bagels are unassigned in terms of their flavor. So so far we have these twelve bagels,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.620
and I've just written them with asterisks, known in the trade as stars, and I have to decide

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.500
which of these stars will be onion, which of the stars will be blueberry, which will be bubblegum and which will be

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.880
caramel. And the way

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:47.080
I will do that is to place dividers between the kinds. So let's say that I want to have only one caramel.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.120
So I will put a divider

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.209
separating off the caramel from the rest of the bagels. And then there's bubblegum.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.900
That's a little sketchy.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.080
Maybe I'll take two bubblegums, so I'll put a divider here, and then the bubblegum

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.630
range from the first divider that I'm writing all the way to the right, to the second divider. Let's say

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.790
I really like blueberry and I'll take four of them. So I'll write the blueberry bagels here.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:19.599
And that leaves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 bagels for the onion category. So, what have I done?

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.540
Well, I've written in a line a

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.880
certain number of symbols. How many symbols? Well, there were 12 symbols for the bagels to start, and then, in order to separate out the

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.059
4 kinds, I needed 3 dividers.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:41.890
That's a really key point, that the number of dividers is one less than number of kinds. And all together I've written 15

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:43.520
symbols, and

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.990
these 15 symbols, 12 are stars, and the remaining symbols are called bars.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.010
So what I have are stars and bars.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.859
I have summarized my choice of

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.859
kinds of bagels, onion, blueberry, bubblegum and caramel, by writing down the bars

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:07.749
that are interspersed among the stars. And the key point to this whole

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.270
analysis, is that I can put the stars and the bars in any order

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.699
I want, and for each order, that gives me a choice of how my bag will be

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:21.429
constituted. And in order to

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:28.298
figure out where the bars go relative to the stars, what I have to do is I have to contemplate

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:33.878
some tableau that is completely blank. It's devoid of symbols.

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:40.059
Where all together there are going to be 15 symbols, and every one of these slots is

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:45.188
capable of housing a star or a bar. And the rule,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:52.239
when I make my final decision, is that of these 15 slots, 12 of them have to be stars

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.040
and 3 of them have to be bars.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.760
Brady: "So Professor, when you fill out your stars and bars on this,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.720
basically if you have 0 of any flavor, it just means you'll have consecutive bars in that list."

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.200
That's right. Except, for example, suppose

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:14.138
I want no onion, right - whatsoever, then I would start with a bar, and to the left of the bar, there is no onion,

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:21.279
there's nothing. And then to the right of the bar, there will be 12 slots for bagels and 2 more slots for bars.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:26.708
So what we've done is we've related this bagel problem to another kind of problem.

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:31.780
It's a problem where there are 15 slots total, 3 of the slots are bars,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.860
and 12 of the slots are stars. And we just have to decide which are which. So this is a standard

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:46.779
combinatorial problem. There's a very simple formula involving factorials. So let's say that I want to analyze this problem

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:49.388
I want to make the choice. So what I'll do is

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:55.839
I'll say there are 15 slots to begin with, and I have to figure out where the bars go.

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.989
So let's say I'm gonna place my first bar somewhere.

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:02.679
There are 15 possibilities for that first bar.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.219
So I write the 15 -15 choices. Once I have placed down the first bar, there will be

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:16.870
14 remaining choices for the second bar, so I'll multiply by 14. And then, there will be 13

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:23.840
choices for the third bar, and I seem to have this product as the number of ways of making my choices.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.320
However, that's not completely correct,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.740
because when I put down these bars, these bars all have equals status.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.529
It's not like there's a first bar, a second bar or a third bar, even though we do have an orientation,

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:40.828
there's left to right. When I say I'm gonna put down my first bar,

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:47.339
I could have put down this bar, this bar or this bar. And so I have to divide by a factor

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.620
that shows you the number of ways of

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:55.229
permuting around the 3 bars. And the number of ways of doing that is

00:10:55.389 --> 00:11:01.229
there are 3 bars, I get 3 choices to say which one was gonna be the first, and then two choices

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.689
remaining, to see which will be the second. And then there's only one choice for the third bar.

00:11:06.689 --> 00:11:08.980
Brady: "So that's removed the problem of ordering."

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.100
That removes the problem of ordering. And so what we have here for

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:15.569
4 kinds is

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:16.930
we have

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:22.829
to go back to the previous situation, where we were looking at 1 kind and 2 kinds and 3 kinds,

00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:28.589
we have 13 which is 12 plus 1, we have 14 which is 12 plus 2, and we have

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:36.689
15 which is 12 plus 3, and then we divide by 1 times 2 times 3. So that's another way to summarize

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.829
what we have here. And if you are familiar with

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:43.829
the notation of combinations or

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.120
binomial coefficients,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.220
this product divided by the denominator product

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.740
is written 15 choose 3, and 15 choose 3 has a

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:03.060
standard notation that identifies what it is. It's the product of all the, the first 15 positive integers,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:11.009
that's called 15 factorial, divided by the product of the first 3 positive integers, that's 3 factorial, and then

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.060
divided by the

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.640
factorial of 15 minus 3,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.420
that'll be 12 factorial. And in fact, you can see that

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.769
this is another way of writing what I've already written. Because if I take 15

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:29.429
factorial and divide by 12 factorial, I am taking the product of the first 15 integers and

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:37.900
removing the product of the first 12 integers, and what's left are the integers from 13 to 15.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.900
13 times 14 times 15. So 15 factorial divided by 12 factorial

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:49.789
is the same product that we have in the numerator, and the 3 factorial is 3 times 2 times 1,

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.410
which also appears. And what's interesting about this formula is that

00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:01.339
there's a symmetry. It's symmetric between the number of bars and the number of stars. And that makes perfect sense,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.539
because when I'm choosing the bagel kinds, I can say, well

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.800
I'm gonna choose the places where the bars go down, where the dividers go down,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.589
but symmetrically, I can choose the places where the bagels go down, leaving 3 remaining slots

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.000
for the bars.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.040
Brady: "To generalize it, if you had had to buy

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.820
20 bagels and there were 6 flavors."

00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:29.929
Okay, so if there are 20 bagels that means 20 stars, and if there are 6 flavors

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.040
that means there are 5 bars,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:40.440
and the answer then, would be that I take the total number of slots, which will be 20 plus 5,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.890
and I choose

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:49.399
symmetrically either the 20 slots that are stars, or the

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.680
5 slots that are bars.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.320
Yeah, this is the famous Berkeley Campanile. Yeah.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.360
[chimes that have been interrupting lesson continue]

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.780
So let's say, in general, that we have n bagels and there are k

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.650
kinds of bagels. Well, k kinds

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:17.329
corresponds to k minus 1 bars. And so the total number of symbols is going to be n, which is the number of

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.169
bagels plus k minus 1, which is the number of dividers. And the number of ways of choosing

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.180
the n bagels when there are k kinds is the number of ways of choosing

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.750
k minus 1 things from a total of n plus k minus 1 slots.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.500
And symmetrically, that's the same as choosing n things from a situation where there are n

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.289
plus k minus 1 slots. And let me just

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:51.589
also write that in terms of factorials, if you like. This is n plus k minus 1 factorial

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.300
divided by the product of two factorials,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.260
n factorial and k minus 1 factorial.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.020
Brady: "What happens if we have more flavors than we need bagels?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.220
"Like if you are only buying 5 bagels and there are 10 flavors?"

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.320
It just means that there will be quite a few bars that are either at the end of the

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:13.339
configuration or next to other bars. The same problem

00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:16.248
occurs in disguise

00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:18.660
if you ask

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.660
students the following sort of question.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.189
Suppose you have a

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.869
bag of 12 identical lollipops.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:33.259
and there are 4 children, and you want to distribute these 12 lollipops to the 4 children.

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:37.308
How many ways can you do that? The answer is that you should take these children,

00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:45.229
and you should give them temporary names. You should call one child Onion, one child Blueberry, the third child will be called

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:53.020
Bubblegum and the fourth child will become Caramel. And so you have really exactly the same problem, and it has exactly the same answer.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.120
...there's only one thing to switch to in this case, it's door number three.

00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:04.549
Are you gonna stay with your choice or are you gonna make that leap to something different? And very often

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:11.359
contestants would stand there agonized, right, so they've got some new information - stick or switch - stick or switch
