00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.580
Let's think about the
units typically used

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.530
in the metric system to
measure an object's weight.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.460
And I'm putting the
weight in quotation marks

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.330
right over here because the
units I'm going to talk about

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270
are-- actually, if we
wanted to be technical,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.560
they're units of mass.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.090
And as we'll see later on
in our scientific careers,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.450
that weight and mass
are not the same thing.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.460
They are related.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.486
Mass you could view as
how much stuff there is.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.110
How much substance
does an object have?

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.610
How hard is it to change
the velocity of an object?

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.480
While weight is,
what's the force

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510
that gravity is pulling
down on that object?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.250
Now, in everyday
life, if we're just

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610
on the same planet or the
same part of the planet,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.210
if something has more mass,
it's going to have more weight.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.440
And if something
has more weight,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.540
it's going to have more mass.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.998
And that's why in
everyday language

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.490
these words are
often interchanged.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.080
Later on, we'll see that
these mean different things.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.080
For the sake of this
video, because we're really

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.190
just getting ourselves warmed
up with some of these units,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.810
I will use these
interchangeably.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.420
I'll use them in kind of
the everyday language sense,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.750
not in the technical
physics sense of the word.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.970
So in the metric
system when people

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.320
talk about measuring
relatively light things,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.060
they will often use the gram.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060
And to get a sense of
things that weight a gram,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.580
one example is a paper clip.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.920
Your average size paper clip
would weigh about a gram.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.630
A stick of chewing gum, not even
the whole pack of chewing gum,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.050
just a stick of chewing gum,
would weigh about a gram.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.100
A dollar bill would
weigh about a gram.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.694
So this really isn't
a lot of weight.

00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:46.110
Now, if you wanted to measure
things more on, I would say,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770
a human scale, you
could then increase

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.800
by a factor of thousand
and go to the kilogram.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.630
Kilogram.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.850
And as the unit implies, as the
prefix implies I should say,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.110
kilo, a thousand.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.650
This means 1,000 grams.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.390
And if you want to think about
how much that represents,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.240
well, many people will
measure their weight

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.530
in terms of kilograms.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.770
So I, for example, weigh
about 70 kilograms.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.730
And I'm 5' 9''.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.180
And I'm about average build
and I weigh about 70 kilograms.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.600
If you want to imagine
what a kilogram is like,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.660
imagine taking a liter of
fluid or a liter of water.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.730
So if you took a liter of water.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.430
And a liter, you could
imagine as a 10 centimeter

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.810
deep cube, 10 centimeters
wide, and 10 centimeters high.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.460
If you filled this up with
water, the weight of that thing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.694
is going to be 1 kilogram.

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:50.360
I know you're not
used to walking around

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.396
with 1 liter cubes of water.

00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:54.770
Another way of
thinking about it,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.269
if you go to the
supermarket and you

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.974
were to buy a 2 liter of soda.

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:01.890
And sometimes you buy 2
liters of other things

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.640
as well-- water, whatever.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.450
If you buy a 2 liter of soda
is going to weigh-- well,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.860
actually, 2 liters of
water, in particular,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.860
is going to weigh-- soda
has other things in it,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.280
so you can't be as
precise with the weight.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.340
But 2 liters of
water, I should say,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.890
are going to weigh
exactly 2 kilograms.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.230
We're just talking
about the water itself.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.987
We're not talking
about the container.

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:33.320
But if you want to get a rough
sense for how much weight

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.470
that is, that's going
to be 2 kilograms.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.540
So if you're measuring
human scale size

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.230
things, reasonable size
quantities of fluid,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.830
objects around this
scale, kilogram

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.150
makes a lot more sense.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.080
If you measure these
very light things,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.970
you're talking about a gram.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.450
If you want to get
really precise,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.990
this might be more in things
if you're doing a drug dosage

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.210
and you need to be very,
very, very precise,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.370
then you will sometimes see
people go to the milligram.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.390
But you could imagine a
milligram is 1/1,000 of a gram.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.480
And so 1/1,000 the weight
of a dollar bill or 1/1,000

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.620
the weight of a paper clip,
this is very, very, very,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.700
very small.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.520
So this usually doesn't come
into play in our everyday life.
