you know today our water bill in most

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630
you know today our water bill in most
 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.180
you know today our water bill in most
parts of the world is much less than our

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
parts of the world is much less than our

cable bill much less than our monthly
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590
cable bill much less than our monthly
cell phone bill and yet you could
