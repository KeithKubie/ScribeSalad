00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.060
Here’s a question: If you could extend your
life 3 years, just by running 7 minutes a

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.349
day - would you do it?

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.349
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I’ll
admit it: I’m not a runner. I tried to run

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.519
a half-marathon back in 2008, but then I injured
my knee and it all went to hell. So imagine

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.960
my surprise, when a new study pops up this
week in the Journal of the American College

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.609
of Cardiology - that says you don’t have
to go the distance, to reap the benefits of

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.340
running. Turns out, all it takes - is 7 minutes
a day!

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.110
The article shares the results of a 15-year-long
cohort study of over 55,000 adults, to see

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.660
whether running could reduce someone’s risk
of death from anything - not just heart disease.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.980
Now because it is a cohort study, it can’t
technically conclude that running is what

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.960
causes the reduced risk of death - but the
correlation is there, and it paints a pretty

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.210
clear picture.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.530
People who run, even in modest amounts, of
51 minutes a week - were found to have a 45%

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.260
reduction in the risk of cardiovascular-related
death, and a 30% overall reduction in any

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.050
type of death, compared to non-runners. This
means that, on average, running can increase

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.770
someone’s life expectancy by about three
years.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.220
Now 51 minutes a week, or about 7 minutes
a day - isn’t exactly a tall order. But

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.830
the study also took other factors into account
- like distance, and speed - and found that

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.090
even they don’t make much of a difference
at all. Even a light jog can significantly

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.480
reduce one’s mortality risk. Although they
did find that persistent runners - people

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.180
who do it regularly - had the best outcomes,
with an average 50% reduction in cardiovascular-related

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.060
deaths, and 29% reduction in overall mortality.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
Pretty impressive. Although it is worth noting
that while certain things were adjusted for

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.780
- like age, smoking, alcohol consumption,
and family history of heart disease - diet

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.300
was not adjusted for, which can have a pretty
big influence on someone’s health status.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.200
Researchers also note that while it is a big
study, most of the people who participated

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.060
were white, middle-to-upper class adults.
So it’s not totally clear how their results

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.390
apply to other populations.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.760
In any case, it’s still promising to know
that even the most minimal amount of exercise

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.200
can have positive effects on your health.
And hopefully, that’ll encourage some of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.530
us - myself included - to not be so intimidated
by the thought of working out. I’m sure

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.650
all of us out there would agree that 7 minutes
a day - is something we can all make time

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.810
for.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.200
What do you guys think? Is exercise less scary
to you now? Let us know your thoughts in the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440

guys for watching!
