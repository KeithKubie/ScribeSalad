00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.340
(boom)
Chris Stuckmann: Oh!...the hell was that--

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.700
(machinery sounds)
Whoa! Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't know what's happening, I'm sorry, I mean, it won't stop--

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.240
(boom)
Nostalgia Critic: Stuckmann! Are you stopping the opening crawl again?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.000
Stuckmann: Whoa! Critic, Snob, what are you guys doing in space?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.240
Cinema Snob: Well, we just wrapped up our Force Awakens review.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.660
Critic: As well as just celebrated HRRRAAnukkah!

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.960
Stuckmann: Well, I just finished doing my Rogue One review with you.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.440
Continuity-wise, I don't think those timelines sync up.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.260
Critic: No no, I'm pretty sure our two separate storylines match up exactly, pretty sure.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.300
Snob: Yeah, it only FEELS like two years have gone by.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.340
Critic: Yeah, and we all look exactly the same as when we saw each other a couple seconds ago!

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.780
Stuckmann: Do we? I'm pretty sure at least my teeth look different.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.980
Snob: Yeah, so step off the crawl so we can review The Last Jedi!

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.380
Stuckmann: I don't know, if literally no time has passed, I don't think the crawl is gonna give us much.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.180
Critic: Look, this is how these Star Wars movies work.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.720
A few years pass by with each one and the crawl always catches us up!

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.980
Stuckmann: I'm tellin' ya, Critic, they got nothing.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.800
Critic: Well, we'll be the judge of that, so step off!

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.760
[Star Wars MIDI resumes]

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.960
Critic: God damn it! 
Stuckmann: Yeah, I told ya the crawl's pointless. They got nothin'.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.580
Critic: Alright, let's just get on with it.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.920
Snob: Oh wait, I always wondered what the last lyric was.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.220
Snob: Meow! Lloyd was right!
Critic: *sigh* Let's just get going!

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.800
Stuckmann: How did you guys do that?!

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.580
Critic: Chris, there have been huge advances in the last couple of seconds since we saw each other!

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.580
Snob: The Force, space technology, appearing wherever you want, all big breakthroughs.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.080
Critic: And we have those ingenious minds to thank for it!

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.600
(porg noises)

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.260
Stuckmann: Porgs? They're responsible for all this?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.100
Critic: Well, whatdja think, they were just a toy ad named after Swedish Chef gibberish?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.480
Snob: Shame, Stuckmann. Shame.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.380
Critic: The porgs are the most im-porg-ant part of Star Wars right now, they're even more central than the Force!

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.080
Stuckmann: I mean, I like 'em fine, I just didn't realize they were so interwoven into everything.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.240
Critic: They are.
Snob: Extremely interwoven.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.180
Critic: Now let them continue to figure out the mysteries of the universe while we start our review.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.700
Stuckmann: Man, I am so sorry again, porgs.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.440
Snob: They'll forgive you, Stuckmann. In time.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.340
Critic: This is our review of The Last Jedi a.k.a.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.940
A Porg's Tail.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.920
The Last Jedi is Episode VIII of the Star Wars whatever-gy.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.040
It was highly anticipated obviously, but also carried a lot of concern.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.520
Snob: After complaints that its predecessor, Force Awakens, was a retread of A New Hope,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.000
fans were worried whether or not this would be a retread of Empire Strikes Back.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.160
Stuckmann: They were also concerned it might be slightly underwhelming like many parts of its spin-off, Rogue One,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.740
so this film had a lot to live up to and several hurdles to jump.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.440
Critic: But thankfully the porgs pulled us through!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.080
Critic: Unlike some naysayers that doubted! 
Stuckmann: I'm sorry, I didn't know.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.360
Snob: Shame, Stuckmann! Shame!
Stuckmann: STOP SAYING THAT!!

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.580
Let's see how Last Jedi did with...

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.780
The Last Jedi.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.900
Snob: Shame!

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.680
Stuckmann: After an impressive space fight on par with Rogue One--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.320
Critic: All it was missing was Darth Vader ceiling-ing someone to death!

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.480
Stuckmann: --General Leia escapes with the Resistance, angering General Hux but especially angering Emperor-ish Snoke.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.080
Hux: Lord Snoke, I assure you my hammy overacting will not be thwarted next time,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.100
please don't use your Force--

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.220
Snoke: --to do this?

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.040
Hux: *yelp*
(slam)

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.100
Snoke: Yeah, not feeling it, buddy. Think you'd have your stuff together after our planet-destroying eight ball blew up.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.140
Hux: I understand, your Snokiness, but we have a way of tracking them through lightspeed!

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.330
Snoke: Oh, that's cool.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.800
You'd think, me being so powerful, I'd sense that.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.140
Hux: Or maybe read the report on your desk every once in a while--

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.700
*yelp*
(slam)

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.120
Snoke: No, I got apprentice shit to do.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.780
Speaking of, where's that douchebag from Girls?

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.340
Hux: *scream*
Kylo Ren: Hey-hey.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.700
Snoke: Three things.
Kylo: Go.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.160
Snoke: Kill your mother.
Kylo: Got it.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.040
Snoke: Ditch the pointless mask.
Kylo: Gone.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.660
Snoke: And do a shirtless scene for the ladies.
Kylo: You have watched Girls, right?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.260
Snoke: Unwillingly.
Kylo: Girlfriend?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
Snoke: Of course girlfriend!

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.400
Critic: Kylo Ren finds he can't destroy his mother, but luckily the other fighters can, blasting her into space.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.100
Stuckmann: I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a little awkward, considering this is Carrie Fisher's last movie.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.220
Critic: Oh, don't worry, it gets even MORE awkward!

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.760
[mock Superman theme MIDI]

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.920
Snob: Oh, c'mon, Critic. Show what really happened.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.000
Critic: That IS what really happened, she goes shooting star on our asses!

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.200
Even if you overlook Fisher's passing and the fact that we're watching her cold corpse come back to life--

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.440
Snob: That's a pretty BIG overlook!

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.260
Critic: --when did Leia learn to do something like that?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.320
Stuckmann: We see how hard it is for prodigies Luke and Rey just to move rocks.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.140
How can she vacu-suck her way back to the ship with no practice?

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.060
Snob: Maybe Luke and her were getting a drink one night and he said

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.960
Luke: So, if by some rare chance, you're out Sandra Bullock-ing in space, just remember

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.080
hold your hand out to the nearest ship.
Force has got your back.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.540
Leia: That's uncomfortably specific but good to know.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540
Luke: Welcome to my world.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.820
Snob: It's weird!

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.460
Critic: Meanwhile, Rey is still in the midst of
handing Luke Skywalker his lightsaber.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.640
Rey: Master Skywalker, I've journeyed far and wide to--

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.780
oooookay.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.620
Snob: Luke tries ignoring her, but the big walking carpet is a little more forceful.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.620
Luke: Chewie, what are you doing here?

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.980
Luke: I told you, I'm not a Jedi anymore.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.140
Critic: Rey brings Luke up to speed with all the things that have happened since he's been gone.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.280
Luke: So Han gave up these sequels to do Blade Runner sequels...

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.480
that was a smart choice.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.700
Rey: Show me the ways of the Force, then
you can come back with me and restore balance.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.560
Luke: No, I'm happy here with my weird lizard nuns,
my green nipple alien milk, and of course, the porgs.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.300
Rey: My God, you have porgs here?

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.920
Luke: Yes, they have taught me more about
the Force than I ever thought possible.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.160
Stuckmann: Okay, did they 'cause I don't remember that happening!

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Critic: I can't believe you missed how im-porg-ant they are!

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.360
Snob: Listen to him not, marshmallows of enchantment.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240
SHAME!

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.460
Luke still says no, but R2 shows him his frenching sister,
which gives him the motivation to train again.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.560
Critic: Meanwhile, Hux is still chasing down Leia's ship, but due to some confusing techno-jargon, they can't defeat them yet.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.960
Hux: Tell me again why we're not firing at them!!

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.300
First Order Personnel: They're too out of range!

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.280
Hux: But they can't even go to lightspeed!!

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.820
First Order Personnel: No, they'd run out of fuel!

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.880
Hux: Then why don't we go a little faster than they're going?!?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.500
First Order Personnel: Look, we only have three settings on this ship. Do you want evil or efficient?

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.280
Hux: Well, evil, of course!

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.680
Snob: While Leia is out of commission,
the second-in-command, Vice Admiral Holdo--

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.060
boy, that would have been a different movie!

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.380
(pop)
--is put in charge, and she seems less like an admiral

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.200
and more like a working mom trying
to keep her cool around her teenage son.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.500
Poe: We need some answers, we need to know what's going on!

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.000
Holdo: I hear you, but I need you to trust my decision.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.500
Poe: How? How can we trust you if we don't even know what you're doing!?

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.400
Holdo: I need to keep things from you, so that you can learn a lesson.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.680
Poe: We don't need to learn any lessons, what we need to do is--

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.380
Holdo: GO TO YOUR ROOM!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.960
Poe: You're the worst vice admiral ever!

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.700
Stuckmann: This brings us to Finn, who just woke up from his kinda coma,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.780
and Rose, a technician who lost her sister in battle.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.920
Finn: Rose, you know about space engineering.
How are they tracking us even though we use lightspeed?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.400
Rose: It must be that new porg technology that's changing the world!

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.220
(smack)
Stuckmann: OW!

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.460
Rose: There's a code breaker who can help us.
We can sneak to the solar system he's at,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.960
bring him back, and he can hack the other ship.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.420
Finn: Great, let's go!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.880
Rose: You coming?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.620
Critic: U-U-Um...w-we're good.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.980
Snob: All fine.
Stuckmann: Thanks though.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.120
Rose: Are you sure? It's really exciting!

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.080
Finn: Yeah, we got space horses and everything.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.820
Stuckmann: Probably not as exciting as you'd expect.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.700
Snob: Yeah, I'm getting a "sidequest filler" vibe.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.720
Critic: Tell us how it went though.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.920
Finn: Come on...

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.180
*exclamations of protest*

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.940
*loud groaning*

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.540
Critic: Alright. Let's talk about this scene.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.220
Stuckmann: Finn and Rose are fine characters,
but their subplot feels unnecessary and not very Star Wars.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:01.020
Critic: They go to a surprisingly boring casino where the code breaker is,
but a lot of the time, it's just listening to them say

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.320
Rose: I was raised here among the people,
abused to make the system of greed work...

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.600
Social commentary social commentary social commentary...

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
Finn: ...social commentary?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.700
Rose: With political subtext!
Finn: *sharp gasp*

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.200
Snob: Remember the pointless diner scene in Attack of the Clones
and the pointless squid scene from Rogue One?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.800
Just combine those scenes together 
and you have one-fourth of your movie.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.040
Stuckmann: What's unfortunate is that every time it cuts back to Rey and Luke, the story becomes so challenging and mythical.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.580
Luke: I knew Snoke had already corrupted Kylo's mind.
For a split second, I thought about killing him.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.580
(lightsaber activation sound)

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.880
But then, I was like "y'know, nah".

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.620
But then, he happened to wake up at that exact moment.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.120
So...yeah, all of this is kind of because a poorly-timed light switch.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.460
Rey: My God, let's continue to explore this and develop our

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.100
Finn: Us again!

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.400
*more heavy groaning*

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.820
Rose: We freed some animals.
Finn: Space horses!

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.060
Snob: ...great...

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.160
Finn: Oh, and we found the code breaker,
but he was busy and didn't do anything.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.140
Rose: In fact, you can probably start a pointless MacGuffin count around now.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.220
Stuckmann: Awesome. Can you let us get back to Luke and Rey again?

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.540
Finn: Oh! Sure.
Rose: *chuckle* Silly us.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.160
Rey: Why would this strange section of the island be associated with the Dark side?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.840
Critic: Well now, this should be interesting...

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.020
Rey: Perhaps because it could give me answers to my past,
and the way of the Jedi is letting go of your past.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.240
What a fascinating conflict of--

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.460
Finn &amp; Rose: Drag! Drag!

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.200
Snob: *loud groan* Dammit!

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.580
Stuckmann: Haven't you dragged ENOUGH?!?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.560
Rose: We found another code breaker!

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.360
Finn: This is DJ.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.680
Oh God, is that what we call you?!

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.360
DJ: Yep. I'm a rogue who always plays on the winning s-s-s-side.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.140
Critic: Is that supposed to be a stutter?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.720
DJ: Yeah, but it's pretty inconsistent. Just like this movie, am I r-r-r-right?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.020
I'm gonna be the most utilized cameo since Gwendoline Christie.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.120
Stuckmann: Rey decides to go to Kylo Ren,
because she feels there's still good in him,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.560
while Luke is thinking about burning what's left of the Jedi Texts.
He gets an unexpected visitor though.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.960
???: Wazzup, L-dog?

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.740
Luke: Back off, Master Yoda. I'm gonna destroy the Jedi tree temple thingy. At least, I think I'm going to...

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.460
Yoda: Less schlock, more shock.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.240
(thunder)

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.380
(explosion)

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.900
Snob: WHOA! I completely underestimated Jedi ghosts!

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.640
Stuckmann: Talk about becoming more powerful than you can possibly imagine, that muppet don't mess around.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.420
Critic: You always thought the Jedi spirits were more of a guiding light, giving advice and wisdom.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.380
With that kind of power, you can have a friggin' Jedi ghost army like in Return of the King and win this war in two seconds!

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.600
Yoda: We must let go of the past and create a future of new challenges and ideas.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.060
Luke: You DO know you're talking to Star Wars fans, right?

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.160
Yoda: Bite my ass, they can!

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.840
Luke: ...fair enough.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.480
Snob: Back on Holdo's ship, Poe takes over command by forcing her to surrender.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.860
Holdo: This is mutiny, Mr. Poe.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.180
Poe: That's right, we're taking over. We're finally gonna put things the way they should be!

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.460
I'm tired of listening to you, I'm tired of not getting all the answers, I'm tired of d-

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.320
is nobody having a problem with me holding a gun at you and taking over the ship?

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.540
Holdo: Yeah, no, everyone seems fine, doing their own thing.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.480
Poe: Yeah, I kinda thought there'd be a lot more resistance in this Resistance.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.020
(blaster fire)
*grunt*

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.080
Poe: General Leia???

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.780
Leia: Well done, Holdo. You got us to the planet where we can evacuate our fleet.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.700
Poe: Wait...so this was all part of your plan!

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.780
Holdo: Yup.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.460
Poe: Well, why didn't you just tell us before?

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.520
Holdo: ...well...

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:40.520
...like I said before, to teach you a lesson.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.100
Poe: What, not telling anyone the plan and risking a mutiny; that LITERALLY just happened!?

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.600
Holdo: Well...*unintelligible sounds*...

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.440
Poe: Was that gibberish?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.560
Holdo: No...that was an alien language.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.100
Poe: What does it mean?

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.380
Holdo: IT MEANS SHUT UP!!

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.200
Stuckmann: Kylo Ren takes Rey to Snoke and

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.220
WHAT IS UP WITH THAT PLAYBOY MANSION ROBE?!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.620
Critic: Yeah, Snoke is looking less like an intimidating villain and more like a crumpled-up drawing of Quagmire.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:17.860
Snoke: Rey, baby, welcome to my pad! Do you like my Snoke-ing jacket? I am totally gonna rule the universe.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:26.440
Snob: Granted, the CG on him is a lot better than in the last one,
but some of this material is a little too on-the-nose familiar...

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.580
Snoke: Let me show you your friends as they perish in space.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.700
Let me loosen your cuffs because that's proven to be smart in the past.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.260
Let me...

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.860
...make this a little easier.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.780
Page 84, scene 5.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.000
Rey: Where you reveal there's no more good left in your apprentice.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.820
Snoke: Yeah...page 92, scene 7.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.460
Rey: Where you reveal that you've tricked me and you're more powerful than me.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.460
Snoke: Got it...and page 103, scene 12.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.640
Rey: Where you reveal you're going to kill me,
but then your apprentice stabs you in the back!

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.800
Snoke: Right on it.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.900
oh wait, skip that o--

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.400
OOOH!

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:15.980
Who the hell even was I? Would it have killed anyone to give me one sentence of backstory?

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.780
???: Oh my God, Frank! That's, like, the second time we let the leader of the Dark side get killed!

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.620
I'm beginning to think the red guards are cursed!

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.440
Frank: Ehhh. It's okay, Harry. Revenge is afoot.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.340
Harry: Right!

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.620
(radio static)
Send in every stormtrooper ya got, nyehehehe!

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.140
Frank: Uh, Harry. What are you doing?

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.700
Harry: I'm going for backup.
Frank: No, Harry. We got this.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.440
Harry: I really feel like we don't!

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.920
Frank: Uhhh, you think more guards would have saved our emperor?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.300
Harry: Very much, yah.
Frank: No. We use our ninja moves with no blasters, ehehheh.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.760
Harry: Uh, I don't know, that, uh, that sounds very wrong.
Frank: It feels so right.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.640
Harry: I think this is why we have two emperors on our dead list.
Frank: Harry. We're the red guys.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.320
When has anything ever gone bad for a guy wearing red in sci-fi?

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.720
Harry: Eh. Guess you're right. CHARGE!
Frank: Charge.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.920
Frank: Ow.
Harry: Heheh, we really suck at this.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.140
Kylo: Rey, come with me. Together, we can page 92, scene 4 of Empire Strikes Back.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.500
Rey: That is my favorite page, but I can't!

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.000
I know my parents were a bunch of nobodies who abandoned me.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.960
Kylo: Not really sure what that has to do with...

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.920
wait, what?

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.380
Snob: Hang on, if her parents are nobody, why was the last movie building it up like they were somebody?

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.400
Rose &amp; Finn: MacGuffin number two!

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.660
Snob: Oh...um, what a twist, I guess.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.500
Critic: Speaking of weird surprises, after it's revealed that DJ switched sides--

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.600
DJ: Tr-Tr-Tr-Traitor.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.400
Rose &amp; Finn: MacGuffin number three!

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.320
Critic: Yeah, great,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.640
BB-8 saves the day by gunning down everyone, operating a killer robot!

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.400
Stuckmann: BB-8 weirdly has a body count...

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.400
Critic: Thus Finn and Phasma have a big fight that's been building up for a while.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.080
Phasma: Time to finish what we sort of started!

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.900
Snob: Unfortunately, it's cut short because Holdo sacrifices herself

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.820
by aiming her abandoned ship at the First Order and putting it in lightspeed.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.640
(time distortion)
Holdo: Oh, hey, guys! 'S my last words. Crazy, right? *giggle*

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.400
(sonic boom)

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.840
Phasma: Is that all I get?!? I'm Gwendoline goddamn Christie!!

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.720
I'm fifth least likely to die on Game of Thrones!!!

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.640
Finn: Sorry, we had to cut it short.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.180
Phasma: For WHAT!?

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.060
Finn: For boring casino FILLER!!!

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.620
Phasma: LAME!!!

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.720
(explosion)

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.480
Finn &amp; Rose: MacGuffin number four!

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.680
Finn: We need real surprises in this.
Rose: Right?

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.460
Critic: Hux finds Kylo Ren unconscious and tries to finish him off.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.240
Hux: It's the end of the line for

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.940
yooooooou've got something right there, on your shoulder, ju-just there.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.980
Kylo: I'm in control now. Let's go destroy the Resistance.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980
Hux: Cool beans...!

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.240
Snob: On the planet below, the Resistance are cheerfully reunited--

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.600
Leia: There. I hugged him. Ya happy, ya weirdos?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.960
And Greedo shot first.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.680
OHHHHHHHHHHH

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.560
Snob: --doesn't last long, as the First Order sends in the AT-AT Walkers.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.200
Stuckmann: Isn't it pronounced "at at"?

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.080
Snob: There's gonna be enough bullshit in the comments, why worry now?

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.580
Finn: Oh no, a laser battering ram!

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.680
Poe: A what now!?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.420
Finn: It's...exactly what it sounds like.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.400
And i'm gonna sacrifice myself to it.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.060
Poe: Yeah, I guess it did kind of explain itself.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:31.420
Stuckmann: Finn tries to sacrifice himself to destroy the laser, but Rose stops him at the last minute.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.440
Finn: Rose! Why'd you do it, Rose!?

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:39.340
Rose: It's not about fighting the things we hate, it's about saving the things we love.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.200
Stuckmann: So you sacrificed yourself to stop him from sacrificing himself.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.060
Snob: Yeah...either way, someone's getting sacrificed.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.500
Rose: shhhh!
Stuckmann: ok

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.480
Rose: Save the things we love, Finn...

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.960
Now take my middle school kiss!

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.960
*kiss*

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.760
Finn: Um, is that the kind of relationship we had?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.660
'cuz honestly, I think I had more chemistry with Poe.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.420
(radio static)
Poe: (on radio) Hey, thanks a lot, buddy!

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.260
Now, bring her back and be sure to keep it vague whether or not she's dead.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.960
We don't know if she's sequel material yet.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.480
Rose: HEY!
Finn: Oh, c'mon, you're set for life with conventions!

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.820
Stuckmann: Luke Skywalker arrives though and sees his sister one last time before facing Kylo Ren,

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.040
allowing the Resistance time to escape.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.900
Kylo: Don't even try and toy with me, Skywalker!
I can see right through you.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.720
Luke: shit-- Oh.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.900
Kylo Ren, I have come to apologize for failing you.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:39.700
Know that even if you were to blow me to smithereens,
you would only increase the pain that you feel

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.940
(explosions and laser cannon fire)

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.940
Hux: Ha, look!! Operation Blow Him to Smithereens was a smashing success,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.400
you can even ask him yourself!

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.920
*shriek*

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.720
Kylo: AAAAAAAAAAAA

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.200
Stuckmann: It turns out Luke has used all of his powers to project himself from entire planets away!

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.600
Luke: Haaaahahahaha! You think this is the real Quaid!?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.180
Stuckmann: But it drains all of his literal life force.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.400
Snob: He strikes a Captain Morgan's pose and fades into the sunsets,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.720
allowing Rey to rescue the Resistance while he distracts them.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.860
Stuckmann: This will likely be polarizing for some fans,
but here's a few reasons why I don't mind it.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.840
It shows that both Luke and the Force are continuing to change and evolve.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.140
That's what we want from our myths, isn't it? To evolve?

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.240
What if, after A New Hope, fans said "the Force can't shoot lightning",

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.540
or "the Force can't make you see ghosts",

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.700
or "the Force can't lift an entire ship"!

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.280
We would miss out on an ever-developing and ever-changing world that was being shaped and molded,

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.820
so in my opinion this is a great and even practical addition to what the Force can do.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.360
Snob: Y-Yeah, but he was projecting the dice the whole time too?
Stuckmann: What?

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.780
Snob: While he's fighting from galaxies away killing what's left of him,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.760
was he really just sitting on that rock saying to himself

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.600
Luke: Remember the dice, remember the dice, remember the dice, remember the dice.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.840
Snob: That just seems like a weird detail he would focus on.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.800
Stuckmann: Snob, who do you think taught him how to do that?

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.040
(porg noises)

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.220
Snob: My God, I've questioned the porgs and brought shame to all...

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.740
Stuckmann: Whoa! Whoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoa!
Critic: Nonononononononoheyheyheyheyhey!

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.480
That is not the porg way.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.100
(porg noises)

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.140
Critic: Oh, it is? Okay, continue.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.859
Nah, nah nah nah, y'know...Han's died enough.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.740
Snob: Fine.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.140
Critic: Finally, we see one of the abused kids from the casino look out into the stars,

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.980
imagining all that the future holds for him.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.880
Stuckmann: And yes, he even appears to be Force-sensitive.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.280
Snob: Last Jedi my ass! This movie should have been called

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.940
[Archer imitation (probably Rob)]

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.360
Critic: And that was the latest Star Wars movie. How was it?

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.620
All three:
AMAZING!

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.260
except when it was kind of dumb.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.480
Critic: The more I think back to it,
the more I do find things wrong with it,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.160
but, at the same time, the more I think back to it,
the more I don't care.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.540
Because I'm so distracted by how visually grand
and emotionally breathtaking the other scenes are.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:27.260
Snob: It has flaws, certainly, and for some, they might be too distracting, but it still feels like Star Wars.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.780
Even though it's not going in a completely different direction,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.100
it's still going in a direction that's different enough to be entertaining.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:42.140
Stuckmann: It borrows from more than just from itself, it borrows from classic myths, anime, religions, and philosophies.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:49.180
It still knows how to keep us talking
and asking questions, looking for deeper meanings, which is what any timeless myth should do.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.780
And I'm still looking forward to seeing what's gonna happen next
in a galaxy far, far away.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.220
And after all this...I just gotta say...

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.160
thank you, porgs, for making this all blossom.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.920
(porg noises)

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.160
(blaster fire)

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.880
Snob: Okay, seriously. I did not like those things.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.220
Critic: Same.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.020
Stuckmann: Alright, but, uh...who's gonna fly the ship?

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.300
Critic: C'mon, how hard could it be?

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.940
Snob: So I'll see you in Mexico?
Critic: Yeah.
Stuckmann: See you there.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.840
Harry: That sounds very wrong.
Frank: It feels so right.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.220
Hey, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out.
For those have been paying attention,

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.300
we did a charity stream not long ago
for St. Jude Children's Hospital Research

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.260
and we're keeping that video open and donations open for a little bit.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.740
If you go to our YouTube channel, you can see where the charity stream video is

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.060
and we're still having the donation link open for a few more days.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:13.340
That's what the charity is gonna be this week
and if, by the time you see this, it's, y'know, gone,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.040
maybe you saw that sometime later, still donate!
It is a wonderful organization,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:25.600
It's one of those charities where, y'know how you kinda do research and certain things and then you find out stuff like "Oh, I didn't know that",

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:32.480
This is one of those charities were the more research you do, just the cooler stuff you find and they just do so much wonderful, phenomenal stuff.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:43.520
and, yeah, it's just definitely worth checking out and so, definitely for the charity stream that we did, definitely consider going over there and donating.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:51.980
And even if the charity stream, if the link is gone by the time you watch this, please consider giving anyway because they do such wonderful, phenomenal work

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.820
Definitely check it out if you get a chance, and thank you so much! Take care.
