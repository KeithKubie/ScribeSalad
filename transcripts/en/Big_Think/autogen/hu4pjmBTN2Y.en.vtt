okay so what should we make up the
concept of events there are a lot of

the last century it's that there's an
 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.540
the last century it's that there's an
enormous amount of variation within the

that if you look at things from a

that if you look at things from a
 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.580
that if you look at things from a
genetic point of view the certain kinds

genetic point of view the certain kinds
 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.850
genetic point of view the certain kinds
of molecular sequences are more common

that's because during the course of

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840
that's because during the course of
 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.590
that's because during the course of
human history these groups have been

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
human history these groups have been
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.100
human history these groups have been
separated from one another they haven't

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110
separated from one another they haven't
 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.830
separated from one another they haven't
intermarried and that's given various

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840
intermarried and that's given various
 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.889

thing to say about that is that these

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869
thing to say about that is that these
 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.630

a tremendously our brilliant study was

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719
a tremendously our brilliant study was
 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.340
a tremendously our brilliant study was
done by researchers at Stanford that

actually divided the human population

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840
actually divided the human population
 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.730
actually divided the human population
into groups that the research

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740

referring to them as races so you might
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.390
referring to them as races so you might
start out with the human population and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
start out with the human population and
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.000
start out with the human population and
say ask the following question on the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.100
transplantation for example there is a
point in saying well you what you need

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110
point in saying well you what you need
 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.619
point in saying well you what you need
is somebody to give you a kidney who

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629
is somebody to give you a kidney who
 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.830
is somebody to give you a kidney who
comes from this particular group but

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840
comes from this particular group but
 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.110
comes from this particular group but
there are other people say this is just

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120
there are other people say this is just
 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.869
there are other people say this is just
the sort of stuff that breeds

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879
the sort of stuff that breeds
 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.070
the sort of stuff that breeds
discrimination and Prejudice as it has

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080
discrimination and Prejudice as it has
 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.290
discrimination and Prejudice as it has
in the past and there are the people who

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
in the past and there are the people who
 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.360
in the past and there are the people who
say precisely because of that

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370
say precisely because of that
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.980
say precisely because of that
discrimination we've had in the past

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990
discrimination we've had in the past
 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.839
discrimination we've had in the past
it's important to acknowledge these

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849
it's important to acknowledge these
 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.119
it's important to acknowledge these
groups so I want to say there's a

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129
groups so I want to say there's a
 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.909
groups so I want to say there's a
certain kind of biological phenomenon

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919
certain kind of biological phenomenon
 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.890
certain kind of biological phenomenon
that stands behind the historic process

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900
that stands behind the historic process
 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.909
that stands behind the historic process
of dividing people into racial groups

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919
of dividing people into racial groups
 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.830
of dividing people into racial groups
but actually these racial groups are

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
but actually these racial groups are
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.770
but actually these racial groups are
constructed by us it's we who decide

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780
constructed by us it's we who decide
 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.950
constructed by us it's we who decide
that we want to draw the lines and the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960
that we want to draw the lines and the
 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.110
that we want to draw the lines and the
basis on which we should decide that is

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120
basis on which we should decide that is
 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.809
basis on which we should decide that is
an ethical basis we should decide how we

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819
an ethical basis we should decide how we
 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.589
an ethical basis we should decide how we
actually treat people most fairly so the

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599
actually treat people most fairly so the
 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.309
actually treat people most fairly so the
issue is really not whether there are

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319
issue is really not whether there are
 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.559
issue is really not whether there are
racial groups I mean we could think

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569
racial groups I mean we could think
 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.050
racial groups I mean we could think
about racial groups in as one two three

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060
about racial groups in as one two three
 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.700
about racial groups in as one two three
four five six seven and so on in

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710
four five six seven and so on in
 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.659
four five six seven and so on in
divisions in this initial human

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669
divisions in this initial human
 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.180
divisions in this initial human
population but it's a question of what

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190
population but it's a question of what
 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.140
population but it's a question of what
the divisions if any are useful from the

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
the divisions if any are useful from the
 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.670
the divisions if any are useful from the
point of view of justice and fairness

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680
point of view of justice and fairness
 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.129
point of view of justice and fairness
and that I think is the right way to

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139
and that I think is the right way to
 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.129
and that I think is the right way to
think about race so is it scientific

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139
think about race so is it scientific
 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.300
think about race so is it scientific
well there's sort of something

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310
well there's sort of something
 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.640
well there's sort of something
scientific lurking in the background is

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650
scientific lurking in the background is
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.529
scientific lurking in the background is
it socially constructed yes it's

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539
it socially constructed yes it's
 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.019
it socially constructed yes it's
socially constructed and the social

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029
socially constructed and the social
 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.510
socially constructed and the social
construction ought to proceed on the

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520
construction ought to proceed on the
 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.590
construction ought to proceed on the
best ethical basis we can find
