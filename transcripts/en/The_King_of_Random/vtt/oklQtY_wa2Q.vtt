00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.677
In today's video,

00:00:00.677 --> 00:00:02.926
we're going to see what happens
if we use extreme cold,

00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:05.300
and a low pressure environment
to suck all of the moisture

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.500
out of some Orbeez.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:15.060
[Music]

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.900
Guys, we have
some Orbeez left over,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.800
and not just this
little bag of Orbeez,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.900
but not too long ago,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.400
we made our Diamond
play button sculpture

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.140
by pouring molten aluminum

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.300
that used to be our Diamond
play button into Orbeez,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.100
and we still have most
of those Orbeez.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.795
We have tens of
thousands of Orbeez,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
I think here.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600
And while a few of them

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
are burned from being in contact
with our molten aluminum,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.420
for the most part,
they're still intact.

00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:42.500
They're still Orbeez,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.984
and we wanted
to see what happens

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.660
if you freeze dry an orbee.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.600
As we've explained
in a couple of other videos,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.900
a freeze dryer works
by lowering the temperature,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.600
and freezing whatever is
in the machine,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.100
and then it pulls a vacuum,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.900
and then it warms
up a little bit.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.200
And as it warms up,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.477
all of that frozen
liquid in there,

00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:03.277
it gets turned into a vapor.

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:06.300
It sublimates like dry ice
turning into a vapor,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.138
but we're doing it with water.

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.100
It does that
at low temperatures,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.570
and very low pressures,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.000
and so it just sort of sucks
all the water out of something

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940
without it ever getting wet.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.874
So we've got a lot of Orbeez,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.100
like we have so many Orbeez,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.792
and we want to see what happens
if we take all of the moisture

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:25.916
out of an Orbeez.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280
Just the entire
orbular of Orbeez.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.060
Yes.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.560
Yes.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.160
A few of the big ones
didn't really survive.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.500
It's like a big piece of Jell-O.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.448
But we're still going to try
and throw those in there too,

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:36.380
just see what happens.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.180
We're going to throw
them in here.

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:38.500
We're going to add
some cameras, some lights,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.768
and we're going to see
what happens to Orbeez

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.752
as you suck all
the moisture out of them.

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:44.952
My hope is that they
actually freeze together

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.840
during the freezing process,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.400
and then maybe break
apart afterwards,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.060
but I really want like a block
of freeze-dried orbeez.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.300
So we've got a tray,
we've got some containers.

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:57.800
I think we can fill
these containers with Orbeez,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.399
and then, we can also
just fill the tray

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.199
around the container
with even more Orbeez.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.540
Let's fill things up.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.220
[Music]

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.100
So again, we had a few of these

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.864
that like got
a little bit melted,

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:17.263
and you can kind of see
the residue of a plastic bucket.

00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:20.720
When we poured molten aluminum
into a bucket of Orbeez,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.040
we lost some of it
to the the plastic,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.700
and so we,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.960
I'm going to try
and filter these out,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.900
just because I don't know
what that's going to do,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.200
and I want this
to just be pure Orbeez.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:44.260
[Music]

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.940
A ridiculous amount of Orbeez.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.600
Let's add more.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.440
Yeah.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:03:00.860
[Music]

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.650
That's a lot of Orbeez.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.980
That's a lot of Orbeez,
and two GoPros.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.940
Saying the name of our cameras
actually turn them off.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.100
They have voice activation
features, which is useful

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.000
until you forget,
and you say the name,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.900
and they both turn off on you.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.800
So the cameras,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.900
the name of which
we will not say,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.000
are in the freeze dryer.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.900
Here we go.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.400
Alright, so that's
the nine hours,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.140
and while that's going,
make some more?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.100
Yeah, why not?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.300
We're about to ruin some.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.660
[Music]

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.320
More?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.020
Better to have too
many than too few.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:04:42.740
[Music]

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.100
Our orbeez are finished.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.900
The freeze dryer
has completed its cycle.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.599
It took a long time.

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.000
We let this thing run
for about two days,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
which is longer
than a lot of things need.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.300
But Orbeez have a lot
of water in them.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.600
It's cool watching
the time lapse of these,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.300
just growing as well.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.800
And Callie found a special one.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.488
Okay guys, for some reason,

00:05:00.488 --> 00:05:04.300
we had a bunch of Orbeez that
were Prince Rupert's drop shape,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.060
but I, somebody may have
accidentally broken this one?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.806
So really just
a tadpole shape,

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:11.200
but it's pretty cool.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.700
Sometimes, they just grow tails.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.700
I wonder if it's more likely
when you make larger batch,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.880
not necessarily
because there's more,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.000
but growing with
this many together.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.833
We probably got like 10,000
in this jar, and so,

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.400
three out of ten thousand.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.300
Let's open up our freeze dryer,
and see what we've got.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.800
[Music]

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.400
Okay, that's awesome.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400
Those change.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.340
I have a plate
of Fruity Pebbles now.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.980
It's just like styrofoam.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.200
Yeah, it sounds
like little styrofoam pebbles.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.150
Okay, this is cool.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.700
This is one of the larger ones.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.400
The color has like seeped
to certain parts,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.500
but the rest of it is
just almost like clear foam.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.000
Some parts of them.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.280
The water did not fully
get vacuumed out,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.640
because somebody may have put
a lot of Orbeez in there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.360
Yeah.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.200
We definitely got
most of it out,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.300
but it looks like where it
was thicker blobs together.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.980
All right.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.416
So the stuff on the tray,
that we got really dry.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:14.799
The stuff in the bowls...

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.120
Oh, interesting.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.500
It's still-- that's like a--

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.180
Well, it's cold,
but it's not frozen.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.800
And the big piles of it got
very well insulated,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.600
so you can definitely see
that there's a difference.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.500
All of this stuff
that's on the tray,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.080
this was an orbee,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.600
and now, it's just
this little plastic thing,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.300
and I can just
smoosh it into dust.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.100
Orbeez dust.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.940
So fluffy and light.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.960
The new kind of Orbeez art.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.860
Just look at this one.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.000
So a lot of these,
the colors like seeping out,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.764
but that was perfectly Cobalt.

00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:48.550
That's cool.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:57.640
[Music]

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.540
Okay, new plan.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.220
Hmm.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.080
Huh?

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.480
No.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.600
I'ts pretty solid.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.900
Did anything break off of that?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.830
Pieces fell off.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.950
I don't think like broke
that all though.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.500
Here you go.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.900
You try.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.260
Pickle jar worth
of solid block of ice.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.060
You weakened that.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.840
I smacked it
against the counter.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.900
That's ice, right in the middle.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.000
That's just solid ice.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.760
&gt;&gt; But the outside is crunchy.
&gt;&gt; But like squished together Orbeez ice,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.100
and like, I think ice
is actually filled in all

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.250
of the gaps between
where the Orbeez were.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.440
It's gelatin ice.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.537
Well, we've also got a jar
of warm water here.

00:07:31.537 --> 00:07:33.200
So this is pretty nice and warm,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.760
and warm water usually
activates Orbeez faster.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.361
So I want to see what happens

00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:39.425
if we start putting
these dehydrated bits

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.248
into the water.

00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:41.400
So let's start with--

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.528
This is one still mostly frozen,

00:07:43.528 --> 00:07:45.990
but not completely
freeze dried orbee.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:58.700
[Music]

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.480
Wow.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.900
That was only
a couple of minutes.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.080
[inaudible] gelatinous.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.100
I don't think it's
all the way through.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.220
No, but it's--

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.880
It's still almost an orbee now.

00:08:06.893 --> 00:08:08.330
The interesting thing is is

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.140
how many air bubbles
are in it now?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.116
It's about the size

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:14.215
of a normal orbee, even if it
is a little misshapen though,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.300
but it's just chock-full
of air bubbles.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.820
There's some more like that one.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.920
I think we should put in one
of these whole chunks.

00:08:20.928 --> 00:08:21.747
I want this one.

00:08:21.747 --> 00:08:23.100
It's just a cool shape.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.640
Goodbye friend.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.180
I mean, it's
probably gonna float.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:33.930
[Music]

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.871
Pieces are just
falling off of it.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.840
But the color is not
really staying anymore.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.060
That's the biggest piece we got.

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:41.044
Yes, that was one

00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:43.280
of the larger pieces
of a larger orbee,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.700
about size of golf ball.

00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:46.438
Now it's foam.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.620
Let's see what that does.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.100
I don't think this
is going to hold together.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.400
So I'm just gonna control it.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.260
Yep, and now it's...

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.540
Huh, interesting.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.280
It's back to Orbeez texture.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.540
But now, it's just
like a gelatinous--

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.000
It's like if you took a normal
orbee and crushed it up.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.220
Yeah, pretty much.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.720
Let's do a comparison even.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.213
Pretty similar.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.900
Yours is more crushed up, but--

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.380
But the texture is
very very similar.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.500
So that's a regular orbee,

00:09:13.506 --> 00:09:16.047
this was a freeze dried
and reconstituted orbee.

00:09:16.047 --> 00:09:17.680
How does our brick doing?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.820
Oh, gross.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.500
But that underneath is cool.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.680
Yeah, all the thawed portions
just scrape right off,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.400
and leave the
frozen parts together.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.300
Someone should make popsicles
that look like that.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.000
Oh my gosh.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.460
Shut up and take my money.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.860
Shut Up And Take My Money.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.340
So these are ones
that have dried out completely,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.080
and I'm going to throw those
into some warm water.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.260
See what happens to you.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.000
[Music]

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.320
Are they dissolving?

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.930
Some of them had
so little cohesion.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.576
Yeah, there's little,
little bits floating down

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.760
to the bottom.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.380
[Music]

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.280
As the really open
ones absorb water,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.360
you can see how they're sort
of turning into orbee shape.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.640
But because there
are missing so much material,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.880
they kind of shredded
as they freeze dried,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.400
that we're now getting
like these frozen--

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.240
Instead of a sphere,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.980
it's just like
a tissue-y substance.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.820
All righrt, this is basically
just like pre-shredded.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.000
It's hardly holding
itself together at all.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:34.300
[Music]

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.280
This is awesome.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.180
This was a solid chunk earlier.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.240
I was like squishing
and flattening out pieces.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.080
And now you can see

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.990
that some of them have actually
started to like bubble up,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.520
and go back
to their normal shape,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.400
but stayed in a popsicle form.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:11:27.940
[Music]

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.500
Kinda have an interesting texture.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.400
With normal Orbeez,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.440
like you can feel the individual
shape of each marble.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.500
But because of the way
these have broken up,

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.860
it's just more of like a slop.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.700
But there's one other thing
I want to try is the Orbeez

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.500
now appear to all
be full of bubbles,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.500
and most of the time,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.100
if you throw Orbeez
into a vacuum chamber,

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.231
they don't really do anything.

00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:45.400
I've tried it, nothing happens.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.148
But because these are
now full of bubbles,

00:11:47.148 --> 00:11:48.860
I want to try it with them.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.360
So I'm just going to pour
off the extra water,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.600
and then slap the vacuum
on to our jar here.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:01.160
[Music]

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:01.840
Oh, yeah.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.900
Those uh...

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.240
Those expands.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.280
Turn that off.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.680
Put the pressure back in.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.240
See it decompress.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.780
I think I actually sucked a lot
of water out of those as well.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.320
I'm gonna see
if I can pour more water off.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.180
I don't know.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.820
Much more.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:42.420
[Music]

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.380
