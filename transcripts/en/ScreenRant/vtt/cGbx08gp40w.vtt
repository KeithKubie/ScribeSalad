00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.099
We’re told from a very young age that lying
is a bad thing.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.469
But in Hollywood, dishonesty has a habit of
getting rewarded.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.250
Some of the world’s most popular actors
might not be where they are today if they

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.710
told the truth early on.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.650
These are 9 Famous Actors Who Lied To Land
Roles, Part 2.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.070
Sandra Bullock
Sandra Bullock is one of the most prolific

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.740
actresses in American history.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.480
And since getting the career boost she needed
back in 1992, she’s appeared in around fifty

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.550
movies since.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.410
The actress has admitted to lying about her
age to the team behind Love Potion No. 9.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.989
But she didn’t go the traditional route
of making herself younger.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.120
Sensing that the casting directors were looking
for someone more mature, Bullock actually

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.010
added three years to her age.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
Magically transforming herself from a 26 year-old
into a 29 year-old.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.379
Wow, she really IS a good actress.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.059
Whoopi Goldberg
Not unlike our friend Sandra Bullock, Whoopi

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.270
Goldberg also had one heck of a time getting
cast because she was too young.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.969
But where Bullock exaggerated by only three
years, Whoopi tacked on six.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.969
Why not?

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.239
Go big or go home, right?

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.539
We can understand why she was so determined
to be successful in showbiz; because it sure

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.210
beats working in a funeral parlor.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.100
IMDB cites Goldberg as having over 150 acting
credits to her name.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280
If we’ve learned anything from this, it’s
that lying works.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.910
And the comedienne has been working steadily
ever since.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.979
Jessica Chastain
Jessica Chastain came out of nowhere.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.930
And suddenly she’s in every movie.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.159
But we’re not complaining.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.030
The talented actress caught the attention
of audiences in the Terrence Malick vehicle

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.229
Tree of Life.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.280
Also in 2011, Chastain appeared opposite Emma
Stone and Viola Davis in The Help.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.560
And at one point she was even slated to appear
in Iron Man 3.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.060
Because the actress’ success seemed to materialize
overnight, there was very little information

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.450
about her.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.000
And because Hollywood has a grotesque fascination
with the age of actresses, some people were

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.710
upset that they couldn't immediately figure
out how old she was.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.790
George Lazenby
Quick!

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.220
Who’s your favorite James Bond?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
Did you say George Lazenby?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.790
Probably not!

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.170
It seems he wasn’t really anyone’s favorite
on-set either.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.760
1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service
was the debut and the finale of Lazenby’s

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760
turn as 007.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.630
You may be wondering how he even got the job
in the first place.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.060
By weaving a web of lies in his audition.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.640
Marketing oneself if obviously a huge part
of any job interview, but the actor took it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640
to the extreme.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640
And made himself sound a lot more desirable
than he actually turned out to be.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.910
The director eventually found out Lazenby
had exaggerated his success, and the actor

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.459
was not asked to reprise the role.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.699
Carla Gugino
Audiences will probably recognize Carla Gugino

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.180
as the voice of the ship in Batman v Superman.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.180
Just kidding!

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.180
Even though she actually was the voice of
a ship, the actress has played substantial

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.639
parts in films like Watchmen and Sucker Punch.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.690
But if Gugino hadn’t lied about her age
back when she was sixteen, we might not be

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.190
talking about her right now.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.880
When auditioning for 1989’s Troop Beverly
Hills, the actress fudged her birthday and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.220
said she was a couple of years younger.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.050
And, as directors have a habit of doing, the
director found out after she’d already been

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.050
hired.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.200
He admitted that if he’d known she was lying
at the time, she wouldn’t have gotten the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.440
job.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.690
Ouch.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.620
Morgan Freeman
Ladies and gentlemen we present to you the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.190
man, the myth, the legend: Mr. Morgan Freeman.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.190
That’s right.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.600
The golden voice of Hollywood might have told
a teeny little fib when negotiating his role

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.080
in 2013’s Oblivion.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.510
Allegedly, Freeman was only supposed to be
attached to the movie in a narrative capacity.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.820
But apparently he wanted more than that, and
it’s rumored that the actor lied about having

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.170
throat trouble in an effort to get more screen
time.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.780
Lie or no lie, if Morgan Freeman says he wants
a bigger part in your movie because he thinks

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.600
it’s awesome, you give him one.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.970
Case closed.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.090
Quvenzhané Wallis
Parents only want what’s best for their

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.090
kids.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.510
And some will bend the rules farther than
others to make sure that happens.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.900
So when Quvenzhané Wallis and her parents
saw the casting call for Beasts of the Southern

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.980
Wild, they all agreed to keep the same secret.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.130
Being only five years old at the time, everyone
pretended she was six.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.500
Wallis won the casting agents over, and guaranteed
herself a spot in the movie.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.900
In the four years since, the actress has begun
cultivating an impressive resume.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.470
Wallis was in the critically-acclaimed 12
Years a Slave, and played the titular character

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.840
in the 2014 film adaptation of Annie.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.350
Chris Hemsworth
Audiences have become so accustomed to seeing

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.840
Chris Hemsworth dressed as Thor that it’s
easy to imagine he’s actually that imposing

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.870
for real.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.410
Apparently this is something the actor is
all too aware of, since he’s admitted to

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.690
lying about his height.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.030
In an effort to be more desirable to casting
agents, Hemsworth would shave approximately

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.440
two inches off his height.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.520
For whatever reason, those two inches seemed
to be the keys to the actor’s success.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.230
He’s been going hard since 2009.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.900
And thanks to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic
Universe, there’s no telling when his reign

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.690
as Thor might end.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.180
Eddie Redmayne
Eddie Redmayne has been getting a lot of press

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.620
over the past few years.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.080
The actor blew everyone away with his portrayal
of Stephen Hawking in 2014’s The Theory

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080
of Everything.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.410
And Harry Potter fans are looking forward
to his debut as Newt Scamander in the upcoming

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.200
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.870
But back in 2005, he was the horse-riding
Earl of Southampton in the TV miniseries Elizabeth

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.870
I.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.410
The only issue is that he couldn't actually
ride horses.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.680
Redmayne misinformed the bigwigs during the
audition process, and when it came time to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.540
do it, that’s when the actor chose to come
clean.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.980
What do you think of our list?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.370
