single person's like oh you're an
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069
single person's like oh you're an
engineer oh your computer science you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
engineer oh your computer science you
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590
engineer oh your computer science you
know person okay actually I'm saying

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

this technical idea in this technical

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
this technical idea in this technical
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.420
this technical idea in this technical
background so now I feel like I've

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
background so now I feel like I've
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.060
background so now I feel like I've
participated even a super small part of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
participated even a super small part of
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370

sad but one of the things was trying to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
sad but one of the things was trying to
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679
sad but one of the things was trying to
get out into the class was that notion

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689

lot of great traditions here but i think
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969
lot of great traditions here but i think
that the work we've done in CS is just

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
that the work we've done in CS is just
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740
that the work we've done in CS is just
you know it's this enormous river and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
you know it's this enormous river and
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.819
you know it's this enormous river and
maybe you're just dipping your foot into

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
maybe you're just dipping your foot into
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.870
maybe you're just dipping your foot into
it but you're a part of it now and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
it but you're a part of it now and
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700
it but you're a part of it now and
that's pretty exciting I mean obviously

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
that's pretty exciting I mean obviously
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010
that's pretty exciting I mean obviously
the course at least the way that we were

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
the course at least the way that we were
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.300
the course at least the way that we were
doing it in the summer and I think them

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.620
doing it in the summer and I think them
in the way it's being introduced now in

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
in the way it's being introduced now in
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780
in the way it's being introduced now in
the in the in the phone spring semesters

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
the in the in the phone spring semesters
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090
the in the in the phone spring semesters
is able to take advantage of a lot of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
is able to take advantage of a lot of
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.109
is able to take advantage of a lot of
the work coming out of the sign

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
the work coming out of the sign
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.660
the work coming out of the sign
initiative which includes vol I courses

initiative which includes vol I courses
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580
initiative which includes vol I courses
and so I'm curious how did that compare

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
and so I'm curious how did that compare
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.810
and so I'm curious how did that compare

to some of the other classes you've
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.660
to some of the other classes you've
taken of courses that didn't have the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
taken of courses that didn't have the
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.130
taken of courses that didn't have the
ability to use some of the EdTech pieces

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
ability to use some of the EdTech pieces
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.100
ability to use some of the EdTech pieces
oh I would say it's kind of tough like

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

could learn it by myself or with the
 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.010
could learn it by myself or with the
guide of the ol I modules okay and did

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020
guide of the ol I modules okay and did
 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.290
guide of the ol I modules okay and did
you feel like the online materials in

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300
you feel like the online materials in
 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.060
you feel like the online materials in
the supporting tech blended fairly well

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
the supporting tech blended fairly well
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.040
the supporting tech blended fairly well
with the with the diction alas time did

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
with the with the diction alas time did
 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.360
with the with the diction alas time did
yeah did we get those synced up fairly

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
yeah did we get those synced up fairly
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.030
yeah did we get those synced up fairly
well yeah I think so i think um the i

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
well yeah I think so i think um the i
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.560
well yeah I think so i think um the i
always loved at the end the question

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570
always loved at the end the question
 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.970
always loved at the end the question
that was like what do you want your

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980
that was like what do you want your
 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.740
that was like what do you want your
instructor to spend more time one

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
instructor to spend more time one
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.630
instructor to spend more time one
because at least the way you didn't you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640
because at least the way you didn't you
 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.340
because at least the way you didn't you
really talked about that and you really

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350
really talked about that and you really
 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.140
really talked about that and you really
use that and that was it kind of made

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150
use that and that was it kind of made
 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.520
use that and that was it kind of made
you feel like you're learning experience

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
you feel like you're learning experience
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.950
you feel like you're learning experience
was like being valued and that like you

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960
was like being valued and that like you
 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.550
was like being valued and that like you
weren't necessarily expected to 100%

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560
weren't necessarily expected to 100%
 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.670
weren't necessarily expected to 100%
understand everything that had happened

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680
understand everything that had happened
 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.440
understand everything that had happened
during the oh I module or during class

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450
during the oh I module or during class
 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.560
during the oh I module or during class
yeah and I think if that's used properly

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570
yeah and I think if that's used properly
 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.300
yeah and I think if that's used properly
it can be pretty nice because I've just

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310
it can be pretty nice because I've just
 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.730
it can be pretty nice because I've just
been thinking about this semester people

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740
been thinking about this semester people
 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.740
been thinking about this semester people
do not like asking questions in lecture

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750
do not like asking questions in lecture
 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.440
do not like asking questions in lecture
at CMU because everybody's afraid that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450
at CMU because everybody's afraid that
 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.240
at CMU because everybody's afraid that
you're there asking the dumb question

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250
you're there asking the dumb question
 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.800
you're there asking the dumb question
when in reality there has to be at least

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
when in reality there has to be at least
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.240
when in reality there has to be at least
one other person in the lecture hall

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250
one other person in the lecture hall
 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.750
one other person in the lecture hall
that feels the same way so even though

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760
that feels the same way so even though
 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.430
that feels the same way so even though
it would be nice to have that problem be

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
it would be nice to have that problem be
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.140
it would be nice to have that problem be
fixed it's nice because this gives an

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150
fixed it's nice because this gives an
 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.210
fixed it's nice because this gives an
opportunity where you don't just like

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220
opportunity where you don't just like
 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.630
opportunity where you don't just like
stay silent and fear of being judged

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640
stay silent and fear of being judged
 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.190
stay silent and fear of being judged
necessarily you can just type in like

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200
necessarily you can just type in like
 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.470
necessarily you can just type in like
hey like this is me to you as my

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480
hey like this is me to you as my
 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.090
hey like this is me to you as my
professor could you please spend some

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100
professor could you please spend some
 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.620
professor could you please spend some
more time on this yeah we talked a lot

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630
more time on this yeah we talked a lot
 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.150
more time on this yeah we talked a lot
about the availability of the technology

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160
about the availability of the technology
 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.130
about the availability of the technology
to eliminate the back row or to bring

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140
to eliminate the back row or to bring
 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.270
to eliminate the back row or to bring
the back row students forward

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280
the back row students forward
 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.890
the back row students forward
metaphorically and I think that that's a

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900
metaphorically and I think that that's a
 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.090
metaphorically and I think that that's a
piece of it right i mean it's but it's

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
piece of it right i mean it's but it's
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.220
piece of it right i mean it's but it's
also i think normalizing that piece of

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230
also i think normalizing that piece of
 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.479
also i think normalizing that piece of
learning that requires you to

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
learning that requires you to
 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.560
learning that requires you to
acknowledge hey i don't know exactly

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570
acknowledge hey i don't know exactly
 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.909
acknowledge hey i don't know exactly
what's happening here i need to ask

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919
what's happening here i need to ask
 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.409
what's happening here i need to ask
questions and so it gives you a vehicle

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419
questions and so it gives you a vehicle
 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.040
questions and so it gives you a vehicle
for doing that

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
for doing that
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.990
for doing that
and it ties it a little more directly to

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000
and it ties it a little more directly to
 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.089
and it ties it a little more directly to
what you've just learned right so

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099
what you've just learned right so
 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.469
what you've just learned right so
there's that close relationship to I've

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479
there's that close relationship to I've
 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.360
there's that close relationship to I've
just had this practice things unclear I

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370
just had this practice things unclear I
 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.830
just had this practice things unclear I
can get that information out and then

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840
can get that information out and then
 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.020
can get that information out and then
hopefully benefit from faculty yeah I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030
hopefully benefit from faculty yeah I
 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.779
hopefully benefit from faculty yeah I
think particularly the activity portion

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789
think particularly the activity portion
 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.730
think particularly the activity portion
when you're not graded on but there's

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740
when you're not graded on but there's
 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.779
when you're not graded on but there's
the checkpoint at the end which is

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789
the checkpoint at the end which is
 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.040
the checkpoint at the end which is
obviously graded and important feedback

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050
obviously graded and important feedback
 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.050
obviously graded and important feedback
for the instructor but the the portion

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060
for the instructor but the the portion
 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.550
for the instructor but the the portion
that you know likes it goes you know

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560
that you know likes it goes you know
 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.899
that you know likes it goes you know
appears green if you've gotten a write

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909
appears green if you've gotten a write
 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.399
appears green if you've gotten a write
or read if you've gotten it wrong but

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409
or read if you've gotten it wrong but
 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.990
or read if you've gotten it wrong but
that you know you can kind of try it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000
that you know you can kind of try it
 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.420
that you know you can kind of try it
again makes it a lot less intimidating

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430
again makes it a lot less intimidating
 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.399
again makes it a lot less intimidating
because if it's immediately graded then

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409
because if it's immediately graded then
 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.749
because if it's immediately graded then
there's you're still kind of stressed

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759
there's you're still kind of stressed
 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.070
there's you're still kind of stressed
out by the whole experience because you

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080
out by the whole experience because you
 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.589
out by the whole experience because you
know like this is a one-shot moment but

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599
know like this is a one-shot moment but
 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.779
know like this is a one-shot moment but
the thief the feedback I think in

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789
the thief the feedback I think in
 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.700
the thief the feedback I think in
particular is really helpful because

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710
particular is really helpful because
 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.589
particular is really helpful because
most other feedback you get in a

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599
most other feedback you get in a
 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.390
most other feedback you get in a
classroom is graded feedback just

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400
classroom is graded feedback just
 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.219
classroom is graded feedback just
because that's the nature of school but

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229
because that's the nature of school but
 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.300
because that's the nature of school but
it kind of offers a unique opportunity

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
it kind of offers a unique opportunity
 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.369
it kind of offers a unique opportunity
for non-graded feedback for the

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379
for non-graded feedback for the
 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.990
for non-graded feedback for the
activities was there anything any

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000
activities was there anything any
 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.520
activities was there anything any
specific pieces of it that really stood

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530
specific pieces of it that really stood
 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.140
specific pieces of it that really stood
out as you know what were some of the

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150
out as you know what were some of the
 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.809
out as you know what were some of the
best ones tell me the worst ones to what

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819
best ones tell me the worst ones to what
 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.490
best ones tell me the worst ones to what
really worked for you I think for me the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500
really worked for you I think for me the
 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.080
really worked for you I think for me the
ones where you could actually code in

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090
ones where you could actually code in
 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.899
ones where you could actually code in
Python in the in the module itself and

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909
Python in the in the module itself and
 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.019
Python in the in the module itself and
it would give you feedback I really

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029
it would give you feedback I really
 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.610
it would give you feedback I really
appreciate it because the whole idea of

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
appreciate it because the whole idea of
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.670
appreciate it because the whole idea of
coding even literally just sending

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680
coding even literally just sending
 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.890
coding even literally just sending
enough on my computer was intimidating

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900
enough on my computer was intimidating
 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.450
enough on my computer was intimidating
to me so the fact that you could do it

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460
to me so the fact that you could do it
 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.879
to me so the fact that you could do it
just like in the web browser and in the

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889
just like in the web browser and in the
 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.589
just like in the web browser and in the
module so the only thing you needed to

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599
module so the only thing you needed to
 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.439
module so the only thing you needed to
focus on with actually whether your code

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449
focus on with actually whether your code
 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.420
focus on with actually whether your code
was working or not was really helpful to

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430
was working or not was really helpful to
 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.469
was working or not was really helpful to
me I think one of the other things

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479
me I think one of the other things
 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.930
me I think one of the other things
that's important about about the way

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940
that's important about about the way
 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.249
that's important about about the way
that the larger Simon initiative worse

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259
that the larger Simon initiative worse
 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.170
that the larger Simon initiative worse
is this ability to take some of the data

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180
is this ability to take some of the data
 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.730
is this ability to take some of the data
that's coming from your experiences with

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740
that's coming from your experiences with

these materials and feed it back into
 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.999
these materials and feed it back into
the research space and is sort of

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009
the research space and is sort of
 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.680
the research space and is sort of
curious as to how that felt to you I

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690
curious as to how that felt to you I
 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.600

for a new initiative in general just
 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.379
for a new initiative in general just
like I don't really think like you can

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389
like I don't really think like you can
 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.390
like I don't really think like you can
mention the consent form doesn't really

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.399
mention the consent form doesn't really
bother me to think that like the way

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409

answer things like how I do in the class
is being like used in research I mean

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:25.879
is being like used in research I mean
 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.209
is being like used in research I mean
like I said when I whenever I didn't

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219
like I said when I whenever I didn't
 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.740

pass 112 it kind of just had to be

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750
pass 112 it kind of just had to be
 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.390

is important and it's important for
 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.200
is important and it's important for
learning as well so no big deal

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210
learning as well so no big deal
 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.100

area like that's okay is going to help

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370
area like that's okay is going to help
 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.160
area like that's okay is going to help
students down the road notion that

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170
students down the road notion that
 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.190
students down the road notion that
what's driving this research is students

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200
what's driving this research is students
 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.870
what's driving this research is students
participating in the work which is being

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880
participating in the work which is being
 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.900
participating in the work which is being
done by a student really yeah it creates

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910
done by a student really yeah it creates
 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.670
done by a student really yeah it creates
pretty exciting cycle it says that the

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680
pretty exciting cycle it says that the
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.320
pretty exciting cycle it says that the
knowledge that's being that that's being

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330
knowledge that's being that that's being
 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.340
knowledge that's being that that's being
created here is actually being

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350
created here is actually being
 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.810
created here is actually being
co-created and the students are an

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820
co-created and the students are an
 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.250
co-created and the students are an
essential part of this right it changes

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.260
essential part of this right it changes
 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.830
essential part of this right it changes
what a university community looks like

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840
what a university community looks like
 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.560
what a university community looks like
so I think that's pretty neat
