00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.720
Seriously North Korea, another underground
nuclear test?

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.600
You know we can see you, right?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.799
[DNEWS OPEN]
[MAIN]

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.730
Hey hermit kings and queens, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.590
So the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,
AKA North Korea, has reportedly tested their

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.539
5th nuclear device.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.000
They want us to know they did it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.830
We know they want us to know they did it.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.070
And they know that we know that they want
us to know what we know.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.689
But how can we know it was a nuclear bomb?

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.250
We’re not just going to take Kim Jong-un’s
word for it.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.730
There’s actually an organization called
the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.510
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.320
Or the CTBTO…

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.710
Though technically I guess it should be the
PCCNTBTO.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.750
Since 1996, the CTBTO has had it’s ear to
the ground around the world, listening for

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.770
any rumblings.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.520
That’s not just a metaphor, they literally
have 42 primary and 107 secondary stations

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.680
around the world monitoring seismic activity.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.910
Usually they just pick up earthquakes, but
if there’s a nuclear test underground, like

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.910
all the North Korean ones have been, they’ll
pick up the seismic waves through the earth’s

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.080
crust and mantle.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.510
Based on the direction, speed and type of
waves each station picks up, the location

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.010
of the test site can be deduced.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.570
But what if the tests are conducted underwater?

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.650
That scenario has been planned for too, and
the CTBTO has an array of 10 hydroacoustic

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.650
monitoring stations globally.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.710
Why only 10?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.280
Because sound travels amazingly well under
water, particularly 1000 meters down, at a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.600
depth known as the Sound Fixing and Ranging
channel, or SOFAR.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.300
With just a handful of stations, they can
still hear nuclear tests in the earth’s

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.230
oceans, even when they’re SOFAR away…

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.230
Get it?

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.440
And if the tests are conducted in the atmosphere,
the CTBTO can catch that too.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.390
Again the method is to use sound, this time
at frequencies so low we can’t even hear

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.950
them, or infrasound.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.670
These longer wavelengths travel farther but
they still don’t move as efficiently as

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.910
sound in water, so there are 49 infrasound
stations in use right now to listen to the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.910
breeze.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.890
As a bonus, underground tests generate infrasound
too, so the data can be combined with the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.150
seismographs for more accurate information.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.310
You’ll notice all these methods of detection
have something in common: they can be tripped

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.770
by non-nuclear means.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.810
Volcanoes, earthquakes, and conventional explosions
can cause seismic activity and sound waves.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.200
There’s only one
way to know for sure the bomb was an A Bomb:

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.200
radioactive fallout. When a nuclear bomb explodes,
it creates radioactive xenon isotopes. And,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.800
because xenon is a gas, it can seep through
layers of rock until it reaches the open air.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.600
This means that unless tests are conducted
deep underwater or underground, the CTBTO

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.400
can forensically prove when someone tests
a nuclear bomb.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.200
So then what? Well that’s where the bulldog
loses its teeth, I’m afraid. The Comprehensive

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.400
Test Ban Treaty has been signed and ratified
by 164 countries but still needs 8 more before

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.820
it can enter into force. Hence why the organization
is still technically called the “Preparatory

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.900
Commission” for the CTBTO. So currently
when a country sets off a bomb, all the rest

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.690
of the world can really do is wag a finger
at it and impose more sanctions for the test

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.430
that was unsanctioned. North Korea, perhaps
unsurprisingly, has not signed or ratified

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.980
the treaty, but to be fair the USA has signed
it but hasn’t ratified it either. Still,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.640
until every country is on the same page about
nuclear weapons, at least the CTBTO has the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.280
tools to warn the rest of the world that someone’s
not being chill.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280
 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.290
Guys, if you love DNews in English -- gracias! Now, we've got a new sister

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.100
show, "DNews en Español" -- It's DNews, but
in Spanish! Check it out here.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.010
In early 2015 North Korea set off what they

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.690
claimed was a hydrogen bomb, but was it? How
is an H bomb even different from an A bomb?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.000
Julian covers all that here.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.800
What’s your stance on nuclear weapons? Inexcusable
superweapon or necessary evil?
