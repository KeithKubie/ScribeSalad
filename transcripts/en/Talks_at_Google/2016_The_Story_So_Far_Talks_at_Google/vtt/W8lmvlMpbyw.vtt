00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:05.090
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So Mr.
Kamal Haasan absolutely needs

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.220
no introduction.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.410
But I'm going to do it anyway
because I'm a huge fan.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.130
He's an actor.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.330
He's a screenwriter.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.670
He's a lyricist, director,
producer, choreographer,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.240
dancer, singer across South
Indian and Bollywood movie

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.220
industries.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.780
And the other thing
that's amazing

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.280
is he's won several film awards,
including 19 Filmfare awards,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.684
four National Film awards,
and with seven submissions,

00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:34.100
he's starred in
the highest number

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.550
of films submitted by India in
Academy Award foreign language

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.496
film.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:44.120
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.420
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: But I
think the most interesting,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.330
and to us as Googlers, the
most powerful thing that Kamal

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.170
Haasan embodies, is this love
of technology and innovation.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.660
He's a 10x thinker,
as we like to say.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.000
And he's a pioneer in bringing
technology to Indian cinema.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.730
Be it the first Indian
movie in digital format

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.735
with "Mumbai Express," or
bringing [? Audi ?] 3D sound

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.654
in "Vishwaroopam", he's
truly been a pioneer.

00:01:09.654 --> 00:01:11.570
And one of the things I
want to call out today

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.270
is that he's here not to
promote any specific event

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.290
or not to promote any specific
movie, but really as a thought

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.400
leader in the industry.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.640
So I look forward
to hearing him.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.352
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.352 --> 00:01:30.060
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
So speaking of 10x,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.480
I'll just start off with a
little 10x experience myself.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.630
I was 10 years when I
first saw this movie,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.450
and then I probably saw
it easily 10 more times.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.410
And then I watched songs
from this movie, easily

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.470
100 more times.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.350
I'm Telugu.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.338
And I'm talking about the
movie "Sagara Sangamam."

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:50.540
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.290
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Where
the song was [NON-ENGLISH].

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.360
And this morning
and before this, I

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.480
played it 10 more times.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.600
I just wanted to
let folks know that.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840
With that, I want to actually
start off, given this audience,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.330
we are all about building
products that millions of users

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.100
love.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.310
Which, if you look at it,
that's what you've done.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.820
You've done it over many years,
over many movies, many times.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.110
So I want to pick your brain
on the creative process.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.192
When you think of a movie like
[? "Nayakan," ?] or "Gunaa"

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:25.660
or "Hey Ram," where do
you get that initial spark

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.590
of inspiration?

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.170
KAMAL HAASAN: I get
terribly scared.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.432
Hi, everyone.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.580
Jump into fork and knife.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.750
When appetite is good, then
you jump straight to the act.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.540
I get terribly concerned
when people ask me,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.954
how do you do market research?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.550
I don't.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.280
That's the thing.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.750
There's something
much deeper and bigger

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.220
than the-- it's your mind.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.770
What you love most.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.030
Because if you truly
believe that you're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.640
part of a crowd, then your
assumption, your need,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.870
your passion will be
emulated by the crowd.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.720
Because you are one of them.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.200
You've learned your
accent, your weaknesses,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.030
your anger your food taste.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.740
It's all from one place.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.236
So it's confusing
for me to go compute.

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:39.235
If I had done that, I
would have been in school.

00:03:39.235 --> 00:03:42.410
I'm a dropout.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.370
I couldn't go that route.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.040
But instead of going
on an outward travel,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.022
I always travel inward.

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:52.855
It's a bigger space.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.670
Everybody's space is bigger than
what they can possibly traverse

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.700
with available transport.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.410
When you travel
inside, it's fantastic

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.710
distances you can cover.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.420
And you don't even
have to be there,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.100
but you'd have been there
before Neil Armstrong.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.489
That's what Jules Verne did.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.572
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Mhm.

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:20.089
In his mind.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.380
KAMAL HAASAN: He
specifically described

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.660
what almost 80% right the way
the rocket launch took place

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.360
and how the capsule
fell back into the sea.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.880
So he has done the travel
much, much before America even

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.730
thought of it-- the
government, I mean.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.510
So that's what I meant, that
I-- when you make a product,

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.110
you go with that feeling.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.750
People call it God.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.840
Some say mind.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.780
Some say [NON-ENGLISH].

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.480
There's this constant trouble
when they say [NON-ENGLISH].

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.930
In our language.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.030
They touch here.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.105
That's not where it is.

00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:06.040
It's here.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.790
KAMAL HAASAN: But there's
this confusion-- location,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.180
address confusion.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.800
Which, I live
between the two ears.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.080
It seems like a narrow
place to live in,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.010
but it's a lot of
Lebensraum, as Hitler would

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.020
like to call it-- living space.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.310
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yeah.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.710
And I guess, related to that--
so when you have this God,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.390
and as you develop
the idea, can you

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.210
share any anecdotes
of where you landed

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.680
was completely different
from where you started?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.890
KAMAL HAASAN: Oh, that happens
every film, you can say.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:51.950
I wanted to make a thriller when
I started off with "Hey Ram."

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.040
Wrote basically a
thriller, I wanted to make.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.130
It's like "Day of the Jackal."

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.140
I started there.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.130
But then, suddenly, when
I did research, I thought,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.720
it's very trivial
to go that route.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.100
I thought I would make a film
that at least I won't forget.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.490
But there are people
who will join me

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.990
in saying they can't
forget the film.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.790
It's not one of those
blockbuster, box office

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.720
record-breaking film.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.780
But it got me a special respect.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.263
But then, business is
not all about respect.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.910
So probably I started
off right and went

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.780
towards something which
will live longer than I do.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.700
The bottom line might die before
I die because I might break it

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.700
with another hit.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.750
But these are things that
might survive even me,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.610
so I'm not unhappy about it.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.600
And if you take-- let me
talk about "Pushpack."

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.730
When Singeetam
came with the idea,

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.520
he had a film
called [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.070
It was fully there in his mind.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.920
It was called
[INAUDIBLE] Duality.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.220
Non-duality.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.750
Not duality, but the
non-duality of it.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.870
And it was a serious film
about rich and the poor.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.920
And I said, I'm not
part of this film

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.310
if it's going to be this way.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.110
Because it will die, and that
with [NON-ENGLISH] playing

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.096
in the back.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:46.150
It would become an art film.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.850
The shots will be lengthy.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.270
You can hear people changing
positions in the seat.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.240
I don't want to be a part of
that film, because that's how--

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.410
and he has tremendous
sense of humor.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.170
And he laughed.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.010
And it's actually
asking somebody

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.480
to do a total 360
change on what he

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.280
thinks is his favorite subject.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.160
But he did it.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.070
And that was a great
writing experience for me.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:21.850
People always ask, what do
you write in a silent room?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.080
That's where you
have to write a lot.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.611
And rehearse a lot.

00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.030
Because every detail
will have to be

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.140
perceived by the audience,
understood by the audience.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.809
It's a cognizance
that you'll have

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:39.640
to forecast, foresee, and also
not come right on the nose

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.720
and make it--

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.200
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Obvious.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200
KAMAL HAASAN: --obvious.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.860
So that was a great experience.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:51.850
The way "Appu Raja" was
born was I take all my ideas

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.600
to my mentor first.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.260
Mr. K.B., I have an idea.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.760
OK.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.630
It's like Martin Luther King,
who says, I have a dream.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.005
I keep going, I have an idea.

00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:06.640
And he would sometimes encourage
it, sometimes craft it.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.100
Sometimes it's made
my career better.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.490
But he always chiseled it to
a better [INAUDIBLE] shape.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.260
So when I took this
idea of playing

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.510
a short man for
the film, he just

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.190
looked at me aside
and said, relax.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.420
What are you eating nowadays?

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.780
Don't be hyper like that.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.890
It's not practical.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.330
Why would you want the
filmmaker to suffer?

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.310
You are good enough at suffering
for a director like me.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.520
Why would you want
him to go into this?

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.900
I can't even think of the
mind-boggling complications

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.380
that will come out of it.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.050
I said, no, it can be done.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.550
No.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.856
I'll write a small
scene for you.

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.730
You can play a short
man and be done with it.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.230
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
In that scene.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.140
KAMAL HAASAN: And I did it.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.090
And I was even more convinced.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.060
I went to him again
and said, I begged him,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.640
but he was not sure for that.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.350
So it fell into
Raaj Kamal's lap.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.280
And that was before CG.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.880
None of the effects that
you see in "Appu Raja"

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.860
were done in post.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.540
It was already done in camera.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.296
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.840
And another thing
about the film was,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.620
I told him I know how
to make the dwarf work.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.710
So I knew two tricks.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.970
But you can't pull off a whole
film with just two tricks.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.400
But I was so exhausted
wanting to try it.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.070
I didn't tell the crew
that I didn't know anymore

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.650
except the two tricks.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.320
So it was unbelievable.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.295
It was the biggest con
game I pulled on my own.

00:10:58.295 --> 00:10:59.370
Whole crew.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.970
And it came to me, I wasn't
cheating anybody except myself,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:04.850
so.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.250
Well, it came to me-- the
first 15 days of a shoot,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.270
which is a lot of
money, were scrapped.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.250
Because I suddenly realized
I was thinking only

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:19.340
about how to play short and
had left screenplay story

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.710
to somebody else.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.800
So it was not working.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.440
So I reworked it with
another writer for a month.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.640
And Appu was supposed
to have a small role,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.940
because it's difficult. I
put it on the head, and said,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.030
Appu's the hero.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.550
Which means we'll break
our back everyday.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:47.483
And we will shoot the scene.

00:11:47.483 --> 00:11:51.990
And they'll take it to the lab.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.300
And we can't move
onto the next shot

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.610
'til they come
back from the lab.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:04.260
We'll be looking at the
car, and as they're driving,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.990
somebody will have their
thumb down like this, say, OK,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.860
break for lunch, and
we're doing it again.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.500
And we'll go back again.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.420
We got so upset
with it, I came up

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.170
with another idea of
just taking a clip of it

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:22.190
and doing the washing
and printing on the spot,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.050
and so that we can see
whether it works or not.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.440
So much so that, towards
the end of the film,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.203
we started shooting
inside the laboratory,

00:12:31.203 --> 00:12:32.036
from the laboratory.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.650
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Launch and iterate.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.320
KAMAL HAASAN: So I can
even laugh at it now,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.849
because none of it is
required now, then--

00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:45.890
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: CG.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.910
KAMAL HAASAN: --on a screen,
you can match everything, put

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.667
together, and go back to sleep.

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:54.250
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Speaking of kind

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.150
of taking risks and
trying to push the limit.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.780
So you've done nearly 200 films.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.190
In Tamil, Telugu, Hindi,
Kannada, Malayalam.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.970
You act, direct,
write screenplay.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.750
You play many parts.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.901
As my friend and many fans
call you, you're [NON-ENGLISH],

00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:13.400
right?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.480
You're versatile.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.140
How do these elements
play off of each other?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.170
How does your
directorial sensibility

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.814
affect your writing and acting?

00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:23.980
Can you share some insights?

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.990
KAMAL HAASAN: I think
this specialist situation

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.688
is a very modern situation.

00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:38.550
Even in times of lore,
people wanted-- a good,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.410
intelligent man was supposed
to be [NON-ENGLISH].

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.020
He must do eight
things at a time.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.450
And there were a
special group, people

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.150
who did 100 things at a time.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.020
And they were tested for it.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.210
Like, someone will ask him
a mathematical question.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.890
Someone will ask him to create
poetry in iambic pentameter.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.970
And somebody will be dropping
flower petals on his back.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.400
He'll have to count that also.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.190
But his sensibility,
sensitivity-- everything

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.010
was tested.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.750
And then they'll blindfold
him, and the whole thing

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.420
will be happening like that.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.470
These are things
that we've heard.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.090
It's all part of being--

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.490
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.850
KAMAL HAASAN: --ambidextrous.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.580
And working on multi platform
is what we call it now.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.071
We're coming back to it.

00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:36.347
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Android and iOS.

00:14:36.347 --> 00:14:37.930
KAMAL HAASAN: You're
doing everything.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.310
The specialist thing is only
for those who are actually

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.810
creating something.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.260
The actual user is
becoming [NON-ENGLISH].

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.650
Everybody.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.840
So I don't take that
as a special talent

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.030
that I'm entitled.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.752
But I think it is like
being everybody else.

00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:58.460
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
I guess, related to

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.980
that-- your directorial
sensibility,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.981
how does it work with
different director styles?

00:15:04.981 --> 00:15:06.396
Like, K.B. is very
different from,

00:15:06.396 --> 00:15:07.854
say, Mani Ratnam
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:07.854 --> 00:15:08.720
KAMAL HAASAN: Yeah.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.590
K.B. is something
like what you would

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.860
say of your father, parents.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.430
I've done 36 films with him.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:23.790
And 36 is a long time to
either love or hate somebody.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.650
I think we went through all
the ups and downs of emotions.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.950
Finally ended up saying
goodbye with a lot of love

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.210
because he knew he
was going to go away.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.723
So that's how we came
together in [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:39.723 --> 00:15:44.085
And so it's a very
rare relationship.

00:15:44.085 --> 00:15:46.540
And the man is tenacious.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.420
I'm not saying that because
one, he's not going to hear it.

00:15:52.132 --> 00:15:54.560
Two, it's not out
of that gratitude

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.340
that he made my career.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.290
Truly, single-handedly,
like a father would do.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.719
OK, now you're done
schooling, go to college.

00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:05.510
Now you're done college,
do your doctorate.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.710
Now you're done doctorate,
no worry about the job.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.620
Continue doing what you like.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.440
That kind of support.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.250
And only a father would do that.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.670
And for me, I keep
telling everyone

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.240
that's rare in this
century-- or any century,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.350
for that matter-- to find a
guru who paid you to teach

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.150
so that he could learn.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.860
That's always
happened in my career.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.880
So I become very
emotionally indebted

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.270
when I talk about gurus.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.190
And I'll use the word guru,
though I've lost my gods.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.670
I have not lost this part of me.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.780
I think it's very
important to have a guru.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:55.480
But only thing is, we are
fixed with a format of a guru.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.610
A guru need not
be older than you.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.000
A guru need not be somebody
who comes from outside.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.750
It could be a friend.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.460
It could be a daughter.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.210
She could be a daughter
or son-- anybody.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.940
That's why, we have even in
our mythology, that Shiva

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.089
takes advice from Lord
[? Mulga. ?] He's called

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.970
[INAUDIBLE] in that.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.079
So it can come from anywhere.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.050
Yes, every director
is different,

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.750
like every interview
is different.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:34.100
Some mock the interviewed.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.790
Some want to prove that
they're better than the man

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.170
being interviewed.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.620
There are various
ways of looking.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.650
And some people make
both of them look good.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.170
And those are the kind of
directors I respect a lot.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.400
They're not trying to
save themselves and use

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.270
the rest of them as fodder
for their critical cannons.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.390
K.B. would make it
look like his life

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.760
was at stake when
an actor, a postman,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.565
didn't render his line properly.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.940
Time was not of essence.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.590
Nothing was.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.660
He would work on a small detail,
over and over and over again.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.890
That's why a small bit
part player in his film

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:26.650
ended up being his partner
in screenwriting-- me.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:31.420
I started as a bit part player
who couldn't sort of mumble

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.620
his dialogue well.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.650
From there, it started the
relation-- that's a special.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.420
We'll not compare
him to anybody else.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.310
Mani Ratnam is another person.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.500
Sometimes when you
look at a peer,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.950
you wonder that this guy
really as old as he says he is.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.291
Or is he older?

00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:57.332
The behavior is not young.

00:18:57.332 --> 00:18:59.140
It's very wise and old.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.350
I always found that with Mani.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.890
When he was about 24, 23,
that's when I saw him.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:11.230
And he had that calm
which none of us had.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.500
And deliberate looking.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.190
It's like a seasoned gladiator
who's not panting and up

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.840
with the sword.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.850
He just lets it loose hang,
and looks for an opportunity.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.990
That's what I found.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.950
Even [INAUDIBLE] for both of
us, we learned some lessons

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.410
from that guy [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.680
He learned it actually
from a film institute.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.120
Of all the directors
I'm talking about,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.920
he is the right-- what do
you call it-- pathfinder

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.080
because he had a map.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.160
All of us, including
[INAUDIBLE],

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.030
built and went on a
journey without a map.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.110
It's difficult, I do understand.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:01.750
But why not take that
education for cinema?

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.530
And I always admired [INAUDIBLE]
for coming prepared to the film

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:13.860
industry and leaving it with
many prepared students, who

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.650
are now making good films.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.050
That's what he left behind.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.530
The legacy of [INAUDIBLE] is
something that will live on.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.380
He did lesser films,
but he compensated

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.700
by making more directors.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.920
These are special people.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.110
Singeetam, of course, is one of
the youngest directors I know.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.910
He's only 87 or 86 now.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.200
And [INAUDIBLE], naturally
your favorite, of the last

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.430
but not the least.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.890
They're all special people.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:52.210
And with this, you can say
clearly, my career was made,

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.533
with these few people.

00:20:53.533 --> 00:20:55.116
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Is there any art

00:20:55.116 --> 00:20:58.350
form-- again, you've done so
many of these different art

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.156
forms-- is there anything
beyond writing, screenplay?

00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:03.780
Is there anything that you feel
like you haven't had the chance

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.738
to explore? [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:04.738 --> 00:21:06.990
KAMAL HAASAN: Oh, so many.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:16.010
I'm not as tech-savvy person
as everyone thinks that I am.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.800
But what I like about
cinema is-- moving images,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.660
let's not even call it cinema.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.140
It's a very versatile medium.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.430
It'll absorb anything
that comes its way

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.690
and continue telling stories.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.390
With all the coagulating
coming together of platforms,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.360
moving images are still
going to be there,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.230
are still going to excite
even more than it did before.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.170
And what I have not
done is so many things.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.360
I always say, what
do you aspire to be?

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.860
In this film, you
would have done this.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.720
Most directors try for this.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.940
Some have succeeded,
some have not-- to become

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.320
truly a humble audience again.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.930
We lose it with
all the technology.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.660
Well, for when you see
something, an architecture,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.700
computer stuff, you're
looking at the corners,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.290
you're looking at
the engineering,

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:20.600
you're looking at the inside,
missing all the fun out of it.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.500
Being computer [? ninjas, ?]
you look at the architecture--

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.270
what is this?

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.420
What could that be?

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.240
And you totally miss out the
fun where common man has.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.070
It's how do you
regain the naivete?

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.260
How do you-- it's
not even unlearning.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.330
It is like meditation.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.820
You just leave it aside
and enjoy, go back.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.320
And that's what I would like
to be, a true, good audience.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.000
You know, when that happens,
I will not be making flops.

00:22:53.353 --> 00:22:56.706
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.150
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So this
question came up from-- again,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.860
we collected some of the
questions from rest of us

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.582
at Google.

00:23:07.582 --> 00:23:09.790
You know, at Google and in
Silicon Valley in general,

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.690
we talk a lot
about taking risks.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.700
We say, how do you go 10x?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.330
How do you bet big?

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.650
Take bolder bets of failing,
trying, experimenting?

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.774
I can't think of
anyone that embodies

00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:24.440
the spirit of
experimentation and taking

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.290
risks other than you in cinema.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.200
So you've taken many risks.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.207
Can you share some thoughts
on how you think about that?

00:23:33.207 --> 00:23:34.290
How do you actually think?

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.800
So think about maybe
[? "Dasavathaaram." ?] How do

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.889
you actually come up with
these big, bold bets?

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:40.680
And actually "Appu
Raja" is a great example

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.434
where, how do you think about
taking risks and failure?

00:23:44.434 --> 00:23:47.290
KAMAL HAASAN: I don't
think it is a risk.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.602
That's point number A.
If I thought it's a risk,

00:23:50.602 --> 00:23:51.560
I won't do it because--

00:23:54.482 --> 00:23:56.917
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:56.917 --> 00:24:00.070
So only when I am
convinced, only when

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:04.500
I know that my bungee
will stretch to-- it's

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.520
made out of right material,
and I won't swing and hit

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.100
the rocks.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.447
Taken this, I might still die.

00:24:15.447 --> 00:24:17.280
But then, where's the
fun of bungee jumping?

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.630
Then don't do bungee jumping.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.300
Just jump on where you are,
six, seven, eight inches.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.430
Be happy with that.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.320
But that's the way man
has always moved forward--

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.320
by taking that step forward.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.800
We were walking on
fours, all four.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.190
And then when we became
biped, somehow, we thought,

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.980
this is the direction to grow.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.180
I always question that.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.550
Why should this be
the direction to grow?

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.400
Why not this?

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.300
Why don't we think laterally?

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.580
Why don't we learn from a crab?

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.975
It moves faster in all
directions, this way.

00:24:55.975 --> 00:25:03.730
And we tend to also complacently
lean back on previous success.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.860
Biped man thinking everything is
up there is also part of that.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.030
He should think laterally.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.750
And about taking risks.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.910
I'll have to use the dialogue
from [? "Dasavathaaram." ?]

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.560
Would you run a marathon with 40
million people and try to still

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.080
win?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.900
All of us here have
run that marathon.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.920
We had 40 million sperms.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.680
And we are the winners.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.904
This room is only
full of winners.

00:25:40.904 --> 00:25:44.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.350
And I'll go even further.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.800
This world has only winners.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.379
If you're not a winner, you
wouldn't have come here at all.

00:25:55.379 --> 00:25:57.920
You would have been with those
other brothers and sisters who

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:03.400
lost, who stayed outside
mama's womb, knocking and dying

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.370
outside.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.020
And you are the only
person who made it.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.830
So when somebody thinks
of killing themselves,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.872
I tell them this.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.092
It's up to you to make
a loser out of a winner.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.390
We always try to do that.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.040
That's why that gives me
the confidence, that I've

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.980
won before-- why not try again?

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.445
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:31.435 --> 00:26:36.360
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.620
One of the things at least
is that the technology

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.000
at that time wasn't
there, right?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.770
And you've been thinking about
this, how technology can really

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.920
shape-- What are your thoughts?

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.955
Do you think that
the time has come?

00:26:46.955 --> 00:26:51.670
KAMAL HAASAN: [INAUDIBLE]
stopped for reasons

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.100
that very few know.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.180
Everyone was sad.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.110
Somebody said, it's a disaster.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:02.840
It'll be like [INAUDIBLE]
for-- I like the comparison,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.620
so I enjoyed it.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:12.970
But what I told them for fun,
or in anger-- I said, so what?

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.870
Part of [INAUDIBLE] was
going to be in film.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.735
The rest was going
to be digital.

00:27:18.735 --> 00:27:24.230
And they all laughed
because it was 2000.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.410
But that's what will
happen, when-- if

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.470
and ever-- [INAUDIBLE] is made.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.400
Part of it will be in film.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.900
The rest of it will
be in digital domain.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.860
Who knows?

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.860
IMAX.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.487
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I want
to switch gears to technology

00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:39.320
and what we do here.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.630
And there's one big shift
at least-- many big shifts,

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.680
actually-- in entertainment,
with mobile phones.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.310
But for us, one of the biggest
things we see is YouTube.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.460
That there's a lot
more of entertainment

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.280
reaching people not through
these mega, mainstream,

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.834
huge marketing machines and
mainstream pictures, and so on.

00:27:59.834 --> 00:28:01.750
And then there's the
other shift with Netflix.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.950
For example, there's
original series,

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.840
with really talented
actors like Kevin Spacey

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.810
in "House of Cards."

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.890
Netflix is coming to India, too.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:13.050
So how do you think about how
film industry is adapting to it

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.990
and how it should adapt to it?

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.160
What are your thoughts?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.920
KAMAL HAASAN: I'm the bleeding,
injured example of why the film

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.600
industry is not adapting to it.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.620
Because when I
wanted to go simple,

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.370
it's a very simple thing,
like putting it on DTH.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:36.212
They're out to kill me.

00:28:36.212 --> 00:28:40.900
Literally throw me out of the
industry for trying to do that.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.930
I think this intramural
entertainment

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.150
is going to be at the
will of the consumer.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:52.660
Where or when you want-- it
cannot be within four walls.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.300
He's going to take
it to his bedroom.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.978
He's going to take it to work.

00:28:56.978 --> 00:29:00.380
For lunchtime viewing
of a part of that film.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.700
And he's going to watch at will.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.950
And the platform is
irrelevant anymore.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.090
I even told the
people who opposed

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:16.230
the theater owners that--
tell me with all the calendar

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.889
printing of
[INAUDIBLE] photograph,

00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:22.555
has the crowd [INAUDIBLE]
[? reduced? ?]

00:29:25.782 --> 00:29:29.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.030
There is a ritual
that they believe in.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:39.180
They like to do that journey.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.840
That's why they go.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.580
Even wine shops
[INAUDIBLE] things.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.150
[INAUDIBLE] wines.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.200
And you have that.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.140
I've seen so many.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.610
And you've seen him.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.610
So what is the thing?

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.210
God is everywhere, isn't it?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.010
According to
[INAUDIBLE], he's there

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:04.780
in atom and in a pillar, in
you and me and everybody else.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.400
So [INAUDIBLE] why won't
we settle down to it?

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.410
It's an experience.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.340
How many ever
treadmills you make,

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:16.440
people would like to walk
the earth in bad weather.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.550
They'll wear all
sorts of rain gear

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.600
and still run on open space.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.660
Like that, there is
this congregation.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:31.520
You want to enjoy
this conversation.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.820
You can read about it.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.290
You can see it on your thing.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.870
But sitting here is
something special

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.640
for people, especially for me.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.910
So I can't just do this on
Skype and be happy about it.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.060
It can be done.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.090
But this is another experience.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.980
Likewise, cinema is a choice.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:59.640
You can-- to go, or here.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.000
That's what you'll have to ask.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.480
And they should encourage
allied businesses

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.140
because it's going to promote
the central core even more.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.710
One thing-- as long as
the industry does not

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.880
allow transparency
in business, they're

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.520
not going to allow any
new technology, either.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.920
It should be, the
correct way to run

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.920
the business is the
collection of a film

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.340
should be seen by
everybody, all the players.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.840
There should be transparency.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.290
I think there's a
hole in the bucket.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:44.070
We're carrying a bucket
with holes on either end.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.430
I'm just a middle man.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.230
A stupid middle man
who likes his art

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.300
and somehow trying
to wet his tongue

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.490
when there is a river running.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.980
And I'm scooping what
comes in a hole bucket

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.860
with two holes on either end.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.250
So I think they must adapt.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:10.075
I'm using this to warn
those old people who

00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:16.930
are hugging their investments,
which will become arcane.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.760
It'll crumble.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.530
The edifice will
crumble on themselves.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.590
And people will
keep marching on.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.150
They can't stop Netflix.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.900
They can't stop YouTube.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.140
They can't stop anybody
coming in and entertaining.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.950
And the democracy
of enjoying art

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.130
will be fully
enjoyed by the world.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.860
No business strategy
can stop it.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.320
No Hollywood, no
Bollywood can stop it.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.480
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Some
of your fans wanted to know

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.544
when are you going
to be on YouTube?

00:32:50.544 --> 00:32:51.335
KAMAL HAASAN: Yeah.

00:32:51.335 --> 00:32:57.300
I'm already there, but
without monetizing it.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.746
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.620
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
So you're at Google.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.100
We're all nerds here, so it's
time for a quick trivia quiz.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.840
But I thought first,
let's see if we

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.326
can ask Google some
questions about you

00:33:12.326 --> 00:33:14.730
before I ask some questions.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.140
Let's see if Google's
smart enough to know this.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.560
I want to try this.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.320
OK, Google-- where
was Kamal Haasan born?

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: He was
born in Paramakudi, India.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.650
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.560
KAMAL HAASAN: We'll
keep it to ourselves.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.520
I was born in [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.510
This is something I
always wanted to correct.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.426
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
All right, let's fix it.

00:33:43.426 --> 00:33:44.367
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:46.687 --> 00:33:48.270
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
So let's ask you

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.340
some questions, just for fun.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.664
Ultimate comedy?

00:33:51.664 --> 00:33:56.020
A, "Pushpak," B, "Michael
Madana Kama Rajan,"

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.880
C, [INAUDIBLE] D, your choice.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:05.360
KAMAL HAASAN: I would say--
in spite of [INAUDIBLE] being

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.510
everybody's favorite--
"Pushpak" is unique

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.980
because he didn't speak.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.320
And I think truly
ultimate comedy

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.900
is that which is done
not at anybody's expense.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.500
That is truly noble
comedy, where you laugh.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.499
They asked me,
well, it's a known--

00:34:26.499 --> 00:34:27.909
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:30.600
If you can do that, you're
a fantastic comedian.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.880
You can make people laugh.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.880
You can call a obese man obese,
short man short, tall man tall.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.370
It's very easy to
make fun of people.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.650
That's why they
say that when they

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.260
explain tragedy and comedy.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.159
They say, when it happens
to you, it's a tragedy.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.440
When it happens to somebody
else, it's a comedy.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.320
Simple That's our attitude.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.320
Within that attitude,
if we can bring nobility

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.810
without hurting anyone,
then that's great comedy.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.560
And Chaplin was that.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.600
Buster Keaton was that.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.890
[INAUDIBLE] was that.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:12.340
He made fun of people,
but people with cold.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.400
And he changed the
spelling for every word

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.350
to explain in writing, how do
you explain a person has cold?

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:25.150
He said, I am
C-U-B-B-I-N-G. I'm cubbing.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.680
Because he had a cold.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.070
If you start phonetically
pronouncing it,

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.180
you feel that you're
talking with a cold.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.110
That's the brilliance of-- he's
actually making fun of anyone

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.750
with cold, including yourself.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:43.460
And you start doing it, he must
have written 100 years ago.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.024
So that's good comedy,
ultimate comedy for me.

00:35:48.024 --> 00:35:50.190
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: We
already covered some of it,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.537
but ultimate director?

00:35:51.537 --> 00:35:53.370
And not including K.B.
in it, because I know

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.732
he's a different category.

00:35:54.732 --> 00:35:56.190
KAMAL HAASAN: Well,
in his absence,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.700
I love to promote somebody
I love equally well-- me.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:05.962 --> 00:36:07.920
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: It
was one of my choices,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.247
which is [INAUDIBLE],
[INAUDIBLE], Kamal Haasan.

00:36:11.247 --> 00:36:12.830
KAMAL HAASAN: But I
have a commitment.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.550
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Ultimate film.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.600
KAMAL HAASAN: Ultimate
film is yet to be made.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.672
I'm trying to--

00:36:22.672 --> 00:36:25.560
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:29.520
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So
I'll turn to some questions

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.100
that we collected
from the audience

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.330
and the rest of Google.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.960
So I'll share some of them.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.820
So one of them is
that there's so much

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.550
exciting work going on in
South Indian region cinema,

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.280
but these films are relatively
difficult for other parts

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.440
of the world to access.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.815
I mean, forget even other
parts of the world, other parts

00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:46.880
of the country to, right?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.242
For example, often they
don't have subtitles.

00:36:49.242 --> 00:36:51.900
Or they don't have distribution.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.579
What are your thoughts on how do
we bring these fantastic films

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:55.620
to the rest of the world?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.480
KAMAL HAASAN: I think
we'll have to-- this world

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.330
and that world will
have sit together.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.840
And probably there are going
to be vested interests, earlier

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.855
champions who won't
like-- I call it

00:37:09.855 --> 00:37:12.870
the Herod and
[INAUDIBLE] syndrome.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.290
Kill the child so they
won't be in opposition,

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.320
which is a very wrong thing.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.800
It's against humanity.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.540
You cannot kill a nascent
industry because you're worried

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.810
that it'll affect it.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.130
In [INAUDIBLE], we'll
have [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.910
Somebody asked about
[INAUDIBLE] What

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.980
is the use of spending
billions of dollars on this?

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.940
What do we get out of it?

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.870
To which he said, I don't know.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.060
It was a lady, and she
said, I don't know.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.060
We scientists do
not think of that.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.470
When Marconi made
radio, he was not

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.250
thinking of the
commercial value of it.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.320
He was inventing something.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:04.015
The businessmen will always
find use for any invention.

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:06.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.720
So we must keep
working on innovative,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.840
if not inventions all the time.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.100
Innovative permutation
combinations.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:19.220
And now I think cinema
should get more democracy.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.350
It cannot be with the money bag.

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.532
No country should be
held by federal banks.

00:38:24.532 --> 00:38:26.490
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
You've been a trailblazer

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.680
in bringing technologies.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.450
[? Audi ?] 3D's a
great example, right?

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.389
What can we expect next,
and what drives you here?

00:38:32.389 --> 00:38:33.930
KAMAL HAASAN: Well,
everyone thinks I

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.040
jump at everything that's new.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.760
I was very angry when
digital revolution

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.440
was delayed by laboratory
owners, studio owners, camera

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.070
rental owners.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:50.350
And people who simply were
attached to film, like Mr.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.170
Noland, Christopher Nolan.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.610
It's something like
saying I'm a vegetarian.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:00.100
I will never touch
meat, or vice versa.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.730
So it is like that.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:06.020
But at that time,
I think the world

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.250
digital cinema revolution
was delayed at least by 10,

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.990
15 years by vested interests.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.150
And in India, add five more.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.200
And that five more
was too much for me.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.840
So what I did was, they
were making big things,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.180
bringing in a lot of big gizmos.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.949
So I made a film
called "Mumbai Express"

00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:29.990
with a camera which is
lesser than the one that's

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.310
shooting me now.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.380
I made a point.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.540
Even now, I am saying
that there were

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.100
times when we had a camera,
and we changed costly lenses.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:49.140
Now we can put a camera for
every perspective we want.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.960
So it's going to be
change of cameras

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.300
rather than the
change of lenses.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.980
It's going that direction.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.120
And it's going to be like
lollipop, where you can

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.350
turn the camera 360 degrees.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:02.320
It's there.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.410
You can choose, now you
have [INAUDIBLE], which

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.300
fixes focus anywhere you want.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.817
Photographers say
that's cheating.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:16.180
So is knowledge.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.420
You know better
than him, and you

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.460
retain that knowledge, what's
going to happen tomorrow.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.730
You see, in King
Solomon's mind, there

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.840
is a scene where he
forecasts darkness

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.500
that will come on Earth.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.620
Actually, he knows from
his calendar there's

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.536
going to be a solar eclipse.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.730
People there believe
that he is godly.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.650
That's cheating.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.280
But you can do that
with knowledge.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.410
That's what others,
the great priests

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.000
were doing there,
with their knowledge.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.520
Now is the time when you have
to really give it to the people.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:57.350
Let the customers, the
inventors, and the content

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.920
makers almost touch each other.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.230
It's going to be like
live performance.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.470
So that's where we
are heading towards.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.660
It is live performance.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.990
If you telecast it now, right
now, it is live performance.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.890
So we are going
in that direction.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.610
And we'll have partners.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.601
But unfortunately, they're
all going to be young.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.240
That's only way to go,
because the older people

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:30.280
seem to believe in
stagnancy and rigidity.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.550
That's perfect
recipe for atrophy.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.880
I just spoke about
that at Harvard.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.170
I said, when you hold on and
think, I believe in this,

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.180
there's no subtle signs.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.740
Shouldn't be.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:48.160
Then we would be only
believing in penicillin.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.510
There won't be antibiotic,
and further on and on.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.650
Now we are reversing
and teaching

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.551
our body to take care of it.

00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:57.050
That's where the
medicine should go.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.570
That's where cinema should go.

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:02.810
I think the audience are
going to drive the content.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.322
Not like designers
making a thing.

00:42:06.322 --> 00:42:09.580
It'll become so
natural and harmonious,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.300
you won't even know who
is directing the film now.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.100
I will live to see
the day, hopefully.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.870
Work fast.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.140
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So
if you were at Google,

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.580
what would be your 10x project?

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.840
KAMAL HAASAN: You ask a
child, what do you want?

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.000
He'll say, a big lollipop.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.280
So it's like that.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.980
And I would say that you
should get into moving

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:42.500
images content dispersal.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.550
How you do it, how will you
encourage the existing industry

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.410
to accept you and
not tolerate you?

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:59.310
You must become part of that
industry, whatever it takes.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:03.520
If it means waging
battle, time for battle.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.970
Because otherwise, it's
going to slow down.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:13.630
And why slow down technology
when all could enjoy it?

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.240
Why slow down knowledge?

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.210
It should be those.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.680
So I think we should all
sort of huddle together.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.530
The game has begun already.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:29.820
The ardent fans cheering
for the game to go.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.490
They don't care about
winners and losers.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.730
They enjoy the spectacle.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.510
So we must give it to them.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.960
And the spectacle
will be when we fully

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:45.230
understand that cinema, or
any entertainment medium,

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.115
is about the content
and the performance.

00:43:47.115 --> 00:43:51.460
And above all, the enjoyment
of the larger majority.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.030
Not the enjoyment of a few
who are playing on the stage.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.070
They both enjoy equally,
but this enjoyment

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.390
comes from there.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.270
They cannot perform on their
own and feel the same happiness.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:10.210
So it's time that we
get together and connect

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.060
that last mile.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.380
And that last mile might be
uphill, might be bloody battle,

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.730
but it has to be done.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:21.113
And I'm not going to
die on the battlefield.

00:44:21.113 --> 00:44:23.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.520
I won't run away
from it, either.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.020
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So the
next question from the audience

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.570
was, if you were to make
a Hollywood movie today,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:32.900
what would it be about?

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.525
KAMAL HAASAN: Oh,
they already made it.

00:44:34.525 --> 00:44:37.024
Whenever I think of
something, they make it.

00:44:37.024 --> 00:44:38.804
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.250
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: And
who would your four stars be?

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.550
KAMAL HAASAN: There are so
many talented people here.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.500
It makes me want to cry.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.170
That's how many talented
people there are.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.700
Some names I don't even know.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.480
But look at Ryan Gosling.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.480
Look at Tom Hardy.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.450
Tom Hardy is somebody who I
could either applaud or kill.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.170
I'll only do two
things for the man.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:10.480
But he'll have to keep
that performance going.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.129
He's doing what Brando and
all did with tremendous pace.

00:45:16.129 --> 00:45:16.670
I don't know.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.870
What would I do?

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.555
He's every actor's envy.

00:45:22.555 --> 00:45:24.510
And there's a way to go.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.660
And there are so many people.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.080
And so many things to do.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.350
And "Revenant" is
a film I always

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.900
wanted to make because
it was already made

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.530
as "Lost in the Wilderness."

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:43.310
It's from a lore.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.350
It's a true story, but
it has happened before.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:49.080
When I saw that film, one
day, I will make that film.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:53.750
And Alejandro beat it to me.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.250
He did.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.390
It's a fantastic film.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:00.350
But it gives me
more energy anger,

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:05.520
because I can feel the
breath of man behind me.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.570
And I can see the kicking of
the dust of the man running

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.340
in front of me, is coming.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.260
I can taste the earth
that's coming from his foot.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.920
And the lion is there.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.450
We can see.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.270
But it's fun.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.590
I enjoy it.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.270
I am in this.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.940
They ask me, what
are you working on?

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.830
And how do you manage?

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.220
Everybody asks me
these questions.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.550
I give a very
disappointing answer.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.620
I don't work anymore.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:41.120
It's about 20, 25 years
since I stopped working.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.160
I still get paid.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.410
I still make movies.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.420
I love it.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:45.920
So--

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.860
I don't consider
that as work at all.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.310
I'm so grateful for
whatever money they give me.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.280
I'm so happy.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.924
Because nobody pays
you for your holiday.

00:47:00.924 --> 00:47:03.340
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: You've
done a variety of genre films

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.714
in different parts
of filmmaking.

00:47:04.714 --> 00:47:06.280
Is there a new genre?

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.600
Is there something new
that's on your mind

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.270
recently that you
want to explore?

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.686
KAMAL HAASAN: Oh,
there's so many.

00:47:11.686 --> 00:47:13.020
It's going to happen.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.380
As a matter of fact,
for [INAUDIBLE],

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.830
Jean-Claude Carriere
and I had a thought,

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.260
because we wanted to shoot
it with multiple cameras.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:30.060
Of course, it's a nightmare
for every producer when

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.970
the director says, I
want multiple cameras.

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.180
That means cost will go up.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.260
A take, to become perfect,
will take so many takes.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.940
So but what we
wanted to do is work

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.920
with three primary
cameras-- and many more.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.490
But three primary cameras
where the French film will have

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:56.590
a different cut, perspective.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:01.350
English and Tamil in one film.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:06.450
We'll send it to those areas
with those point of views.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:11.430
Like, when we want to see
this film of us talking,

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:14.620
where would you want
the camera to be?

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.973
Here.

00:48:15.973 --> 00:48:18.230
Not there.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:22.570
So our, probably here and here.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.240
That's what pleases us.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.330
So the script was
written that way.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:31.130
We didn't even share it with
anyone because if we had,

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:35.650
that would have been another
reason to stop the film.

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.950
So there are so many
things that you could do,

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:39.980
innovative things.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.640
Now you have so
many things coming.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.930
You can make the audience
look around and still

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.080
have content everywhere.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.980
And this is nothing new for me.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.070
When I was about
five-year or six-year-old,

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:01.700
there was a exhibition
called Circorama which

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.250
came to my town, [? Cheni ?].

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:08.350
It was a big tent they
built. The audience

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:13.010
were herded inside
a huge circus tent.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:17.420
And all the projection
rooms were outside.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:25.480
And I saw a speech by Abraham
Lincoln, Gettysburg speech

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.190
or something.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.720
I didn't know much English then.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.615
Something was
happening in English.

00:49:30.615 --> 00:49:34.120
And you had this
Lincoln Memorial thing.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.970
And we were in the middle.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.810
It was astounding.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.440
You have to stand and watch.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.356
So when they say 360
degree camera now,

00:49:45.356 --> 00:49:48.500
I say, I've seen it.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.430
So that is technology.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:53.330
That's how delayed technology
becomes, sometimes,

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.540
for good reasons
and bad reasons.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.415
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
It's a related question

00:49:57.415 --> 00:50:00.520
to what you just said,
which is, what role do you

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.030
think personally you want
to play in the pushing

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:08.490
this technology
towards the frontier?

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:11.180
You've always been, as you
said, like the bleeding edge.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.150
KAMAL HAASAN: Simply
get in there and do it.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:16.270
Don't keep deliberating
and talking about it.

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.580
What's the worst
thing that can happen?

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.880
Is you'll fail.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.162
That's data for future work.

00:50:22.162 --> 00:50:24.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:29.537 --> 00:50:31.120
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
The last request

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.690
was, can we take a
group selfie with you?

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:35.420
KAMAL HAASAN: Yeah, we can.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.620
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
