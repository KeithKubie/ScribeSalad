00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 Whether you're watching Netflix in one session, 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.320
 Or play the new Zelda game from start to finish, 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.780
 Most of us spend long hours in front of screens. 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.200
 But do you see these bad for your mind and your body? 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 In the past, it could have been fatal indeed! 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.740
 In 1967 a manufacturing error led to the sale of televisions 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.700
 Sends harmful X-rays with a radiation rate greater than 100,000 times 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.600
 What is safe today. 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.400
 But even modern TVs cause stress to your eyes 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.260
 Under normal conditions, the human eye is sprayed about 18 times per minute 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
 But when you put them in front of the screens, this rate is severely reduced 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.720
 Causing tired and burning eyes. 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.300
 Unfortunately these symptoms are short term in general. 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.720
 Children who spend long hours at home can have advanced effects 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.300
 From the short-sighted state where the eye can not focus properly, 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.380
 We see it more often in children who spend a lot of time indoors, 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.120
 So not because you have to focus on close-up devices and vice versa, 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.180
 You do not see landscapes and spacious spaces. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.000
 But scientists think that the sun itself may play a role in eye health, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.740
 While television feels that it is a good way to comfort the body and brain, 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.340
 But it is not always good, not just because it is a lifestyle 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.280
 Contributes to weight gain, 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 Studies have shown that people who do not watch television often burn more calories 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 Even if they did not perform many physical activities. 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 They simply do more mental activities such as reading or playing chess, 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 Or some home tasks that require more energy and burn more calories, 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.020
 If you want to relax, watching TV before bedtime is also harmful to you. 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 Studies have shown that they reduce normal sleep hours 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.740
 Causing insomnia. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.040
 It also affects pre-sleep activities. 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.260
 The researchers found that people watching television more than 20 hours a week 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.580
 Their sperm count decreases by 44%. 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.600
 The most prominent results are directly related to the life span. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.380
 Not only because there is a close relationship between TV viewing time and the risks of obesity and heart disease, 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.620
 But the shock is that several studies have found a relationship between TV viewing time 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.680
 And all causes leading to death. 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.420
 A study found that every hour you spend in front of the TV decreases 22 minutes of your life, 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.940
 Of course, the relationship is not the same. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.640
 You can have a healthy relationship with television 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.693
 If you use it properly like anything else. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.860
 The origin of many of these claims is the association of physical activity with television viewing hours. 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.700
 The sooner I move the longer I live. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.100
