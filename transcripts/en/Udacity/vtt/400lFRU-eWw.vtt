00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.460
Since we have m and b, we can just plug these in to slope intercept form to find

00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:11.547
the equation for each of these lines. Line f has the equation y equals negative

00:00:11.547 --> 00:00:16.375
x minus 2. Line g we can just write as y equals negative 1/2 x. You could, of

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:22.810
course, also write plus 0 out here, but that's not necessary. And lastly, line h

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.331
is y equals negative 1/2 x plus 3. As we saw before, lines g and h have the same

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:32.259
slope, negative 1/2, and we can see on the graph that they look parallel. They

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:37.191
don't have the same y intercept, but they do point in the same direction.

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:42.331
Parallel, as we learned very early in the lesson, just means same slope.
