going to switch gears look at the places
 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.979
going to switch gears look at the places
API where we've got some improvements in

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989
API where we've got some improvements in
 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.930

auto complete and we're going to wrap it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940
auto complete and we're going to wrap it
 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.660
auto complete and we're going to wrap it
up with a brand new app so a jade you

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670
up with a brand new app so a jade you
 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.610
up with a brand new app so a jade you
want to start off with the maps engine

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620
want to start off with the maps engine
 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.610
want to start off with the maps engine
data import sure Dylan so first things

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620
data import sure Dylan so first things
 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.279
data import sure Dylan so first things
first the maps engine API has been able

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289
first the maps engine API has been able
 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.279
first the maps engine API has been able
to do a few things allow us to look at

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289
to do a few things allow us to look at
 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.980
to do a few things allow us to look at
data yeah ask questions again data yeah

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
data yeah ask questions again data yeah
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.130
data yeah ask questions again data yeah
and now the API has been extended to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140
and now the API has been extended to
 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.410
and now the API has been extended to
allow us to be able to get data into our

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420
allow us to be able to get data into our
 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.420
allow us to be able to get data into our
Maps engine account so we used to be

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430
Maps engine account so we used to be
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.459
Maps engine account so we used to be
able to do it well we could feature by

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469
able to do it well we could feature by
 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.349
able to do it well we could feature by
feature I like add a feature exactly

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359
feature I like add a feature exactly
 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.330
feature I like add a feature exactly
feature but you're talking about bulk

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340
feature but you're talking about bulk
 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.209
feature but you're talking about bulk
upload right exactly getting tables in

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219
upload right exactly getting tables in
 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.219
upload right exactly getting tables in
getting raster image REE in even

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
getting raster image REE in even
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.810
getting raster image REE in even
creating an empty table and so I'm

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820
creating an empty table and so I'm
 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.050
creating an empty table and so I'm
specifically going to talk about two

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060
specifically going to talk about two
 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.029
specifically going to talk about two
features right here the first one gives

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039
features right here the first one gives
 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.859
features right here the first one gives
us the ability to upload new data

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869
us the ability to upload new data
 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.840
us the ability to upload new data
sources through the API this could work

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850
sources through the API this could work
 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.899
sources through the API this could work
for vector as well as wrestlers haha the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909
for vector as well as wrestlers haha the
 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.789
for vector as well as wrestlers haha the
second allows us to create a new empty

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799
second allows us to create a new empty
 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.010
second allows us to create a new empty
vector table so that you know after

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
vector table so that you know after
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.770
vector table so that you know after
after which you'll be able to use the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
after which you'll be able to use the
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.660
after which you'll be able to use the
batch insert or batch update to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
batch insert or batch update to
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.139
batch insert or batch update to
periodically insert records into the

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149
periodically insert records into the
 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.999
periodically insert records into the
table so the missing the missing piece

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009
table so the missing the missing piece
 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.380
table so the missing the missing piece
as far as our partners and customers

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
as far as our partners and customers
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.999
as far as our partners and customers
were concerned whether was was the

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009
were concerned whether was was the
 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.770
were concerned whether was was the
initial creations that create that empty

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780
initial creations that create that empty
 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.719
initial creations that create that empty
thing right to start doing the inserts

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729
thing right to start doing the inserts
 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.460
thing right to start doing the inserts
exactly right yeah

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470
exactly right yeah
 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.259
exactly right yeah
and I have a demo prepared for each of

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
and I have a demo prepared for each of
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.089

away I'm going to be using the OAuth
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640
away I'm going to be using the OAuth
playground for running these demos so

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
playground for running these demos so
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470
playground for running these demos so
that I can share what the request looks

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
that I can share what the request looks
 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.119

like but to get things started first you
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.259
like but to get things started first you
need to specify the scope and so I'm

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
need to specify the scope and so I'm
 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.820
need to specify the scope and so I'm
going to use the READ&amp;WRITE scope right

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
going to use the READ&amp;WRITE scope right
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.080

I'm going to start with the create new
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.229
I'm going to start with the create new
empty table example and so take a look

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239
empty table example and so take a look
 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.080
empty table example and so take a look
at the endpoint request so that's triple

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
at the endpoint request so that's triple
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.839

typical things that you would have
 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.559
typical things that you would have
entered even if you had created or

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569
entered even if you had created or
 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.390
entered even if you had created or
uploaded a table directly over at the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
uploaded a table directly over at the
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.670
uploaded a table directly over at the
console table name description and so on

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.659
imagine creating a table inside the
database should specify the column so

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669
database should specify the column so
 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.839
database should specify the column so
exactly the attributes you ok right so

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849
exactly the attributes you ok right so
 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.400
exactly the attributes you ok right so
I'm going to go ahead and close this and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
I'm going to go ahead and close this and
 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.479
I'm going to go ahead and close this and
run this query or right and over the

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
run this query or right and over the
 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.330
run this query or right and over the
results side of things you will see the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
results side of things you will see the
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.430
results side of things you will see the
schema that i created the table width

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
schema that i created the table width
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.729
schema that i created the table width
along with the asset ID that's that gets

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739
along with the asset ID that's that gets
 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.159
along with the asset ID that's that gets
created and assigned to this new asset

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169
created and assigned to this new asset
 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.170
created and assigned to this new asset
which is a vector table and i'm going to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
which is a vector table and i'm going to
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.270
which is a vector table and i'm going to
go into the maps engine console and

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
go into the maps engine console and
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.509
go into the maps engine console and
display the data sources so for partners

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519
display the data sources so for partners

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889
there was the missing piece that exactly
 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.340
there was the missing piece that exactly
that filled the gap right right

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350
that filled the gap right right
 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.210

bring to everyone's attention is the
fact that with this request I had

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650
fact that with this request I had
 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.340
fact that with this request I had
created the table using the same name as

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350
created the table using the same name as
 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.370

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380
I had tried last night right so i end up
 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.410
I had tried last night right so i end up
with two or more tables with the same

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420
with two or more tables with the same
 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.120
with two or more tables with the same
name which is not a problem because they

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130
name which is not a problem because they
 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.580
name which is not a problem because they
all have different asset IDs but come

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590

be more specific with what makes up this
data source yeah right and so here is a

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260
data source yeah right and so here is a
 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.020
data source yeah right and so here is a
list of the files that make up this

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030
list of the files that make up this
 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.850
list of the files that make up this
particular vector data source and again

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860

just to reiterate you're using a

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910
just to reiterate you're using a
 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.910
just to reiterate you're using a
shapefile vector-based but of course you

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920
shapefile vector-based but of course you
 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.010
shapefile vector-based but of course you
can upload images here to exactly that

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020
can upload images here to exactly that
 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.630
can upload images here to exactly that
right this is just examples showing a

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640
right this is just examples showing a
 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.980
right this is just examples showing a
vector but you can do that with with

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990
vector but you can do that with with
 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.050
vector but you can do that with with
imagery as well the other thing about

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060
imagery as well the other thing about
 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.910
imagery as well the other thing about
the upload functionality is that it

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920
the upload functionality is that it
 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.950
the upload functionality is that it
happens in two steps yeah in this first

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960
happens in two steps yeah in this first
 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.950
happens in two steps yeah in this first
step I'm just describing what the data

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960
step I'm just describing what the data
 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840
step I'm just describing what the data
source looks like it's made up of four

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850
source looks like it's made up of four
 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.090
source looks like it's made up of four
files and in the second step i'll be

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100
files and in the second step i'll be
 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.980
files and in the second step i'll be
uploading the files one by one so it's

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990
uploading the files one by one so it's
 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.570
uploading the files one by one so it's
really exactly it's exactly like using

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580
really exactly it's exactly like using
 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.070
really exactly it's exactly like using
the you i mean the same steps as in the

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080
the you i mean the same steps as in the
 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.040
the you i mean the same steps as in the
UI right just exactly metadata upload

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.240
Josh Livni and mark MacDonald did one in
mid-december so if you look for

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250
mid-december so if you look for
 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.430
mid-december so if you look for
importing data into Google Maps engine

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440
importing data into Google Maps engine
 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.650
importing data into Google Maps engine
if you look for that you'll see a video

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660
if you look for that you'll see a video
 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.420
if you look for that you'll see a video
that has a point is to some great code

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430
that has a point is to some great code
 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.520
that has a point is to some great code

place to look for details thanks so
should we uh switch gears now and look

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510
should we uh switch gears now and look
 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.150
should we uh switch gears now and look
at the I think the second item we wanted

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160
at the I think the second item we wanted
 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.850
at the I think the second item we wanted
to I was some styling there's been great

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860
to I was some styling there's been great
 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.770
to I was some styling there's been great
improvement in the styling aspect

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780
improvement in the styling aspect
 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.080
improvement in the styling aspect
especially for vector styles and so this

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.090
especially for vector styles and so this
 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.450
especially for vector styles and so this
basically goes into you know creating

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460
basically goes into you know creating
 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.610
basically goes into you know creating
richer cartography beautiful maps more

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620
richer cartography beautiful maps more
 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.830
richer cartography beautiful maps more
informative and so I have a short demo

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840
informative and so I have a short demo
 

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.560
informative and so I have a short demo
right here to share let me pull that up

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.570
right here to share let me pull that up
 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.390
right here to share let me pull that up
I'm going to use an existing data source

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400
I'm going to use an existing data source
 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.210
I'm going to use an existing data source
that I upload it again last night here's

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220
that I upload it again last night here's
 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.120
that I upload it again last night here's
a data source that has polylines

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.130
a data source that has polylines
 

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.270
a data source that has polylines
describing the various rivers and lakes

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280
describing the various rivers and lakes
 

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.580
describing the various rivers and lakes
I believe and so what I'm going to do is

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:07.590
I believe and so what I'm going to do is
 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.310
I believe and so what I'm going to do is
create a star player just give it a new

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.320
create a star player just give it a new
 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.029
create a star player just give it a new
name

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039
 

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:20.359
and as I create the first display rule

00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:20.369
and as I create the first display rule
 

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:25.159
and as I create the first display rule
give it a name over here what you'll

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:25.169
give it a name over here what you'll
 

00:08:25.169 --> 00:08:27.499
give it a name over here what you'll
notice are two main improvements first

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:27.509
notice are two main improvements first
 

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:30.709
notice are two main improvements first
is the ability to choose various kinds

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:30.719
is the ability to choose various kinds
 

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:33.050
is the ability to choose various kinds
of symbologies for displaying the lines

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060
of symbologies for displaying the lines
 

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.749
of symbologies for displaying the lines
on top of the base map tiles so let me

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:35.759
on top of the base map tiles so let me
 

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:38.149
on top of the base map tiles so let me
stick with this and maybe I change the

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159
stick with this and maybe I change the
 

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.019
stick with this and maybe I change the
color and do something more visible

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:41.029
color and do something more visible
 

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:44.120
color and do something more visible
right here and the other cool thing is

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.130
right here and the other cool thing is
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.879
right here and the other cool thing is
the ability to display one of the

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:46.889
the ability to display one of the
 

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:50.600
the ability to display one of the
attribute values as a label on top of

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.610
attribute values as a label on top of
 

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.280
attribute values as a label on top of
the geometric in this case which is a

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:52.290
the geometric in this case which is a
 

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.199
the geometric in this case which is a
polyline so I'm going to choose the name

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:54.209
polyline so I'm going to choose the name
 

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:57.590
polyline so I'm going to choose the name
attribute and the color stays is black

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600
attribute and the color stays is black
 

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.009
attribute and the color stays is black
I'm going to choose a very obvious

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:00.019
I'm going to choose a very obvious
 

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:03.410
I'm going to choose a very obvious
outline so it so it's the rule just

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420
outline so it so it's the rule just
 

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.610
outline so it so it's the rule just
because you can doesn't mean you should

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620
because you can doesn't mean you should
 

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.139
because you can doesn't mean you should
but we're doing a demo right right

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:06.149
but we're doing a demo right right
 

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:08.569
but we're doing a demo right right
because I do that alright I'm going to

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:08.579
because I do that alright I'm going to
 

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:10.550
because I do that alright I'm going to
go ahead and apply this and let's see

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560
go ahead and apply this and let's see
 

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.740
go ahead and apply this and let's see
how that plays out and so obviously here

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:15.750
how that plays out and so obviously here
 

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.910
how that plays out and so obviously here
this is not I mean if you want to

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920
this is not I mean if you want to
 

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.620
this is not I mean if you want to
customize the Google base map you can

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:18.630
customize the Google base map you can
 

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.960
customize the Google base map you can
still do that using the the existing

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:20.970
still do that using the the existing
 

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.759
still do that using the the existing
approach of applying styles to the

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:22.769
approach of applying styles to the
 

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:24.230
approach of applying styles to the
Google basement but clearly this is

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240
Google basement but clearly this is
 

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.240
Google basement but clearly this is
working with your data that's being

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.250
working with your data that's being
 

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.519
working with your data that's being
overlaid on top of that exactly that and

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:28.529
overlaid on top of that exactly that and
 

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:31.579
overlaid on top of that exactly that and
so now as you can see the labels that

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:31.589
so now as you can see the labels that
 

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:34.400
so now as you can see the labels that
come out from the name attribute are

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.410
come out from the name attribute are
 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.889
come out from the name attribute are
being displayed on as labels on top of

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899
being displayed on as labels on top of
 

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:38.569
being displayed on as labels on top of
the geometry and in fact a long made

00:09:38.569 --> 00:09:38.579
the geometry and in fact a long made
 

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:39.920
the geometry and in fact a long made
geometry as well which is kind of nice

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:39.930
geometry as well which is kind of nice
 

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.009
geometry as well which is kind of nice
right right exactly that excellent so we

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019
right right exactly that excellent so we
 

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:46.009
right right exactly that excellent so we
got new line styles and new labels and

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019
got new line styles and new labels and
 

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:47.509
got new line styles and new labels and
this is kind of on that continuous path

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519
this is kind of on that continuous path
 

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.100
this is kind of on that continuous path
we're trying to get from where we

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.110
we're trying to get from where we
 

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.509
we're trying to get from where we
started with a sort of the minimum

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519
started with a sort of the minimum
 

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:54.530
started with a sort of the minimum
viable set of symbology and slowly

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540
viable set of symbology and slowly
 

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.000
viable set of symbology and slowly
getting better and better and I think

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.010
getting better and better and I think
 

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.590
getting better and better and I think
our goal is basically to have some kind

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600
our goal is basically to have some kind
 

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.569
our goal is basically to have some kind
of parity in terms of the beautiful map

00:09:59.569 --> 00:09:59.579
of parity in terms of the beautiful map
 

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:01.340
of parity in terms of the beautiful map
with the consumer experience as well

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.350
with the consumer experience as well
 

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.420
with the consumer experience as well
just so it looks it all looks good okay

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:05.430
just so it looks it all looks good okay
 

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.309
just so it looks it all looks good okay
well I think the next item and the last

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:07.319
well I think the next item and the last
 

00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:08.509
well I think the next item and the last
thing for maps engine we were covering

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519
thing for maps engine we were covering
 

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.790
thing for maps engine we were covering
was the image referencing tool right and

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800
was the image referencing tool right and
 

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.350
was the image referencing tool right and
so with the image referencing tool the

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360
so with the image referencing tool the
 

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.629
so with the image referencing tool the
idea is pretty simple you're able to

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:14.639
idea is pretty simple you're able to
 

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:17.530
idea is pretty simple you're able to
upload a JPEG that has 0 geo referencing

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.540
upload a JPEG that has 0 geo referencing
 

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.420
upload a JPEG that has 0 geo referencing
I'm imagining in my mind a floor plan

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.430
I'm imagining in my mind a floor plan
 

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.340
I'm imagining in my mind a floor plan
let's say yeah where you need to place

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.350
let's say yeah where you need to place
 

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.569
let's say yeah where you need to place
on top of the base

00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:24.579
on top of the base
 

00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:27.449
on top of the base
right and so with the absence of geo

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:27.459
right and so with the absence of geo
 

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:29.850
right and so with the absence of geo
referencing this tool allows you to kind

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:29.860
referencing this tool allows you to kind
 

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.009
referencing this tool allows you to kind
of align it with the base map tiles and

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:32.019
of align it with the base map tiles and
 

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:35.189
of align it with the base map tiles and
so I'm going to do that right here with

00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:35.199
so I'm going to do that right here with
 

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:37.019
so I'm going to do that right here with
one of the data sources that I have

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.029
one of the data sources that I have
 

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:42.809
one of the data sources that I have
existing right so this is the floor pan

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:42.819
existing right so this is the floor pan
 

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:44.970
existing right so this is the floor pan
jpg image that I upload it last night

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:44.980
jpg image that I upload it last night
 

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.859
jpg image that I upload it last night
and with the upload feature now there is

00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:49.869
and with the upload feature now there is
 

00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:51.840
and with the upload feature now there is
the setting that you can choose where

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:51.850
the setting that you can choose where
 

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.400
the setting that you can choose where
you can say I want to manually align

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.410
you can say I want to manually align
 

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.699
you can say I want to manually align
this a cryogenic data source and so

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:56.709
this a cryogenic data source and so
 

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:58.379
this a cryogenic data source and so
that's what I've done so when you choose

00:10:58.379 --> 00:10:58.389
that's what I've done so when you choose
 

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:00.449
that's what I've done so when you choose
that what you have here in the data

00:11:00.449 --> 00:11:00.459
that what you have here in the data
 

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.389
that what you have here in the data
details page is a link that allows you

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399
details page is a link that allows you
 

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:05.549
details page is a link that allows you
to open up the alignment tool so I'm

00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:05.559
to open up the alignment tool so I'm
 

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:08.699
to open up the alignment tool so I'm
going to go into that first things first

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:08.709
going to go into that first things first
 

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.829
going to go into that first things first
this alignment tools works on the bait

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839
this alignment tools works on the bait
 

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:13.410
this alignment tools works on the bait
what's based on three anchors that are

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:13.420
what's based on three anchors that are
 

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.139
what's based on three anchors that are
attached to the image and you you can

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:16.149
attached to the image and you you can
 

00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:17.699
attached to the image and you you can
feel free to move around these anchors

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:17.709
feel free to move around these anchors
 

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:19.710
feel free to move around these anchors
however you want it once you've chosen

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720
however you want it once you've chosen
 

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.419
however you want it once you've chosen
the anchors the next step will be to

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:21.429
the anchors the next step will be to
 

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:23.429
the anchors the next step will be to
align them wherever you want on the map

00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:23.439
align them wherever you want on the map
 

00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:25.530
align them wherever you want on the map
mm-hmm right so I'm just going to do

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:25.540
mm-hmm right so I'm just going to do
 

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.259
mm-hmm right so I'm just going to do
that right here by changing the address

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:28.269
that right here by changing the address
 

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:34.559
that right here by changing the address
to and so instead of having to drag this

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:34.569
to and so instead of having to drag this
 

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.629
to and so instead of having to drag this
across the tiles you just type in a

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639
across the tiles you just type in a
 

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:40.739
across the tiles you just type in a
dress and that image will be dragged to

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:40.749
dress and that image will be dragged to
 

00:11:40.749 --> 00:11:43.859
dress and that image will be dragged to
wherever the address that you had chosen

00:11:43.859 --> 00:11:43.869
wherever the address that you had chosen
 

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:46.169
wherever the address that you had chosen
and I'm just going to stretch this all

00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:46.179
and I'm just going to stretch this all
 

00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:48.809
and I'm just going to stretch this all
the way here to make a little more sense

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:48.819
the way here to make a little more sense
 

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:51.539
the way here to make a little more sense
of this image I should add that you can

00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:51.549
of this image I should add that you can
 

00:11:51.549 --> 00:11:53.009
of this image I should add that you can
you can repeat this process as always

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:53.019
you can repeat this process as always
 

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.059
you can repeat this process as always
you've done it you can go back and

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:54.069
you've done it you can go back and
 

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:56.729
you've done it you can go back and
realign it as you see definitely exactly

00:11:56.729 --> 00:11:56.739
realign it as you see definitely exactly
 

00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:04.970
realign it as you see definitely exactly
that rude boy and so

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980
 

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.380
yeah i think that sort of the benefit of

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.390
yeah i think that sort of the benefit of
 

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.930
yeah i think that sort of the benefit of
this too is that um you know anyone can

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:09.940
this too is that um you know anyone can
 

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.700
this too is that um you know anyone can
I always think of emergency situations

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:11.710
I always think of emergency situations
 

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.020
I always think of emergency situations
as being where you need to act quickly

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.030
as being where you need to act quickly
 

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.910
as being where you need to act quickly
and it doesn't have to be perfect fit

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920
and it doesn't have to be perfect fit
 

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.710
and it doesn't have to be perfect fit
where if you just had a floor plan from

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720
where if you just had a floor plan from
 

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.600
where if you just had a floor plan from
someone you need to share it securely

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:18.610
someone you need to share it securely
 

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.210
someone you need to share it securely
you can upload it align it and then

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:21.220
you can upload it align it and then
 

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.400
you can upload it align it and then
share it through Maps engine right

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:23.410
share it through Maps engine right
 

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.110
share it through Maps engine right
exactly that like you know if you zoomed

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120
exactly that like you know if you zoomed
 

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.820
exactly that like you know if you zoomed
it into the base map tiles you'd see

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:26.830
it into the base map tiles you'd see
 

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.740
it into the base map tiles you'd see
more like an empty outline so it makes

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:28.750
more like an empty outline so it makes
 

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.960
more like an empty outline so it makes
more sense if you had an existing floor

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.970
more sense if you had an existing floor
 

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.370
more sense if you had an existing floor
plan to kind of share that with your

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:32.380
plan to kind of share that with your
 

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.210
plan to kind of share that with your
viewers all right and at once the

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:36.220
viewers all right and at once the
 

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.800
viewers all right and at once the
processing is done you should be able to

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:37.810
processing is done you should be able to
 

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.830
processing is done you should be able to
view that in your drafts and basically

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:40.840
view that in your drafts and basically
 

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.630
view that in your drafts and basically
any way you can use a max engine layer

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:42.640
any way you can use a max engine layer
 

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.130
any way you can use a max engine layer
you're going to be able to add that as a

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:44.140
you're going to be able to add that as a
 

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.960
you're going to be able to add that as a
layer or an asset right right yeah

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:45.970
layer or an asset right right yeah
 

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.980
layer or an asset right right yeah
exactly that um okay so let's switch to

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:49.990
exactly that um okay so let's switch to
 

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.740
exactly that um okay so let's switch to
the places API now there's one thing we

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:52.750
the places API now there's one thing we
 

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.510
the places API now there's one thing we
wanted to call out which is a sort of it

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:54.520
wanted to call out which is a sort of it
 

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.160
wanted to call out which is a sort of it
seems like a small thing but actually a

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.170
seems like a small thing but actually a
 

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.570
seems like a small thing but actually a
pretty significant improvement in

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:57.580
pretty significant improvement in
 

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.700
pretty significant improvement in
royalty a result throw relevance I

00:12:59.700 --> 00:12:59.710
royalty a result throw relevance I
 

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.100
royalty a result throw relevance I
should say right which is IP biasing on

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.110
should say right which is IP biasing on
 

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.740
should say right which is IP biasing on
locally right so what we have for the

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:04.750
locally right so what we have for the
 

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.470
locally right so what we have for the
autocomplete nozzle in enhancement that

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480
autocomplete nozzle in enhancement that
 

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.190
autocomplete nozzle in enhancement that
does IP biasing by default and so let me

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200
does IP biasing by default and so let me
 

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:19.890
does IP biasing by default and so let me
start with a query right here I'm just

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:19.900
start with a query right here I'm just
 

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.570
start with a query right here I'm just
going to dump it dump it into the

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:21.580
going to dump it dump it into the
 

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.440
going to dump it dump it into the
address bar and run it and so this query

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:25.450
address bar and run it and so this query
 

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.760
address bar and run it and so this query
uses autocomplete endpoint to look for

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:28.770
uses autocomplete endpoint to look for
 

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.410
uses autocomplete endpoint to look for
suggestions based on the text that I

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:31.420
suggestions based on the text that I
 

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.050
suggestions based on the text that I
enter wa Sh so it's going to give me

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.060
enter wa Sh so it's going to give me
 

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.150
enter wa Sh so it's going to give me
suggestions on Washington so if you look

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160
suggestions on Washington so if you look
 

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.280
suggestions on Washington so if you look
at the result it starts at Washington DC

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.290
at the result it starts at Washington DC
 

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.340
at the result it starts at Washington DC
if I scroll a little towards the bottom

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:41.350
if I scroll a little towards the bottom
 

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.470
if I scroll a little towards the bottom
i see washington street san jose and

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480
i see washington street san jose and
 

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.530
i see washington street san jose and
then washington street sunnyvale and

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:46.540
then washington street sunnyvale and
 

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.420
then washington street sunnyvale and
that's primarily because we're doing

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:48.430
that's primarily because we're doing
 

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.800
that's primarily because we're doing
this recording in the Mountain View

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:49.810
this recording in the Mountain View
 

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.300
this recording in the Mountain View
campus and these are the nearby

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.310
campus and these are the nearby
 

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.100
campus and these are the nearby
locations that have Washington in the

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.110
locations that have Washington in the
 

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.050
locations that have Washington in the
address and to be more specific your

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.060
address and to be more specific your
 

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.790
address and to be more specific your
machine that you're making the call from

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800
machine that you're making the call from
 

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.490
machine that you're making the call from
has a has an IP address associated with

00:13:59.490 --> 00:13:59.500
has a has an IP address associated with
 

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.700
has a has an IP address associated with
that location right exactly that right

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:02.710
that location right exactly that right
 

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.920
that location right exactly that right
so that happens by default now if you

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:04.930
so that happens by default now if you
 

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.410
so that happens by default now if you
wanted to switch that off you'd remember

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:07.420
wanted to switch that off you'd remember
 

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.530
wanted to switch that off you'd remember
if you've been using the places API

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540
if you've been using the places API
 

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.270
if you've been using the places API
there is the additional optional

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:12.280
there is the additional optional
 

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.960
there is the additional optional
parameters that you can add location and

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:15.970
parameters that you can add location and
 

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.390
parameters that you can add location and
radius yeah so that also does some

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:18.400
radius yeah so that also does some
 

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.990
radius yeah so that also does some
biasing so to switch off this IP biasing

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000
biasing so to switch off this IP biasing
 

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.680
biasing so to switch off this IP biasing
you would need to enter 0 comma 0 for

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:25.690
you would need to enter 0 comma 0 for
 

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.660
you would need to enter 0 comma 0 for
the lat/long for the location yeah and

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:27.670
the lat/long for the location yeah and
 

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.690
the lat/long for the location yeah and
radius as 20 million meters that covers

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:30.700
radius as 20 million meters that covers
 

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.370
radius as 20 million meters that covers
the whole globe so that is indirectly

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:32.380
the whole globe so that is indirectly
 

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.840
the whole globe so that is indirectly
saying that I don't want to do IP

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:33.850
saying that I don't want to do IP
 

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.380
saying that I don't want to do IP
biasing yeah so I mean obviously the the

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:37.390
biasing yeah so I mean obviously the the
 

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.750
biasing yeah so I mean obviously the the
thing is a lot of times that developers

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760
thing is a lot of times that developers
 

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.880
thing is a lot of times that developers
or consumers of the API are adding those

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:41.890
or consumers of the API are adding those
 

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.830
or consumers of the API are adding those
parameters and customers might be

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:43.840
parameters and customers might be
 

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.930
parameters and customers might be
getting results that don't really make

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:45.940
getting results that don't really make
 

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.100
getting results that don't really make
sense based on where they're located

this is kind of the first first attempt

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.020
this is kind of the first first attempt

okay right so just a quick glance at the

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880
okay right so just a quick glance at the
 

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.520
okay right so just a quick glance at the
results another five included the

00:14:59.520 --> 00:14:59.530
results another five included the
 

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.160
results another five included the
