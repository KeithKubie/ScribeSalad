00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:14.730
SPEAKER 1: --see that grow
and see that bloom as everyone

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.220
all over the world kind
of jumped on and put

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.520
these connections together.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.610
I've been witness to a few
large changes on the web.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.740
And the web is
interesting in that I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.680
think it evolves as a
platform in a way that's

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.720
pretty unique, compared to
other platforms as well.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.560
The first evolution
was Ajax when we kept

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.670
adding capabilities to the web.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.850
We wanted to make it
prettier, so we added styling

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.230
with CSS and the like.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.840
And we wanted to do
more dynamic interfaces,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.450
so we added JavaScript.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.850
But we kept pushing
and kept pushing.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.870
And when someone on the
Outlook web team at Microsoft

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.070
put together the XMLHttpRequest
object that kind of birthed

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.580
the Ajax movement, we got to
go from this world of documents

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.280
and kind of rich documents,
and really kind of blow

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.120
up and allow you to build
real web applications.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.000
And we remember that with
immersive apps like Google

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.380
Maps, Gmail, and Google Suggest
and the like on the Google

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.284
side.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.700
And this was a
massive difference.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
And you go back and think about
what it was like before that.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.940
I remember going to
MapQuest, for example,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.370
before Google Maps.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.930
And every time you
wanted to pan around

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.330
to another area in there, you
had to wait for the server

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.850
to send everything down again.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.280
The web created some
new capabilities,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.870
took a bit of time
to work out how

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.150
to deliver on
those capabilities,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.320
and we built the desktop web app
revolution going from documents

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.080
to apps, just in time for
the web to take over--

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.110
for mobile to take over,
rather, and the big explosion

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.440
that happened with mobile.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.480
And now it's easy to
think back and remember

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.600
this explosion happening as
though it kind of came out

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.780
of nothing.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.590
But for those who had
been around a little bit,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.990
you may remember it was
kind of a long time coming.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.759
I remember going to JavaOne,
back in the Sun days,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.800
and every keynote they'd
be up there talking

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.290
about how this is
the year for mobile.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.420
Developers, learn J2ME.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.880
It's going to be huge.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.490
And then it never
happened, until we got

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.160
the iPhone, and then Android.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.200
And then mobile
totally took off.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.770
And we got to the point where
mobile has eclipsed desktop

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.055
entirely.

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:31.680
I do think it's
important though for us

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.170
to remember that it's not that
desktop isn't growing anymore.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.512
It's not that desktop
isn't going away.

00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:38.970
So it's really
important that we're

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.975
able to build experiences
that actually work there.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.100
I don't know about you,
but there are some services

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.910
that I use where it feels like
the team's all off working

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.190
on mobile, and I use this to
try to be productive all day.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.800
And nothing's really
changing on the desktop side.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.020
So I'm actually really
proud of the fact that you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.360
can develop things responsively
across desktop and mobile too.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.630
Some scary statistics came
out after mobile really

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.739
was taking off and people were
building these native apps.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.280
And I was thinking
about, like, well,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.690
what's actually
happening to the web?

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.340
You look at the stats and you
see, wow, only 13% of the time

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.640
is spent on the mobile web,
compared to apps, where they're

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.910
getting 87% of user time.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.290
That's a little bit dire.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.890
That's not the kind of thing
that we as web developers,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.940
we like to see.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.900
But this is a very
macro statistic.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.720
And it was important for us
to go deeper and take a look

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.610
at what actually
was happening there.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.890
And you're going to see
a series of case studies

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.830
where we actually go in and
look at different companies

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.280
and what's happening to them
to kind of piece apart what's

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.190
really happening out there.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.050
One of the things to
piece apart in general

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.380
was just, of all of
that time, 80% of it

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.710
was spent in the top three
apps that a user has.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.740
So it wasn't about just the
native platform versus web,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.820
it was the actual experiences
that they were working with.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.130
And then if you go
deeper within that,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.980
you see that a lot
of the top apps

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.090
are kind of
platforms themselves,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.860
and a lot of the
content that's within it

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.500
is actually web content
that's going to different web

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.910
services.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.589
So the picture
got a lot muddier.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.870
So let's take a look at
a little bit of what's

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.360
going on with the whole
web versus native thing,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.830
as we kind of move forward
from desktop into mobile.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.270
And if you look
at one axis you've

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.090
got, what are the
capabilities and what

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.980
are the access to
capabilities that you

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.680
get from a particular platform?

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.320
So in the world of
apps, you obviously

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.020
get access to the
entire native platform.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.940
You kind of do all of
the permission modeling

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.650
a little bit up front
in the app store,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.120
and some runtime permissions.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.590
And then you kind of get to do
whatever you want from then on.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.520
And you get access to the
places where users really

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.530
want to get access
to those experiences,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.390
like the home screen and
the notifications bar

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.740
and things of that nature.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.430
So you get access to
all of the capabilities

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.792
of the native device.

00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:08.250
The web, on the
other hand, doesn't

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.850
get access to all of those,
especially back in the day.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.840
But then you add in reach.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.170
And you think about
that magic of the URL

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.810
where we got to see with
5miles the difference

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.549
that we can make by
upgrading our web experience,

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:25.090
and being able to
just share this URL

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.110
and get access to not
only the application,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.300
but potentially directly to
the state that really matters.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.220
And again, I think
back to the old days

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.930
and installing software and
the like, compared to being I

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.130
would to send a URL to my dad,
who can then just click on it

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.500
and get directly
into that experience

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.380
and start actually
getting something done.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.500
Another startling
statistic that came out,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.440
again with a macro lens, is
something that doesn't really

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.030
make a lot of sense.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.900
How can no one be
downloading any apps?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.610
That doesn't really make sense.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.180
But this is good old
statistics and rounding.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.110
This is all about the fact that
people have kind of slowed down

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.090
the number of apps that
they're downloading,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.984
because you've kind of
got the apps that you

00:06:10.984 --> 00:06:12.150
want to be working with now.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.233
You've got your favorites.

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:14.490
They're lined up.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.890
Apps you download tend
to be the services

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.200
you're really loyal to.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.900
And so if you're a newcomer
coming into the game,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.850
it's really hard
to fight for a spot

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.562
directly on that home screen.

00:06:27.562 --> 00:06:30.020
You've got to get people to go
through all of this process,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.000
download the app
from the App Store.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.170
That's a really
tricky proposition.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.230
So we've got to struggle
to get access to our users,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.120
and what can we do?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.820
So one thing is,
what if we could

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.310
take the benefits of
the web and actually

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.430
deliver on the capabilities, and
kind of up level the web again

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.110
and give you access
to all of the things

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.984
that we actually wanted
and all of the things

00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:58.640
that users want to be able
to get work done on mobile?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.820
And that's exactly the work
that we-- not just Google,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.450
but the entire web
community-- have been doing.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.540
This is us enhancing
the platform itself,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.240
learning about what works and
giving you, the developers,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.540
access to the underlying
platform in a way that's

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.650
secure for users, in a way that
can be at the end of a URL.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.290
This is why I'm
really excited about--

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.450
we had Ajax for the
world of desktop apps,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.370
and we finally got
the capabilities

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.099
that you need to deliver
fantastic mobile applications.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.640
And so that's what we mean when
we talk about progressive web

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.510
apps.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.140
It basically is just
saying that we're here

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.360
for mobile natively on the web.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.980
And we saw this
big transformation

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.402
where, I remember at the
beginning, with Ajax,

00:07:42.402 --> 00:07:44.360
we talked about the
different technologies that

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.590
were involved.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.820
And then over time
it just started to--

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.160
it started to mean just
the user experience

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.220
itself had been up leveled.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.060
And we're trying to do the same
thing here with PWAs on mobile.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.950
We don't want to
just share, here's

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.104
all of the different APIs
that you have access to.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.520
That's really
important, and we're

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.350
going to go into those details.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.320
But we really want you to
think about the user experience

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.220
itself and how to make sure
that you really kind of up level

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.020
that experience
on the mobile web.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.540
Because the partners that
we've been working with now

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.189
have really been able
to delight their users.

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:18.730
Because, let's face
it, sometimes you

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.660
go on the mobile web and
it's not the best experience.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.210
So if you deliver
something that's

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.630
really tantalizing
and delightful,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.660
it's going to be great, and
the results are going to show.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.090
So what do we need
to actually do?

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.400
How are we going to up
level the experience

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.559
and give you the
capabilities that you

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.970
need to deliver to your users?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.770
So the first piece is we
need a reliable experience.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.200
We need to make
sure that users know

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.630
that they can use the web
even if the connectivity is

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.010
intermittent.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.230
Now this was actually
hard on the web,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.962
because its roots, back in time,
were in a very different world.

00:08:57.962 --> 00:08:59.920
You remember back then
when you were connecting

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.550
to the internet, it wasn't you
connecting through your phone

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.600
to the internet.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.930
It was you connecting your
household to the internet.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.590
You'd go.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.030
You'd get a modem.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.540
You'd start dialing up and
you'd hear that magical sounds

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.250
that are coming through the
modem to get you connected.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.400
And now you're jacked
into the Matrix.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.116
You're ready to do things.

00:09:20.116 --> 00:09:21.490
And then you have
that fear where

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.625
you start doing a big
download or something,

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.000
and you hope that
someone doesn't

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.140
pick the phone up or call you
and disrupt the entire process.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.250
But it was very binary.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.980
You were either connected to
the internet or you weren't.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.320
That's what the
web was all about.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.200
That's what it was based on,
whether it be on a dialup

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.760
or sitting there in a university
on a nice flush T1 line,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.320
you knew that you
were always connected.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.050
If you weren't, you got to
see this guy, the downasaur,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.050
and you weren't happy.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.436
And I've got kids at
this point now back home,

00:09:54.436 --> 00:09:56.060
and this really
doesn't make them happy

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.880
other than the fact they can
play the little game while they

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.180
wait for me to try and
fix the Wi-Fi at home.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.150
This is very, very
frustrating to users.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.500
But what we find
is, there's actually

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.981
something that's more hidden
and more frustrating going on,

00:10:11.981 --> 00:10:13.480
and something that
we need to tackle

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.160
as developers to get these
experiences working reliably.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.090
And that's the notion of Li-Fi.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.680
So you've all
probably experienced

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.350
this, where you're
looking at your phone,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.070
and it looks like you're
fully connected to Wi-Fi,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.740
or you're fully connected
to your cell network,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.430
but it doesn't
seem to be working.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.550
We've got this problem where
we're connected to the access

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.740
point that may be close
to us, but that doesn't

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.514
mean we're actually connected
to the internet itself.

00:10:41.514 --> 00:10:43.180
And then when you
start to do something,

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.729
you don't see the downasaur.

00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:47.020
You're just kind of sitting
there with a spinner trying

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.830
to work out what's going on.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.040
We, the web platform
provider, needed

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.490
to give you the hook so you
could take ownership over this,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.340
make things still work even
as the network is going

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.260
up and down and
all of the issues

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.860
that we run into every day on
cell networks and the like.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.330
So that's what
reliability is for us.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.760
It's about making sure
that your users never

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.350
see this dinosaur when
they're using your experience,

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.700
and you're able to do it.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.070
And as you sit through the
different sessions today,

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.480
you're going to see
exactly what it takes

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.646
to get rid of this dinosaur.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.385
OK, reliability, that's key.

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:27.760
And that's something
that we need

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.860
to kind of keep
teaching users so they

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.420
know that when
they go on the web,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.240
it's always working
no matter what.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.410
The next slide is
performance and speed.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.970
Ben in the keynote talked
about the strong focus

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.880
that we have there, and how
we're trying to attack it

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.590
in different ways with AMP.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.490
That's one option to get
content running really quickly.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.710
But we also needed to put
things into the platform

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:55.360
itself to enable you to make
incredibly fast experiences.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.210
Fast meaning loading
things incredibly quickly

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.410
on first load, but also
as your users experience

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.680
your application, it's that
buttery smooth environment

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.880
that Ben was talking about.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.900
You get 60 frames per second.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.900
It feels like it's right
there with your finger.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.820
It just works as it should.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.960
It's just like native.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.010
Now this performance isn't
just about pleasing your users.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.150
We see time and time again
that performance goes directly

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.170
to the bottom line.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.480
Soasta is a company that does
a lot of monitoring out there

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.880
for your applications and
applications in the wild.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.490
And they did a famous
study a year or so ago

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.720
where they looked
at the bounce rates

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.470
in the world of e-commerce
and other vectors,

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.380
and they just started to measure
the effects of those bounce

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.560
rates depending on how
slow your experience is.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.470
And you can see
there's key moments,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.560
like if your load time
is over three seconds,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.020
there's a bounce rate of 20%.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.550
And as you get
slower and slower,

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.050
the bounce rate gets
worse and worse.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.840
So anything you can do
to fix this performance

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.260
will instantly bring
more money in the door,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.900
and your users won't
be off to play "Candy

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.386
Crush" or some other game.

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:11.260
They will be focused
doing whatever they need

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.420
to do with your experience.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.610
Now this was done
a year or so ago.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.940
The DoubleClick team
just did another study,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.520
and things have
gotten even worse.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:30.990
53% of users abandon sites that
take longer than three seconds.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.410
This is a wake up call for
us on the web and in general.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.631
We need to fix the
obesity epidemic

00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:38.630
that we have on the web.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.460
We need to deliver
faster experiences,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.260
because your users
are just going away

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.940
when this doesn't happen.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.910
And sometimes you
don't even notice.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.040
So a lot of our effort
recently has been

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.510
about targeting this problem.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.130
This is kind of the
number one problem

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.950
that we have is to allow us to
have really fast experiences

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.220
on mobile itself.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.010
When we do things across
Chrome, across APIs,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.470
across the platform,
CDNs, you name it,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.527
we need to come
together to really fix

00:14:06.527 --> 00:14:07.485
this problem for users.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.530
Now the good news
is, you can do it.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.512
You can provably do it.

00:14:14.512 --> 00:14:16.220
We're seeing a lot of
partners coming out

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.170
with these new progressive web
apps that are showing this off.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.240
So the "Washington
Post," they're

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.330
a news outlet over in the US.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.840
And they went off and built
a new progressive web app.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.160
And they focused a lot on this
exact issue, on performance.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.277
And so they focused
on initial page loads.

00:14:36.277 --> 00:14:37.360
And that was really great.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.250
And then they're really
proud to also focus on,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.980
once you've got
things loaded, they

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.460
have a nice rich
experience, lots of imagery.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.170
It's not like they're not doing
anything and kind of having

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.730
a bare bones experience.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.350
It's a great experience that
when you type on that article,

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.120
something's going to
load in 80 milliseconds.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.220
They do a lot with prefetching.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.320
They do a lot with service
worker caches, things

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.459
that we're going to
talk about later.

00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:03.250
They're able to deliver
this really, really

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.450
beautiful experience.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.730
And all of this technology
is available for you

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.359
to do the same thing.

00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:10.150
One of the cute little
things that they did

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.790
was if you go to their
articles now and check it out,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.980
they actually put
right into the article

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.440
how long it took to
render that article.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.480
They're really putting
it front and center,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.120
because I think that team is
just so proud of what they're

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.502
doing for performance.

00:15:23.502 --> 00:15:24.460
And users are noticing.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.210
So we need reliably
fast experiences,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.230
and we also need
them to be engaging.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.920
We need them to be really
fun and useful for users.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.490
And we need you, the developer,
to be able to reach that user

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.630
and for them to be
able to reach them.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.810
So the areas that we
think are most important

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.120
there are threefold.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.420
First up, we need to
give you the capability

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.120
to get your web experience
on the home screen.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.711
Again, we talked
about how loyal users,

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.210
they're the ones that want to
be able to add you to the home

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.040
screen so they can
come back to you easily

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.810
from wherever they are.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.410
So we had to give the
API, as a platform, to you

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.385
folks to be able to
get access to that.

00:16:15.385 --> 00:16:17.760
And that's been done with this
add to home screen feature

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.470
that you'll see.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.080
But then, in exchange
for that, you

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.030
need to deliver the
experiences that people

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.660
want to add to the home screen,
and that meet the expectations

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.670
they have when they
tap on something

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.002
that's on the home screen.

00:16:32.002 --> 00:16:33.710
The second thing we
need to be able to do

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:39.950
is allow you to develop a
truly immersive experience.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.410
So that means you
get the full screen.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.092
There's no browser Chrome
that's getting in the way,

00:16:46.092 --> 00:16:48.050
or anything that just
doesn't feel quite right.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.570
You get full access
to everything.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.330
You can customize theme
colors on the headers

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.980
and do whatever you want.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.800
So to the user, it just
feels like a fully immersive

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.790
experience.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.885
And then thirdly, we need
access to notifications.

00:17:03.885 --> 00:17:08.460
Now notifications have been
probably the biggest deal--

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.740
the biggest effect that we've
had with the world of mobile.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.349
You think about it, what's the
big difference between going

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:20.400
from my laptop at
home or at work,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.290
compared to what
happens now with mobile?

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.890
I've got this thing that's
with me at all times, 24/7.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.710
I sometimes have to remember
to charge it and get it out

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.650
of my sight at home
so it doesn't start

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.720
kind of running my life for me.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.070
But there's full access
available to every user,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.260
that you can then
choose to use to be

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.000
able to give them information
that makes sense for them.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.040
Now that doesn't
mean abusing this.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.600
But if you do it
right, it's going

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.380
to enable you to have a
really excellent up leveling

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.510
of your engagement.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.420
So here with push
notifications, just like Ben

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.840
said before, you can go through,
set something up, get a push

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.680
notification.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.740
Doesn't matter if the browser
is open or anything like that.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.190
It's going to come through
and get to your code

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.650
so you can show
something to the user

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.470
and then entice them back
into your experience.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.490
This is a huge deal.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.010
If you look at all of
our case studies, anyone

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.310
who uses push notifications,
you see the massive bump

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.356
that they get when
they use them.

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:26.260
We've got a whole session
on push notifications.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.810
We also want to make
sure that our users are

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.280
protected, as always.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.450
And so with
everything on the web,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.440
you'll see that there's a
permissions model behind it.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.220
And so when you think it's time
and you think it make sense

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.790
for push notifications
for the user,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.360
the user can then go in
and allow or disallow

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.430
what's going on.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.900
We also highly recommend that
you add notification settings.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.020
So it's not just a
blanket statement of,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.580
do I want push or not?

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.460
You have the ability
as a user to fine tune

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.670
really what I want
to get out of you.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.870
And when we see
people doing that,

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.450
people are more apt to stay
with push notifications

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.890
and not turn them off.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.950
So I really recommend
that you do that work.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.820
OK, let's take a look at what
an immersive experience actually

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.800
looks like and how it works.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.230
This example is from CNET.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.530
CNET is a technology site.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.230
And they went off,
one of their teams,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.250
and put this into production
recently, a separate PWA that

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.630
was just kind of exploring
what something on tech,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.420
with a few articles, could
be like as an immersive PWA

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.000
experience.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.790
And so let's say you went
to the URL at the top there,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.420
cnet.com/techtoday.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.160
Or maybe you did a
search for something,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.930
or maybe it comes from an email.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.260
Anyway, you get the
URL, you tap on that.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.950
You're now into this experience.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.140
Very rich, very immersive--

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.510
you see at the top
there's that zero, one.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.570
You can just flip through
these really nice articles

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:02.387
and experiences and then scroll
up and down and explore them.

00:20:02.387 --> 00:20:09.430
Now, when it's
appropriate, when you've

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.040
got a user that's been
to your site regularly

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.760
and the like, the browser will
say to you as a developer, hey,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.420
this might be a good
time to ask that user

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.364
if they want you to add your
experience to the home screen.

00:20:23.364 --> 00:20:25.530
What people are really doing
here is thinking about,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.830
when is the right time
to say that to the user?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.760
So that may not be as soon as
we say, hey, it's available.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.110
It may be waiting for
a particular action,

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.830
like when they've bought
something, maybe then say, hey,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.040
maybe now is a good time for
you to track what's going on.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.540
Sign up for push notifications.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.310
Add me to the home
screen or whatever.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.790
But here I go through,
I've got the standard UI.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.410
I tap on Add to Home Screen.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.270
It's now going to add
it in the background

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.680
and tell me along the bottom
there that it's been done.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.990
And now, the user can kind
of go along, still browsing,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.290
do their own thing.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.730
Or they can go into the
immersive experience.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.862
So let's say it's a month later.

00:21:10.862 --> 00:21:12.820
The user wants to go back
into that experience.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.530
And they go to
their home screen,

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.510
and they see that
the icon's there,

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.640
looks exactly the same
as their native app,

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.140
because it is the same thing.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.880
They type on the app.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.100
It then launches up.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.020
You have full access
to this experience,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.340
have a splash screen.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.130
So while you're quickly loading
and getting things ready,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.460
you can theme things that
make sense for your brand.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.330
And then you get right
into the experience.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.720
And what's the difference here?

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.600
The difference is there's
no URL bar at the top.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.600
There's no notion of the fact
that this is using a browser

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.420
or using web
technologies at all.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.720
And that's by design.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.380
The user may have forgot where
they did the Add to Home Screen

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:52.680
from.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.346
They don't know.

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:54.160
They don't care.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.100
They just want to get
in there and start

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.790
using your experience.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:04.880
Now, maybe they're going to the
task switcher at the bottom.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.630
And then, again, the
representation that they get

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:14.030
is one where it just feels
like any old application.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.740
It's just like a
native app to them,

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.865
and that's the whole point.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:25.846
So, reliable, fast, and engaging
applications, that's the key.

00:22:25.846 --> 00:22:26.970
How do we actually do this?

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.772
What's the technology
that's behind all of this?

00:22:30.772 --> 00:22:32.480
It's what we talked
about in the keynote.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.070
It's that service
worker technology.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.540
And this is the fix
that we had to put in.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.730
Again, when you're
connected to that dial up

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.652
and you've connected
your home to the web,

00:22:44.652 --> 00:22:46.360
the browser's talking
to this web server,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.910
and it's reliant on that
web server to do anything.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.470
That's where it
needs to go to get

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.050
any of its logic
or its information.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.780
And as soon as somebody
goes offline, you're toast.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.710
You can't do anything
for the user.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:05.390
So we had to create a service
worker, this technology that

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.630
allows you to build a proxy,
that's just JavaScript, that's

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.590
just a small piece of code
that you can install down

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.410
for the user.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.170
So user comes to your site.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.000
You download this piece of code.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.480
And now you have full
control, full access

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.400
to watch what's going on.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.240
So requests start coming in
from Flipkart, this experience.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.610
And you can go through
and proxy that,

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.340
and say you know what, I've
got all of this information.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.100
I've got the Chrome for
the actual app itself.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.290
I'm going to grab
it from the cache,

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.960
or I'm going to
go and run a race.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.560
I'm going to go to the
cache and return some data.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.630
And then I'm going to go
to the website at the end.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.420
And when new data
comes back from that,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.200
I'll then update my application.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.520
You can do whatever you want.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.290
You have full
access and control.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.700
Now, this is the base for a
lot of the different technology

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.380
that we're adding to
the web these days,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.170
including push notifications.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.940
So now, your
website, example.com,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.940
sends a push message out.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.890
It's going to end up coming over
to your little piece of code.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.370
That just says, OK, here's
the event that's coming in.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.800
You then get to do whatever
you want with that event,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.320
probably ending up with
showing an actual notification

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.820
for the user.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.920
You don't have to worry
about the lifecycle.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.544
You don't have to
worry about was there

00:24:29.544 --> 00:24:32.240
a service worker in memory,
or any of that stuff.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.910
Doesn't matter if the
browser was there or not.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.850
The whole operating system
will make sure that this works

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.070
and send you the
correct message.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:47.090
Now, we talked about
Alibaba in the keynote,

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.780
and the work that they've been
doing in the world of commerce,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.020
the increase in conversions
that they were getting,

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.160
and the fact that, I
don't know if you noticed,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.700
where he talked about
the usage increase

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.300
across iOS and Android.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.070
And to me it's
really interesting

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.160
that they got this
bump on Android,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.530
that has service workers, but
they also got a bump on iOS.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.570
But iOS doesn't support
service workers.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.130
So what happened?

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:19.940
Why did they get a
bump in their usage?

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.360
The reason is, the key part
of progressive web apps

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.800
is the progressive part.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.830
They went in and took
care of their experience.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.860
With Safari, it may not
have service workers today,

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.980
but it has a lot of support for
now the latest specs on the web

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.240
components side.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.420
It's got a lot of support for
doing things performantly.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.420
And so by taking the care
and just starting there,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.670
starting with the web
standards and the fundamentals

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.630
and then progressively
adding in service worker

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.590
support and extra
features, enabled

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.500
them to make things better for
all of their users, not just

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.479
for users that happen to be
on the latest and greatest.

00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:55.520
This is really important.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.450
We really care about
this at Google.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.020
We're not just focused
about building things

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.882
for Chrome users.

00:26:02.882 --> 00:26:04.340
Another thing that
they have access

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.130
to in the world of
commerce is really

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.540
cleaning up transactions.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.780
So a key issue on
the web is signing up

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.640
or signing into a website.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.310
We've all seen those forms that
are really ugly to fill out

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.240
and the like.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.270
And we have new standards
with Credential Manager APIs

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.900
and the like on sign
up and payments,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.500
on the payment side, where now
Alibaba can take all of this

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.340
and just keep streamlining
all of the work to just really

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.960
enable users to get in and
out and make their purchases.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.480
So how do you
actually get started?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.360
The basis of everything is
to make sure that you've

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.330
secured your web experience.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.120
So this is the
key to everything.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.140
You need to make sure that
you're getting on HTTPS.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.700
The green lock is there.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.590
The user knows it's secure.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.300
We're moving, as a web platform,
all of the key capabilities

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.120
to be within a secure origin.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.830
As we entrust you,
the developers,

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.780
with more native
capabilities, we

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.960
need to make sure that it's
getting access to your code

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.770
and the user isn't getting
fished into some other area

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.830
and bad things are happening.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.450
So step one, if you
haven't done it,

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:25.980
is you need to immediately
get onto HTTPS.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.740
From there you've got
a few different parts.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.189
We've now worked with
a bunch of partners,

00:27:31.189 --> 00:27:32.730
and there are
different ways that you

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.260
can go about actually getting
your experience up and running.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.130
And we understand that people
work in their companies, work

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.010
in their businesses.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.020
They can't all just
stop what they're doing

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.529
and just go off and build
a brand-new experience.

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:46.945
We need to have
different tactics.

00:27:46.945 --> 00:27:50.100
And we've seen three
patterns really show through.

00:27:52.605 --> 00:27:54.730
We're going to talk about
going from the ground up,

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.290
just doing a full rewrite.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.100
This is the dream.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.870
This is the dream
for me as an engineer

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.664
to have full greenfield
to go build things.

00:28:02.664 --> 00:28:03.330
So that's ideal.

00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:08.450
You may not be able to do that.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.820
And so another option is
to do a simple version

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.720
of what you're building.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.490
And we'll talk
about that approach.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.220
And then finally you
can just go and take

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.200
one API from the PWA landscape
and just go deep on that API

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.670
and start building from there.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.770
Let's take a look at one of the
examples of going ground up.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:34.180
This is a Nigerian e-commerce
company called Konga.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.110
And a lot of their customers
are on 2G connections.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.530
They really care about
connectivity and delivering

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.660
fast experiences.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.460
And so they took
one of their teams

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.190
that had actually native
developers, as well as web

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.620
developers, and they
built from scratch

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.910
a new checkout flow using
all of the new capabilities.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.860
And it's really cool
how even like right now

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.779
it's using this phone support.

00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:02.320
They go through and make sure
that even when they're offline,

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.270
you can still check out, and
with the last option being,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.890
we're really sorry we
can't do anything online.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.920
But hey, just call us
and our customer support

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.360
will get this through.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.890
So they've really
thought end to end

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.290
about the entire experience.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.390
So they did this from scratch.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.830
They pushed it out there.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.840
And they were really
surprised to see

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.630
that the amount of data
that they were using

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:29.080
was dramatically less than
their pretty lightweight Android

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.940
application.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.910
So they're able to get much
better performance out of this.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.170
In areas where data costs a lot
of money, this was a big deal.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.190
This was a big side
effect for them.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.804
And then they also
measure something

00:29:43.804 --> 00:29:45.220
that was really
interesting to me,

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.480
which was the amount
of time, amount of data

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.400
to get a transaction.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.460
And they found that once
again, through that flow,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.940
they could drop 82% of that
data out of that transaction.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.000
This is a massive
deal for folks working

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.180
in these types of environments.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.000
Another e-commerce
company, Flipkart,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.040
they went through and did a PWA.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.560
They were one of the earliest
groups that did this.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.320
Another focus for them
was, in India, they

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.440
kept running into the issue of
having to get APK size really,

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.260
really small.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.480
And so if you compare their
native application, which

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.240
is the Flipkart one there
to the Flipkart Lite

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.840
application, which is a
PWA, you see it's not just

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.040
like a little bit less.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.820
It's over 300 times smaller.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.200
So they're able to get
people into that application

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.280
in no time.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.190
You're talking about
kilobytes, not megabytes.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.642
This was a massive
deal for their users

00:30:42.642 --> 00:30:43.600
and for their business.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.630
So if you can, doing
a ground up approach

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.030
is going to get you a
fantastic experience.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.560
Let's take a look
at a simple version.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.770
Air Berlin, in the
travel industry,

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.550
they didn't have time to do the
full ground up rewrite first.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.100
So they thought about the
different user journeys

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.610
that they have.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.400
And one of them that's
really important

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.390
that they were failing was
not picking your flight

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.460
and purchasing your flight or
any of that side of things,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.290
but actually after that.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.380
And what's the
experience like where

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.570
you show up at the
airport and you just

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.960
want to get access to your
itinerary, your boarding pass,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.850
all of your information?

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.770
And so they focused
on that piece.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.730
They flushed out
that feature set.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.950
And they built this
little PWA experience

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.740
that would guarantee
you, the customer,

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.320
to be able to get access
to all of that information

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.860
and make sure that it works
offline, because we've all been

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.440
to airports where the
Wi-Fi is a little bit shaky

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.680
and the cell networks
aren't working that great.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.850
So they put through all of this
work, and they found at the end

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.170
that the load time was
less than a second.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:59.370
So they're able to bring this
really niche use case that

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.070
was really vital for
their users and deliver

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.920
that outside of the bounds
of their main desktop web

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.342
application and the like.

00:32:06.342 --> 00:32:07.800
They're able to
just kind of really

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.350
focus in and do a
great job with that.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.140
OK, the final approach is
taking one part of the API,

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.580
or one API from
the myriad of APIs

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.960
that we have in the world
of progressive web apps.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.830
So a great example of that
is weather.com, where again,

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.700
what was really important
to them was re-engagement.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.482
If you think about a
site like weather.com,

00:32:35.482 --> 00:32:38.910
it may not be the kind of site
that everyone is refreshing

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.080
every hour.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.040
What's the weather now?

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.300
How's it changed?

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.155
It's not that kind
of experience.

00:32:45.155 --> 00:32:46.780
So instead, they
wanted to think about,

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.820
how do I reach those users?

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.250
How do I reach them to tell
them it's going to rain

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.980
or there's a dramatic
difference in the weather?

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.860
Well the best way to do that
is through push notifications.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.960
They were used to that
in the native world,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.780
but a lot of users don't need
to have something on the home

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.870
screen or fully native
just to know a little bit

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.700
about what's going
on with that weather.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.560
So what they did was they went
big on push, and push only,

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.850
and they launched it to over
60-plus languages globally.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.700
And when they did that, they
were able in just a few months,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.220
just three months, get over a
million people using those push

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.620
notifications.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.800
So you think about their
business and the amount

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.270
of re-engagement
you get when you

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.150
have a million people in there
being notified when something's

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.140
changing.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.360
That's a massive
leap in the curve

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.972
of user engagement for them.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.841
So, you've got a
menu of choices.

00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:47.340
You need to really think about
what makes for you, depending

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.100
on the company that
you're at, the legacy code

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.510
base that you may have.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.127
Are you ready and
primed for a rewrite

00:33:54.127 --> 00:33:55.210
to do something different?

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.418
There's a lot of different
things that are out there.

00:33:57.418 --> 00:34:01.120
And we'd love to hear from
you, over in the web booth,

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.580
and after talks and the like,
to have us help in any way

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:09.870
on what the right choice is
and what makes sense for you.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.920
We also want to guide
you in other ways.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.010
Ben talked about how
we've got a new developer

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:21.230
side out there that's targeted
towards this region, which

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.560
is really exciting.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.560
We've got a lot
of our web content

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.300
up there available to you.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.969
But we also want to
do more than that.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.840
We want to have tools that kind
of walk you through the path.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.210
The web is a really
big platform.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.159
You can do so much
with it, and it

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:40.340
can be a little bit daunting
to think about, well

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.429
what do I do next?

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:45.389
How do I take on this
big, big challenge?

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.420
And so we started
to think about,

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.880
what can we do to
help web developers?

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.760
And we came up with this tool
that we called Lighthouse

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.380
because it's trying to kind
of light the way for you.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.410
And so the vision for this is
that you're running this all

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.550
the time on your application.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.120
And it's giving you a score
and giving you information

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.300
on what's working and
what isn't working.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.501
So it's going to hold you
accountable to your performance

00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:13.250
to make sure that
you're doing a great job

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.875
with that performance, and it's
going to give you hints on what

00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:19.060
to do to make things faster.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.190
This started off with
a lot of information

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.780
on the performant side.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.160
But, this is an
open source project,

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.530
and we've been building more and
more new rules into the system.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.912
And so there's this whole notion
that we call "do better web"

00:35:32.912 --> 00:35:35.120
that's in there that's just
watching your application

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.910
and it's telling you things.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.790
In the world of AI
and machine learning,

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.730
we should be able to go
in, look at our code bases,

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.650
start to see patterns,
and start telling you

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.100
as developers what are things
that you should notice.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.550
And so I really recommend that
you take a look at Lighthouse.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.980
And we have a whole
talk today that's

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.482
all about tools,
including Lighthouse.

00:35:56.482 --> 00:35:58.815
This is going to be able to
walk you through the process

00:35:58.815 --> 00:36:02.320
and kind of, hopefully, hold
your hand a little bit as we

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.030
go along with that,
and then linking

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.220
into all of the
rich documentation

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.670
that we have available.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:13.620
So it's been kind of a wild
ride for us over the last year.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.380
I'd say we've got the technology
out there at the bleeding

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.050
edge a couple of years ago.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.410
But then over the last year,
the whole browser community

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.970
has really come
together and started

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.720
getting the capabilities across
lots of different browsers.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.630
The web frameworks communities
have really come together.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:36.060
It's a big effort for us to
be able to build for mobile.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.830
There's totally
different constraints

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.559
that we have to be aware of.

00:36:39.559 --> 00:36:42.100
And so that's why you see that
Angular is creating an Angular

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.580
2, because you need
to think differently

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.290
when you build for mobile.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.240
And we see similar
things happening

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.040
in the world of React.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.844
We have a framework
called Polymer

00:36:51.844 --> 00:36:53.760
that sits within the
Chrome team that's really

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.860
trying to push the boundaries
and be kind of like the Tesla

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.090
for what it means to
take web standards

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.580
and build something
really quickly on mobile.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.190
So the framework communities
are coming together.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.100
And now it's up to us as
just general web developers

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.940
to come together to deliver this
functionality for our users.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.980
So if there's one thing I ask
and that you take away from

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.180
is, really appreciate you
coming here to listen,

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.800
to hear what we have to say.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.680
This is a big revolution
for us on the web,

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.770
and there's a lot of work for us
to make this just really killer

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.239
on mobile.

00:37:29.239 --> 00:37:31.280
And we think that we've
got the capabilities that

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.580
allow you to help us
cause an extinction

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.970
to the whole dinosaur race,
so to speak, and get rid

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.540
of those offline dinosaurs.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.720
With that, [CHINESE], thank you.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.165
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:56.412 --> 00:38:00.000
SPEAKER 2: Thanks, Steven,
for the great keynote.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:10.970
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:31.380
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.770
SPEAKER 3: OK, let me
translate the questions.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.970
So the audience is asking,
she saw all these examples

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.080
about e-commerce.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.270
She was wondering
whether there are

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:50.580
more examples around
small games and et cetera.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.882
SPEAKER 1: Right, got it.

00:38:51.882 --> 00:38:53.340
OK great, thank
you, good question.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:57.420
So games is an
interesting venue for us.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.590
We're seeing that there's a
lot of new web games being

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.500
created and being
put into other areas

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.410
where things work on the web.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.400
So recently, for
example, Facebook just

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.140
announced gaming
on their platform,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.364
and it uses web as
its core technology.

00:39:13.364 --> 00:39:15.030
And so if you think
back to the old days

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.100
of Flash games and
the like, there

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.770
was a real community of
doing games on the web.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.930
And we're starting to
see that more and more.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.760
And with a lot of
the key capabilities

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.176
that we're talking
about here, you

00:39:25.176 --> 00:39:26.850
need your game to work offline.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.670
You know, all of these
things can very much

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.630
be used in the world of games.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.810
And so we're seeing
a large push.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.750
The initial push was
kind of publishing,

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:37.710
and then e-commerce.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.112
And then the newest
thing, these days,

00:39:40.112 --> 00:39:41.695
is around the kind
of gaming vertical.

00:39:48.174 --> 00:39:50.080
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.130
I saw the cute
dinosaur on your mic.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:58.730
So a lot of your technology you
talk about, and in this country

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:03.820
we have some network
issues such as GFW.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.780
And if I want to
use my next service

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:15.560
to use that push service, then
there will be a problem here.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.740
If there is some
network issue, what

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:25.820
will we do about a web
push, especially in China?

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.980
Yes, thank you.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.790
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.000
Great, great question.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.200
So the question is,
different regions have

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.340
very different constraints.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.940
They have users using
different browsers.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.650
They have the constraints that
you mentioned with networking

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.549
issues and the like.

00:40:40.549 --> 00:40:42.590
And so what we're trying
to do as a web community

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.960
there is to work
really closely with all

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.700
of the different browser vendors
and CDN providers and everyone

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.700
we can to be able to
deliver these capabilities.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.750
So the whole reason that Web
Push exists the way it does

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.570
is that it's an open standard
that anyone can implement.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.360
So it's not a Google push
or anything like that.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.790
It's fully open.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.910
And so what we're finding,
especially as of late,

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.620
a lot of the browser
vendors are really

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.807
coming together to tackle
these kind of problems.

00:41:12.807 --> 00:41:14.390
But one of the reasons
that we're here

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.460
is to learn from
you folks on what

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.410
are the things that
aren't working here

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.645
and what you need from us.

00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:20.520
That's a great point.

00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:27.690
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:34.050
I'm an Android
application developer.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:40.173
If I want to replace some
of my function with web,

00:41:40.173 --> 00:41:43.340
can I benefit from a PWA?

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.720
If I can, how?

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.470
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:53.190
So Android developer thinking
about how does the PWA fit in.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.580
So I think there's always a
role for native development.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.710
That's not going away anywhere.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.070
What PWA really is about
is up leveling the web

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.586
to take on the most
important capabilities.

00:42:04.586 --> 00:42:06.210
And so what we're
finding more and more

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:11.970
is that to reach these users,
instead of just trying to block

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.550
and force them to
install your application,

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.020
depending on what
you're building,

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.550
it actually seems
to make more sense

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.910
to have something for them that
they can actually start using.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:23.820
So depending on what you're
building, you can think about,

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.860
how much could you do
on the web there now

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.920
that we've kind of up
leveled, and what makes sense?

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.660
And then if there
are some capabilities

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.461
that the web doesn't have yet,
you've got a path onto native.

00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:36.210
And we're working on
getting more and more

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.490
of these paths set up for you.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.680
But we think time
and time again,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.560
across a lot of the
verticals, we actually

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.160
can give you what you need
for a lot of use cases

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.000
just using the web.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:43:02.070
I want to know, as a user, how
can I get into the PW web set,

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:10.890
and send them, such as
throughout the search all

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:15.190
the web set, and so on?

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.810
Yeah.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:16.560
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.760
So I think the question is, as a
user, how do I find these PWAs?

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.580
How do I actually use
them and the like?

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.400
One of the really nice
things about PWAs,

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.574
for a long time we
kept hearing about,

00:43:28.574 --> 00:43:29.740
you've got these app stores.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.200
Where's the web app store?

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.296
And Chrome came out with the
Chrome Web Store and the like.

00:43:35.296 --> 00:43:37.170
And we have some of
these sites, like there's

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:40.410
a site called pwa.rocks.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.020
That's a catalog,
more for developers,

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.380
for us to get inspiration
on different PWAs.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.930
But the real beauty
about PWAs is

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.200
you don't need to go to
a store to download them.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.620
And you can go ahead and
use search or get access

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.260
through WeChat and the
like through a link,

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.930
and you get access to
this rich application.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:05.070
And so once you have this,
all through the power of URLs,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.760
you can use anything that you
want to get your message out

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.520
to users to get
them to then start

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.790
getting real benefit and value
from using your application.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.130
And then at the very
end, the loyal users

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.160
will want to do
Add to Home Screen.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.640
But you don't have to ask all
of your user base to think, OK,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.890
do you want the app on day one?

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.360
You can get, again,
progressively

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.060
allow that to unfold for them.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:47.110
AUDIENCE: I know that Chrome
has much APIs to support PWA.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:53.300
But I want to know if
users use either browsers

00:44:53.300 --> 00:45:01.420
or other operating systems,
my PWA apps can work perfectly

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.340
on these other platforms.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.790
SPEAKER 1: Great,
great question.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.260
So once again, users use
lots of different browsers,

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.690
lots of different platforms.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.180
Chrome has a lot of
these great PWA APIs,

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.740
but not every browser does.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.200
So the good news there
is that Firefox, Opera,

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.500
a lot of these folks are
implementing, and have

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.340
implemented--

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.110
Microsoft Edge and the like--

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.220
a lot of these APIs.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.710
So the APIs are coming quickly.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.400
But again, the
whole point of PWA

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.860
is that progressive
where, as the user gets

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.170
more capabilities,
you can then do

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.240
something new with that user.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.590
And if you think about a world
where you have chat interfaces

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:51.310
and Google Home Voice
interfaces, and you separate

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.970
all of the different pieces
of what it takes to actually

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.160
interact with something,
it's a really nice way

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.950
to develop services
and applications,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.200
because now with
that Voice UI, you

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.480
may want to show something
that you can actually

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.130
pick in a UI that's visual, and
the web is perfect for that.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.900
And so it's a different
way of thinking.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.090
You can go responsive.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.530
You can go across
desktop, mobile.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:18.040
As a capability is available,
you just then get to use it.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.280
And again, you don't have to
make this binary choice of yes

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.280
or no.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.310
And the good news
from our side is just,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.650
we've been really excited
with how quickly the browser

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:30.150
community is working
on these features.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.450
The other side of it is,
you still have access

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:37.520
through other means, like
Cordova and the like,

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.790
to be able to bridge into native
from your web technology too.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.680
So if there's that one API
that you really need to use

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.460
and you want to get it in the
store, you can take your app,

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.820
you can use Cordova
and get access to that

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.690
and put it in a store.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.745
So you have lots of
different escape hatches.

00:47:00.799 --> 00:47:03.340
SPEAKER 3: I think this will be
the last question, because we

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.990
need to leave like--

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.493
or it's already.

00:47:07.493 --> 00:47:10.890
SPEAKER 2: I think we can
actually have two more.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.313
SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
OK, I'll start from--

00:47:15.313 --> 00:47:16.220
[CHINESE]

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.070
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.910
I have question about,
is there some possibility

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:32.530
in the future that the PWA
special feature like pushing

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.620
future can run in iOS device?

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:42.430
And is there Google can
talk about this with Apple

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.510
in future?

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:45.100
Thank you.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.183
SPEAKER 1: Yes, thank you.

00:47:46.183 --> 00:47:50.320
So I obviously can't
speak for Apple.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:55.930
We would love to have PWAs
running in Safari and iOS.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:58.360
The good news again
recently is, if you

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.760
look at what Apple
is coming out with,

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.550
the recent support for
different specs and web

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.980
components and the like, we
feel really good at the progress

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.620
that they're making towards
all of the key things that

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.480
go into progressive web app.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.917
And so we're really hopeful.

00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:16.750
We've got actually
really good relationships

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.420
with the Safari team itself.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.220
They tend to be fairly
secretive and the like,

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.650
and we respect that.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.720
But we're seeing things
going in the right direction.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.479
So we think that's
going to come on iOS.

00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:32.770
But once again, we want to
build other tools that allow

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.680
you to still get on to iOS.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.200
So one being the
progressive nature--

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.750
you can build a great experience
and you see big uptake.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.580
And the other being
PhoneGappy type

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.760
solutions to enable yourself
to take that technology

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.620
and get it into a native app.

00:48:51.239 --> 00:48:53.280
SPEAKER 2: OK, so this
will be the last question.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.946
And before that, I
would ask [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:54.946 --> 00:48:58.090
to remind lunch is served
on the fourth floor.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.320
And the afternoon sessions
is going to start at 12:30.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.470
So we're going to have a
whole lot more excellent talks

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.270
and deep dive into afternoon.

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:07.710
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:23.790
OK, last question.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:27.180
AUDIENCE: Hi, I've
got one question.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.300
For native apps,
we know native apps

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:35.500
can interact with other native
apps we intend or deep link.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:42.660
So does PWA support the
interact with other native apps

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.164
or PWA apps?

00:49:45.164 --> 00:49:47.080
SPEAKER 1: Great, that's
a fantastic question.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.120
So the question was, on
Android, for example,

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.210
you have intents and
a way for native apps

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.050
to talk to each other.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:57.970
How does that work
in the world of PWAs?

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.920
So when you install
a PWA in Android,

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.810
you actually are
installing an APK itself.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:07.030
And so you are able to interact.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.970
And we're doing a lot of work
right now on setting things

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.240
up so you can interact really
nicely between the two.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.100
If you take a look,
we just talked

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.780
about a new API
called the Web Share

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.380
API that allows you to
do sharing, rich sharing,

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.620
from within the worlds of PWAs.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:27.370
And so as you imagine this world
with these PWAs as just APKs,

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.500
and that you could set
up intents and the like,

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.080
the whole power of
the web is the fact

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.630
that you can compose
things with mashups

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.820
and tie things
together with URLs.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.950
And so we're going to be
putting a lot of effort

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.050
in to make that
really work well,

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:45.586
both between PWAs and also PWAs
connected with native apps.

00:50:45.586 --> 00:50:47.085
And we're really
excited about that.

00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:48.512
Thank you.

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.470
So again, we've run out
of time now, but thanks

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:52.750
so much for spending
time with us.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.790
And I can't wait to see
what you guys develop.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.540
