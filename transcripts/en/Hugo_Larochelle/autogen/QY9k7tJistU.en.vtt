simple expression that's very general so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
simple expression that's very general so
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150

my parameter of interest of the log
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.490
my parameter of interest of the log
factors so over all the factors I'm

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
factors so over all the factors I'm
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.060
factors so over all the factors I'm
taking the sum of the partial live of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
taking the sum of the partial live of

the each log factor with respect to my
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920
the each log factor with respect to my
parameter and I'm subtracting to that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
parameter and I'm subtracting to that
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.420

the expectation over the what could be

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
the expectation over the what could be
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.990
the expectation over the what could be
the true label why I did this is the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
the true label why I did this is the
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.210
the true label why I did this is the

again the sum of the partial derivative

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
again the sum of the partial derivative
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.830
again the sum of the partial derivative
of the log factors so here we have a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
of the log factors so here we have a
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.160
of the log factors so here we have a
difference between what a grain of what

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
difference between what a grain of what
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.530
difference between what a grain of what
is based on what is observed minus the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.570
gradient based on what the modeled
thinks its conditioned on the input but

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580
thinks its conditioned on the input but
 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.760
thinks its conditioned on the input but
we're doing an expectation over what the

we're doing an expectation over what the
 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.240
we're doing an expectation over what the
model thinks is most likely and if you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250

think about this expression what it's

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660

factors will only involved maybe a pair

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020
factors will only involved maybe a pair
 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.050

or triplet or just a subset of the Y's

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060
or triplet or just a subset of the Y's
 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.510
or triplet or just a subset of the Y's
then usually this expectation reduces to

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520
then usually this expectation reduces to
 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550
then usually this expectation reduces to
an expectation over just a subset of the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560
an expectation over just a subset of the
 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.909
