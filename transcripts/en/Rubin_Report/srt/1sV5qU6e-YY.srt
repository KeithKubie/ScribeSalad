1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,910
[inaudible] all right,

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:09,800
let's talk about systemic racism or
at least the idea of systemic racism.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,810
So I think you've seen the video of me
about two or two and a half years ago

4
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:17,420
with Larry elder and I
brought up systemic racism.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,560
Larry elder proceeded to commit
a hate crime on me, a white man.

6
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:26,561
He beat me senseless with statistics
and I came to a fight not ready to fight

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,070
basically. And that was definitely
one of my red pillow moments,

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,760
so to speak. I was not prepared.
I heard new information.

9
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:39,440
I did research after that.
Subsequently,

10
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:43,320
I've had many people on this
show and many conversations, uh,

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,200
that have led me to two more of
Larry's original premise. Um,

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,280
so I guess first when you,
when you saw that moment, uh,

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,740
was that the first time you'd ever
seen me do anything? Cause that's,

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,440
a lot of people tell me and I'm like,
oh, I don't think it was the first time.

15
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,274
But I think,
yeah,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,320
I mean I don't envy anyone who is
debating Larry elder on anything.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
He's,
he's pretty devastating.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,860
It must've been kind of refreshing though
when you saw this moment where he laid

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,460
it out and yeah. You know there was no
counter cause there is no counter. Right?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,490
Well yeah he,
he what he did with you there is he,

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,790
he went through each specific venue
in which supposedly there is this big

22
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:28,001
systemic racism problem where the system
is rigged in such a way that it doesn't

23
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:32,960
require any individual in the system
to be racist in order for the system to

24
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:37,850
spit out racist outcomes. That's
essentially the idea of systemic racism.

25
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:41,270
So he went, he went with you
through, he said just name,

26
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:46,271
name a place in society where you think
systemic racism exists and he just di Ba

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,950
ba basically destroyed each one
with the specifics of, of the case.

28
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:56,570
And I'm not going to do a better job than
he did there and then he's capable of

29
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:56,781
doing.

30
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:01,781
But there's a bigger picture way to
test this systemic racism hypothesis,

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,830
which is to take two
populations where it's,

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,740
it's a very messy crude
science experiment.

33
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,330
But to take two populations where you're
holding systemic racism, constant,

34
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,830
namely black Americans like
myself and black immigrants,

35
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:22,310
especially black immigrants from
the West indies and their children.

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,130
So we're talking about immigrants
from Jamaica, Barbados,

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,240
other places in the West indies
and specifically their children.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,650
They're American born children.

39
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,640
So these are people you could
not tell apart from black.

40
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:37,790
Like you couldn't tell if I didn't
tell you that I wasn't the child of a

41
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:42,200
Jamaican immigrant or something.
Right. And you find that the,

42
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,640
the thing about these is that these two
populations differ in many ways. Some,

43
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:50,270
some, some ways are very hard to
quantify, but they differ culturally.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,490
They differ for all kinds of reasons.
Um,

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,860
because partially because the kind of
immigrant who gets out of a Jamaica

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,690
differs systematically is going to
be disproportionately intelligent,

47
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,070
disproportionately hardworking,

48
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,060
whatever the traits are that get
you from Jamaica to New York.

49
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Say That's a cluster of attributes
that that makes that population differ.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
But there's,
there's one thing that is not different,

51
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:20,641
which is they're subjected to whatever
level of systemic racism exists.

52
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,590
So t Thomas soul has done good work on it.

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,720
Back in the 70s, he showed that, uh,

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,070
second generation west Indian west
Indians living in the same city as black

55
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,270
Americans were earning 58%
more, right? So they're,

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
they're both being treated to whatever
degree badly by white people there.

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,190
Whatever this,
whatever system you want,

58
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:48,920
I suppose is holding by people back is
equally affecting both of them. Uh, the,

59
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:53,920
the Columbia. So sociologist van
Tran has a great essay in which,

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,580
uh, um, the, this, this
difference is brought out.

61
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,010
You find neighborhoods of,

62
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,810
of black Americans right next
to neighborhoods of black
west Indians in New York,

63
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,980
they're equally segregated from white
people. So it gets rid of, you know, the,

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,940
the idea that being
segregated by a seller,

65
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,020
living around people who only
look like you is inherently a, um,

66
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,470
a disadvantage.
Um,

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,570
it gets around the policing issue because
these populations are being police.

68
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,030
The police can't tell the
difference between a second
generation west Indian end

69
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,403
and a black person.

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,410
It gets around whatever level of
systemic racism is or isn't in,

71
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:39,601
in the pipeline with regard to schools
and you find wildly different outcomes.

72
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,090
You find, you know, rate
of high school graduation,

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,040
much higher for Black West Indians,
uh, rate of enrollment in college,

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,610
much higher rate of
professional occupation,

75
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,790
much higher crime,
lower right.

76
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,870
So this suggests to me that there are,
that,

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,860
that the role of systemic racism
tool to whatever degree it exists is,

78
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,890
is minimal at this point.
Uh,

79
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:10,891
and there's a whole narrative built
around the idea that this is the primary

80
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,820
obstacle facing black people.
And it's worth noting, I don't,

81
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,290
I don't think most black people actually
believe this because I mean there are

82
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,220
various poles to site here, but
there's, there's one from Pew that,

83
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,290
that asked black people without
s without college educations has,

84
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,280
has race. How has your race held you
back at all in life? 60% said no.

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,810
It's a recent pew poll.
Another Gallup poll asked his bias,

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
the main issue facing you
in, in, in jobs and housing.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,120
60% again said no. The
A, a Harvard sociologist,

88
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,900
Ethan Foss has done extensive polling
of the black community and found that

89
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,740
disconnected black youth,
which are, you know,

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,590
black youth without who aren't in
schools and don't have the jobs.

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,580
The people on the lowest rung of society
may something something around 30% of

92
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,340
them think the system is
rigged and 70% don't. So what,

93
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:08,510
what we're getting is we're getting the
voices of black people who believe the

94
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:12,590
systemic racism narrative promoted to the,

95
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:17,040
to the most powerful media
positions in our country.

96
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,390
So we're getting the impression that
this is a uniform view and it's not

97
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,930
right. So this is sort of
the Jesse Jackson's Al Sharp.

98
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,130
They get moved up because they're
given sort of simple answers. Right.

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,920
So I guess it, it hearkens the question
then I can ask this either way.

100
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,630
What is it that the west Indian
immigrants are doing right?

101
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,830
Or what is it that the other
folks are doing wrong? Yeah,

102
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,490
I mean you can answer that in either
direction you want to go first.

103
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,090
Well,
partly I,

104
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,050
part of it is just immigration selection
factors that I mentioned. Right? So the,

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,480
the kind of Jamaican or Barbadian who
makes it off the island to New York did

106
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,420
likely to be disproportionately
hardworking, disproportional,

107
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,390
disproportionately x for
whatever x factor is.

108
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:07,391
And so in that sense the direct
comparison can be misleading,

109
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,560
but it just analyzing why
these two populations differ.

110
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:17,270
You Find West Indian immigrants, uh, more
likely to come from a two parent home.

111
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,000
Um, you know, more likely to have,

112
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:25,001
have had a more classically
socially conservative upbringing,

113
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:29,360
which is, you know, you don't talk back to
your parents. Parents are rather strict.

114
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,420
There are downsides of course
to that style of parenting.

115
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,740
But um,

116
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,340
basically what I'm saying is that there
are cultural factors that are important

117
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:44,410
that differ between these two groups.
Right? And you find the, there,

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,220
there are many,
I mean this is,

119
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,490
this is where the conversation for many
people gets especially uncomfortable,

120
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,280
right?
It's the idea that every culture,

121
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:56,300
every subculture is identical in the
behave behavioral patterns that are

122
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,450
inculcated and wherever there is some,

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,330
wherever there is a
disparity in some outcome,

124
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,070
it's not possible that culture accounts
for some or most of of that disparity,

125
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,540
which I think is very silly idea.

126
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, it's completely nonsensical.
Yeah. Cultures are different.

127
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,740
Different people and different groups
put different emphasis on certain things.

128
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:17,830
So I'm a little more on families
and put more on education,

129
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,710
so but more on sports or whatever
the hell, whatever the hell it is.

130
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,980
So when you hear Larry elder
make the argument, you know,

131
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:29,890
something around until 1972 the
black family had a higher rate of,

132
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:34,340
of staying in marriages and then he
lays out the reasons that he believes

133
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,050
policies of the Democrats
destroyed all that.

134
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,200
That that obviously resonates
with you. Right? Because you're,

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,840
you're giving me some piece of this.

136
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:46,841
Both answers I think resonate or went
back to family rates of marriage and some

137
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,990
sort of conservative ideals. Right?
Well, yeah. I mean that's a very complex,

138
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,780
people hate when you talk with,
when anyone talks about this about family,

139
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,160
people just absolutely hate it.
It is a fact

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,640
that black,
the,

141
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:02,641
the rate of two parent homes and marriages
was pretty similar to the white rate

142
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,750
until the 60s. Um, it is, it is a,

143
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,640
it's a matter of scholarly dispute as to
what was the cause I think it's certain

144
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:15,150
at this point there was no one cause
welfare state may have had something to do

145
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:19,920
with it, but I think it may have just
been changing norms in the culture.

146
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,750
What, cause we're seeing the
same thing happen in, in,

147
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:26,450
in the white working class as
well now with the decline of,

148
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,710
of two parent homes to
a lesser extent than,

149
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,520
than has happened in the
black community. Um, yeah.

150
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:38,440
So, so I guess what, yeah, so I mean
we could talk about some of the,

151
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,530
the most important behavioral patterns
that are different between a black

152
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:49,330
families and white families and
Asian families. Um, I mean there,

153
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,630
there are some statistics that I,
I just,

154
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,620
I don't see any way in which this could
possibly be explained by systemic racism.

155
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,453
For example,

156
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,300
one is that if you ask 13 year olds if
they've had their first sexual experience

157
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,820
yet,
you get 9% of of white saying yes,

158
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,640
you got 21% of black people saying yes.
Right?

159
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,860
So it's more than a two
fold difference there.

160
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,210
And that has everything to
do with family dynamics with,

161
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:17,100
with there not being
two parents in the home.

162
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,450
It is a development issue more than it
is an issue of treatment by white people.

163
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,280
Right. I have another piece in Colette,
uh, called Black American culture and,

164
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:32,000
and the racial wealth gap where I talk
about spending differences and you,

165
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:36,180
you, you know, Nielsen, the marketing
firm has done, done research on this,

166
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,980
found that the average black woman is
more likely to own a luxury vehicle than

167
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,880
the average white woman.

168
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,950
Despite the fact that the average black
family has one 10th the wealth of,

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,030
of, of the average average white
family spending patterns on,

170
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:56,031
on jewelry and expensive clothes are
very different in the black community.

171
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,000
Um, whatever you want to say about
these from an ethical a, this is not a,

172
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,250
I mean I'm not big in
the ethical judgment is,

173
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,610
I mean I'm not finger wagging and people
saying do x, don't do y. I'm saying

174
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,741
there are,

175
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,741
there are entire books
written by respected left wing
scholars about issues like

176
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,970
wealth or income or that just don't
mention a single one of these facts as if

177
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:28,740
it's not relevant. Right. So what's the,

178
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,220
what's the through line then or the
connection between all of this and the

179
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:36,430
welfare state? Because the more
that I've explored these ideas,

180
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:41,431
the more that I am starting to buy that
that almost is the real problem here

181
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,060
that we've given a certain amount
and then it's just human nature.

182
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,260
People don't want to stop being on the
Dole. That has nothing to do with race.

183
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,720
You could give it to anyone.
But in this case,

184
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:54,190
we happen be talking
about black Americans,

185
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:58,060
but I can give you just one simple
example, which is my sister lives in a,

186
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,070
in Manhattan,
not that far from you actually,

187
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,590
and she's in a building
that's part subsidized.

188
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,130
So there's a lot of black people in
the building that had been there for

189
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:10,780
generations now that are,
they're subsidized. My sister
and her husband, two kids,

190
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,420
they're not rolling in dough.
They're paying full market price.

191
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,670
But the people that are
in the subsidized housing,

192
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,860
it's almost impossible for them to leave.

193
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,500
I don't even blame them because
they're paying next to nothing.

194
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,700
And if they wanted to work more, they'd
probably, and then get off the subsidies.

195
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,563
The subsidies,

196
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,150
they probably have to leave the building
in the first place and then go live

197
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:32,500
somewhere worse. So we end up with
this horrific catch 22 that again,

198
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,690
I don't believe,
I don't put this on race.

199
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,230
It just seems to be affecting
people of a certain race more.

200
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,280
Yes. I think, I mean,

201
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:44,530
I think it's clear that
there was a point in, in,

202
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
in the late sixties and seventies
where the welfare state was clearly

203
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:53,561
incentivizing counterproductive behavior
disproportionately among black people.

204
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,730
Um, I mean, the reason I,
yeah, I, I, I, I don't,

205
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,460
I think we need a welfare state.
I think there's,

206
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,700
there's really no free market.

207
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,300
There's no capitalist economy in the world
that doesn't have one because they're

208
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,850
just,
and you know,

209
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,330
people's jobs are being taken by
automation and that's only going in one

210
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:15,164
direction.

211
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,620
And we clearly need a welfare state and
we need one that doesn't incentivize,

212
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,670
uh, you know, counterproductive
behavior. And we haven't always had that.

213
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,550
And when you say,

214
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,010
you mean some sort of social
safety net? Yes, correct.

215
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,480
Because I think people would,
you say welfare state,

216
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,250
I think people have a different sort of,
kind of

217
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,560
perhaps. Yeah. I mean as social,

218
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:38,880
I mean something that catches the people
who can't really, can't help themselves,

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,290
who can't trade their skills for
money in the market. Yeah, yeah.

220
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm with Ya.
So,

221
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,470
so then how do we untether the issue
of people that are now stuck in that

222
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,150
machine where every time you talk
about it, you're called a racist?

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,350
No, I mean this is, yeah,

224
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:59,351
it is extremely pernicious because I
think it's clear that the welfare state,

225
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,010
the way it was rolled out in the sixties
and seventies had bad effects for black

226
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,390
people. Right? It's, it's,

227
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:10,450
it's hard to fully explain the decline
in two parent homes without noticing

228
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:12,520
that,
you know,

229
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:17,521
a black mother in the early seventies
stood to lose money by getting married to

230
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:22,190
a guy. Right? Because of the
perverse incentives of the
welfare state. That said,

231
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,120
it's not just because the welfare state
was one of the causes of the decline of

232
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,630
the black family doesn't imply that
taking it away would repair it.

233
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,400
So I think, I think that is something
like Charles Murray, for example,

234
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:41,660
grow big book in the 80s that
made him big losing ground,

235
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,960
which criticize the welfare state
very much along these grounds.

236
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:49,961
But I think even he has acknowledged that
at this point removing it once you've

237
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:55,220
said it all into motion, it's not
obvious that removing it is a cure,

238
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,960
which is, which is tragic, but

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
true. Yeah, it's, it's a real
tragedy because then it's like,

240
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,060
I mean this is where you would definitely
have a difference of opinion with

241
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:08,020
Candice. We're at her argument is
rip the Bandaid, rip the Bandaid,

242
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,090
let the pieces fall where they may,

243
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't know what her policy is on that
and helping the poorest of the poor or

244
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,450
whatever. Like are you literally going
to be kicking people out of their houses?

245
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,380
I don't know what the answer to that is,
but I think there's,

246
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,010
there's a growing feeling I think at
least at a certain set of people that it's

247
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:24,700
not working.

248
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,540
You're acknowledging why it's not
working and these little bandaid fixes

249
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,580
seemingly only make it worse.

250
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,620
Yeah. It's, I think it's a very
complex issue because there are some,

251
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:38,540
there are some elements of the social
safety net that I think economists agree

252
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,000
are working like the
earned income tax credit,

253
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,730
which actually incentivizes you to work.

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,310
It helps the worst off
people in society without,

255
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,910
it basically corrects the massive mistake
of welfare in the Lyndon Johnson era.

256
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,090
Um, but yeah, no, it's
a, it's a complex issue.

257
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,830
Yeah, sure. So I hate to talk
about race this whole time.

258
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,610
It's like kind of annoying.
I know it's what you mostly write about.

259
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,650
What else is kind of on your mind?

260
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:07,260
Like what are the other issues
that you care about? I mean,

261
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,820
we can keep going on that, but I
always feel like it's like, it's,

262
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,450
that's also a sort of
tragedy of all of this.

263
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,860
It's like your whole world view is to
move past all this and yet because of that

264
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:19,740
you get thrust into the conversation.
It's a weird,

265
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:23,970
a weird psychological condition,
I suppose. Yes, it is.

266
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:25,470
Does that just drive you crazy in general?

267
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,350
Yeah. I mean I don't, before
we move on, I am racist.

268
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,720
Not something I find
inherently interesting. Yeah.

269
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,460
I think it is like when I have,
when I have a free moment to,

270
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,360
to read a book,
I'm not ordering the race book because,

271
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,910
but at the same time, it is a topic
that's looms so large in our politics.

272
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,450
And so much of what is said
makes so little sense that I,

273
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,820
it, it, it just gets to me.
So I have to say something,

274
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:56,620
but it's not something I enjoy.
I mean what,

275
00:16:56,621 --> 00:17:01,500
what I really enjoy is a
philosophy and science. Um,

276
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,630
so, so when I have free moments, I tend
to read things in those, in those Janrus.

277
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,020
Yeah.

278
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,440
Well you're working for the right lady
Claire Over collect cause that's what she

279
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:13,330
cares about too. So actually we
can shift a little bit. So, uh,

280
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,510
you attended an event, uh, that, uh,

281
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,660
there's an IDW group in
New York put together. Uh,

282
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,330
it was put together in
like two or three days.

283
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:25,170
It was me and Eric Weinstein and
Faisal Machar and Melissa Chen.

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,830
And we're just kind of doing like
IDW one on one stuff. And you,

285
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,340
you asked me an interesting
question during the Q and a,

286
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:35,130
so I'll let you present the question
and then I want to hear your answer

287
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,230
actually before I repeat
my answer. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,380
So my,

289
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,510
my question was essentially there are a
lot of people who really don't like the

290
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:48,320
intellectual dark web. I think it's just
a bunch of cranks who are, you know,

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,910
playing footsie the outright
in this objectionable way, um,

292
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:55,860
and totally dismissed the whole
thing. But then there are, there are,

293
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,500
there are many other people who
think, well, you know, I, I like,

294
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,190
I like half of the people in the, in
the intellectual dark web, you know,

295
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't maybe like the other half,
but I think it's,

296
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,020
they have a kind of nuanced take on it,

297
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,200
but they're really where one
loses them is the fact that,

298
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,990
you know,
you've had Stefan Molyneux ma,

299
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,930
I don't know how to promote some
new Molyneux. Right. So this, this,

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,350
this character that people view as
objectionable to whatever degree.

301
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,510
I Dunno,
I don't follow him.

302
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:31,920
So I don't know whether they should or
shouldn't view him that way. But you know,

303
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:36,150
or Sam Harris has had Charles Murray
on the podcast, which you know, many,

304
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:39,390
he just has a terrible
reputation on the left,

305
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,860
largely undeserved or Joe Rogan head.
Alex Jones done. Exactly. We can do,

306
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,110
you can do this ad infinitum.

307
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,550
And it seems like that is is the last
place where people who might otherwise see

308
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:59,490
this phenomenon as good get off
the ship. Yeah. Or I've, I've had,

309
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:03,780
I think I've had conversations with
people where that was kind of the last

310
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:08,580
trench to die in, in terms of criticizing
the phenomenon. So my question was,

311
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:12,240
what do you like, what do you think
about this, do you think? I mean,

312
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:15,690
this is also a criticism that Barry Weiss
raised in her, in her piece about it.

313
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,010
So I guess my answer to that would be,

314
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm, I mean, well, do you know
this guy, Daryl Davis? He, he,

315
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,040
he's a black guy who did a documentary,
can't remember the name of it,

316
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,810
where he met with the white supremist.

317
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,810
He met with Ku Klux Klan members as a
black person and just hung out with them,

318
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,560
talk to them about various issues.
Became friends with them. Right?

319
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,390
So imagine the psychological courage
this takes to sit across from someone who

320
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:48,570
literally thinks you are an
inferior kind of human being.

321
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,200
And to put that aside and just expand
your circle of empathy to include them

322
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:57,960
preemptively, incredibly
inspirational. So,

323
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:02,961
and he ends up getting over 200 Ku
Klux Klan members to renounce their

324
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:07,500
membership and he keeps their robes in
his closet as a kind of trophy of having

325
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,020
d radicalized them.
Okay.

326
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,300
And then he gets harshly criticized from
blacks, black lives matter for having,

327
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,620
having done this, um,
which is, which I find,

328
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,830
I find to be the most galling irony in
the world because we're talking about a

329
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:27,831
person who has done more to reduce racism
in this society than almost anyone I

330
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:32,730
could name in black lives matter, right?
He is, he is gone like a, you know,

331
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
many, many progressive activists, they,

332
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,790
they tend to go to the spaces that are
actually most progressive already and try

333
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,200
to make them even more progressive.

334
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:44,340
So they show up on the university campuses
already the most progressive places

335
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:48,370
on planet earth and then accused them
of being systemically racist. Right.

336
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,330
So we're talking about a guy who
actually went into the trenches. Yeah.

337
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,170
He plays the belly of the beast.
Exactly.

338
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,180
And was successful in d radicalizing
people from white racism.

339
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,840
Um, the, the point, the
point I'm making here is not,

340
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,130
not to compare obviously
Charles Murray or Stefan to,

341
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,480
to a Ku Klux Klan member.

342
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,510
My point is we ought to be expanding the
range of people were willing to talk to

343
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,010
and disagree with.

344
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,910
And I think that insofar as you're able
to challenge people or just expose,

345
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,690
expose people's ideas,
I think that in the long run,

346
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,010
as uncomfortable as it is and
counterintuitive as it is, tends to,

347
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,963
tends to be better.

348
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,520
Yeah. So I'll just repeat it
quickly, but that in essence,

349
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,000
that last portion especially really
was my answer. Now, first off,

350
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:42,600
some of us Rogan me in San particularly,
we interview people.

351
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:47,601
So we can't say we're for plurality of
ideas and we want to talk to people we

352
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,580
disagree with and all that. And then
only talk to people we agree with.

353
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:54,030
So that means we are going to talk to
some of these characters without getting

354
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:58,530
into any of the specifics of the people
that I've had on the show. Of course,

355
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:02,550
sometimes somebody you may not ask
the right question here or there.

356
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,070
I'm not even, I'm not even saying
that that's what I did or didn't do.

357
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,460
But you have like,
otherwise we're not taking any risks.

358
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:12,870
And the group of people that will talk
to will become infinitely smaller and

359
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:16,230
smaller and smaller. And
also we'll be sort of, um,

360
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,260
we'll be hostages to people that
don't like us in the first place.

361
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,630
And that's what I'm more concerned about.
It's like,

362
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,850
I don't want people who don't want any
conversation to be happening at all to

363
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:29,850
have ownership over who I'm
going to talk to. Yeah. Now,

364
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,470
on any specific moment, could any of us
do something a little bit differently?

365
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:37,730
Sure. But in essence, yeah, you're
asking about the gatekeeping that,

366
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,790
that Barry was talking about.
Yeah. I don't even know that it's,

367
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,710
it's for me to say. And as I said
before, you know, we don't even have,

368
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:46,320
it's not like we're walking around with
laminated cards and we'd go to a secret

369
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:50,370
meetings. I'm right. But I think the
best sunlight is the best disinfectant.

370
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:54,720
I just, I just fundamentally
believe that. And as far as I know,

371
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,900
no one was hurt by any of the interviews
that I've done. And I think I've,

372
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,890
I've helped a lot of people that were
maybe into some of those ideas. You know,

373
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,690
that was the one that people
were giving me a lotta.

374
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,890
That's the day I said Daryl
Davis phenomenon 80. Yeah.
Yeah. So, yeah, nobody's lost.

375
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:11,010
I mean, that's what I really believe.
And maybe that's a little, um,

376
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,940
rose colored glasses of me. But
I believe that, you know, when,

377
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:18,900
when people were giving me crap
for doing Alex Jones to like,

378
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,180
forget what he thinks
about things for a moment,

379
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,750
clearly hundreds of thousands or
millions of people are watching this.

380
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,250
I came on on a live show. I
said, whatever. I believe,
I didn't lie about anything.

381
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,750
I said the same thing as I say here.

382
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,060
And then I got emails from
his people saying, you know,

383
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,600
I never heard a decent
liberal talk before.

384
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,410
Now I watched your interview with
Bret Weinstein. So like, wow,

385
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:41,400
that's pretty cool man.
So I just think perhaps we,

386
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,270
and I mean you and I in this case,
we just have a little bit more

387
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,290
tolerance for,

388
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,710
I don't think if someone hears something
it's going to immediately infect them

389
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:54,740
and then they're going to take that
infection and infect other people.

390
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,810
But I think a lot of people operate
in that prison. I think so, uh,

391
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,130
one of the reasons I asked this question
at the event is I was glad you did by

392
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,200
the way. Yeah. It's because, for example,

393
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,090
Charles Murray has retweeted
some of my pieces and you know,

394
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:08,420
I've,

395
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,420
I've gotten into exchanges with
some of my critics where I've,

396
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,550
I've kind of talked them down off of
the ledge of me being a sellout or

397
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,140
convinced them that I'm,

398
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,230
I'm operating in good faith and the
trench there dying and criticizing me is,

399
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:31,520
well,
Charles Murray retweeted you and he is x,

400
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:35,840
y and Z. Therefore, I
think a, that's just,

401
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,850
that's like two layers of Ad Hominem.

402
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,550
Ad Hominem is attacking
you instead of your belief,

403
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,420
but attacking someone else instead of
your belief. It's like, that's a bit much.

404
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:47,210
Yeah, it's Ad Hominem twice
over. But we seem to be in this,

405
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,910
in this place now where people like lists,
you know,

406
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,810
the SPLC is making lists of people
that are bad people. You know,

407
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,890
there was this alternative influencer
graph that you probably saw that tried to

408
00:24:57,891 --> 00:24:59,570
link together.
I didn't even know,

409
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,620
probably 10 or 15 of the people
on there and I don't, you know,

410
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,330
and I looked at the list after where
they're including me in this like crazy,

411
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,340
whatever it was,
white supremacists list or something.

412
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,380
Not only did I not know
plenty of the people,

413
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,040
several of them I have muted
because they hate me. So it's like,

414
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,910
like you just come together with
anyone that has walked past you. Oh,

415
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,790
you shook hands with that guy. You
didn't know who he was. Too Bad. You're,

416
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,280
you're screwed man. Yeah,
that's it. No, I think,

417
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:24,980
I think I was telling this
to you before we filmed,

418
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:29,390
but I think we live in a McCarthy
asked era with regard to,

419
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,860
especially racism, but
also other, other isms. Um,

420
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,140
I mean I hope historians look back on
it as that, but you know, we're getting,

421
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,100
we're getting people fired for,
you know,

422
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,350
for saying the n word and an
antiracist context. You know,

423
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:46,610
Papa John's for example,

424
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,810
the CEO of that got fired for saying
the n word and there was no pushback on

425
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:54,650
that. The Guy said it in the
context of an anti racist razor,

426
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:55,820
like recalling his,

427
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,590
the racist of his youth and the heinous
things they would say. Yeah, right.

428
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:04,940
And it gets fired and get, gets his name
taken off the gym of his local hometown.

429
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,680
Just gets his reputation deep.
Sixth and right.

430
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,000
So like this is happening. It
happened a month later to, to,

431
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,430
to this executive at Netflix who's in a,

432
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:20,060
in a meeting about offensive words
and Netflix is comedy context.

433
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,840
So how do you have a meeting about
offensive words without saying offensive

434
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:27,650
words unless you're just going to be
talking like alphabet soup and the entire

435
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,990
time.
So he says this fired.

436
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,950
So these are note nobody upon reflection
thinks that these people are racists.

437
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,180
It is completely,
it is,

438
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,860
it is analogous to
McCarthyism in that sense.

439
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,880
And the word racism has been
denuded so fully of of its,

440
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,210
of its moral valence and its moral
charge at this point that you know,

441
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,650
people, you know, we're, we're caring
less and less about actual racism too.

442
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,670
That that's a fear here. Like, once you,

443
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,520
once you strip this word of all
of this all its moral charge,

444
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,770
then you have a boy who
cried wolf scenario,

445
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,210
which ends up backfiring spectacularly.
And I would argue that that is happening.

446
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:13,770
We're seeing a, a surge, uh, on the,
on the far right as well. Right.

447
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:14,604
So I think

448
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,300
that that was also my concern.
I mean, before the election,

449
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:20,870
I did plenty of videos about you
gotta stop calling Trump Hitler. Yeah.

450
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,380
Because if he is not Hitler, and for all
the reasons that people don't like them,

451
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:27,140
the guy's not Hitler.
And it's like you keep doing that.

452
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,960
You won't even realize when
the real bad guys go. Yeah.

453
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,440
And the people that would be sympathetic
to your views will no longer listen to

454
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:35,990
you. Yeah. Because they'll view
you as the boy who cried wolf.

455
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,270
Yeah. And Bill Mar del Mar called
himself out for doing this for calling,

456
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,560
you know, Bush and Romney
racists or whatever it was.

457
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,570
Right.
He said that Romney or hated women.

458
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,230
Yes, yes. Yeah. And he called himself
out for being hyperbolic so that when,

459
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:56,231
when trunk Trump came along who actually
has done clearly or has said clearly

460
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:01,301
misogynous things is alleged to have
said some things that if he did say them

461
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,850
are, are clearly racist. Yeah. Um,

462
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,040
people don't care anymore because
they've been so solid. You know, they've,

463
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:13,810
they've been called racist a thousand
times by the pundits at Msnbc and it's,

464
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,840
it's been true maybe 10% of the times,
but not true. Like for the, the,

465
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,370
the funniest case of
this to me was, uh, when,

466
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:25,310
when Trump called Omarosa a dog,
right?

467
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,460
At Wash u turn on NBC and Msnbc after
this or are read the New York Times.

468
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,970
It is just obvious to those
people that this is a racist slur.

469
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:38,570
He's called this black woman a dog.
This is obviously racist.

470
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:43,250
And if you're defending it, you're a
racist too. Okay. And then you just,

471
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,100
if you have an internet connection,
yeah. You look at the other people,

472
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:50,510
Trump has directly called the dog.
You find Mac Miller before he passed away.

473
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:54,290
Of course you find, um, David Axelrod,

474
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,930
you find Adriana Huffington, just, you,

475
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,280
you find white person after white person
that he is directly called the dog,

476
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,280
not said they did something
like a dog cause he does,

477
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,150
he likes that construction too.
Right?

478
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,880
But he's called the white
person after white person a dog.

479
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,640
There's no reason to believe
that this was a racist incident.

480
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,810
And yet every pundit at
Msnbc is saying that it is.

481
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,380
And anyone who likes Trump and you know,
watches Fox News,

482
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,710
they're getting these clips exported
from MSNBC seeing themselves called as

483
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:27,530
racist by called racist by
implication or by association.

484
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,430
And then seeing someone like Tucker
Carlson who you know, I have,

485
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:32,510
I have reservations about,

486
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:37,010
but seeing someone like Tucker
Carlson make perfect sense about it,

487
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:40,340
just destroy this view with,

488
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,200
with simple logic and
facts and imagine how,

489
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:46,570
how refreshing it is to have
someone like Tucker doing that.

490
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,920
And obviously like you're, you're going
to get tired of being called a racist in,

491
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,920
in cases when it's so obviously not
true and there's just a lack of due

492
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,550
diligence. There's a lack of
any concern for, for facts.

493
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,370
And for logic and that
ends up having a very, uh,

494
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:06,490
a bad effect on the other
end because now Trump,

495
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,990
I mean there are some things Trump has
said for which racism I think is the best

496
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:13,540
explanation.
I don't think he's a Klan member.

497
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,930
I think he's a very mild kind of New
York racist of his era. You know, there,

498
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,080
there degrees of racism in other words.
But the point is,

499
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:28,000
it's like the, the reason that Trump
voters, I think for the most part,

500
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,880
excuse him, on some of the
things he said is not because,

501
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,940
or not for the most part because of a
random upsurge and racism that happened in

502
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:43,870
2016 but wasn't present the past
eight years. You, they're like,

503
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:47,500
there are counties that went for Obama
twice that went for Trump. It is, it is.

504
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:51,090
I think it's largely because
people are absolutely sick of,

505
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,050
of being tarred as racists,

506
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,170
untethered to the facts
of the specific cases.

507
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,040
Yeah. And then now we've got
just the match made in hell.

508
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,460
We've got a group that calls everyone
racist. The guy who, you know,

509
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,560
is happy to bite them on every bit of
it and use that as fuel to get his base

510
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,270
going. And Yeah. So what do you,

511
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,910
somehow I said we were going to shift
that a race and we went right back to

512
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,860
exactly. Yeah. All right. We're going
to try to finish up something else.

513
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:17,370
But what do you, what do you even consider
yourself politically these days? If I,

514
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,370
if I was trying to label you, I
mean I have a sense, you know,

515
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:23,420
you're somewhere in that classical
liberal situation, but does,

516
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,670
does that even matter to you? Do you,
do you think of yourself a certain way?

517
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,090
I think if you can be gender fluid,

518
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:33,040
you should be able to be political fluid
at this point. Yeah. I think, uh, I don't,

519
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,630
and I,
I find your political views to be,

520
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,510
I appreciate that. I appreciate
that. Um, no, but I think, I mean,

521
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:44,330
it is,
it is strange that is it,

522
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,040
like politics is a social construct,
political ideologies.

523
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:52,390
These are fully social constructs and it
seems like we're getting more and more

524
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:56,560
rigid with the degree to
which we take them seriously.

525
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,980
Um,
obviously one should take ideas seriously,

526
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:04,981
but I don't see anything to be gained
from anchoring myself to conservatism or

527
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,630
liberalism or libertarianism,
even though I find wisdom and,

528
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:12,970
and all of these three, uh,
political ideologies. Um,

529
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,430
so yeah, I mean, I think, I
think if I can, if I can make
politically fluid a meme,

530
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,100
that would be, that'd be great. Yeah.

531
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,960
I will see what I can do. All right.
Give me one other thing besides race.

532
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:25,340
What are you doing for fun days?
Man,

533
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,630
I'm reading, I'm reading a lot
about, I'm taking metaphysics,

534
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,990
taking philosophy of language in mind.
Both of them.

535
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,950
What are you doing?
Facetime, reading metaphors.

536
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,890
You've got a political future
in front of you or, Oh God, no.

537
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,410
And this is the of it, right?
People often ask me that. No,

538
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,410
I would never go into politics.
Actually. People assume that about me,

539
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,540
which I think is really
interesting because I detest
politics. I hate it so much.

540
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,090
Um, yeah, no, I don't. I Dunno.
I Dunno why I give that vibe off,

541
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,590
but it's, yeah. I, I cannot
see myself as a politician.

542
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,200
You're too sane. That's the problem. It's
been a pleasure, man. Likewise. All right.

543
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,390
We're more on Coleman. Follow them
on the Twitter at Cold X. Man.
