00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
&gt;&gt; Since we've already covered how xhrGet works as a function, this should be

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.640
pretty simplistic. Give in the input to some URI on the internet, do an xhrGET

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.517
on it, fetch the data and set this.fullyLoaded=true. This effectively means that

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:17.738
we allow the loading function to occur and when we set this flag, this allows

00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:22.160
other external functions to query the class and have logic defined on what to do

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.429
or not to do depending on its load state.
