MALE SPEAKER: I'm not going
to spend a lot of time

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.960
introducing Amanda Palmer.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.217
She didn't ask me to do so,
so I'm not going to do it.

00:00:11.217 --> 00:00:15.820
And so she's going
to play her self.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.140
So everyone please
welcome to Google,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
the Authors At
program-- "Authors" At,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.140
but you could sing, too.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.110
You're musical.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.004
Please join me in welcoming
Amanda Palmer to Google.

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.836
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.080
AMANDA PALMER: Hi.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.180
I'm not sure what to do.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.070
You guys are all at work.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.650
If you're not, what
are you doing here?

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.210
Why are you at Google?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.430
She's your date?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.780
Are most of you in the
middle of your work day?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.540
Except for you.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.640
OK, I know, I know,
I know, I know.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.550
Shh.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.167
What can I do for you?

00:00:58.167 --> 00:00:59.000
What would you like?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.920
Because I have-- read?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.620
Read and sing?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.708
Do a little bit of both?

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:08.510
OK.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.845
I want to alleviate you of
whatever needs alleviation.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.980
I don't actually
play the ukulele,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.890
a fact of which I am proud.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.150
And if you want,
I can give you--

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.030
I've been giving little flash
ukulele lessons to people.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.690
I'm actually-- now that I
can maybe quit my day job,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.620
which-- whatever.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.000
If you knew me,
it would be funny.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.110
I'm thinking of just
whoring myself out

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.560
to different corporations
as a ukulele healer.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.470
It's just like going from
Google to Twitter to Microsoft

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.500
and bringing giant
truckloads of ukuleles

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.670
and teaching everyone on staff
the basic three chords that you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.760
need to know to play all rock
songs ever at lunch hour.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:17.232
(SINGING) In my mind, in a
future five years from now,

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:24.736
I'm 120 pounds, and
I never get hungover

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:31.053
because I will be the
picture of discipline,

00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:36.980
never minding what state I'm
in, and I will be someone

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.880
I admire and it's
funny how I imagined

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.116
that I would be that
person now but it does not

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.580
seem to have happened.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.816
Maybe I've just
forgotten how to see

00:02:55.816 --> 00:03:01.065
that I'm not exactly the
person that I thought I'd be.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.050
And in mind, in the
faraway here and now, I've

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.900
become in control,
somehow, and I never

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.140
lose my wallet because I will
be the picture of discipline,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.526
never fucking up anything, and
I'll be a good defensive driver

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:39.400
and it's funny how I
imagined that I would

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.344
be that person now,
but it does not

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:47.100
seem to have happened
maybe I've just

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.640
forgotten how to see that
I'm not exactly the person

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.780
that I want to be.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.645
And in my mind, when
I'm old, I am beautiful,

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:15.877
planting tulips and vegetables,
which I will mindfully

00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:17.296
watch over.

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:23.485
Not like me now, I'm so
busy with everything,

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:28.488
that I don't look
at anything, but I'm

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:33.166
sure I'll look when I
am older, and it's funny

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:39.477
how I imagined that I would
be that person now, that's now

00:04:39.477 --> 00:04:45.460
what I want-- that's I wanted
that I'd be giving up somehow

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.310
how strange to see
that I don't want

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.890
to be the person
that I want to be.

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:06.440
And in my mind, I
imagined so many things,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.220
things that aren't
really happening,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.460
and when they put
me in the ground,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.232
I'll start pounding the lid,
saying, I haven't finished yet,

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:24.640
I still have a
tattoo to get, that

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.250
says I'm living in the moment,
and its funny how I imagined

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.460
that I would win
this, win this right,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.890
but maybe it really
isn't funny that I've

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.430
been fighting all my life.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.365
But maybe I have
to think it's funny

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:49.760
if I want to live before
I die, and maybe it's

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.850
funny as [INAUDIBLE] to think
I'll die before I actually

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.398
see that I am exactly the
person that I want to be.

00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:11.864
Fuck, yes.

00:06:11.864 --> 00:06:16.974
I am exactly the person
that I want to be.

00:06:22.106 --> 00:06:24.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:25.452
Thank you.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.290
So what's better for you
guys-- if I read here

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.970
or at the reading thing?

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.730
This is good?

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.730
OK, then I'm not moving.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.500
I just landed here
from Portland.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.710
I did a reading and a show
in Portland last night

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.130
that was really wonderful.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.080
And I'm doing one tonight
and tomorrow in this area.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:59.260
And I've been doing nothing
for a week and change but just

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.640
this book and signing
it and talking about it.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.230
And I've had all these fantastic
interview guests every night

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:13.200
of tour and all of these
incredible discussions

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.750
about the internet-- mostly
the topic with all these people

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.710
who are my friends
and other artists--

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.890
the topic keeps just snaking
back to internet trolling.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.310
Especially the guests I have on
stage has any kind of following

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.490
or is even just a
small local artist,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.110
it seems to be the bane
of everyone's existence.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.760
And what do we do about it?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.480
And how do we deal
with a culture that

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.370
seems to be addicted to outrage.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.247
And can you guys fix that?

00:07:46.247 --> 00:07:47.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.650
I'm asking for real.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.260
Like is that a-- maybe that's
not actually a good idea.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.757
Don't fix-- OK.

00:07:53.757 --> 00:07:55.340
If you have ideas,
though, talk to me.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.070
Because it's a pain in my
ass and my friends' asses.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.710
What?

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.835
AUDIENCE: Try not controlling
people's speech here.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.527
AMANDA PALMER: What
does that mean?

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.110
AUDIENCE: If people
want to say stuff,

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.865
by and large you're not going
to-- the internet's free

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:10.570
and all that.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.440
AMANDA PALMER: Yeah.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.130
I know, I wasn't suggesting
that Google should just

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:20.160
become this giant fascist
censor that-- that would be bad.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.942
It would be fun to
create a nice filter,

00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:28.650
like if you decide
one day you could just

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.160
surf the "nice" internet.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.270
That might be hard to do.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.448
AUDIENCE: Well, we
could do a lot more sort

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:39.849
of justice-type stuff, like
try to encourage people

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:43.028
to do hash it out in a nice way.

00:08:43.028 --> 00:08:44.495
AMANDA PALMER: I do that.

00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:46.470
I do that a lot.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.060
AUDIENCE: Somewhere else.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.560
AMANDA PALMER: It
can be really hard

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.560
trying to direct angry
traffic, and that can sometimes

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.850
be a really losing battle.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.680
But I kind of do-- I write
about it a lot in the book.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.220
This is a section
of the book that

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.570
takes place towards the end
and I'm just going to read it.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.800
"I loved being the center of
attention when I was a kid,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.420
and I still do.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.917
And sometimes it makes
wonderful things happen,

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:26.750
like when I convinced
the neighborhood girls

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.124
to enact an a capella production
of 'Fiddler on the Roof'

00:09:29.124 --> 00:09:30.500
on my back porch.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.410
I played Tevye, obviously.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.620
And sometimes it made
terrible things happen,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.650
like when I wore a bra
to school Madonna-style

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.066
on the outside of my dress and
got sent to the principal's

00:09:41.066 --> 00:09:44.150
office, and the principal
delivered a lecture that I

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.330
would absolutely kill to
have a recording of just

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.740
to be able to use the line,
"You think you're so special,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.146
Amanda, but you're not actually
special" in my techno remix

00:09:56.146 --> 00:09:57.145
of 'Creep' by Radiohead.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.530
As I moved through my life
as a street-performing statue

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.110
and later as a
musician, I started

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.340
to understand
something-- there's

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.230
a difference between
wanting to be looked at

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.010
and wanting to be seen.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.690
When you're looked at, your
eyes can stay blissfully closed.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.530
You suck energy.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.910
You steal the spotlight.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.180
But when you're seen,
your eyes must be open

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.270
as you are seeing and
recognizing your witness.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.140
You accept energy, but
you generate energy.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.510
You create light.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.790
One is exhibitionism.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.390
The other is connection.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.050
Not everybody wants
to be looked at,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.165
but everybody wants to be seen.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:58.818
Following the success of my
TED Talk, Microsoft called."

00:10:58.818 --> 00:11:00.990
I don't know why I was
expecting a reaction,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.590
but-- just, like, crickets.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.790
No, it's cool, it's
cool, it's cool.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.670
"Microsoft called.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.080
They were offering
to fly me to Seattle

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.820
to speak to a group of
women who worked there.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.620
Apparently, a whopping 16%
of the employees at Microsoft

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.520
were female.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.460
I asked the speaker coordinator
what I would be speaking about.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.150
'Whatever you want,' she
said, and I started to panic.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.370
I had no idea what
to talk about.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.330
Crowd sourcing?

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.950
Music?

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.950
Surely I could wax poetic for
a half an hour about something,

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.390
but these women
were actually smart

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.395
and the fraud police
were paying me a call."

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:52.040
A fraud police is my own
personal version of what

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.810
y'all might call
"imposer syndrome."

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.630
"So for two months,
I avoided coming up

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.001
with an idea worth Microsofting.

00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:02.500
And the night before
the talk, I was

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.210
pacing frantically around Jason
Webley's Seattle houseboat

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.370
where I was staying,
still having written

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:16.340
nothing, when it occurred
to me-- my mother.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.450
She'd been retired
for a decade, but she

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.710
worked as a freelancer
for almost 40 years

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.100
applying her math whiz
brain to the emerging

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.120
field of computer programming.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.580
And growing up, I'd had no
idea of what she actually

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.780
did all day after she
threw her heels in a bag

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.260
and drove her car into
the rush hour traffic.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.850
And whenever she started
trying to explain to me what

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.950
her job entailed, the words
blurred into a wall of noise.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.040
I hadn't called my
mother in a while,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.980
but now I had
something to ask her.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.380
And I needed her.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.410
She talked for
two hours straight

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.410
while I furiously
scribbled notes

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.720
about what it was like for
her to be one of the only

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.170
female computer programmers
at various companies

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.930
around Boston in
the '60s and '70s.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.590
I poured myself a glass of wine.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.790
On the other end of the
phone, on the opposite side

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.470
of the country, so did my mom.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.070
And for the first
time, in earnest,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.090
it was like we were
drinking together.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.260
I listened to her stories about
the sexism and the judgment

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.710
and the weird harassment.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.950
She told me the story about
the guy she programmed

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.090
with who got fired for looking
at too much porn on his office

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.240
computer.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.210
'In 1970?' 'No, no, no, no, no,
no, honey, this was way later,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.170
when we were working on Y2K.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.784
There was internet
porn by then.'

00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:41.950
I couldn't believe my mother
had just said the words

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.569
'internet porn,' and I
asked for more stories.

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:48.860
'Well, you had to work harder
than the men just to keep

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.350
the job,' she said
matter of factly.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.580
'And, you know, you had to be
perfect.' The way she said it

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.750
hit a nerve.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.625
'What kind of perfect?' 'Well,
if a guy messed up a project,

00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.500
there was always another
job waiting for him.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.020
But a woman?

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.520
Forget it.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.420
You'd never get a job
in that town again,

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.330
and Boston was a small town.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.200
There were only a few of us and
the men all stuck together.'

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.270
And she told me the story
of the accountant, Jerry,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.730
who paid all the male
freelancers on time but kept

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.560
withholding her paycheck,
claiming off-handedly that

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.900
because she 'had a husband,' she
probably didn't need the money

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.780
as badly as the men did.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.920
She ask nicely for
months, persistently,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.210
and a check she was owed
still didn't arrive.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.406
So one day, she called him
up 'At 6:02,' she said.

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:40.530
'when I knew the switchboard
operator had gone home

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.040
for the day, and I would get
him directly.' And she said,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.790
'Hi, Jerry.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.360
It's Cathy.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.500
Just wondering when
we're going to be

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.650
able to process that check.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.932
It's eight weeks late.' And
when Jerry made some grumblings

00:14:52.932 --> 00:14:55.140
about how they would send
it out as soon as possible,

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.850
my mother said, 'What are you
having for dinner tonight,

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.770
Jerry?'"

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.120
I love my mom so much.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.250
"And Jerry said, 'Excuse
me?' And my mother said,

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.510
'I need that money to buy
groceries to feed my family

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.801
and if you don't cut my check,
I'm coming to your house

00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:11.460
for dinner tonight.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.560
And I don't like salmon
and I don't like peas.'

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.310
The check was on her
desk the next day.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.930
I'd never known
any of this stuff.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.790
But then again, I'd never asked.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.600
And as we were wrapping up our
two-hour conversation and well

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.010
into our second or possibly
third glasses of wine,

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:35.270
she said, 'You know, Amanda,
one thing always bothered me--

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:40.710
something you said when you were
a teenager.' Whatever this was

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.430
going to be, it was not good.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.900
I was a terrible
teenager-- an explosion

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.300
of hormones and nihilism.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.880
'What, Mom?' She can do this
imitation of me as a teenager

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.730
that makes me want to
crawl under a table,

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.530
and she did it now.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:05.720
'You said, "Mom, I'm a real
artist and you're not."' Oh,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.480
god.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.790
And then she added more
kindly, 'You know, Amanda,

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:16.160
you were just being a typical
teenager.' I winced and I felt

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.220
my neck tighten and my teeth
grit down into Mother fight

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.770
or flight mode.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.140
And she continued, 'But you
know, Amanda, you would say,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.220
"I'm an artist.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.610
Fuck you, Mom.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.340
What do you know?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.570
You're just a
computer programmer."'

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.976
I had to admit, I
could totally imagine

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:35.350
myself saying that
as a teenager.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.350
Maybe not the 'fuck you,
Mom' part, but still.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.270
And then my mother
said something

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.544
that absolutely demolished
my defensiveness.

00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:45.960
And I don't think
it all the years

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.577
I've known her that
I've ever heard

00:16:47.577 --> 00:16:48.660
her sound more vulnerable.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.290
'You know, Amanda,
it always bothered me

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.750
because you can't
see my art, but I'm

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.330
one of the best artists I know.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.630
And it's just that no one can
see the beautiful things I made

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.310
because you couldn't
hang them in a gallery.'

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:16.430
And then there was a pause
and I took a deep breath.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.420
'God, Mom, I'm sorry.' And she
laughed and her voice turned

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.927
cheerful again.

00:17:21.927 --> 00:17:23.010
'Oh, don't worry, sweetie.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.730
You were 13.' As I related
the story the next morning

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.150
to a small theater filled
with 200 women of Microsoft,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.090
I added a confession, which was
that in all my years of rock

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.370
'n' roll, touring around
and supporting people

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.930
and advocating for women and
giving all these strangers

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.240
and fans permission to embrace
their inner fucking artists

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.800
and to express themselves fully
and look at their own work

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.510
and lives as beautiful,
unique, creative acts--

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.400
I'd somehow excluded
my own mother.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.440
And maybe, by extension, a
whole lot of other people.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.720
And I looked out at
the women of Microsoft

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.560
seeing present-day versions
of my 1970s programmer mom.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.530
Maybe they all felt
thoroughly misunderstood

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.160
by their own bitchy teenage
wannabe-poet daughters.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.535
Who knew?

00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:11.910
So I thought about
all the things

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.190
she told me over the
phone, I said to the room,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.870
and I thought about her work
that I couldn't possibly

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.850
comprehend-- about the actual
creative work she had done.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.780
All of that delicate,
handmade programming she

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.360
did into the dead of night
to switch one platform

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.250
to another on some critical
company deadline, how

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.920
outside the box she said that
she would think and venture

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.500
to fix a problem, and
how insanely proud

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:43.980
she felt when it worked, and
the true beauty of those things.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.610
And the sadness,
too, because nobody

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:52.810
ever clapped for her at
the end of the night.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.710
And as I looked out
into the audience,

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.270
I saw that three or four
of the women of Microsoft

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.740
were sniffling and
dabbing their eyes,

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.500
and my own throat tightened up.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.070
And she couldn't hang
her work on a wall.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.300
I can.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.680
I do my art in public and
people applaud all the time.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.810
And my mom never
really got that.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.930
And she's retired now.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.150
After the talk, I
hugged a handful

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.520
of the women of Microsoft,
got back in my rental car,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.230
turned the radio up to 11, and
peeled out of the office park.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.104
Take that, Fraud Police."

00:19:37.104 --> 00:19:39.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:48.580
Do you guys want one more?

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.534
Or do you want to ask questions?

00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:52.450
It's really up to you.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.366
I'm here for you guys.

00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:54.804
You want another one?

00:19:54.804 --> 00:19:55.304
OK.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.320
This is a shorter one, but
I think you'll like it.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.560
"While I was working on the
first draft of this book, which

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.270
I did over a few
thousand coffees

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.620
in various cafes in Melbourne
over about seven weeks,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.600
I shared a coffee with Samantha
Buckingham, an Australian indie

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.960
guitarist.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.110
And during the coffee,
I picked her brain

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.860
about her process
and her relationship

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.480
with her own fan base.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.640
Sam is typical of a lot of indie
musicians eking out a living.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.190
She's not on a
label, she crowdfunds

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.280
and she releases music
directly to the internet,

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.430
and she plays house parties
in her fans' living rooms.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.400
We were comparing notes
about the pros and cons

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.100
of patrion.com, which is a new
subscription service Sam was

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.490
using which allows fans to
automatically deposit money

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.900
into a musician's account
every single time the musician

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.499
releases a piece of
content, kind of like

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.040
a book-of-the-month
club for weirdos.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:14.100
And the artist can then rely on
a somewhat predictable income

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.475
instead of praying that their
Kickstarter will get funded

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:20.000
every single time they have
something to release or make.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.450
And at the time of this
writing, she's got 44 patrons,

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.600
including 19 $1 backers
and one backer at $50,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.080
and is paid about $200 every
time she releases a song.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.050
Patrons can choose how
much they pay per song

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.660
and they can cap
their monthly bill,

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.890
so she doesn't all of a sudden
dump 1,000 songs on them

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.580
and run off to Mexico.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.190
Although running
off to Mexico when

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.620
your Australian seems weird."

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.120
Because-- far.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.820
So I'm thinking she
would more run off

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.160
to Papa New Guinea or
something like that.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.870
"Sam was, in fact,
about to travel

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.240
to Asia with her
boyfriend and she

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.420
was fretting about what
her backers would think

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.670
if she continued releasing her
songs on a schedule on the page

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.620
fan website while
she was on vacation.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.160
She was worried that posting
pictures of herself sipping

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.370
a Mai Tai while simultaneously
releasing content for money

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.450
was going to make her
look like an asshole.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.050
'What does it matter where
you or whether you're drinking

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.810
a coffee, a Mai Tai, or a
bottle of water,' I asked,

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:28.440
'aren't they paying for your
songs so you can also live?

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.670
And doesn't living include
wandering and collecting

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.000
emotions and possibly drinking
a Mai Tai so that you got stuff

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.740
to write about-- not just
sitting in a blank white room

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.270
and writing songs without
ever leaving the house?'

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.200
I told Sam about another
songwriter friend

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.810
of mine, Kim Boekbinder, who
runs her own direct support

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.670
website through which he fans
pay her monthly at levels

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.480
from $5 to $1,000.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.580
She also has a running
online wish list

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.520
of musical gear and costumes,
like a wedding registry

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.287
to which are fans can
contribute any time.

00:23:03.287 --> 00:23:05.370
Kim had told me a few days
before that she doesn't

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.650
mind charging her
backers during what

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.410
she calls her
'staring at the wall'

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.500
time, which she thinks is
essential to have before she

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.390
could write a new
batch of songs.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.750
And her fans don't complain.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.260
They trust her.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.170
These are new forms of
patronage and it's messy.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.380
The artists and the patrons
are making up the rules

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.440
as they go along.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.950
But whether these
artists are using

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.580
crowdfunding or subscriptions or
pay-per-piece of content pledge

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.310
services, it doesn't matter.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.730
The fundamental building
blocks of these relationships

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:42.160
boil down to the
same thing-- trust.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.800
If you're going to ask
your fans to support you--

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.750
you as the artist--
it doesn't really

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.490
matter what your choices
are as long as you're

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.260
delivering your
side of the bargain.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.760
And you might be spending
their money on guitar picks

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.380
or on Mai Tais or baby formula
or college loans or coffee,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.830
as long as the art is
coming out the other side

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:05.290
and making the people who
have paid for it happy.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.870
The money that you need
to live and 'need to live'

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.800
is hard to define.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.160
It's almost indistinguishable
from the money

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.200
you need to make art.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.460
Like me, Sam, and thousands
of new-school artists,

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.040
Kim is in daily communication
with her fan base,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.490
and her ongoing arrangement with
her 200 supporters functions

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.490
because she shares her
songwriting process

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:32.550
and her bad days and her
heartaches and her travels.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.370
And so they trust her decisions.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.970
And what she posts
a photo of herself

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.730
in a vintage dress
she just bought,

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.650
nobody scolds her
for spending money

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.960
on something other
than effects petals.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.310
It's not like her fans'
money is an allowance

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.690
with nosy and critical
strings attached.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.310
It's a gift in the form
of money in exchange

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.010
for her gift in
the form of music.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.410
The relative values are messy,
but if we accept the messiness,

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.380
we're fine.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.550
If Beck needs to moisturize
his cuticles with truffle oil

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.350
in order to play guitar tracks
on his new crowdfunded album,

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.790
I technically shouldn't care if
the money that I've fronted him

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.100
isn't going towards two
turntables or a microphone.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.430
Just as long as the art
gets made, I get the album,

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.052
and Beck doesn't die.

00:25:17.052 --> 00:25:18.510
But that doesn't
mean observers are

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.870
going to stop criticizing
artists in their processes

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.900
any time soon.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.850
No less than Henry David
Thoreau has been called a poser.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.650
Thoreau wrote in
painstaking detail

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.850
about how he chose to remove
himself from society to live

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.420
by his own means in a little
10 by 15 foot hand-hewn

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.930
cabin on the side of a pond.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.390
But what he left out
of 'Walden,' however,

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.490
is the fact that the land he
built on was borrowed from his

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.830
wealthy neighbor, that his pal
Ralph had him over for dinner

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.750
all the time, and
that every Sunday,

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.080
Thoreau's mother and
sister brought him a basket

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:01.310
of freshly-baked goods,
including donuts.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.840
The idea of Thoreau gazing
thoughtfully over the expansive

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.140
transcendental Walden Pond,
a bluebird alighting on his

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.030
threadbare shoe, all the while
eating donuts that his mom

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.810
brought him just doesn't jive
with most people's picture

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.420
of him as a self-reliant,
noble, marrow-sucking,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.170
back-to-the-woods folk hipster.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.890
In the book 'An Underground
Education,' Richard Zacks

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.030
declares, 'Let it be known
that Nature Boy went home

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.480
on weekends to raid
the family cookie jar.'

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.460
Thoreau also lived at Walden for
a total of two or three years,

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.360
but he condensed the book
down to a single year--

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.700
to the four seasons-- to
make the book flow better,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.850
to work as a piece of
art, and to best reflect

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.120
his emotional experience--
a poetic license that I also

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.830
took with this book.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:53.300
And I told this story
to Sam over our coffees.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.130
'Poor Thoreau,' said Sam.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:02.660
'The donuts are totally the Mai
Tai.' Taking the doughnuts is

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.390
hard for a lot of people.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.010
And it's not the act of taking
that's so difficult-- it's more

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.820
the fear of what other people
are going to think when they

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.200
see us slaving away
at our manuscript

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.410
about the pure
transcendence of nature

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.710
while munching on
somebody else's doughnut.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.910
Maybe it comes back
to that same old issue

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.050
we just can't see what
we do is important enough

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.540
to merit to help, the love.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.364
Try picture getting
angry at Einstein

00:27:27.364 --> 00:27:29.530
devouring a doughnut brought
to him by his assistant

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.260
while he sat slaving on
the theory of relativity.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.480
Try picture getting angry
at Florence Nightingale

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.090
for snacking on a donut while
taking a break from tirelessly

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.280
helping the sick.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.690
These are difficult
things to do.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:48.470
So a plea to the artists and
the creators, the scientists,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:53.160
nonprofit runners, librarians,
strange thinkers, start-uppers,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.560
programmers, inventors, to
all the people everywhere

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.020
afraid to accept the help in
whatever form it's appearing--

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.850
please take the doughnuts.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.570
To the guy in my
opening band too

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.980
ashamed to go out into the crowd
and accept money in his hat,

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.260
even though people wanted to
give it-- take the doughnuts.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.810
And to the girl
who spent her '20s

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.030
as a street performer
and a stripper living

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.420
on $700 a month who
went on to marry

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.500
a best-selling author whom
she loves unquestioningly--

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.650
but even that massive love
can't break her unwillingness

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:32.270
to accept his help--
please, everybody,

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.522
please just take
the fucking donuts."

00:28:36.522 --> 00:28:39.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.430
Thank you.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.629
How much time have we got?

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.670
MALE SPEAKER: 20 minutes.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.060
AMANDA PALMER: Great.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.650
Let's just talk for 20 minutes.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.159
And if any of you guys want to
grab a book and get it signed,

00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:05.200
I'll take a couple minutes
at the end to do that.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.740
I'm happy to do that.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.540
Yes, if you have a
question, use the mic.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.340
Hi.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.000
AUDIENCE: Hey, Amanda.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.930
I'm curious how this has been
for you to go from a street

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.260
performer to an ever-growing
circle of influence,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.530
and how that's
changed the way you

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.150
interact with the world
and the responsibility that

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.695
maybe comes with that.

00:29:30.695 --> 00:29:32.070
AMANDA PALMER:
The responsibility

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.856
that comes with what?

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:36.520
AUDIENCE: With having
influence and people following

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.779
what you do, what you say.

00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:41.195
AMANDA PALMER:
Well those are kind

00:29:41.195 --> 00:29:42.695
of two different
questions, I think,

00:29:42.695 --> 00:29:44.720
but I guess they're related.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:51.690
I think to distill it
down, one of the things

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:56.701
that happened gradually as I
street-performed for five, six

00:29:56.701 --> 00:30:01.150
years is I just became
really comfortable.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.480
And I tell musicians
this a lot--

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.850
it really breaks you in a
certain way, in a good way,

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.350
I think, to be a
street performer.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.450
Because there's just
no stage and there's

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.710
nobody taking care of you.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:21.530
And you just can't have
any sense of entitlement

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.240
because you're in
the fucking street

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.120
and there's billions
of people passing by.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.780
And if you spend
an ounce of energy

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.970
getting angry at the thousands
of people who aren't stopping,

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.880
you can't do your job and
attract the one person who

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.110
does want to stop and
give you a dollar.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:42.720
So really, you're shaped into
this different kind of vessel

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.250
that just doesn't happen.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.830
Even starting off
in a band-- it's

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.650
a way safer space being
in a bar on a stage,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.060
even if people are talking and
not paying attention to you.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.580
It's not like the
street, where it's you

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.340
versus all of humanity.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.420
And I think it's really
good for a musician's ego

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.950
and general stage
presence which is--

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.900
this is so much easier
than the street.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.200
At some point during the
day, you chose to be here.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.160
And so I've already won.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.600
I don't have to sit here and
win you over and convince

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.020
you to sit down.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.980
And I think that kind
of comfortableness

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.400
just came with me.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.070
I took that kind of
comfortableness onto my blog

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.830
and onto the internet
and then out on the road

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.220
with The Dresden Dolls.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.770
And I was so thrilled to just
have any human entities coming

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.410
to me by choice.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.420
That was thrilling.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.430
And it's why it's always
been pretty easy for me

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.870
not to focus on the people
who don't like my music

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.850
or don't like me or don't
like the way I do things.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.200
I'm like, that's fine.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.780
You guys are in
it the typical 99%

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.220
of the population passing by.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.490
And the people who
criticize and troll me just

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.570
remind me of the people
who would take time out

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.970
of their day to
be like, you suck!

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.540
And you're just like, OK.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.390
There's a little circle of
people around me watching what

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.400
I'm doing and enjoying
it, and I know

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.250
that my job is to just
pay attention to them.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.250
And I think this can be
intellectually something

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.930
that artists know,
but emotionally it

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.420
can be really hard to
get to that place--

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.750
that you just are
dealing in a relationship

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.050
with those who want to be there
who appreciating your work, who

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.310
appreciate you, and not
spending your time shaking

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.120
your fists at the
rest of humanity.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.306
Because that can be so tempting.

00:32:41.306 --> 00:32:43.430
And I think the street
really prepared me for that.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.790
And as far as the
responsibility goes,

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.630
I actually write about
that in the book.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.430
I talk about how unwieldy
that was in the beginning

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:58.900
and how I fucked up
plenty in the early days.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.560
And actually when I was in
New York about a week ago,

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.985
my guest was Brandon Stanton.

00:33:03.985 --> 00:33:04.860
Do you guys know him?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.030
He runs a blog called
"Humans of New York"

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.820
that's just wonderful.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.840
And we shared our stories
of clumsily wielding

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.300
the hammer of justice when
we first had blog power

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.750
and thinking that we
could use our blogs

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.170
and our new found
platform of fans

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:26.120
to go out and sort of be like
justice-seeking superheroes

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.100
any time we saw-- and
how stupid that was.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.700
Because it doesn't really work.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.640
And so I have an anecdote--
he told a great anecdote

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.190
about in the early days
of "Humans of New York."

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.691
he asked this woman if he
could take a picture of her

00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:43.190
and she was really
excited to do it.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.190
But her boyfriend sidled in
and was like, no, no, no no,

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.120
don't do this thing
with this guy.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.610
And she was like,
but I want to do it.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.400
I said yes.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.067
I want to do it.

00:33:52.067 --> 00:33:52.691
Leave me alone.

00:33:52.691 --> 00:33:53.280
Let me do it.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.070
And the guy wouldn't
allow her to do it

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.390
and photo-bombed the
picture with his arm

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.170
around her making a
really stupid face.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:05.120
And Brandon was so irritated
by this entire exchange

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.814
that he just told the entire
story of everything that

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:13.040
had happened and then
posted the picture of them.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.989
And it got millions and
millions of hits and the guy

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.880
became a villain.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.239
Like, he was now the most
hated man in New York.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:29.590
And he now had his own sub-sites
of hatred directed against him.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.739
And I had my own moments
like that on my blog.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:36.840
I tell a story in the
book-- my first real taste

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.449
of mishandling crowd power.

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:42.816
I was very, very small.

00:34:42.816 --> 00:34:44.190
I had just started
my blog, but I

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.850
knew I had a few hundred
really dedicated readers.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:51.090
And we had just gotten our first
label check-- our advance--

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.320
and we were on top of the
world and feeling legitimate

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.160
all a sudden because we'd
finally gotten signed.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.119
And Brian went off and bought
a really fancy drum kit

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:01.410
for the first time in his life.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.889
And I had a budget
to go get a piano.

00:35:03.889 --> 00:35:04.680
And I was thrilled.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.040
It was the first time
in my life I had money.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.170
And I was like, I have
money, I have power.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.020
I'm going to go buy
a piano and I'm real.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.620
And I shopped all over Boston.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.370
And then one day I went
to a store in Brookline

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.420
and it was a little mom and
pop piano shop and I went in.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.470
And I had been sort
of comparison shopping

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.625
all over town, and I
sat down at this piano

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:29.280
and I started playing some
really loud Dresden Dolls

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.700
songs.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.020
And there was two other
people in the shop.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:38.230
And this guy came up to me-- the
meek piano shop owner came up

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.314
to me-- and said,
ma'am, I'm going

00:35:41.314 --> 00:35:42.480
to have to ask you to leave.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.900
I'm sorry.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.510
And I was like, but-- (CRYING).

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.400
I'm real.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.870
(STAMMERING) I-- I-- and I
went home and I blogged about

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.570
it and I gave the guy's address.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.680
And it was like, if you want
to stand up for what's right,

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.430
write them a letter
about who I really am.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:04.180
And I was 25 or something
and I was so hurt.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.150
And it's such a
perfect example of-- I

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.870
was just this wounded,
weeping mass of pus.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.210
And I had a choice in that
moment-- I could deal with it,

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:18.170
or I could lash out to
the only possible object

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.380
that I could aim at,
and it was this guy.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.784
And the next day, I
checked-- and this was back

00:36:23.784 --> 00:36:25.950
when I just emailed directly
back and forth with all

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.190
my fans-- like five people
had written me proud

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.620
emails being like, I wrote him
a three-page letter about how

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.820
amazing you are and how
wonderful your music is

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.604
and what a dick he is.

00:36:36.604 --> 00:36:38.312
And I was like, oh my
god, I'm actually--

00:36:38.312 --> 00:36:41.650
I'm now going to
ruin this guy's life.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.270
I have to put a stop to this.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.570
So I took the
address of the blog

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.620
and wrote like a cease
and desist to my fans

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.060
and was like, that was
a really weak moment,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.410
please don't bother the guy.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:58.120
He doesn't deserve your vitriol
any more than I deserved his.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.760
And I had a few of
those early days.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.470
And I still-- I feel
like I see so much

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.135
negativity and nastiness
on social media

00:37:10.135 --> 00:37:13.500
and on blogs and in
online journalism.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.350
It's so shitty.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:19.370
And it just cycles and gets
worse and worse by the day.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.750
I almost feel like I
can't go on the internet

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.720
without losing my mind nowadays.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.980
And I think people
don't realize even just

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.680
by making a snarky,
off-handed comment,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.430
they're contributing to the
cesspool of the internet.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.340
And so I feel like if I have
a responsibility at all,

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.270
it's just to remind
people you have a choice.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.820
You can live a life of
outrage constantly look around

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.560
the internet looking at who
you can be pissed off at,

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.860
or you can not.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.430
And you can just back away and
have those angry conversations

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.637
in bars with your angry friends.

00:37:56.637 --> 00:37:57.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:01.629 --> 00:38:02.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.380
Thank you for being here.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.830
So you've talked
about connecting

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:12.201
with people and your experiences
with the diverse people you've

00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:12.700
met.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.230
And I feel very sheltered in the
tech world and generally having

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:22.820
been to a top university
and then coming to Google.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.050
And I'm wondering if you have
any tips or thoughts on how

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:32.910
to reach out to different people
or connect with more people

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:36.794
than just those who are just
like me and already around me.

00:38:36.794 --> 00:38:38.210
AMANDA PALMER:
Wait, do you really

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:42.150
feel like the people of
Google are just like you?

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.520
AUDIENCE: In certain ways, yes.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.090
They come from
different backgrounds,

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.350
but they're here
because they reason

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.480
about things in similar
ways as me and they think

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.090
in similar ways to me.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.800
And I think we try really
hard to get diversity,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.430
but we get diversity that
all contributes to tech.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:05.260
And so it's diverse in
the domain it needs to be,

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.670
but I think it's
still narrowing.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:13.410
AMANDA PALMER: Well the
obvious answer-- and it may

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.560
seem like a stupid
answer, but how much time

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.620
do you spend outside of work?

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.324
Period.

00:39:19.324 --> 00:39:25.630
Because it may just be that
the change of environment

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.840
is more about what you need.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.070
I mean, I feel the same
thing in my life sometimes.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:35.350
Especially on tour where I met
like a bubble of Amanda Palmer

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.920
fans, which is not
a very-- they're

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.754
diverse in their own way, but
when they interact with me,

00:39:42.754 --> 00:39:43.920
they're not fucking diverse.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.211
When they interact with me,
all they want to talk about

00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:47.740
is Amanda Palmer.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.860
And that can get
really irritating.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.430
Not that I don't want
to give them what

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:55.560
they want, but they don't
generally come up to me

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.850
and just chat about other
totally unrelated, interesting

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.035
things.

00:40:03.035 --> 00:40:07.130
And so I go out of my
way to stay connected

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:10.160
with those outside of my bubble.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.270
Also just so I don't
start living my life

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:18.540
with celebrity blinders on.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.290
And I feel like that
has happened to me,

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.770
and I have to
constantly self-police

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:28.480
so that I don't just turn
into a machine of my own ego.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.220
And I look around at my
life and who feeds me

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.930
and what friends I have
from other areas who

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.360
don't give a shit
about the capital

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.480
Amanda Palmer, who just
know me as a person.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.980
And I reach out to them and
I email them and I text them

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.950
and I try to stay in touch with
people outside of my bubble,

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.370
just to make sure.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:50.100
I remind myself on a daily
basis that I am actually not

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.010
very special.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.010
I'm special to these
people in this building who

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:54.730
bought a ticket to
see me, but that's

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.750
a very small sliver
of the population.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.020
And even though my ego
is wonderfully fed by it

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.050
and I think it's
fantastic, it's not

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.630
a representation of
the world at large.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.770
And so whoever your
friends were pre-Google

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:19.070
or whoever is around you in
your environment outside work,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.090
making actual friends
with those people

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.927
is probably a step in
the right direction.

00:41:25.927 --> 00:41:26.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.190
AMANDA PALMER: You're welcome.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:33.090
And if you got the book-- it
just hit the best seller list

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.660
yesterday, which is against--

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.575
[CHEERING]

00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:36.670
Thank you.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:40.630
And that was against all odds, I
wasn't expecting it necessarily

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.470
to because it wasn't
sold on Amazon,

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.520
because the book's
on fucking Hachette.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.470
And so if you are following
the Amazon-Hachette wars,

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.700
I was one of the prime
victims of that war

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.970
and my fans went crazy
helping me promote the book.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.540
And it was one of the best-sold
books in indie bookstores

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.040
last week.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.990
Because my fans just
grassrooted the shit out of it.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.322
So it's still not easily
available on Amazon,

00:42:07.322 --> 00:42:08.280
but it's getting there.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.970
But you guys can really do me
a solid and if you like it,

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.280
spread it around or
pass the copy on.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.750
And it's also an
audio book, it's

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:20.640
an e-book, it's all the various
book, book, books that exist.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.720
And if he doesn't
make it here and you

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.280
happen to run into Michael
Gaiman, my stepson who

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.930
works here, give
him a hug for me.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.850
You'll embarrass him.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.095
It'll be great.

00:42:31.095 --> 00:42:33.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for speaking with us today.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.740
AMANDA PALMER: Thank you.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:34.680
AMANDA PALMER: It's
been a pleasure.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.870
Thank you guys.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.920
