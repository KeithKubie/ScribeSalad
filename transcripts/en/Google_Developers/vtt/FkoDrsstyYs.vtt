MIKE ALMERARIS: So I'm here
to talk to you guys today

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.360
about launching successful
VR and AR games with Google.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.850
Before we do that, I just
want to kind of set the stage

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.150
and say how important VR
and AR are to our mission

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.240
here at Google.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.570
We see them as kind
of the striking bound

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.920
of being the fourth
generation of computing.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.220
So again, if you think
about that supercomputer

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.000
back at IBM's headquarters years
ago to when Dell really made

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.224
the PC kind of
approachable to the point

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.390
that now we all have a
supercomputer in our pockets,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.890
we see VR and AR as leading
to that next-gen mixed reality

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.900
world of computing
that we're hoping to be

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.060
in in the next five years.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.160
So with us, how have
we kind of started

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.230
to kind of hit the scale on that
particular kind of achievement?

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.080
It's through Daydream and Tango.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.460
So we launched Daydream
on November 10th of 2016

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.190
at a $79 price point.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.099
And Daydream itself
wasn't just a headset,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.170
it was actually a
standard of phones.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.795
And I'll get into
that in a minute.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:09.170
And at the same
time, we actually

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.430
launched our AR
device, which is Tango,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.950
which is a software
stack built directly

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.690
into the hardware of phones.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.267
And that launched with
the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:21.600
So we're really, really excited.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.350
And you'll continue to see
these two platforms evolve

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.120
over the next two years.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.070
So when I start to
talk about Daydream,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.410
it's really important that
we separate the headset

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.420
from the actual
standard of phones.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.480
So Daydream Ready
is what we have

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.440
built into the hardware, which
is really about low persistence

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.370
displays.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.760
It's about low latency,
high-quality sensors,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.670
and it's about higher
performing SOCs.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.770
To achieve that,
we've built directly

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.090
into Android N in order to give
us sustained performance, head

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.070
tracking, and system
UI, which we're

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.417
really, really excited about.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.750
As part of that, we actually
just launched two new games

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.110
on Daydream, along with all
the other games and apps

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.780
that we currently
have since November.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.640
When we think about
gaming with Daydream,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.090
we really think about kind
of three major categories

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.990
for gaming.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.270
The first, we think about
fictional teleportation

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.340
narratives, which is
really about breaking

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.680
that barrier of why I
would put a headset on,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.640
and why I would want to immerse
myself and isolate myself

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.391
from the community around.

00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:26.390
The second kind of type
of gaming that we really

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.610
think about is
connected experiences

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.640
because what we don't want to do
is isolate ourselves too much.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.140
So we really want
to think about how

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.310
we collaborate in the same
virtual space together.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.930
And the third kind
of way is thinking

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.120
about adrenaline
rushes, things that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.880
are going to get my heart
pumping, whether it's racing

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.040
with EA's "Need for Speed"
or going through kind

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.184
of a haunted house maze with
"Layers of Fear" by Aspire.

00:02:50.184 --> 00:02:52.100
So we're really, really
excited to kind of see

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.920
what you guys can come up
with, and how we can get that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.630
into our platform.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.760
When it comes to Tango,
it's really important

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.490
that we think about
software that brings

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.450
a human scale to the world.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.710
It's still a phone.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.990
It's still looking
through a magic window.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.720
But it's taking advantage
of motion tracking, so full

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.280
six degrees of freedom.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.250
It's taking advantage of depth
perception, which is really

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.770
about scale and geometry,
and getting as close

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.160
to an object as you need to be,
or as far back from an object,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.970
and showing you real-world
what that object looks like.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.200
And when you combine
these two things together,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.950
you get what's called area
learning, which we're really

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.610
excited about.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.290
So being able to drop
objects into this room,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.180
for example, in augmented
reality, leaving the room,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.340
leaving the building,
even leaving the city,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.110
and coming back and
finding those objects

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.420
exactly where you left them,
which we're really, really

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.500
excited about.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.450
When we think about
Tango, we're really

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.190
thinking about
mobile games that can

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.340
be enhanced with this
augmented reality today.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.750
We're really thinking about
tabletop gaming, which, again,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.500
if we're all playing
in a world around us,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.680
and bringing those characters
to life right in front of us.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.410
Or we're thinking about the
living playground-- being

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.600
able to bring virtual
pets into our space,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.472
or bringing this room to life.

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:05.930
And so we're really
excited, again,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.910
to see what you guys
can come up with.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.730
And we're demoing some
of those cool new games

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.180
at our booth starting
on Wednesday.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.829
So as you start to think
about, OK, these are great.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.560
These platforms
seem really cool.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.510
But how do I actually
get discovered?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.480
Well, we've got
discoverability across both.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.670
The first is our
Daydream VR Play

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.530
Store, which when you
go into the headset

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.630
you go directly into.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.130
Daydream VR Play Store has full
IIP built directly into it.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.440
And every user of
Daydream is required

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.630
to have a form of
payment on file.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.560
So we're really, really excited
about driving monetization

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.030
for our developers.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.210
On the Tango side, we continue
to evolve how collections

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.410
work on the 2D Play
Store to, again,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.330
allow for discoverability
for our developers.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.270
You can self-publish
via Play dev

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.460
console today for
either platform.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.830
We know we heard our
developers loud and clear.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.984
We did launch with a more
curated platform for Daydream.

00:05:03.984 --> 00:05:05.650
And that was really
to put our processes

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.560
in place and kind of set the
bar of what quality means in VR.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.140
But we absolutely
encourage everyone today

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.655
to go ahead and self-publish.

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:16.280
And we want to take advantage of
all that great organic content

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.863
that you guys were
already working on,

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:20.300
and bring it to the
forefront for our users.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.510
Directions and how to do it
are located on our website.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.560
But we really recommend,
for monetization, really

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.290
thinking about a try
before you buy model.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.916
We know users really want
to understand duration

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.040
of what they're purchasing.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.080
They want to understand
the environment

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.340
of where they're going to be.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.840
And we really-- and
they really want

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.210
to understand the quality
of what you're delivering.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.985
So for us, as we've
kind of learned

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:44.360
over the last
three, four months,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.190
we really push
developers to think about

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.760
what does this try before
you buy model look like.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.100
So, thank you very much.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.450
