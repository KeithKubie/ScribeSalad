Now, for all you S.P.s

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.471
who can't afford
premium cable,

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:08.274
last week, HBO aired

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.777
a documentary
about Scientology.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.545
Spoiler alert:
it's a cult

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.515
and their buildings
are nothing but tax shelters.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.917
The one thing that
all members have in common

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.787
is that they are
mind-blowingly stupid.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.623
Oh, the reason L.R.H.
had horrible teeth

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.359
is because he generously gave
away all his toothbrushes

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:29.128
so people could clean
his toilets with them.

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.864
Spoiler-spoiler alert,
I am totally on board!

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.635
In fact, I declare myself
the new face of Scientology.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:39.072 line:0%
[cheers and applause]
- Tom Cruise is 52.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.941 line:0%
They need someone
who appeals to the millennials,

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:45.211
like, say,
a sprightly 39-year-old.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.546
[cheers and applause]

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.615
Much like T.C.,
I've been subjected to C.G.R.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.551
Plus, I love A.S.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.287
[cheers and applause]

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.289 line:0%
[laughter]

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.958 line:0%
And I, too, am happy
to turn a blind eye

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.829 line:0%
to the fact that this F.R.
was built entirely on S.L.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.163 line:0%
[cheers and applause]

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.467
Tom barely talks about
the intergalactic overlord Xenu,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.569
but I would never
shut up about it.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.137
[cheers and applause]

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.505
I'm no sci-fi fan,

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.141
but I've already invented
a thetan-proof vest.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.175
Yeah.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.977
It's made out of gravlons,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.980
which are harvested in space
from claster-droids.

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.248
Oh, oh, oh!

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.684
I just found a new thetan.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.453
Nope, just a fat deposit.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.055
The Church of Scientology

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:32.358
makes you sign
a billion-year contract,

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.062
which is fine
if you don't value loyalty.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.664
I force everyone
who works for me

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:41.467
to sign
a two-billion-year contract!

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.603
Not that they could quit,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.606
because I've been keeping
P.C.F.s on my staff

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.674
since D. one.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.276
For example,

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.211
Erik--
oh-oh-oh!

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:55.214
Has a mild-to-severe A.P.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:57.183
Should be in A.A.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.685
Nick--
oh, he's a P.S.D.

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.087
His file's thick,
my friend.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.022
Banged an L.P.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:07.226
CC exec Gary Mann has
a secret family in New Jersey

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.663
and was verbally molested
by a counselor at F.C.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.765
in the early '70s.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.968
I've already converted
an office closet into a P.C.,

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.906
and I'm officially declaring
<i> Tosh.0</i> a religion.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.742
Boom. Tax exempt.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.012
Eff the IRS!
Eff the IRS!

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.246
The war is over.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.148
You are all totally clear now.

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:32.051
You owe me $1,000 each.
Good night.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.021
[applause]
