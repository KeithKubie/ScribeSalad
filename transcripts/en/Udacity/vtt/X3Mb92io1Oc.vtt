00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.870
So I look to through documentation for AV Foundation framework.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.440
By the way, a link to this website is also available in the instructor notes.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.440
And in here when I scroll down,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.090
I came across this class called AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.920
Now this seems like a very verbose name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.490
But when I clicked on it,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.560
I found out that this class does exactly what we want to do.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.170
It says that AVAudioUnitTimePitch, provides good quality playback rate and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.090
pitch shifting.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.910
Now, if I read through this class,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.930
I find that it has a variable called pitch that I could change.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.210
The documentation says that the default value of this variable, Is 1.0 and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.670
the range of values for

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.150
this variable can be anywhere from negative 2400 to positive 2400.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.570
All of this seems really promising.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.530
All I need to do now, is to figure out how to use AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.120
And that's where you can help.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.640
Your challenge is to find an example, Of how to use AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.470
And it's okay if you find an example on the internet that you don't

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.710
fully understand yet.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.710
Specifically, I would love for you to identify any new websites that you thought

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.000
were promising, and then to try out any new code ideas that you discovered.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.420
