00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.562
 

00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:02.770
Now let's start to do some
more interesting problems.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.061
And one of these things that
you'll find in probability

00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:07.969
is that you can always do
a more interesting problem.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:09.510
So now I'm going to
think about-- I'm

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.010
going to take a
fair coin, and I'm

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.240
going to flip it three times.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.100
And I want to find the
probability of at least

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.450
one head out of the three flips.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.130
So the easiest way
to think about this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880
is how many equally likely
possibilities there are.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.170
In the last video, we saw
if we flip a coin 3 times,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.000
there's 8 possibilities.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.680
For the first flip,
there's 2 possibilities.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.620
Second flip, there's
2 possibilities.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.810
And in the third flip,
there are 2 possibilities.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.730
So 2 times 2 times 2-- there are
8 equally likely possibilities

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.090
if I'm flipping a coin 3 times.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.630
Now how many of
those possibilities

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.300
have at least 1 head?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.240
Well, we drew all the
possibilities over here.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.990
So we just have to
count how many of these

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.090
have at least 1 head.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.269
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.060
So 7 of these have at
least 1 head in them.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.390
And this last one does not.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.520
So 7 of the 8 have
at least 1 head.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.189
Now you're probably
thinking, OK, Sal.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.730
You were able to do
it by writing out

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.840
all of the possibilities.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.256
But that would be
really hard if I

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:21.730
said at least one
head out of 20 flips.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.900
This had worked well
because I only had 3 flips.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.710
Let me make it clear,
this is in 3 flips.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.516
 

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:31.890
This would have
been a lot harder

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.970
to do or more time consuming
to do if I had 20 flips.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.790
Is there some shortcut here?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.920
Is there some other
way to think about it?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.765
And you couldn't just do
it in some simple way.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:43.390
You can't just say,
oh, the probability

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.760
of heads times the probability
of heads, because if you got

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.200
heads the first
time, then now you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.839
don't have to get heads anymore.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:52.880
Or you could get heads
again-- you don't have to.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.750
So it becomes a little
bit more complicated.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.030
But there is an easy way
to think about it where

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.171
you could use this
methodology right over here.

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.920
You'll actually see
this on a lot of exams

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.129
where they make it seem
like a harder problem,

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.670
but if you just think about in
the right way, all of a sudden

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.340
it becomes simpler.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.980
One way to think about it is
the probability of at least

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.140
1 head in 3 flips
is the same thing--

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.250
this is the same thing--
as the probability of not

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.040
getting all tails, right?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.450
If we got all tails, then we
don't have at least 1 head.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.810
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.560
The probability of getting
at least 1 head in 3 flips

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.380
is the same thing
as the probability

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.810
of not getting all
tails in 3 flips.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.010
 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.420
So what's the probability
of not getting all tails?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.000
Well, that's going to be 1
minus the probability of getting

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.290
all tails.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.790
The probability of getting
all tails, since it's 3

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.790
flips, it's the probability
of tails, tails, and tails.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.870
Because any of the
other situations

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.780
are going to have at
least 1 head in them.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.529
And that's all of the
other possibilities,

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.760
and then this is the only
other leftover possibility.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.180
If you add them together,
you're going to get 1.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.040
Let me write it this way.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.110
Let me write it a
new color just so you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.100
see where this is coming from.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.520
The probability of not all
tails plus the probability

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.820
of all tails-- well, this
is essentially exhaustive.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.990
This is all of the
possible circumstances.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.830
So your chances of getting
either not all tails

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.310
or all tails-- and these
are mutually exclusive,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.350
so we can add them.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.860
The probability of not all
tails or, just to be clear

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.170
what we're doing, the
probability of not all tails

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:01.370
or the probability of all tails
is going to be equal to one.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.890
These are mutually exclusive.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.250
You're either going to
have not all tails, which

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.280
means a head shows up.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.810
Or you're going
to have all tails.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.310
But you can't have both
of these things happening.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.860
And since they're
mutually exclusive

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.568
and you're saying the
probability of this

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:16.269
or this happening, you could
add their probabilities.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.570
And this is essentially
all of the possible events.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.600
So this is essentially,
if you combine these,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.920
this is the probability of
any of the events happening.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.560
And that's going to
be a 1 or 100% chance.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.560
So another way to think
about is the probability

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.270
of not all tails
is going to be 1

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.300
minus the probability
of all tails.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.460
So that's what we
did right over here.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.370
And the probability of all
tails is pretty straightforward.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.990
That's the probability
of it's going

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.370
to be 1/2, because you have
a 1/2 chance of getting

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.106
a tails on the
first flip, times--

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:52.480
let me write it here, so we
can have it a little clearer.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.900
So this is going to be 1 minus
the probability of getting

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.779
all tails.

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.570
You will have a 1/2
chance of getting tails

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.030
on the first flip,
and then you're

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.580
going to have to get another
tails on the second flip,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.080
and then you're
going to have to get

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.650
another tails on the third flip.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.030
And then 1/2 times
1/2 times 1/2.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.670
This is going to be 1/8.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.300
And then 1 minus
1/8 or 8/8 minus 1/8

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.960
is going to be equal to 7/8.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.300
So we can apply that to
a problem that is harder

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.100
to do than writing
all of the scenarios

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.475
like we did in
the first problem.

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:32.600
 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.360
Let's say we have 10 flips,
the probability of at least one

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:50.130
head in 10 flips-- well,
we use the same idea.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.770
This is going to be equal
to the probability of not

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.285
all tails in 10 flips.

00:06:01.285 --> 00:06:03.561
 

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.060
So we're just saying
the probability

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.600
of not getting all of the
flips going to be tail.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.850
All of the flips is tails--
not all tails in 10 flips.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.690
And this is going to be 1 minus
the probability of flipping

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.780
tails 10 times.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.325
So it's 1 minus
10 tails in a row.

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:26.590
 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.720
And so this is going to be equal
to this part right over here.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.620
Let me write this.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.462
So this is going to be this one.

00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:33.420
Let me just rewrite it.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.670
This is equal to 1 minus-- and
this part is going to be, well,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.440
one tail, another tail.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.390
So it's 1/2 times 1/2.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.806
And I'm going to
do this 10 times.

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:45.670
 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.790
Let me write this
a little neater.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:56.970
1/2-- so that's 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.190
And so we really just have to--
the numerator is going to be 1.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.640
So this is going to be 1.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.210
This is going to be equal to 1.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.490
Let me do it in that
same color of green.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.210
This is going to be equal
to 1 minus-- our numerator,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.630
you just have 1 times
itself 10 times.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.920
So that's 1.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.620
And then on the denominator,
you have 2 times 2 is 4.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:32.330
4 times 2 is 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,
256, 512, 1,024-- over 1,024.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:42.260
This is the exact same thing
as 1 is 1024 over 1024 minus 1

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:55.150
over 1024, which is equal
to 1,023 over 1,024.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.600
We have a common
denominator here.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:03.830
So 1,000-- I'm doing that
same blue-- over 1,024.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.424
So if you flip a coin 10
times in a row-- a fair coin--

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:09.340
you're probability of
getting at least 1 heads

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.450
in that 10 flips is pretty high.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.260
It's 1,023 over 1,024.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.419
And you can get a calculator
out to figure that out

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:17.460
in terms of a percentage.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.080
Actually, let me just
do that just for fun.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.710
So if we have 1,023 divided
by 1,024 that gives us-- you

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.690
have a 99.9% chance
that you're going

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.770
to have at least one heads.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.330
So this is if we round.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.034
This is equal to 99.9% chance.

00:08:40.034 --> 00:08:41.159
And I rounded a little bit.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.909
It's actually slightly, even
slightly, higher than that.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.580
And this is a pretty powerful
tool or a pretty powerful way

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.660
to think about it because
it would have taken you

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.610
forever to write all
of the scenarios down.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.450
In fact, there would have been
1,024 scenarios to write down.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.000
So doing this
exercise for 10 flips

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.484
would have taken
up all of our time.

00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:04.900
But when you think about in a
slightly different way, when

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.260
you just say, look the
probability of getting at least

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.140
1 heads in 10 flips
is the same thing

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.370
as the probably of
not getting all tails.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.110
And that's 1 minus
the probability

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.710
of getting all tails.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.867
And this is actually a pretty
easy thing to think about.

00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:19.367
