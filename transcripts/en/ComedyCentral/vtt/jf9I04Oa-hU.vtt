- [Nathan Voiceover]
If you're handing over

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.870
your computer to a stranger,

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:06.806
there's nothing you care
more about than your privacy,

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.341
so for computer repair shops

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.676
like Los Angeles-based Cyberguy,

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.279
earning customers' trust
is a huge struggle.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.514
- We are saying them,

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:17.150
we are not gonna looking
at the files and folders,

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.752
or private files, but they don't
trust.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:20.586
(soft piano music)

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.554
- [Nathan Voiceover] The reason
is

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.456
that most of us have
things on our computer

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.224
that we don't want seen.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.326
As someone with a recurring
medical issue,

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.961
I keep photos on my laptop

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.531
that are meant only for my
doctor's eyes,

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.266
and when my computer breaks
down,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.601
I can never be certain
that a repair technician

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.570
won't be tempted to snoop.

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:40.640
But fortunately for Cyberguy
owner Herman Akbiyik,

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:41.941
I had a solution.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.376
- Your biggest problem is,

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.011
no matter how much you tell your
customers

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:49.015
you're not gonna look at
their nude or sexy pics,

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.217
they'll always be skeptical

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.886
because you're a sexual being,
right?

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:56.889
- Okay, so, whatever desire I
have,

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:00.293
it's not gonna be affecting my
business.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.194
- What do you mean?

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.296
- Okay, if you don't eat foods,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.165
you're hungry always, okay?

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.032
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.368
- If you eat food, you're gonna
be full.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.939
You don't feel anymore your
hunger.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.307
- Right.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.277
- So if you don't
pleasure yourself at home,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.446
maybe you're gonna feel it at
the office,

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.281
or while walking on the street,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:25.017
you can feel those desires, in a
way.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.988
- So you're saying you pleasure
yourself so much at home

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.390
that it doesn't affect you at
work.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:32.258
- Correct.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.226
(ominous music)

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.160
- [Nathan Voiceover]
Despite Herman's claim

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.828
that he gets everything out of
his system

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.897
before arriving at work each
morning,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.466
his customers will never
completely trust him

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.468
because he's a sexual being.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.637
But if Herman recruited repair
technicians

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.339
from the one percent of
Americans

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.541
who identify as asexual,

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:51.777
meaning they have no
sexual desires whatsoever,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.646
customers could finally feel
confident

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.515
about getting their computers
repaired

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.916
without the staff being tempted

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:59.318
to look at their private photos.

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:01.254
The plan, put customers at ease

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:06.225
by offering the world's first
asexual computer repair.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:07.092
- I see.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:10.463
When they see any image, nude
image,

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:14.234
so they're not gonna be
desired or affecting?

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.202
- In theory, yes.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.503
- In theory, I see.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:18.771
- [Nathan Voiceover] Neither
Herman nor I

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.773
knew much about asexuality,

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.742
but he was willing to give it a
shot.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.479
So I went to the internet's
most popular asexuality forum

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.481
and posted a job notification to
see

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:31.884
if anyone would fit the
criteria that Herman would need,

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.020
and later that week, I set up
interviews

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.688
with everyone who responded.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.590
- You know, just the lack of
feeling,

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:40.393
a sexual attraction, and need
for sex,

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.729
is all that asexuality truly is,

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:45.698
and there's a spectrum to it
too.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.700
- So if you're not thinking
about sex,

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.569
what are you thinking about?

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:50.436
- Well, it always depends.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.804
I mean, I suppose, most of the
time,

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.907
I'm actually thinking about
superheroes,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.175
my favorite of which being
Aquaman,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.810
hence the orange shirt.

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:59.545
- So when most people are
thinking of sex,

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.547
you're thinking of Aquaman?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.648
- Well, that's a funny way of
putting it,

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.250
but I suppose so.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.084
- [Nathan Voiceover] After
learning more

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.086
about the asexual lifestyle,

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.522
I was feeling optimistic
that this could work.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.124
- So right now, sitting across
from me,

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:14.527
you feel no sexual attraction?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.263
- No, you're another person to
me.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.264
- Whoa.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:20.933
- I was born an asexual,

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:25.137
and I assume that I
shall still be an asexual

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.373
upon leaving this world.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:29.242
- [Nathan Voiceover] So after
a rigorous vetting process

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.110
using a heart rate monitor to
judge

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:33.079
their physical response to a
series

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.816
of stimulating images I found
in a stock photo database ...

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.919
- Do you find this sexual
arousing?

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:41.587
- No.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.989
- [Nathan Voiceover] I
offered the job to the two

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:45.124
who showed no spike in heart
rate

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:48.094
no matter how stimulating the
image was.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.863
So the next day, I brought
the new recruits to Cyberguy

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:52.431
to introduce them to Herman.

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:54.967
- So this is Nicky and Randy,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.536
and they're asexual, which means

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.172
they don't have a desire to look

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:04.177
at any customers' private
nudes or sexy photos.

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.880
You know, they just
don't have those urges.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.416
- And also a sense of privacy, I
mean.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.984
- Yeah, definitely, privacy is

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:14.120
important to everybody.
- Not because

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.454
of asexuality.

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:18.858
- Right, but someone like
Herman might be tempted.

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.226
- Yeah, possibility.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.895
- Right, yeah, but you
wouldn't be tempted ever?

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:23.729
- No, no, no.

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:26.132
- Right, so that's why.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.067
- [Nathan Voiceover] Their
lack of arousal was perfect,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.636
but they still weren't computer
experts.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.538
- I've removed viruses
from computers before,

00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:34.140
but with instructions.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.108
- [Nathan Voiceover] So
knowing they would need

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.810
Herman's close guidance
when doing a repair,

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:40.746
I installed a series of walls
in the back of the store

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.382
to create a quarantined
viewing booth for Herman

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:44.950
so the repair area would remain

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:47.586
free of sexual contamination.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:50.189
The only access point
into the inner chamber

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:52.792
was through a military-grade key
code lock

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:55.528
that only the asexuals
would have the code to.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.164
So after putting up a
brand new banner out front

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.066
and giving the repair staff
their code

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.134
to enter the desexualized zone
...

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.270
- The code is 1234, okay?

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.208
So don't tell Herman, okay.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.643
- [Nathan Voiceover] The
securely sealed themselves

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:12.478
inside the repair area

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:16.849
while me and Herman waited
for customers up front.

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:18.217
- You didn't see the code,
right?

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.218
- No, I didn't.

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.286
- Do you promise?

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.321
- I promise.

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:27.427
- Okay.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.865
- [Nathan Voiceover] Before
long,

00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:34.500
the first customer arrived.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.369
- It's very slow,

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.237
and it's hard for me to get
to the internet sometimes.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.138
- [Nathan Voiceover] So it was
time to see

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:41.540
if he'd be impressed by the new
service.

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:43.442
- I don't know if you saw our
sign,

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:46.245
but we're the only computer
repair shop in town

00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:49.482
that offers a fully
asexual repair service.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.316
- Okay.

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.918
- Are you familiar with
asexuals?

00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:53.986
- No, I'm not.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.656
- Okay, so the entire time
your computer is here,

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.193
no one with any sexual
desires will be touching it,

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:03.863
and that is the Cyberguy
guarantee, right?

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.832
- Yes, for sure, 100% guarantee
that.

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:10.903
- Full disclosure, Herman
is a sexual person,

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:14.240
but he will not be touching
your computer at any point.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.709
- What does that mean,
he's a sexual person?

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:20.313
- Yeah, that means, a
sexual person, as me,

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:24.784
so we having some desires
for looking at the picture,

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:28.320
digging, looking inside, so
we're curious

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:31.490
about what is inside,
what's contained inside,

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:34.126
it's a nude photos, videos,
stuff.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.761
- So he has those desires.

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:37.463
- But the other people don't?

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:39.965
- They don't, the people
that will be repairing it.

00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:40.900
- [Nathan Voiceover]
The first customer was

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:42.568
excited by the concept.

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.004
(bell rings)

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:49.708
- So now an asexual is coming
up?

00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:50.943
- Yes.
- Got you.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.479
(dramatic music)
