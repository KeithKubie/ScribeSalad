00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:06.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We
welcome Manuel Bronstein,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.640
VP of Product Management
here at Google,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.620
to talk to us about the next
generation Google Assistant.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.870
Manuel, thanks for joining us.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.360
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
let's go really big picture

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.550
for a moment.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.100
When you think about how
the Google Assistant changes

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.698
peoples' everyday lives for the
better, what does it look like?

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:25.240
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Yeah, so when
we thought about the product,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.020
we want it to be--

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.000
our mission is to be the
best way to get things done.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.170
And when we say best, we
think about seamless, fastest,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.728
easiest way to get things done.

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:36.770
And if you think about a
world, in some ways it's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.880
getting more complex, right?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.300
Every time you try
to do something,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.508
you need to think about not
only what you want to do,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.430
but the how.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.600
And if we do our
job right, and we're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.250
investing to make
it happen, you want

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.160
to be able to go from "Why
do I want to get done?"

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.860
to getting it done without
having to worry about the "how"

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.880
in many ways.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.370
And our hope is that
that saves you time.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.453
And we all know how
important it is for all of us

00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:59.870
to get a little bit more time
to do all the things that we

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.840
care about.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.480
So we're very proud
to be investing

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.897
in making the
product the best way

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.508
to get things done, in many
ways to give users time back.

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.300
EMILY FORTUNA: So the
Assistant is becoming

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.590
more and more personalized.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.670
How does that help us as well?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.430
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: So
think about-- when

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.690
people think about
an Assistant, they're

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.107
thinking about a
product that it's

00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:18.440
going to learn from them,
that is going to understand

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.580
what they're saying.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.290
And in order for the system to
understand what you're saying,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.080
it needs to understand
your role, right.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.630
If I say, "Call my wife."

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.130
It needs to know that my wife
is [? Arianna ?] and what number

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.630
to call.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.990
If I say, "Set an
appointment for my kids."

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.790
It should understand
who my kids are.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.920
So when the Assistant
starts getting to know you,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.560
or even knows where is
home, where is work,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.410
so that I can go,
hey, when I'm asking

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.000
it to give me a direction, I
said like, "Drive me work."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.260
It can understand that.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.510
This is something that becomes
more useful because you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.130
can speak to it in
a more natural way.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.360
You don't have to
think about addresses

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.590
or you don't have to
think about commands.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.300
You just speak to
it the same way

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.980
you would speak to a
friend, and then it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.397
will understand
what you're trying

00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:58.578
to do and help you get it done.

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:00.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What is
your favorite new feature

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.980
that Assistant announced
today, and why?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.625
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: I mean it's
really hard to pick a favorite.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.000
The team worked really, really
hard on many of the things

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.470
that we announced today.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.020
I think that when you
think about the promise

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.210
of the Assistant being the
best way to get things done,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.075
when it starts
getting really fast,

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.450
and what we announced with
the next-generation Assistant,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.220
and one of the key
things about it--

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.450
and we're saying it in
a very proud way, which

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.380
is, imagine that it starts
understanding you so fast, so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.310
quickly, that speaking to your
phone is faster than tapping.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.920
Or that tapping your phone
is going to feel slow.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.200
That's when you know
that you hit something

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.940
that could change
your user behavior

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.790
and get people to start
embedding themselves

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.540
into this product.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.750
Because it's actually
becoming very simple, but also

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.910
very fast and very
efficient in helping you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.923
get your tasks done.

00:02:49.923 --> 00:02:51.090
EMILY FORTUNA: That's great.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.632
So in the past couple
of years, we've

00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:54.690
seen Assistant play
a much larger role

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.760
in homes and phones.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.810
And now in driving.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.810
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Right.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.580
EMILY FORTUNA: So
can you tell us

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.810
about the experience for
drivers and what that's like?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.010
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Yeah.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.860
You know, I mean, when you
think about using your voice

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.450
and being hands-free--

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.950
actually, you know, the car is
a perfect environment for it,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.450
right?

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.130
Hopefully people are driving
and they're looking at the road,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.180
they're not looking
at their phones,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.220
they're not touching the screen.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hands-free driving.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.840
MANUEL BRONSTEIN:
Hands-free driving.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's hands
on wheel, not on the phone.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.223
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Correct.

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:21.840
So when you can think
about it, actually the car

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.910
is one of the places
where the system can

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.170
be even more helpful, right?

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.770
But the car is a
hard environment

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.250
because if your windows are
down, there's a lot of noise,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.758
you may lose connectivity,
and so forth.

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:36.300
But one of the things
that we started

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.513
thinking about is let's
start from the user,

00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:39.930
and what is that
thing that you're

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.390
trying to get done when
you're in your car?

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.310
And there are mainly
three things, right?

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.080
You're trying to
navigate from point A

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.510
to point B. You want to
get to the place hopefully

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.875
fast and safe.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.620
You also want to make sure
that when you're in the car

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.010
you can get entertained.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.170
So you want to listen to
music or podcast or radio.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.893
And then of course you sometimes
want to communicate, right.

00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:02.310
You want to make
a phone call, you

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.520
want to receive a text message,
or send a text message.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.455
And think about doing all
these things with your hands

00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:10.080
while you're driving,
it's probably not

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.038
the right way to do it.

00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:12.100
It's not safe.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.520
But when you start doing
each of these scenarios,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.589
like driving from
point A to point B,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.209
communicating, or
listening to media,

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.430
and you can control
that with your voice

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.920
and it understands exactly
what you're trying to get done,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.570
then the product
becomes very magical

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.210
because it's really solving a
real need and a real problem

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.813
in an environment
that needs that help.

00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:31.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Can you talk to us

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.750
about how the next generation
of the Google Assistant

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.425
will change the way that
people interact with it?

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:37.800
MANUEL BRONSTEIN:
Yeah, so if you

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.900
think about when you start
forgetting about the how,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.570
and you start worrying about
what is it that you want to do,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.107
you start relying on the
product in a very different way.

00:04:50.107 --> 00:04:52.440
That's when the behavior
change starts to happen, right?

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.600
So in the first phase
of the Assistant,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.580
it should be very
responsive to you, right?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.380
It should understand
what you're saying

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.390
and then help you get it done.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.670
As the product starts
learning from you,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.710
you can start getting
more proactive, right.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.510
So now when I get
in my car it can

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.550
flash to me some missed calls
or voicemails that I have,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.550
so that if I want
to return that call,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.080
I'm reminded of that, right?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.510
Or if it knows
that in my calendar

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.750
I have an appointment at 7:00
PM and it's 6:00 PM or 6:30

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.420
and I haven't left, and it also
knows information of where I'm

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.173
trying to go, and
knows the traffic,

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:24.840
it could actually
send me a notification

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.420
and let me know,
hey, you're probably

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.420
going to be a late if
you don't leave now.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.180
And it's very interesting
when the product

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.130
starts getting more proactive.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.870
I think that we're
going to see a switch.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.980
I mean, I see it a
lot with my kids.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.680
In the same way that when the
screens became touch screens,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.830
and people felt that
every screen is touchable,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.810
and you see a little kid
and they see an old TV

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.950
and they try to
touch on the screen,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.242
and the screen doesn't work.

00:05:48.242 --> 00:05:49.950
I think that people
are going to get used

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.600
to talking to their products.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.300
And expecting that
the product will

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.000
understand what you're saying
in a natural way and help you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.500
get it done.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.583
And I think that we're
going to see that evolution

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:02.190
from basically understanding
your commands, what you want

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.070
to do and help you get it done,
to getting very proactive,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.670
personal, and more helpful.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.640
So anticipating your
needs and the things

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.300
that you're trying
to accomplish.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.920
EMILY FORTUNA: So you've got
Assistant on your phone, home,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.400
and now driving.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.858
Where do you see Assistants
going in the future?

00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:18.650
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: So
it's a great question.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.590
Look, I think that a personal
assistant needs to be with you.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.500
So of course a lot of the
work the team has been doing

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.405
is making sure that the
product is available

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:28.530
where you need it the most.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.197
I don't know necessarily
that it's going

00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:32.010
to go to different places.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.750
I mean, at the end of the day,
we spend time in our homes,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.960
we spend time at work, we
spend time in our cars,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.580
we spend time with our phones.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.740
Maybe too much time
with our phones.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.140
But if the product can
always be with you,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.420
then it can help you fulfill
some of those things.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.750
I think that in the future,
what I'm hoping it helps--

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.310
I mean, if you think
about the areas

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.190
where people spend time
trying to get things done,

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.040
but they wish that--

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.063
when I think about it, when
you want to go to a restaurant,

00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:00.480
the act of going
to the restaurant

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.640
and having a nice
meal is awesome.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.527
Maybe calling to make a
reservation is not that great.

00:07:05.527 --> 00:07:07.860
But if this product can start
doing those things for you

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.030
and remove that load from you,
it becomes incredibly useful.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.280
So I think that if you think
about more of those tasks

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.070
that people are trying to get
done, and help you anticipate

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.440
it, find that ticket
for an event for you

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.340
that you want to go to, making
that appointment for you,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.470
and getting predictive
about those things,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.980
then the product becomes
extremely magical.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Before you leave us,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.150
are there any hints you can
give us to find some Easter

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.170
eggs in the Assistant?

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.128
MANUEL BRONSTEIN: Sure.

00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:37.560
We recently launched a new
voice for the Assistant

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.955
with John Legend.

00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:40.107
And it's pretty cool.

00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:42.690
And if you asked-- actually, if
you turn the voice to the John

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.232
Legend voice on the
Assistant and you

00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:46.440
ask it to sing a song for
you or sing happy birthday,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.524
you are going to hear John
Legend singing for you.

00:07:48.524 --> 00:07:49.830
And it's actually pretty cool.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.580
EMILY FORTUNA:
Thank you, Manuel,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.240
so much for sharing
your insight.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.823
MANUEL BRONSTEIN:
So great to be here.

00:07:53.823 --> 00:07:56.390
