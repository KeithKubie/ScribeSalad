00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:03.670
And now it's time to play
Tattoos of the Heart.

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:05.639
Tattoos of the Heart.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.944
There are two kinds
of tattoos people get--

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.412
the ones where
a drunk person thinks,

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.615
"Hey, my navel
will make a great cat anus!"

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.684
and just in case you thought
we made that up, here.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.188
Mm-hmm.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.024
Yeah.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.959
And the ones that have
personal meaning behind them.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.362
Like, you had
a really important relationship

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.131
with your cat's anus.
Uh...

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.102
Just that special weekend
when you were snowed in.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.872
And Mittens just kind of looked
at you from behind, like...

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.341
-(meows)
-No, Mittens, no.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.977
(meows)

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.213
Meow, Flula, meow.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.648
BORG:
No.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:51.485
Stop it, Mittens.
Go back to your podium, Mittens.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.455
Oh, fine, Mittens, fine.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.094
-(hisses)
-Oh!

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.004
So comedians, I'm gonna show you
a picture of a tattoo

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.740
and for 250 points you have to
tell me the meaning behind it.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:16.476
First up, this
curious sea creature.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.812
This curious sea creature.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.049
Huh?
Hungry for toffee, he's a shark.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.717
What could...
What is that, Flula?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.586
I think it's to promote
awareness

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.554
for shark type 2 diabetes.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.791
Points.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:34.127
It's a real problem.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:37.030
Next, a childhood friend.

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.199
Huh?

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:43.136
It's a little Gumby
with a... eye infection? Uh...

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.005
James.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:47.241
The story behind this
is that the guy

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:49.576
clearly got
catfished by Gumby.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.812
Yeah.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.315
-Points.
-You got to...

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.017
Flula.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.254
It was, uh, supposed to be,
uh, Gumby fisting,

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:04.224
uh, but the artist
didn't hear it right.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.593
Points.

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.863
Fi... Aw, come on.

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:11.265
Jen.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.233
It's a guy
who's commemorating that

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.335
there's plenty of fish
in the sea except for him.

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.803
He's a weirdo, lonely loser.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.873
Yeah, okay, points.
Points, points.

00:02:19.907 --> 00:02:23.243
Next one, this
very painful receipt.

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.812
Right here.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:27.314
(bell dings)

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.815
Uh, Flula.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.517
This is so
he will always remember

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:33.687
where he conceived
his third child.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.022
KIRKMAN:
Got a lot of stuff.

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:36.823
Points.

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.292
James.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.161
This guy hates his dad.
His dad works at Wendy's.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:44.498
-(bleep) you, Dad.
-Yeah, points. Mm-hmm.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.405
Uh, next one, what about
this tasteful wrench?

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:54.575
This very tasteful wrench
right there. Jen.

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:56.944
That is someone who
needs to remind themselves

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.112
that they are a tool.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.649
At all times.
Mm-hmm.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.451
(whooping)

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.054
-Thank you, thank you,
thank you. -Good one.

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:09.556
Do you know this person?
It says #Berlin.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.327
We have met once.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.028
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:15.128
Chill D Tattoo
is very friendly.
