Now for the big quiz.

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:05.806
In all seriousness, this is the most
complicated exercise

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.270
I've given you so far this lesson.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.100
I want you to implement the DetailsView 
using the CursorLoader

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.426
and multiple TextView widgets.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.522
And I've got some hints for you.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:23.200
Use loaders not adapters. 
What does this mean?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.913
Well, it makes sense.

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:28.860
Your DetailView does not contain a list,
so you don't need to use an adapter.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.113
but you can still use the loader pattern.

00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:35.776
The loader pattern will automatically
observe for changes in the URI

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:37.810
with a CursorLoader.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.850
The second thing you want
to do is pass the date into your intent.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.450
The date is the important thing

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.640
that the DetailView needs
to have passed into it,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.540
to properly query the content provider.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.603
Now remember, you can actually get 
the current location settings

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:54.816
from the utility function.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:59.070
So all you really need is the date. 
I hope that helps.
