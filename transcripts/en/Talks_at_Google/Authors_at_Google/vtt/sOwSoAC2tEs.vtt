00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:09.080
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.180
Thanks for coming.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm here to introduce
Amanda Gefter and her book,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.040
"Trespassing on
Einstein's Lawn."

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.590
And I came to this book
through a confluence

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.680
of several factors.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.070
My late father was a physicist
and had the opportunity

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.130
to exchange a few letters
with Einstein himself

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.800
and always had them locked
away in the safe deposit box.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.580
It was always a
special family thing.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.610
And separately, he
and my mother used

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.680
to go to a particular Chinese
restaurant in Philadelphia

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.600
all the time, and the young
five-year-old son of the owners

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.390
would always hang
around, being playful.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.030
But he also liked
math a lot, and my dad

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.370
started tutoring him in math.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.890
The young man grew
up, went to Wharton,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.390
and is now at Khosla
Partners, a venture

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.270
capitalist out in
Silicon Valley.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.380
So my dad helped spawn a
Silicon Valley hotshot.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.820
So when I heard of Amanda's book
and that it involved Einstein,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.980
physics, fathers, Chinese
restaurants, and Philadelphia,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.520
where I'm from, I realized
this was a book I had to read.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.302
So without further
ado, Amanda Gefter.

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:28.492
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:29.950
AMANDA GEFTER: So
first I just want

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.799
to thank Google so much
for hosting me here today.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.840
It's a real privilege to
be here in this building

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.840
and to get to talk
to all of you.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.480
So when I was 15
years old my father

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.370
took me out to dinner at our
favorite Chinese restaurant

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.270
and asked me how I
would define nothing.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.670
And this was an odd dinner
table question but not

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.770
entirely out of character
for my father, who

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.180
was this sort of Zen
guru, former hippy

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.850
turned radiologist.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.560
And so I said I
would define nothing

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.330
as the absence of something
or the absence of everything.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.500
And really this is how everyone
defines nothing, as a void.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140
But my father had
a different idea.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.740
He had been thinking about
this for a while, he told me.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.800
And the other day he
had had an epiphany.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.520
He was at the mechanics
waiting for his car to be fixed

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.350
and it dawned on him that
you could define nothing

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.990
as "an infinite, unbounded,
homogeneous state."

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.560
So a state of
utter sameness that

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560
extends, without bound, forever.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.260
And this wasn't
a semantic trick.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.370
An infinite,
unbounded, homogeneous

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.190
state would literally be
indistinguishable from a void.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.500
It's nothing.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.790
But my father thought it was
an interesting definition

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.730
because it defined
nothing not in terms

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.094
of what it isn't but
in terms of what it is.

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:53.510
And so he explained
all this to me

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.230
over a plate of cashew chicken.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.380
And then he asked
me, do you think

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.660
this could help explain
how the universe began?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.020
Now you have to bear in mind,
I'm his teenage daughter.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.570
I was not exactly the
most well-behaved kid.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.080
I would not be
described as studious.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.780
I was failing math class.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.770
I was not even
taking physics class.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.180
I had opted for
meteorology because that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.760
was what my high school
offered in place of physics

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.060
for the underachievers.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.680
And here my father is asking
me how the universe began.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.690
And he just sort of shrugged
like it was a normal thing

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.330
to do and said, I think
we should figure it out.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.490
And so that is how,
at 15 years old,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.800
I found myself on a
mission to figure out

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.925
the origin of the universe.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.850
So my father and I started
teaching ourselves physics.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.530
We stayed up late
every night, we

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.030
started amassing a crazy
collection of physics books,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.370
reading everything we
could get our hands on,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.220
and talking about
all these ideas

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.520
until my mother would
yell at us to go to bed.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.370
Because if you want to
understand this something that

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.260
came from nothing when
the universe was born,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.600
you have to look at
both sides of the coin.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.540
So my father had already thought
long and hard about the nothing

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.110
part, and now we needed to
understand the something.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.690
And that's what physics is.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.660
Incidentally, before I
started this secret project

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.720
with my dad, I had no
idea what physics was.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.050
I didn't take physics class
because I thought that physics

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.860
was like a set of
rules and numbers

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.190
for describing how
levers and pulleys work.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.520
And now I know that
physics is about uncovering

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.780
the reality behind appearances.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.885
It's about glimpsing this
deep and hidden architecture

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:46.070
of existence itself.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.760
It's about embracing the
fact that the world is not

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.200
what it seems and that
everything is stranger

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.112
and simpler than we can
imagine, and yet comprehensible.

00:04:55.112 --> 00:04:57.070
And I think if I had
known that from the start,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.686
I wouldn't have
taken meteorology.

00:05:00.686 --> 00:05:02.310
But eventually I
graduated high school,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.800
and I move to New
York City for college.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.610
And then when I
finish college I did

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.720
what any physics-loving,
amateur reality hunter would do,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.480
and I took a job at
a bridal magazine.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.200
So I was working as an
assistant at "Manhattan Bride."

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.260
And I was there in the
office, which was really

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.770
just the one-bedroom apartment
of a guy named Rick, when

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.350
I read an article in
"The New York Times"

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.140
announcing this huge physics
conference that was going

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.840
to be happening in
Princeton, New Jersey

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.180
called Science and
Ultimate Reality.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.020
And all the world's
leading physicists

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.860
were going to gather there
to talk about their most

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.250
cutting-edge ideas.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.560
So I'm reading this
article and a light bulb

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.320
goes off over my head.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.390
I wait until Rick
leaves for lunch

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.800
and then I pick up the
phone, I call the people

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.290
in charge of publicity
for the conference,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.410
and in the most
professional voice

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.911
that I can muster I lie and
say that I am a journalist

00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:02.410
and that I'm calling
from "Manhattan

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.940
Magazine," because
that sounded better,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.431
and that I wanted to
come cover the event.

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:11.550
Oh, of course, we would
love you to come, they said.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.740
Great, I said, put
me down plus one.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.280
Now in that moment,
I had no idea

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.420
how that one little
lie would forever

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.990
alter the course of my life.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.260
But I called my dad and
I said, pack your bags,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.160
we're going to Princeton.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.030
So my dad and I
show up in Princeton

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.030
and we crash this
physics conference,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.970
posing as journalists.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.410
We found our press badges
at the press table.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.870
Mine said "Manhattan Magazine,"
I had a blank for my plus one.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.550
And we put them around our
necks and just wandered

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.870
amongst our heroes
like two idiot deer

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.870
caught in genius headlights.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.050
We got to listen to
these physicists lecture

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.080
about their most recent ideas
about the nature of reality.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.310
And then, as if that
wasn't good enough,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.240
we got to go into this
magical little room

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.330
that they call the press
room, where you sit down

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.800
and they deliver
to you, one by one,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.030
each physicist so you
can ask them questions.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.980
It was the most amazing
experience of my entire life.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.006
And when the conference
let out, my father and I

00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:21.130
just sort of wandered
through the town of Princeton

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.410
in a daze, talking about
everything we had just heard.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.880
And eventually we
found ourselves

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.671
on Mercer Street, which
is the street where

00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:29.350
Einstein had lived.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.702
And we found his
house at 112 Mercer.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.535
It was undergoing some
sort of construction,

00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:37.570
so it was sort of cordoned
by yellow tape like a murder

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.070
scene.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.630
But we just stood there
in awe, trespassing

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.120
on Einstein's lawn, two bogus
press badges still hanging

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.570
around our necks.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.710
And it struck me then that
this little private hobby

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.680
that I shared with
my dad was maybe

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.580
going to be something bigger.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.360
And it also dawned
on me that I was not

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.640
ready to give up this journalism
front because it was just

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.480
too good to be true.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.521
All you need is this press
badge and suddenly you

00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.570
can learn physics directly
from the physicists.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.750
I figured the "Manhattan
Magazine" scam wouldn't

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.220
work for long
because someone was

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.120
bound to look it up and
see that it didn't exist.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.060
But I figured I would
use it one more time.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.240
So when I got back to New
York I called an editor

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.155
at "Scientific American."

00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.780
Again I lied and said that I was
a journalist at the "Manhattan

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.840
Magazine" and that I had
been to this conference

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.210
and that I wanted to
cover it, or write

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.039
an article about physics
for their magazine.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.419
And miraculously he agreed.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.570
So my article comes out
in "Scientific American."

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.590
And suddenly my fake
journalism career

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.530
has just morphed into a
real journalism career,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.930
and I was able to use that
to sort of worm my way

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.936
into more situations
where I didn't belong.

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:57.360
So I'm sure you can see
Stephen Hawking there,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.140
front and center.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.590
And then there,
inexplicably, is me.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.210
It was the perfect scam.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.900
And at this
particular conference

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.720
I ended up meeting an editor
from "New Scientist" magazine.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.600
We struck up a
conversation, and I

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.700
mentioned that I wrote
for "Scientific American."

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.095
I didn't mention
it was only once

00:09:17.095 --> 00:09:19.414
and it was the only
article I'd ever done.

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:21.830
And he suggested maybe I should
write for "New Scientist."

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.170
And so I started writing
articles for "New Scientist."

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.100
And then when I turned
25 "New Scientist"

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.530
asked me to be an
editor there, landing

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.360
me the ultimate
permanent press badge.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.770
So once I was an editor at
a major science magazine,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.000
I had access to everything
that my father and I needed

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.120
to learn physics and
start to figure out

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.250
the origin of the universe,
which was the whole point.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.940
And I was learning
so much, trying

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.920
to come to grips with this
something that supposedly arose

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.080
from nothing 14
billion years ago.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.500
And if you try to learn
all of fundamental physics

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.130
from scratch, not only
is it a lot to learn

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.820
but it can seem like a lot
of crazy, unrelated facts.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.790
But early on I had
an epiphany that

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.390
made it infinitely easier
to connect the dots

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.090
and to see the big picture.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.880
And so I think if
you want to know

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.520
one thing about
fundamental physics,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.740
this is the one thing to know.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.800
Something is only real
if it's invariant.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.570
And I'll explain
what that means.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.330
Something is only
real if it remains

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.040
unchanged in every
reference frame.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.170
If it changes or disappears
from some perspective,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.550
then it's not ultimately real.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.720
And actually, even though
this is a very deep idea,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.440
it's something that we all
sort of know intuitively.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.530
Like if you were
sitting in your lobby

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.750
and out of the corner of your
eye you saw an elephant walk

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.460
by, even for Google that
would be pretty unusual.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.200
And you might find
yourself wondering,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.460
is that elephant real or am I
having some kind of break down.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.020
And instinctively
you know there are

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.520
two strategies that you
can use to find out.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.860
So the first would be to get
up, walk over to the elephant,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.450
and just walk in a circle around
it, eyeing it from every angle,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.520
suspiciously.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.010
Because you know that if at
some angle it just vanishes,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.350
then it was something
more like a mirage

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.750
and less like a mammal.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.650
And the other
strategy you can use

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.370
is to just turn to the
Googler next to you

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.910
and say, do you see
that elephant too.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.450
And if she says, no,
or just stares at you

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.360
blankly, then you know
that you should probably

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.809
go see a neurologist.

00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:44.850
And why do you know that?

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.430
Because you know that
something is only real

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.330
if it remains invariant
in every reference frame.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:52.830
OK.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.880
So just because something's
not ultimately real

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.330
it doesn't mean it has to
be a hallucination, right?

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.850
Take a rainbow.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.360
Is a rainbow real?

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.620
Not really, right?

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.012
It's not subjective.

00:12:05.012 --> 00:12:07.060
It's not a hallucination.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.430
But it's also not a physical
object hanging in the sky.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.480
You can't go touch it.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.490
Because it's a product
of your reference frame.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.260
You see a rainbow
when you're standing

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.260
in just the right spot
and the sun's streaming

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.140
in from behind you,
and the light's

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.187
being refracted by the
moisture in the air.

00:12:22.187 --> 00:12:23.645
And if you ask the
guy next to you,

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:26.800
do you see that rainbow too,
he'll probably say, yes.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.070
But if you run the test of
walking around it in a circle,

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.380
you will eventually
see it disappear.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.750
Because it's not invariant.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.040
It's not ultimately real.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.900
It's not a fundamental
ingredient of ultimate reality.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.035
And so if you want to find
the fundamental ingredients

00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:44.030
of ultimate reality,
the something that

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.100
arose from nothing, you have
to find what's invariant.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.680
So if there's one thing that
you remember about physics,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.970
let it be that.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.260
It was Einstein who
first recognized

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.010
this link between
invariance and reality.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.510
And I would actually
argue that this

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.090
was Einstein's single greatest
contribution to physics, which

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.170
I realize is a very
bold statement.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.090
He did a lot of things-- special
relativity, general relativity.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.090
That's not even what he
won the Nobel Prize for.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.192
He won it for the
photoelectric effect.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:15.150
Which is just so badass,
if you think about it.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.500
Because the thing he
won the Nobel Prize

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.060
for barely cracks the list of
the best things he ever did.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.020
But the best thing
he ever did was

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.770
to illuminate this link
between invariance and reality.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.170
Because it set the future
trajectory of modern physics

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.710
in motion.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.750
And it changed
physics from being

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.850
a set of rules and
numbers that describe

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.060
how levers and pulleys
work to being a way

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.090
to glimpse the reality
behind appearances.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.100
And there's a good reason
that no one before Einstein

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.190
thought of this link between
invariance and reality.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.220
And it's that before
Einstein, everyone

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.650
shared the same reference frame.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.330
So in a Newtonian universe
the speed of light

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.530
is instantaneous, which means
everyone sees the same thing.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.220
So everything's invariant.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.710
And in Einstein's universe
this is no longer true.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.510
So Einstein realized that
in order for every observer

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.410
to see the same laws of
physics, every observer

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.694
has to measure the speed
of light to be the same.

00:14:15.694 --> 00:14:17.110
And so it doesn't
matter if you're

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.700
running a million miles an
hour or you're standing still.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.250
As you measure a beam of
light, that beam of light's

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.160
going to be moving at
186,000 miles per second.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.530
And what's important about that
number is that it's finite.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.570
Light does not travel
instantaneously.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.670
It takes time.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.070
Light from the sun takes
eight minutes to reach us.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.630
Light from distant galaxies
takes millions or even

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.430
billions of years.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.930
And so looking out
into the universe

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.300
is a way of looking
back in time.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.160
But the point is you
can't see everything.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.470
The universe you can see
is bounded by the fact

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.410
that light has only had 14
billion years to reach you.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:59.020
And so beyond that the
universe for you is dark.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.620
Now the boundary that marks the
very edge of what you can see

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.140
is called your horizon.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.740
And it's uniquely yours.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.120
You are sitting at the center
of a sphere that encompasses

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.150
your one-of-a-kind universe.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.030
And the person next
to you is sitting

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.050
at the central of
a different sphere.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.790
Now they mostly overlap,
but not entirely.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.550
And so Einstein realized
that in a universe

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.060
with a finite speed of
light, every observer

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.620
occupies a unique
reference frame.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.640
So you can no longer just
describe the universe

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.800
without first
specifying from who's

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.879
frame you're describing it.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:36.920
Because things might look
very different from one

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.340
frame to another.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.470
And if things look very
different from one frame

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.810
to another, this introduces
a fundamentally new problem.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.320
How do you know which
things are real?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.660
And Einstein figured
out the solution.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.420
Something is real if it's
invariant in every reference

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.920
frame.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.700
So it was this way of
thinking that led Einstein

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.930
to his famous discovery.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.660
By analyzing how things
look from different frames,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.900
he was able to see that
space and time, which

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.190
everyone had always assumed were
the same for every observer,

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.047
are in fact not the
same for every observer.

00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:13.380
They look different from one
reference frame to another.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.800
So what I see as space, you
might experience as time.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.980
And vice versa.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.040
And so space and time
are not invariant.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.160
They are relative to
your reference frame.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.660
That's what relativity is.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.160
But he found that
there is something

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.540
that remains invariant.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.280
And that is this combination
of space and time.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.330
This unified
four-dimensional spacetime.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.170
So we might disagree on
measurements of space

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.490
or of time, but
everyone will always

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.201
agree on measurements of
this combined spacetime.

00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:44.700
OK.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.565
So space and time are not
real, spacetime is real.

00:16:49.565 --> 00:16:51.440
And everyone always
focuses on the first part

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.190
because it's really
mind-blowing,

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.370
that space and time aren't real.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.890
But Einstein actually cared
more about the second part.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.590
Because he knew that the key
to finding ultimate reality

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.190
is to find the invariant.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.789
And actually later
in life he said

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:07.780
that he regretted calling
it the theory of relativity

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.460
and wished that
instead he had called

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.740
it the theory of invariance.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.900
So once we knew all
this, my father and I

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.599
now had a concrete plan.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.244
The question, what
is ultimately real,

00:17:21.244 --> 00:17:23.160
what is the something
that arose from nothing,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.960
it was no longer this vague
philosophical question.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.750
It was a rigorous
physics question.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.840
What is invariant?

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.360
And so we were out to
breakfast at a pancake house,

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.300
and we wrote a list of possible
ingredients of ultimate reality

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.050
on a napkin.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:44.056
So things like spacetime,
dimensionality, particles,

00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:46.060
strings, et cetera.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.800
This image, by the
way, is a recreation.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.640
The original napkin
was eventually lost

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.260
or possibly sneezed in.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.970
But we made this list, and then
I used my journalism career

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.170
to investigate each one.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.190
And I want to tell you about
two of the items on the napkin.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.000
So the first one is particles.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.640
Particles seem
pretty fundamental.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.970
If you ask, what is all the
stuff in the universe made of,

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.490
particles is the obvious answer.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.764
That's what I thought,
until I encountered

00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:17.930
the work of Stephen Hawking.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.070
So I have to confess something.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.540
When I was first learning
all of this stuff,

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.040
I had this suspicion that
Stephen Hawking was overrated.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.950
I just wasn't convinced that
his contribution to physics

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.170
could be proportionate
to his fame.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.810
Because there's just
something about a guy that

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.290
speaks in a computer voice
that sort of automatically

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.460
sounds like a genius.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.220
He automatically
sounds like he knows

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.040
something no one else
could possibly know.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.140
But as I studied
his work, I learned

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.520
that he had done this remarkable
calculation in the 1970s.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.660
Actually he was annoyed
at another physicist,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.570
and so he was doing this
calculation in order

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.800
to show that this
other guy was wrong.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.790
And the calculation
proved three things.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:08.080
First, that revenge is an
excellent fuel for genius.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.910
Second, that I was an idiot.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.160
Because if anything,
Hawking is underrated.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.250
His physics is brilliant.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.000
And the only thing
that's disproportionate

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.820
is the fact that everyone
knows who Stephen Hawking is,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.790
but if you ask them,
what did he actually

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.504
do that was so important,
hardly anyone knows.

00:19:24.504 --> 00:19:26.170
But now you guys will
know, because I'll

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.950
tell you the third thing.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.940
His calculation proved
that particles are not

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.800
ultimately real.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.030
And here's why.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.170
So thanks to quantum
mechanics, empty space

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.530
is not really empty.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.310
The uncertainty principle
tells us there's

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.880
a trade-off between
time and energy, which

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.290
means that on incredibly
short time scales--

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.880
a fraction of a
fraction of a fraction

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.040
of a second-- large
amounts of energy

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.840
can bubble up out
of empty space.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.130
And this energy takes
the form of pairs

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.150
of particles and antiparticles
that emerged from empty space

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.010
and then meet and annihilate
and in the blink of an eye,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.660
disappear.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.080
And this is happening
all the time

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.200
all around us, these
particles and antiparticles

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.720
emerging, meeting,
annihilating, and disappearing.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.790
But it happens so
quickly that we just

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.070
refer to them as
virtual particles.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.910
But when Hawking was
doing this calculation

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.290
he realized that
something different

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.000
happens when you have a horizon.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.930
And so, as you already
know, a horizon

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.230
marks an edge beyond which
light can't reach an observer.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.720
So we talked about
the horizon that

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.390
surrounds your unique universe.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.140
And there's an analogous
kind of horizon--

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.820
it's actually a mathematically
equivalent kind of horizon--

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.260
that surrounds a black hole.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.600
So in this case the
horizon marks the edge

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.970
beyond which light can't escape
gravity's clutches in order

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.920
to reach an observer
on the outside.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.500
So if you're standing
outside the black hole,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.930
the horizon marks the
edge of what you can see.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:04.570
So Hawking realized
that if these pairs

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.260
of particles-- virtual
particles and antiparticles--

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.170
are bubbling up out of
empty space in the vicinity

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.420
of a horizon, something
sort of amazing can happen.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.070
The horizon can
separate the pairs.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:21.220
So that where one particle
is just outside the horizon,

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.280
its antiparticle partner can
be just inside the black hole.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.710
And now they can no
longer annihilate.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.320
And so instead of disappearing
they just stick around.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.620
These virtual particles
are not so virtual anymore.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.682
They're actually totally
normal particles.

00:21:37.682 --> 00:21:39.390
They're exactly the
same as the particles

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.320
that make up anything
in this room.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.392
You could collect a bunch
of them and build a chair.

00:21:44.392 --> 00:21:46.850
But there would be something
really weird about that chair.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.700
Because it would owe its
existence to the horizon,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.910
but the horizon's
not a real thing.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.760
The horizon is not like a brick
wall that's floating in space.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.060
The horizon's like a rainbow.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.520
It's a product of
a reference frame.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.710
Namely, the reference
frame of an observer who

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.890
is lucky enough to remain
outside the black hole.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.570
And textbooks tend to call the
observer outside the black hole

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.540
Bob.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.670
I like to call him Safe.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.860
There's another kind of
observer who is not so lucky.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.890
An observer who's in
inertial motion-- free-fall--

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.110
can't escape gravity's
clutches and falls straight

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.720
through the horizon and
into the black hole.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.820
And I like to call him Screwed.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:37.430
So from Safe's point of view,
these once-virtual particles

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.680
that can no longer annihilate
with their partners

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.900
are streaming out
from the horizon,

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.210
as if the black
hole is radiating.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.880
That's why we call
it Hawking radiation.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.489
But for Screwed,
there is no horizon.

00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:54.280
He just falls straight
through, and there's

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.260
no edge of what he can see.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.950
So for Screwed, these
virtual particles

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.720
just continue to annihilate
and disappear like always.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.490
And so where Safe sees this
stream of hot particles,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.506
Screwed just sees
ordinary empty space.

00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:12.880
So you see what's
happening here.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.210
The particles are not invariant.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.740
And that's what Hawking
discovered that's so important.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.200
Particles are not
ultimately real.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.120
They're a product of
your reference frame.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.920
Not only in the
vicinity of a black hole

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.040
but everywhere,
because every one of us

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.735
is surrounded by a horizon.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.890
So my father and I crossed
particles off the list

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.570
on the napkin.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.920
Now Hawking's
discovery has driven,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.510
and continues to drive,
theoretical physics forward

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.980
for the last four decades.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.600
Because it's rife
with paradoxes.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.520
And there is nothing
that a physicist

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.780
loves more than a paradox.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.590
And I'll give you an example.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.270
So let's take our
elephant from the lobby

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.820
and throw him into a black hole.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.030
All right, there he goes.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.560
So Safe is watching
this from afar.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.260
And so we can ask,
in Safe's reference

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.360
frame, what does this look like.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.180
And fair warning,
It's not pretty.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.970
So from Safe's point
of view, the elephant

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.190
is going to fall
towards the black hole

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:24.220
and then encounter this stream
of hot Hawking radiation.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.410
And he's going to
be burned to a crisp

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.285
before he ever
crosses the horizon.

00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:32.010
And his ashes will just
emanate back into the universe.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:32.510
OK.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.130
So that gruesome and terrible.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.840
But we can also look at
Screwed's point of view.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.860
Because Screwed is
just falling straight

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.590
through alongside the elephant.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.460
And for Screwed
there is no horizon.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.410
So there are no hot particles
to harm any animals.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:54.850
And so for Screwed,
the elephant is just

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.310
in ordinary empty space.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.020
And he can live out
the rest of life

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.310
until he eventually reaches
the center of the black hole.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.670
So there's a problem.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:10.690
The laws of physics require that
both of these stories be true.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.300
If either one of
them were not true,

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.320
you'd violate a law of physics.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.250
And so the elephant has to be
both dead in a pile of ashes

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:25.220
outside the black hole and alive
and well inside the black hole.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.540
That alone is just weird.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.244
But the problem comes
in because there's

00:25:29.244 --> 00:25:30.910
another law of physics
that's equally as

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.200
fundamental as the others
that says you can't have

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.800
two copies of the same elephant.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.690
So both stories have to be true,
and both stories can't be true.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.390
That's the paradox.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.340
And it was a physicist
named Lenny Susskind

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.610
who solved this paradox.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:52.390
He said, as long as you stick to
one observer's reference frame,

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.730
as long as you talk about the
Safe sees or what Screwed sees,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.500
all the laws of
physics remain intact.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.710
It's only when you try to talk
about their points of view

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.020
simultaneously that
you see these two

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.570
illegal copies of the elephant.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.150
So it's this picture
that's the problem.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.010
Einstein had said, if you
describe the universe,

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.350
you have to first specify
your reference frame.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.570
And the fact is this is an
unphysical reference frame.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.210
It's impossible.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.780
There's no one who can see
inside and outside a horizon

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.590
simultaneously.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.020
That's the idea of a horizon.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:36.100
And so as long as we just
stick to physical reference

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.790
frames, what an observer
could actually see,

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.620
we never see two
copies of the elephant.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.030
And all the laws of
physics remain intact.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.970
So the problem is solved.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.360
But there's still something
very unsettling about that.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.180
Because we would like
to think that there's

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.640
some actual answer
to the question,

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.110
where is the elephant?

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.330
Is the elephant dead
outside the black hole

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.790
or alive inside the black hole.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.748
We like to think that
there's some real answer.

00:27:02.748 --> 00:27:06.020
And what this is telling
us is that there's not.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.000
So Susskind realized
that the location

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.110
of the elephant in
spacetime is not invariant.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.140
So spacetime-- this unified,
four-dimensional spacetime

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.980
that was left invariant
by Einstein's theory

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.940
of invariance-- turns out not
to be invariant after all.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.215
And so my dad and I had to
cross spacetime off the list.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.540
So we continued our search for
these ever-elusive invariants,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.120
these fundamental ingredients
of ultimate reality.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.146
I was running around
the world having

00:27:41.146 --> 00:27:43.520
fascinating conversations with
these brilliant physicists

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.040
and usually making a total
fool of myself in the process.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.370
And often my dad
was there with me.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.702
And when he couldn't be,
I would report back to him

00:27:51.702 --> 00:27:54.270
and detail all of my crazy
adventures and everything

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.760
I had learned.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.970
But looking back on this
17-year journey, here's

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.497
what I realize now.

00:28:03.497 --> 00:28:05.080
If it weren't for
my father I would've

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.370
never done any of this.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.230
Even if I had somehow
become interested in physics

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.550
on my own, I would've
never crashed

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.264
a conference posing
as a journalist.

00:28:15.264 --> 00:28:16.930
I would have never
turned one little lie

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.910
into an entire career.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.540
Because without my
dad there at my side

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.270
or on the other
end of the phone,

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.530
it wouldn't have been fun and
it wouldn't have meant anything.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.250
And that's the thing
about invariance.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.800
It doesn't just make objects
real, it makes our lives real.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.170
And I really think that's
why we need other people.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.170
We need them because they
bear witness to our lives.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.300
And in doing so, they
anchor us to the world.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.880
They anchor us to a reality that
can be seen from every angle

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.030
when you walk around it.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.540
I needed my dad because
that second reference frame

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.380
gave my life a
sense of invariance

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.350
and created between
us a shared reality.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.270
So that every time I learned
something deep and wondrous

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.750
about the universe, I could
turn to my dad and say,

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.250
do you see that too.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:07.100
And he could smile back
at me and say, yes.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.810
But just as we were
creating this shared reality

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.080
we were also chipping
away at it piece by piece

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.410
as we crossed item after
item off the napkin,

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.810
slowly undermining the very
notion of a shared reality.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.540
Because once you know this
one thing about physics,

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.060
that what's real is
what's invariant,

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.260
the entire trajectory of
physics snaps into focus.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.830
The whole history of
physics, from Einstein

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:39.260
to exactly what's
going on right now,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.980
has been a steady and relentless
progression of invariant

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.500
after invariant giving
way to observer dependence

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.840
and illusion.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.880
And so the list of fundamental
ingredients of reality

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.940
is getting shorter and
shorter and shorter.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.930
And so we can ask, where
does this trajectory end.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.940
Does it end with one fundamental
ingredient, one invariant, one

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.950
thing that everything
else is made of?

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.850
Well, that used to be the hope.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.180
A lot of people thought that.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.310
That was sort of the
idea of string theory.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.312
That all these different
things, all this variety

00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:15.020
we see in the world,
is actually all just

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.940
made up of this one ingredient,
these little vibrating strings.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.700
But the most exciting and
interesting and challenging

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.280
thing that's happened in
string theory in recent years

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.210
is that it's turned out that
strings are not invariant.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:33.430
And so physicists are starting
to think that maybe there's

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.560
not one fundamental ingredient.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.410
So where does the
trajectory end?

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.640
Does it end at nothing?

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.010
Because here's the interesting
thing about nothing.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.540
If you think about
it not in terms

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.140
of what it isn't but
in terms of what it is,

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.060
an infinite, unbounded
homogeneous state

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:56.730
is by definition invariant in
every possible reference frame.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.660
So my dad had started with this
sort of existential question

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.850
of, how do you get
something from nothing?

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.180
And now everything
we were learning

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.980
was presenting us with
the very real possibility

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.390
that that something might
not be made of anything.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.960
That the something
might be nothing.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.560
And on the one hand,
that's really good news.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.640
Because that actually
offers a possible solution

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.090
to this ancient
existential riddle.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.830
But on the other hand, it's kind
of a bummer when you've just

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.770
spent 17 years trying
to create a shared

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.850
reality with your
father, only to learn

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:37.690
that there may be no such thing.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.300
Physics taught me that I
have my reference frame

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.450
and my dad has his
reference frame.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.886
And they mostly overlap,
but not entirely.

00:31:48.886 --> 00:31:50.260
Which I think is
just another way

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.000
to say that over
the past 17 years,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.960
physics has taught me
what it means to grow up.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.480
But still I am comforted to
know that there is a reference

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.750
frame in which we are together,
side by side, my dad and me.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.330
And that's the
reference frame that

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.675
sits between the
covers of my book.

00:32:08.675 --> 00:32:11.066
So thank you very much.

00:32:11.066 --> 00:32:17.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.805
I can take questions,
if anyone has.

00:32:23.694 --> 00:32:25.110
AUDIENCE: What's
a good suggestion

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.135
for getting our daughters
involved in math and science?

00:32:28.135 --> 00:32:30.093
You have a chance to
speak with a lot of people

00:32:30.093 --> 00:32:32.070
who have made this
be their profession.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.050
And from their
experience and yours,

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.760
what do you think is
a good first step?

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.570
AMANDA GEFTER: So I think it
depends on personality a lot.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:48.220
So for me, I was sort
of this rebellious kid.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:52.960
And I think if physics
had been presented

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.780
to me in any normal way,
like as something you

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.730
have to study in
school, I just don't

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.060
think it would have ever
captured my imagination.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.270
I think it was the fact
that my dad presented it

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.412
as this secret thing
that we were going to do,

00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:07.870
and it was this
mission and we were

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.828
going to figure out the
origin of the universe.

00:33:09.828 --> 00:33:12.260
And it felt like
by doing physics

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.800
I was rebelling in some way.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.590
Actually, I've thought
about this a lot.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:24.040
I think physics is a very
inherently rebellious subject.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.280
Because it requires you
to question everything

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.620
we think we know about reality.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.140
And if you look at the
greatest physicists of all time

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.170
they tend to be very
rebellious characters.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.990
So I think it's a shame because
a lot of times the people who

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.010
are encouraged to go
into science and math

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:46.254
tend to be the very studious
people who go by the book.

00:33:46.254 --> 00:33:47.920
And you need that,
but that's not always

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.760
going to be the most
creative thinkers.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.094
And I think sometimes we weed
out creative thinkers who

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:54.760
could have really
contributed to physics

00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.410
by not appealing to
that type of kid.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.540
But I realize not
everyone's going

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.090
to go on a secret
mission for 17 years

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.660
to figure out the
nature of the universe.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:12.960
So I really think
the physics that's

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:20.179
taught in school-- you don't
get to the really good stuff

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:24.060
until you've already committed.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.060
You do Newtonian
physics in high school,

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.402
and then it's not until-- if
you did physics in college,

00:34:28.402 --> 00:34:30.360
you'll start to get into
relativity and quantum

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:30.860
mechanics.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.639
And that's where it
gets really cool.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:38.830
But I think you could actually
present those topics to kids

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.130
without needing a crazy amount
of math that they don't have.

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.040
And so I think if
there was a way

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.199
to present the cooler parts
of physics, the really

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:51.445
exciting, mind-blowing stuff
earlier on-- so that they would

00:34:51.445 --> 00:34:53.820
see that, OK, I have to get
through all this other stuff,

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.010
but it's going to be really
good-- I feel like people

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.458
would be more into it that way.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.940
So I'm actually about 50%
through your book right now.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.110
And I have this
problem when reading

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.010
these sort of theoretical
physics books.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:19.570
Which is that I usually follow
through special relativity

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.150
and general
relativity, but once I

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:26.430
get to sections about
supersymmetry and string theory

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.810
and things like that, I
just stop understanding.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.410
And you actually talk a little
bit about this in your book,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:38.590
that part of the problem here is
that these descriptions aren't

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.977
actually accurate.

00:35:39.977 --> 00:35:41.560
Because really they're
just describing

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.120
these mathematical equations.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.810
So is it impossible to
understand this stuff

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.840
without understanding
the math involved?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.224
Or is this something
that you encountered

00:35:55.224 --> 00:35:56.390
when you were learning this?

00:35:56.390 --> 00:36:01.360
At some point did you just
say, wow, I didn't take physics

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.720
but now I have to learn
differential equations just

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.990
to even understand this at all?

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:09.920
AMANDA GEFTER: That's
a really good question.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.336
And I sort of
struggled with this.

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:14.620
Because there definitely
were times where I was like,

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.120
oh my god.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.786
I'm reading through
these papers and I'm

00:36:16.786 --> 00:36:21.060
like, if I knew this math,
this would be a lot easier.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.600
And I think it's true,
what you were referring to,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.390
this idea that physics is
expressed in mathematics.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.600
And then if you try to
translate that into English,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.859
there's not a
one-to-one correlation

00:36:36.859 --> 00:36:37.900
between English and math.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.320
And so something is inevitably
lost in the translation.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.320
And science writers tend
to rely a lot on metaphors.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.270
And so now you're
almost at another level

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.634
where you're losing a little
bit of something else.

00:36:54.634 --> 00:36:56.550
It might make it easier
to sort of understand,

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.160
but on the other hand you're
losing more of the nuance.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.550
And so you might say you
can't really understand it

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.740
unless you understand the math.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.749
But on the other hand--
the joke that the meaning

00:37:12.749 --> 00:37:14.290
of life, the universe,
and everything

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:18.520
is 42, the reason
that's funny-- why

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.760
is 42 not a satisfying answer?

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.940
Because you want an
answer in English.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.290
A number wouldn't be
the answer, because we

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.440
want to know what it means.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.500
And so the math doesn't tell
you what anything means.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.760
And so even though you lose
something in the translation,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.890
you gain a sense of meaning.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:45.130
And a lot of physics
is really based

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:49.400
on principles and having
these foundational principles

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.700
and then deriving
the math from that.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.560
And that's how Einstein worked.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.930
And so you can understand
all the principles

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.080
without understanding
the particular solutions

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.860
of equations.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.640
And so I think you actually
can have a complete big picture

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.690
understanding, even
if you can't sit down

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:14.800
and actually do a
particular problem.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.310
AUDIENCE: So my understanding
of string theory-- by the way,

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:21.620
I really enjoyed your talk-- my
understanding of string theory

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.720
is a little bit outdated.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.610
Why are strings not invariant?

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.410
AMANDA GEFTER: Yeah,
great question.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.590
So there was a period
of time where everyone

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:36.280
was hoping that
that was the case.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.990
And then physicists
realized they

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:43.060
had five different
versions of string theory

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.180
that were all
completely consistent.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.359
And so this was sort of an
embarrassment of riches.

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:50.150
You don't want five
theories of everything,

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.810
you want one theory
of everything.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.480
And so this was
sort of a crisis.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.450
And Ed Witten came
along, and he realized

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.200
that actually these
five string theories,

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.460
even though they
look very different,

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.204
are all mathematically
equivalent.

00:39:07.204 --> 00:39:08.620
There are
transformations that you

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.910
can make to go from
one to another.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.290
And that's really unexpected.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:16.565
Because you have a theory
with strings vibrating

00:39:16.565 --> 00:39:18.580
in 10 dimensions,
and then you have

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.760
a theory of these
membranes in 11 dimensions,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.970
and then you have particles.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:27.470
And you have radically
different spacetime geometries

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:32.440
and what would look to us
like drastically different

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.210
physical worlds.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:37.930
And they're actually all
descriptions of the same thing.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.120
And so people refer to that
as the second superstring

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.770
revolution.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.830
And that was considered
this amazing step.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.279
Because, oh, we don't
really have five theories,

00:39:48.279 --> 00:39:49.070
we have one theory.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.920
And now we'll call it M-theory.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.220
And that's great.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.890
But what M-theory
is telling you is

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.340
that things like dimensionality
and strings are not invariant.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.466
Because what look like
strings in one point of view,

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:04.715
one of these theories, look
like particles in another.

00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:06.694
And they look like
membranes in another.

00:40:06.694 --> 00:40:08.360
And what looks like
10 dimensions in one

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.526
is 11 dimensions in another.

00:40:09.526 --> 00:40:12.979
And it's not like one's
right and one's wrong.

00:40:12.979 --> 00:40:14.770
It's just that there
are two different ways

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.228
of looking at the
exact same thing.

00:40:16.228 --> 00:40:21.240
And so now M-theory
basically undermined the idea

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:26.130
that you can have an invariant
fundamental ingredient.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.370
AUDIENCE: I was snooping
at your bookshelf,

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.910
so I know you've run
into a couple of these.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.260
And I'm not going to
remember the guys' names,

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:43.240
but there are a couple people
who look at the evolving

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.910
contradictions
and-- if you wind up

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:55.240
proving that nothing is real--
If all of our particles that

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.620
make up us in this room right
now originated as Hawking

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:04.610
radiation, so there's some
frame of reference from which

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:12.360
absolutely nothing is
real, that you sort of

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:19.590
need to find another
kind of answer to things.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:27.270
I think of that as sort of like
Godel's notion of completeness

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:31.530
and being able to prove
the system is complete.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.630
So you've got the guy who thinks
that the entire universe is

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.250
a cellular automata.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:42.590
And then there's also the
thought experiment thing

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.090
that suggests that maybe
the entire universe is

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:49.520
a simulation in somebody
else's universe.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.380
And I just wondered
what you thought

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.200
about those kind of notions.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.645
AMANDA GEFTER: Yeah, so
they're all really interesting.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.370
I think the same problems sort
of plague all of those ideas.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:09.060
And the simulation question
is really interesting.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.670
And it's actually
directly related

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.220
to Godel's
incompleteness theorem.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:19.040
Because the main
conceptual difficulty

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.560
in talking about the
universe as a whole,

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.680
especially when you have
to apply quantum mechanics

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.400
to the universe as
a whole, is the fact

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.900
that unlike anything
else that we know of,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.410
the universe only has an inside.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.860
It doesn't have an outside.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.240
It's like a one-sided coin.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.850
And so you can't have an
observer outside the universe.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.350
The universe is this set
that contains itself.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.760
You get into these
weird paradoxes.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.640
And there's no way
for an observer

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.100
to describe the universe without
it being self-referential

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.270
in some sense,
because the observer's

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.540
part of the universe.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.470
And so with the
simulation question,

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:09.180
you're saying, what if this
whole universe is actually

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.050
a simulation embedded on
a computer in some higher

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.300
reality.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.130
Well, for one
thing, I don't know

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.930
that it would matter that much.

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.240
There would still be some
fundamental laws of physics

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.400
that I really believe you
would be able to figure out.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:36.620
But in order to assess
the reality of reality,

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.120
you have to step outside of it.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.750
So to know that you
were a simulation,

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:44.270
you'd have to be
outside the simulation.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.520
And then how do you know
that that's not a simulation.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.894
You'd have to be
outside of that.

00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:50.670
And so it's again
this question of,

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.220
what is your reference frame.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.460
Because by definition you
can't be outside reality.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.400
And so there is
no reference frame

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.250
from which you can determine
the reality of reality.

00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:05.710
I don't know if that totally
answers your question,

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.370
but I think all of these
issues that you're raising

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.940
are very related.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:19.080
And Stephen Wolfram's theory
that you were referring to

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.460
is really interesting.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.700
I don't really
know it well enough

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:28.430
to comment that
intelligibly, but it's

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.291
going to be subject
to the same issues

00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:31.540
that we're talking about here.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.740
Because it's another
way of doing things,

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.280
but it still has to replicate
all of physics as we know it.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:42.074
And so it's going to run
into these same questions.

00:44:42.074 --> 00:44:42.990
Anyone else?

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.656
AUDIENCE: One more question, but
I want to see if it make sense.

00:44:45.656 --> 00:44:48.430
Because this stuff's amazing
but also makes my head spin.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.650
You said there is a
trajectory and what

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.400
is invariant's become
smaller and smaller,

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.910
and it may be nothing.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.845
But what is the endgame?

00:44:56.845 --> 00:44:58.470
Obviously there's an
endgame for people

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.850
that study this and are amazed
by it and everything else.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.660
But for someone who doesn't
have this understanding--

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:09.450
and if there is an endgame where
it does become figured out,

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.190
what effect could it have
on people outside of just

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.780
in theory?

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.482
AMANDA GEFTER: Probably none.

00:45:17.482 --> 00:45:21.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:28.300
I don't think it's going to
have technological applications.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.306
You never know, right?

00:45:29.306 --> 00:45:29.930
You never know.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:33.070
You can never see
these things coming.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:38.360
I think this is really
just about answering

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.970
deep existential questions
that humans have been asking

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.370
for as long as there
have been humans.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:50.070
The question of what is real,
what am I, how am I here,

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:50.800
what am I seeing?

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.130
I think it's just things
that we deeply want to know.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.470
And it's funny because
on the one hand

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.170
it seems incredibly abstract,
especially if you're

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.809
talking about 14
billion years ago

00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:05.100
and the origin of the universe.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.260
Or the cosmos, which is so huge.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.480
And quantum mechanics,
which the scale is so tiny.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.330
And you can't place
yourself in these things.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:16.020
But I always have
these moments where--

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.332
because I start thinking about
this stuff and I kind of start

00:46:19.332 --> 00:46:20.790
taking it for
granted a little bit.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:22.540
And then all of a sudden
I'll have this moment

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.560
where I'm like, oh my
god, I'm talking about,

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.970
literally, this isn't real.

00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:31.480
I'm talking about the
stuff right here and me

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.850
and all of us.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.840
And so it's not that abstract.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.175
It's just you can't really live
your life thinking about it

00:46:39.175 --> 00:46:41.800
every minute like that, or else
you're going to have a problem.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:51.800
I think any time you have a
better understanding of the way

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:59.050
that nature works it's
going to have some effect.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.460
It's going to be
useful in some way.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.770
But when you get to this
level, will it be practical?

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.265
Probably not.

00:47:08.265 --> 00:47:10.140
AUDIENCE: Sorry for
being a stick in the mud,

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.560
but if strings aren't
invariant, are there

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.570
any invariants in M-theory?

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:19.610
There are not that
anyone knows of.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.770
And it's really
interesting because when

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:29.500
I've talked to
string theorists--

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.610
string theorists
will say things like,

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.890
we don't really know
what the theory is.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:37.430
We have all these equations,
we have the theory,

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:39.760
but we don't know
what it's a theory of.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.480
And what they mean by
that is quantum field

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.204
theory is the theory
of quantum fields,

00:47:48.204 --> 00:47:49.870
string theory was the
theory of strings.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.500
M-theory, they don't know.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.000
They have this
theory and they don't

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.730
know what it's describing.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.090
There's no basic ontology there.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.900
And they're well aware of that.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.699
They see it as either
something will emerge

00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:08.240
and there will be
something that it's

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.290
describing that we
just don't realize yet.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:15.430
I happen to think it's actually
more useful if there's not

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:16.210
an ontology there.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.876
Because now you can
answer this question

00:48:17.876 --> 00:48:21.700
of how you get
something from nothing.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.700
It's really fascinating.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.880
M-theory-- if you read physics
books, everything you read

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.640
will say, nobody knows
what the M stands for.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.365
Maybe it stands for
mystery or mother or magic.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:40.970
There was a Nobel
Prize winner who said,

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.310
it's the upside
down W for Witten.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.904
And people had all
these theories.

00:48:45.904 --> 00:48:47.570
You read Stephen
Hawking's book and it's

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.490
like, no one knows
what the M stands for.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.410
And I'm like, how
can no one know?

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:55.210
Ed Witten coined it,
and he's still alive.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.870
Why doesn't someone
just ask him?

00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:59.510
So I went and I asked him.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.310
And he was like, it
stands for membrane.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.330
I originally said, oh, it
could be mother or mystery

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.580
or whatever, but I was kidding.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.610
And nobody really got the joke.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:14.810
But so the M stands
for membrane.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.520
But membranes are not
invariant in that theory.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:24.040
And so there's a deeper
point to the no one

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.440
knows what M stands for, which
is even though literally it

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.090
stands for membrane,
I think part

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:36.130
of what that means is they don't
know what it's a theory of.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.490
Which has never really happened.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.484
It's a weird way
of doing physics.

00:49:42.484 --> 00:49:43.150
But fascinating.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.110
All right, thank you
guys so much for coming.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.460
[APPLAUSE]
