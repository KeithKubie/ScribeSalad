PROFESSOR: Basically, you're
not going to able to use Beatles

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.570
clip, unfortunately.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.720
But can I hear what the song is?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.590
STUDENT: Yes.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.665
PROFESSOR: So the
reason why this

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.040
is under Creative Commons--
which, it's a little sketchy.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm not sure if
they ligitimately

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.110
could have done that.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.030
But it's because they've
transformed it so much,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.950
to the extent that it's, like,
no longer the original work,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.450
right?

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.836
So if you revert it
to the original work,

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.210
then you're also
reverting-- you,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.459
like, taking away the Creative
Commons work basically.

STUDENT: Uh huh.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:12.320
PROFESSOR: You
could find something

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.030
like this on ccMixter or
a different music archive.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.800
It'll take a while,
and unfortunately I

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.700
don't have a short cut.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.000
That's a problem with
music, is that it's not

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.040
catalogued very well.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.720
So it's time consuming,
because you just

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.650
have to listen to everything.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.660
STUDENT: What would be, like,
a good mood to search for that?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.330
PROFESSOR: I wouldn't
necessarily search by mood.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.081
I would search by
instrumentation.

00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:39.580
STUDENT: OK.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.040
PROFESSOR: So, have you looked
at any of those links that

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.039
were up on the syllabus?

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.370
STUDENT 1: Uh huh.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.780
PROFESSOR: I mean, this is sort
of, like, chill rock basically.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.460
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.410
PROFESSOR: And that may not
actually narrow it down.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.760
Go ahead and try to
explore other genres, too.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.370
I-- unfortunately,
there's no quick algorithm

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.480
for finding good music.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.330
That's why it's
so time consuming.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.880
But let me see what
you've got cut so far.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.410
STUDENT 1: OK, the video?

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.970
All right.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.310
PROFESSOR: Do you mind if
I bump up your brightness

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.810
a little bit so I
can see it better?

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.788
STUDENT 1: Oh yeah.

00:02:15.788 --> 00:02:17.630

-Hi, what do snowflakes and
cell phones have in common?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.050
Well, let me start by
drawing a snowflake first.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.070
First, I'm draw an
equilateral triangle,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.880
divide each side
into three parts,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.490
and draw another equilateral
triangle on top of each one.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.540
Then, take out the middle
and repeat the process.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.970
This time with one,
two, three, four,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.520
times three, which is 12 sides.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.050
Eventually, the shape will start
looking something like this.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.100
In mathematics this is
called a Koch snowflake.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.900
If I repeated my
process again and again,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.410
I would see this same
pattern anywhere I looked.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.952
This is a Koch
snowflake, this time--

00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:16.701
STUDENT 1: And this
would be an animation.

00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:17.880
I just haven't inserted it.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.546
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:21.400
- --that on any scale, on any
level of zoom look roughly

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.370
the same, are called fractals.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.260
Computer scientists can
program these infinite patterns

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.420
by repeating an often
simple mathematical process

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.581
over and over.

00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:34.530
In the 1990s, a radio
astronomer named

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.530
Nathan Cohen, used
fractals to revolutionize

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.880
telecommunications

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.036
At the time, Cohen was having
troubles with his landlord.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:44.540
The man wouldn't let him
put an antenna on his roof.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.050
So Cohen designed a more
compact, fractal radio antenna

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.000
instead.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.200
The landlord didn't notice
it, and it worked better

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.780
than the ones before.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.780
Working further, Cohen
designed a new antenna.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.004
This time, using the fractal
called the Menger sponge.

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:04.043
The Menger sponge is
not really the sponge

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.626
you'd be scrubbing
your bathroom with.

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:07.910
But you can still
think of it like that.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.274
Imagine both water
and soap getting

00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:11.440
through your sponge's holes.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.604
Except the water is Wi-Fi and
the soap is, say, Bluetooth.

00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:18.829
The fractal's
infinite sponginess

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.351
allows it to receive many
different frequencies

00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:22.824
simultaneously.

00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:24.570
Before Cohen's
invention, antennas

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.380
had to be cut for one frequency.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.764
And that was the only frequency
they could operate at.

00:04:29.764 --> 00:04:32.560
So without Cohen's
sponge, your cell phone

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.890
would have to look a hedgehog
to receive multiple signals,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.940
including the one your
friends use when they call.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.520
Cohen later proved that
only fractal shapes

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.110
could work with such a
wide range of frequencies.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.377
Today, millions of wireless
communication devices--

Cohen's fractal antenna.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.520
Cohen's genius
invention, however,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.457
was not the first application
of fractals in the world.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.580
It tuns out, nature has been
doing it the whole time,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.370
and not just with snowflakes.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.530
Natural selection favors
the most efficient systems

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.390
and organisms, often
of a fractal shape.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.840
For example, the spiral fractal
is present broccoli, seashells,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.260
and hurricanes.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.270
The fractal tree is
relatively easy to program,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.950
and can be used to study
river systems, blood

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.390
vessels, and lightening bolts.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.470
So many natural systems
previously thought off limits

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.492
to mathematicians can now be
explained in terms of fractals.

00:06:39.492 --> 00:06:43.867
Plus, mathematics allows us to
learn nature's best practices,

00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:47.276
and then apply them to
solve world problems.

00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:50.685
Much like Cohen's antenna
revolutionized the field

00:06:50.685 --> 00:06:53.120
of telecommunications,
other fractal research

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.555
is changing medicine,
weather prediction,

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:59.970
and building design-- here
at MIT, and everywhere

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.395
in the world.

00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:02.844
Look around you.

00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:05.766
What beautiful
patterns do you see?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:08.110
PROFESSOR: All right,
that's a good start.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.360
Good start.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.040
So I think in general,
the transitions

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.250
could be a little bit tighter.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.395
So, like right here.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.320
When you walk off-- well, this
hiccup up is really noticeable.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.810
So either hide it by
having an extreme close up

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.410
before you leave, or just
get rid of this entirely.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.450
Although, I know that you did
that to show the walk off,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.520
so that you could
show walking in.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.540
STUDENT 1: And I can
connect-- this is actually

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.800
one video I separated so
I could speed this up.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800
And I guess I was just
playing around with that.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.706
PROFESSOR: I almost think this
happens too quickly, though.

at 140 right now.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.760
So I was just like--

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I would
slow it back down, yeah.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.462
So let's go scene by scene.

STUDENT 1: No, it's Aerosmith.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.102
I would take that out.

00:08:08.102 --> 00:08:09.560
I was just looking
for an interem--

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.880
PROFESSOR: There's probably an
iMovie sound effect, actually,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.850
that you could use.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.437
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:08:14.437 --> 00:08:16.520
PROFESSOR: For this part,
where you're just, like,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.980
walking around, I would
digitally zoom in close up.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.040
Because otherwise, you jump
to talking all of a sudden.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.300
But your movement wasn't
exaggerated enough

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.159
to where you, like, get the
joke that you're talking.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.659
So you can exaggerate it by
changing the actual framing

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.679
of the scene.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.679
STUDENT 1: So would I zoom
in when I start talking?

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.520
PROFESSOR: I would stay
zoomed in when you're talking,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.090
and then clean cut to a
wider shot of you afterwards.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:59.730
So basically, I would
cut, like, right there.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.870
I don't remember
how-- my version's

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.610
a little but
different than yours.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.220
But I would cut right there.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.430
And for the preceding
clip, do you know

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.752
how to crop and zoom on clips?

00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:14.710
STUDENT 1: Yeah, I can.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.630
PROFESSOR: You just go
like that, basically.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.440
Yeah, for that.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.390
Now, for this I
would also-- this

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.580
is basically one,
really long shot that

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.630
is framed the exact same way.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.080
And it's very lectury,
because you're literally

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.090
at a blackboard.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.690
Although I think that that was
a good set up for you guys,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.890
given the complexity
of explaining this.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.960
But I think you can avoid making
it sound too chalkboard lectury

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.717
by cutting in and
out of your frame.

00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:48.300
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.020
PROFESSOR: Or, of your framing.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.010
So this is fine.

00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:57.390
Like right there, I
would save your audio

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.990
but just cut to a close up
of your hand drawing it.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.480
Does that make sense?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.230
STUDENT 1: So kind of
like with the phone?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.660
When I'm showing--

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah--
I would do more of that.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.550
I think in general, you
have very static shots

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.640
that last for a long time.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.600
So you can break that up
by keeping the same track

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.780
from your one long take,
but mixing the extent

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.220
to which you've zoomed in.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.470
STUDENT 1: OK, yeah, that's
what I did with the phone,

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.020
so I can definitely
work on that.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.150
PROFESSOR: I think
that would help.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.649
Because this section
is pretty long.

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:37.290
Like, if you just even
look at your project,

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.380
this file is 32 seconds.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:47.340
STUDENT 1: Which, it's-- the
video is about three minutes

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.310
and 40 seconds right now.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.800
STUDENT 1: And then,
like, this part

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.340
is because I inserted the song.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK, great.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.166

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.267

[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.930
STUDENT 1: So I guess you could
zoom in at "this same shape."

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.010
PROFESSOR: I actually--
I feel like you're

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.770
revealing this image too
soon in your sentence.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.070
"If I repeated this process
over and over again,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.860
I would see this image."

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.820
And I almost don't
want to see the image

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.490
until you say "this image."

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.170
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.430
PROFESSOR: So maybe if you
can zoom in, and frame,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:23.050
and crop out the fractal
zoom in until you say "this."

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.760
And then at "this" you can
either pan to the drawing,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.167
or you can cut to a wide shot.

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:29.750
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.550
PROFESSOR: And
anywhere you looked--

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.630
I mean, is there a
way to, like, shoot

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.770
footage of just close
ups of the snowflake?

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.070
Of you, like, going around
the edge of the periphery

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.840
of the snowflake?

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.980
STUDENT 1: So that
would this part.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.450
PROFESSOR: That would
be that part, OK.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:52.765

[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.170
STUDENT 1: Which, this is a
software-- a fractal drawing

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:56.810
software.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.730
Am I allowed to, like,
film the zoom in on that?

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.650
And then use--

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.760
PROFESSOR: It depends
on what license

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.425
the software is released under,
and who created that image.

00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:08.008
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.300
So, I mean, I didn't have
to pay for it or anything.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.920
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
created the image.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.503
STUDENT 1: No.

00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:20.500
Well-- so, kind of.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.430
It's just a software.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.470
And then you can do-- let's
say you draw a Koch snowflake,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.810
and then you can
just zoom in on it.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.950
And then I just--

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.022
PROFESSOR: And that is are
free, open source software?

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:36.230
STUDENT 1: Yeah, it was free.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.680
PROFESSOR: You know,
what you should do is?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.660
You should just take a QuickTime
recording of your screen.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.980
Like what we were doing.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.780
STUDENT 1: That's what
I was going to do.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.904
PROFESSOR: And just, like,
do a QuickTime recording

00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:50.720
of you zooming in.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.140
STUDENT 1: And that's OK to use?

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.680
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:52.760
All

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.468
STUDENT 1: Right.

00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:57.030
PROFESSOR: Oh wow,
this is so trippy.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.306
How do I make it stop?

00:12:58.306 --> 00:12:59.680
STUDENT 1: I don't
actually know.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.590
I haven't worked too
much-- there is actually

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.010
a video of somebody doing
that, which is well done.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.330
So I may use part of that.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:13.502
PROFESSOR: You-- ideally, you
would make your own video.

00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:14.960
STUDENT 1: Yeah,
I'll work on that.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.210
Maybe I'll just, like, track
their movements at least.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because I don't
know what the details of that

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.300
would be.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.240
If you're actually
allowed to use a video.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.107

specifically released it

00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:53.440
PROFESSOR: OK, this is where
you change your wardrobe

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.230
all of a sudden.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.260
Ideally, that wouldn't happen.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.810
Wardrobe changes are
OK if it makes sense.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.010
But here it seems, like,
a little arbitrary.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.728
But it's not the
end of the world.

00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:21.330
Does that makes sense why
that seems a little bit weird,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:21.830
though?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.204
Because it's like,
in your script

00:14:23.204 --> 00:14:25.580
there is nothing that
sort of signifies

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.980
or identifies that you've
shot, like, at a different day.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.970
Or that you're in a
location that requires

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.945
a different wardrobe, you know?

PROFESSOR: OK, I'm
just going to say it.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.370
How do you pronounce
Koch snowflake.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.411
STUDENT 2: I think it's
"coke," but I don't know.

00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:58.535
PROFESSOR: I'm pretty
sure-- it's K-O-C-H, right?

00:14:58.535 --> 00:15:03.680
Just cause I would imagine
that it's educators watching

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.070
this video, but if there
are little children watching

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.364
this one, there are
going to be some,

ha, ha-- she said cock
snowflake comments.

00:15:14.004 --> 00:15:15.420
STUDENT 1: I was
actually thinking

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.500
of doing-- because the
sound changes so much, I

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.820
was actually thinking of
doing a voiceover of this.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.050
Because what I found-- I
recorded this part indoors

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.880
and outdoors, and I could
match up the sound perfectly

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.250
for what I was moving.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.700
So if I, like, do the same
thing but somewhere else,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.380
I can probably
match up the sound

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.260
and change the snowflake part.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.256
PROFESSOR: Helge von Koch.

00:15:43.327 --> 00:15:45.160
Yeah, I would just look
up the pronunciation

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.040
of that, just to--

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.450
STUDENT 1: OK, I will do that.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.880
PROFESSOR: Just be careful.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.790
Yeah, and especially-- this
is just video stuff anyway,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.380
so you can easily
re-record that.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.926
So wait for the reveal here.

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:02.050
Basically, do a little more
with cutting in and out

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.590
of close ups and wide shots.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.640

PROFESSOR: So this reveal
is a little awkward,

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.440
because you're not
looking at the audience

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.590
when you're saying
the big reveal.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.302
And then you have this
sort of unnatural pause

00:16:21.302 --> 00:16:22.760
before you start
the next sentence.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.843
STUDENT 1: OK, I was
actually originally intending

00:16:24.843 --> 00:16:27.290
to say fractals
here, but I cut it--

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.397
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK, I see.

00:16:28.397 --> 00:16:30.480
STUDENT 1: I thought, oh,
well I'll just say that.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.830
But originally, it was going to
be I finished saying fractals,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.770
and then I type on
the computer and say--

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.700
PROFESSOR: OK, that
will work a lot better.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.347
STUDENT 1: So I
can just redo that.

00:16:39.347 --> 00:16:40.180
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:47.670
I mean, I think it's also-- I
think ideally, you would say,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.160
fractals, and then you'd
look down at your computer.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.440
But what you're saying
now, that'll work too.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.821
STUDENT 1: And that's
how we filmed it, so--

00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:57.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
because this, like,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.106
gap in where you take a
breath-- it sounds fine,

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.355
but it looks a little awkward.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.130
PROFESSOR: So this is super
overexposed in the background.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.960
So I would try to see if you
can bring the exposure down

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.040
just a little bit.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.700

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.909
PROFESSOR: I don't remember
how to do that on iMovie.

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:19.908
STUDENT 1: It's on this.

00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:21.420
I actually increased
the exposure,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.540
because there were some shadows.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.760
But I can play around with that.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.051

thing is the whites, right?

00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:27.920

blown out in the window.

STUDENT 1: No, it was
different in the original one.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.680
PROFESSOR: I don't know if
there's a history on iMovie,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.230
but if you can somehow just,
like, increase the blacks

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.690
but don't blow out
the whites, that

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.230
might help if you have
weird shadows going on.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.211
STUDENT 1: I think-- so it
looked like this originally I

00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:48.710
think.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's better.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.520
STUDENT 1: Yeah, I don't know.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.905
I was playing around with that.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.280
But that's not
the final version.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.050
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.650
STUDENT 1: But that
was the original.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.240
PROFESSOR: Got it.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.007
Oh, yeah, I remember-- this one
also feels pretty long to me.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.650
PROFESSOR: So, for that line,
do you have footage of you

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:19.499
on MATLAB graphing a fractal?

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:20.540
STUDENT 1: I can do that.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.490
Because that would probably
be on the fractal software.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.050
I can just--

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, even that.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.583
Like, just to break
it up a little bit

00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:28.824
and give them, like,
a visual association.

00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:30.490
Because this is one
of those times where

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.820
if you're like, again,
in static place saying

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.219
a big chunk of words to
them, it's sort of easier to

00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:38.260
tune it out a little bit.

In the 1990s--

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
then cut back out to you

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.770
when you say-- I mean,
because that's, like,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.160
a very separate thought.

00:18:55.421 --> 00:18:58.046
PROFESSOR: Is there a picture of
Nathan Cohen that could, like,

00:18:58.046 --> 00:18:59.090
pop up on the side?

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.010
STUDENT 1: I can
probably find that, yeah.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.500
There is one, actually.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.378
- --to revolutionize
telecommunications.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.930
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.110
So half way through the
video, you switch to these,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.810
like, cube turn transitions.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.020
I mean, this is a
personal preference.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.030
I don't know how you
fell about transitions.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:26.880
But I feel like, either
keep it all the same

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.700
or use, like, this a
little quirkier transitions

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.700
for a very pointed reason.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.950
STUDENT 1: OK, for
this one, because it

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.590
was such different locations,
I used these to tell the story.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.770
So this is me introducing the
story and telling the story.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.150
So just for that story I'm
using those transitions.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I think if you're

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:55.060
going to do that, I much prefer
a push rather than a cube turn.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.710
Because we've done
that once before,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.130
and-- again,
personal preference.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.010
George had to really
sell me on the idea,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.230
because I was very
opposed to it.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.910
But instead of doing a
rotation, you just-- it's

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.790
a wipe, basically.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.080
One frame pushes off and
reveals the next one.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.110
I think that looks
a little bit better.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.310
STUDENT 2: Basically,
I prefer as subtle

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.960
of a transition as possible.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.170
And the animations
are cool, but they

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:26.269
remind people of, like,
really flashy homemade videos

00:20:26.269 --> 00:20:27.810
as opposed to
something professional.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah, like this
is a very iMovie transition.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.412
STUDENT 2: Yeah.

00:20:30.412 --> 00:20:31.078
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:31.078 --> 00:20:36.010
-At ths time, Cohen was having
troubles with his landlord.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:41.590
The man wouldn't let him
put an antenna on his roof.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.280
So--

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.780
PROFESSOR: There's some-- wait,
let me listen to this again.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.590
-Cohen was having troubles
with his landlord.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.030
The man wouldn't let him
put an antenna on his roof.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.730
So, Cohen designed a
more compact fract--

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.990
PROFESSOR: There
I would zoom in.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.120
Cut to a closer framing up that
that's, like, just the wire.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.860
- --radio antenna instead.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.830
The landlord didn't notice
it, and it worked better

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.510
than the ones before.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.510
Working further--

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.140
PROFESSOR: And then
cut come back out.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.270
- --designed a new antenna.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.914

called the Menger sponge.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:18.724 --> 00:21:20.390
PROFESSOR: And again,
I don't think it's

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.286
necessary to do a rotation.

00:21:22.286 --> 00:21:23.910
STUDENT 1: OK, and
I was thinking here,

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.200
while-- maybe have the Menger
sponge increase in size,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.930
and then curtain
as a background.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.980
So would that be
another transition,

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.670
to kind of have the
Menger sponge expand

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.820
and then have me wipe it off?

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.100
STUDENT 2: Are you
drawing a Menger sponge?

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.922
STUDENT 1: Going to have
a model of it, hopefully.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.170
STUDENT 2: So you
are-- sorry, are

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.030
you going to re-film the
part with, like, a model?

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.210
STUDENT 1: No, just
like and image.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.810
STUDENT 2: OK, OK.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.810
PROFESSOR: So it would pop
up in your hand right there.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.460
So the way this is
framed-- I mean,

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.030
the subject is really
here-- is going to be here--

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.570
and you're so biased.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.140
I mean, this is
beautifully framed

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.780
in terms of, like, rule
of thirds and everything.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.640
But because you held
your hand out this way,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.360
it's going to look
really fun-- like,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.900
the visual balance
of that frame is

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.774
going to look really funny when
you're like, Menger sponge,

00:22:21.774 --> 00:22:23.440
and then all of a
sudden this huge thing

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.800
gets cut off on the side.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.820
So either zoom in a
little bit-- ideally,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.967
you would have held
out this hand so

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.550
that it would have
been in the middle.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.800
Although the background
is really distracting,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.485
so I don't know if--

00:22:37.485 --> 00:22:38.400
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.395
-Menger sponge.

00:22:40.395 --> 00:22:41.717

00:22:41.717 --> 00:22:42.300
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.050
PROFESSOR: And are you
going to hold-- so,

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.760
I'm assuming the
Menger sponge picture

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.630
will be floating somewhere.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.940
STUDENT 1: It would
be here, yeah.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.660
But then I would
get rid of that when

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.900
I'm talking about
the regular sponge.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.720
PROFESSOR: Well here it
would still be floating.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.350
Because I think when you say,
the Menger sponge isn't exactly

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.210
like a real sponge, right?

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.920
But I think the Menger
sponge needs to be shown.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.930
STUDENT 1: OK

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.130
PROFESSOR: If you're
going to show something,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.120
show it long enough to
where the viewer can

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.790
process it a little bit.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:18.182
Otherwise, it's like this
blip that might distract them.

00:23:18.182 --> 00:23:18.765
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:24.350
PROFESSOR: Did you
cut right here,

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.600
or is there a little bit more?

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.474
STUDENT 1: I think
there's a little bit more.

00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:28.670
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.400
Hold it just a little bit,
and maybe cut to-- again,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.180
cut to a close up shot.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.250
That can be sort of a workaround
to the weird framing issue.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.670
Otherwise it's like,
it's really nicely done.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.480
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.460
-The Menger sponge--

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can
say, the Menger sponge,

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.730
and then pop up right there.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.130
- --is not really the
sponge you'd be scrubbing

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:54.170
your bathroom with, but you can
still think of it like that.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.050
Imagine both water and soap
getting through your sponge's

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.960
holes, except the water
is Wi-Fi and the soap is,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.910
say, Bluetooth.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so here the timing

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.610
of you turning on the water
is a little bit weird.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.470
Because you turn it
on, like, way after you

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.540
say water and soap.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.120
And I wonder, were
you planning on doing

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.110
an animation for this section?

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.110

[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.978
PROFESSOR: Because
I feel like this

00:24:24.978 --> 00:24:26.530
is a spot where
it actually would

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.846
be beneficial to not
even have an overlay,

00:24:28.846 --> 00:24:30.720
but a completely separate
animation of, like,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.290
a sponge with holes and,
like, H2O and soap with arrows

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:34.820
pointing.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.970
Like, going into
the sponge holes.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.090
What do you think, Zoe?

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.890
STUDENT 2: Yeah, or just to,
like, demonstrate that concept.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.027
Because it's easier
to understand

00:24:45.027 --> 00:24:47.610
when you read it than when you
hear it in a couple of seconds.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.720
STUDENT 1: Yeah.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.900
PROFESSOR: And I think, like,
the visuals of this-- again,

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:58.370
it's a pretty long--
it's, what, 14 seconds?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.370
It's actually kind
of long to have

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.970
the same sort of still framing.

00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:07.660
STUDENT 1: If you
like how it's framed,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.400
it's another-- you could
also just overlay like,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.645
a little arrow pointing in.

00:25:14.645 --> 00:25:16.020
Because you hold
it pretty still.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.264
-But you can still
think of it like that.

00:25:18.264 --> 00:25:19.937
Imagine both water and soap--

00:25:19.937 --> 00:25:20.520
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.061
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
like, you could just

00:25:22.061 --> 00:25:25.210
have H2O and soap with arrows
pointing into the sponge,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.718
and then coming
out of the sponge.

00:25:28.718 --> 00:25:29.614
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:33.667
-Except the water is Wi-Fi and
the soap is, say, Bluetooth.

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:34.250
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.399
PROFESSOR: Yeah but
I would almost--

00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:38.940
you can leave it in
for the rough cut

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.170
and we can see what
other people say.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.320
But the movement
of that is almost

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.932
distracting, because
it has nothing

00:25:46.932 --> 00:25:49.390
to do with what you're saying
when you're saying it, right?

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.934
Do you have another
take of this?

00:25:50.934 --> 00:25:52.600
STUDENT 1: All of
them are kind of like.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.270
PROFESSOR: Oh, the exact same.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.770
OK.

00:25:56.395 --> 00:25:58.520
STUDENT 1: There might be
one when I finish talking

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.436
and then turn on the
water, so I can use that.

00:26:00.436 --> 00:26:04.616
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
if you cut it right here,

00:26:04.616 --> 00:26:05.990
and you didn't
turn on the water,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.349
then that would
have been better.

00:26:08.349 --> 00:26:09.890
STUDENT 1: I think
there are versions

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.750
like that that I can use.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.500
PROFESSOR: And again, this
one-- like, I wouldn't even

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.430
do it a push at all.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.960
I really think it
looks a lot better when

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.777
you do as clean
transitions as you can.

00:26:22.777 --> 00:26:23.443
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:23.443 --> 00:26:26.166
-The fractal's infinite
sponginess allows it--

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.880
PROFESSOR: I would shave off,
maybe, like a half second.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.460
Because you take
a breath, and then

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.240
it takes just a hair before
you actually start talking.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.520
So I'd just snip the tiniest
bit off of the beginning.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.672
Are you planning on doing
any animations to the dies?

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:48.755
- --allows it to receive--

00:26:48.755 --> 00:26:49.060
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.550
STUDENT 1: I probably can put
them in the sponge, there.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.170
And, like, signals
coming inside.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
otherwise-- again,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.330
like, nice rule of thirds.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:00.334
But you have a bath-- is
that a bathroom stall?

00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:01.000
STUDENT 1: Yeah.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it's
like a really awkward visual.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:04.630
But if--

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:05.660
STUDENT 2: It's a
good background.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.490
PROFESSOR: It's
a good background

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.480
if you want to put, like, a
picture of a Menger sponge

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.760
receiving different signal.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.590
STUDENT 1: All right,
I can see that.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.740
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.510
-Before Cohen's
invention, antennas

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.890
had to be cut for one frequency.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
show an old antenna.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.586
-And that was the only
frequency they could operate at.

00:27:19.586 --> 00:27:20.937
So--

00:27:20.937 --> 00:27:22.270
PROFESSOR: And like, right here.

00:27:25.138 --> 00:27:28.210
-So without Cohen's
sponge, your cell phone

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.327
would have to look
something like a hedgehog.

00:27:30.327 --> 00:27:30.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.160
PROFESSOR: I would-- there's
like, a bit of a hesitation

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.116
before you say, "without
Cohen's sponge."

00:27:36.116 --> 00:27:37.740
And I don't even
think you need the so.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.070
So I would just
cut out the pause

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.510
and the so, and cut straight
to, "without Cohen's sponge."

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.110
And then to hide that
cut, you can either

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.500
zoom in little bit more--

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.994
STUDENT 1: OK, that makes sense.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
and like, for that,

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.614
since you're not going
to have the animation,

00:27:57.614 --> 00:28:01.910
I would frame it and zoom
in to where it's just you.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.120
And the resolution is going
to look a little funky,

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.600
but I think it's worth
the compromise to do that.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.970
STUDENT 2: And it helps lead
to start leading the viewer

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.020
into seeing your phone.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.980
Because it's like, you're
starting out with a wide shot,

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.600
and now you're on you,
and then eventually it

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.430
will be your phone.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.481
And so it's like-- it just sort
of helps the narrative along.

00:28:22.044 --> 00:28:23.710
PROFESSOR: And again,
I wouldn't ripple.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.536
I would just go straight
to the cut into that.

00:28:25.536 --> 00:28:26.202
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:26.202 --> 00:28:29.297

the one your friends use when

[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:32.680
STUDENT 1: So I'll take
out that transition.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.750
PROFESSOR: This one you
could-- because it's

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.246
such a different--
wait, is that the end?

00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:42.160
STUDENT 1: The end of the story.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.544
PROFESSOR: Yeah, maybe
you can do a push.

00:28:44.544 --> 00:28:45.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.437
-Cohen later proved
that only fractal--

[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.110
PROFESSOR: But it's still
part of the same story,

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.340
so I would say just do
a clean cut there, too.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.837
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:28:54.837 --> 00:28:58.306
STUDENT 2: I like
that background.

00:28:58.306 --> 00:29:00.430
PROFESSOR: But it is a
little-- it's still a little

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.830
overexposed here, too.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.121
STUDENT 1: Yeah, that was
another one I edited as well.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
clean transition--

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.150
I would cut out this gap, too.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.600
It's just like the
slightest-- it's

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.700
too long by just the
slightest amount of time.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.366
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:15.366 --> 00:29:18.510
-Cohen later proved that only
fractal shapes could work--

[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.960
PROFESSOR: And that's
actually what makes

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.890
it read sort of newscastery.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.140
You know, like, have you ever
seen the special segments,

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.570
and the reporter is on their
couch, and they're like,

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.260
da dah da dah da dah.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.850
And then this person did this.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.800
So it's just, like,
those tiny little gaps

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.640
that make it read that way.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.650
But if you get rid of it, then
it will be a lot more natural.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:39.770
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.820

Cohen's genius

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.727
was not the first application
of fractals in the world.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.518
STUDENT 1: So I'm going to
change that audio as well,

00:29:56.518 --> 00:29:58.000
because I think I was too grand.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.500
And I have other versions
that may work better.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.480
PROFESSOR: OK, I like this a
camera slow pan off, actually.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.760
STUDENT 1: We did
another version

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.830
which had also this pan.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:17.240
It wasn't as good, but I said
the next sentence after that.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.010
So it sounds more natural.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:23.980
So I'm going to see
if I can trade off

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.170
the visual for better--

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:28.990
PROFESSOR: Do you
need something?

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.430
OK, sorry.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:38.620
OK, so this is why this
transition is a little bit

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.840
funny here.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.290
The speed at which you're moving
the camera when you pan off

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.960
is way faster than when
you pan down onto you.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.510
So what you could do is
cut this clip into two,

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.630
and speed up the first part.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.040
Like you did earlier.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.467
Also, is this broccoli?

00:30:56.467 --> 00:30:57.550
STUDENT 1: It is broccoli.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.949
There's a mural, and stata.

00:31:00.949 --> 00:31:02.740
PROFESSOR: I didn't
know that was broccoli.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.030
It looked like bags
of seeds or something.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.850

looked like broccoli enough.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.614

it's indistinguishable.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.558
It looks like bags
of stuff almost.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:43.900
STUDENT 1: I can still insert
just an image of broccoli,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.074

it's not broccoli.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:53.750
STUDENT 2: Oh, I know-- I
think the broccoli-- the spiral

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.162
fractals are most present,
it's like romanesco broccoli

00:32:57.162 --> 00:32:58.120
or something like that.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.290
And so like,

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.920
PROFESSOR: It's a specific type.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.420
STUDENT 2: And so people might
be confused, and like look

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.977
at their normal
broccoli, and like--

00:33:05.977 --> 00:33:08.060
PROFESSOR: I would show a
picture of the romanesco

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.120
broccoli.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.010
Especially because I
don't think this is-- I

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:17.037
think this is bags of
barley, or cotton almost.

00:33:17.037 --> 00:33:18.620
STUDENT 1: That would
make more sense.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.640
It's also why the
person is up there.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
I think, also, it just

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:29.080
like doesn't really
look like a fractal.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.240
Whereas the broccoli
actually-- there

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.470
are visualizations of it
where it actually looks like,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.510
oh, I can identify
this as a fractal.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.010
STUDENT 2: And so it will just
be reassuring for your viewer

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.426
when they can see the picture
of the broccoli and be like,

00:33:42.426 --> 00:33:44.270
oh, I can totally see
how that's a fractal.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.895
Rather than, like, squinting at
your background and being like,

00:33:46.895 --> 00:33:49.757
is that-- did I learn anything
from this video type thing.

00:33:49.757 --> 00:33:51.840
PROFESSOR: If you're going
to re-shoot this part--

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.260
and if you can't get it
this weekend, that's OK.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.980
Remember, you still
have Wednesday to do it.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.640
I would be careful about the
way you're emphasizing words.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.530
It's kind of falling a little
into the trap of what George

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.730
was saying about how
news presenters emphasize

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.590
every third word, just a
sound sort of-- they're

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.900
emphasizing important
thoughts, but they don't really

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.350
make sense where they're
emphasizing the words.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:26.159
So I would just try a few
different types of deliveries.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.159
One where you're actually
emphasizing every other word

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.440
on purpose.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.949
And then do something, like,
completely exaggerated.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.485
And then try one where you're
sort of more natural tone

00:34:37.485 --> 00:34:37.985
talking.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.600
STUDENT 1: I think that's
how I usually present.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.760
Like, even in real life.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.426

You're talking for
eighth graders,

necessarily to a 10-year-old,

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.250
right?

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.754
So how would you say this line--

to, like, your professor?

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.500
STUDENT 1: I mean, I wouldn't
say this line to my professor.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.810
PROFESSOR: How would you
say that line to Jamie?

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.532

been doing it the whole time.

00:35:22.532 --> 00:35:24.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a little bit different.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:26.877
Like, turns out nature's
been doing it the whole time.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.319
It's such a subtle nuance,
but it's just something

00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:35.860
about, like--

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.526

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.190
Nature has been doing
it the whole time.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.760
I mean it's OK to
say the whole time,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.970
but it reads like a
little Reading Rainbow

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.940
when the intonation
is like that.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.662
But again, maybe that's
just my personal taste.

00:36:06.662 --> 00:36:08.870
In general, I think your
enthusiasm is really, really

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:09.369
good.

00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:12.410
Like, you're taking a subject
that's inherently a little bit

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:13.320
hard to visualize.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.560
It's a little bit tedious.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.110
And because you have this
enthusiastic delivery,

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.009
it's a lot easier to follow
along with you, which is good.

00:36:20.009 --> 00:36:21.800
So don't lose any of
that energy, for sure.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:36.407

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.630
PROFESSOR: If you
re-shoot this, just

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.470
make sure that you're
framed more in the center,

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.790
and there's enough room
above you to accommodate

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.440
for the animations.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.982
And this is actually something
that you could, if you had to,

00:36:47.982 --> 00:36:49.023
you could do on your own.

00:36:49.023 --> 00:36:51.450
You just set up the tripod
and flip the screen around you

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.480
so you could see.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.164

pan down, but that's OK.

definitely don't think

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:07.896
there is enough space there.

00:37:07.896 --> 00:37:10.960
But I wasn't the one directing.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.980
PROFESSOR: The other
thing is, like,

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.594
if you end up filming
this part on your own

00:37:15.594 --> 00:37:17.510
you don't necessarily
have to have a pan down.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.877
You could just do a
push down transition.

00:37:19.877 --> 00:37:21.960
That's where I feel like
a transition would be OK,

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:28.410
because you've got the
camera tilt up previously.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.940
If you do this again,
I would just look up

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.190
instead of going like this.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.814

awkward to go like that.

It's a good start--
really good start.

00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:18.300
STUDENT 2: A good
rule of thumb--

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.120
we never mentioned this
in the editing lecture,

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.700
but, like, you want to
give the end of a scene

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.110
a little room to breathe so
people can process, like,

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:26.860
what's going on.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.640
And then at the
beginning of a scene,

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.690
you want it to be, like,
one or two frames before you

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:32.440
start talking.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.000
So it's, like, almost
immediately your voice.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
actually a very good point.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.510
And I should have brought that
up during the editing lecture.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.610
But I feel like the tendency
is to do the opposite with what

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.780
you've done with the scenes
here, where you end too soon,

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.210
and then you wait
too long before you

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.274
start the next scene.

00:39:47.274 --> 00:39:49.190
STUDENT 2: It's like--
it's counter intuitive,

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.782
but it makes it flow better.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.800
PROFESSOR: But yeah,
you're in really good shape

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.290
in terms of, like,
pacing what you

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.650
need to do before next week.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.790
So I think, at this
point, it's a matter

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.470
of getting the animations
in and the music.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.450

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.984
You guys finished filming
everything, right?

00:41:07.984 --> 00:41:08.650
STUDENT 4: Yeah.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.400
PROFESSOR: This is nice framing.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.590
STUDENT 3: Thank you
See, you should--

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.554
PROFESSOR: Now, if
you did it again,

00:41:24.554 --> 00:41:25.970
one cool thing
that you could do--

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:30.240
and I'm not saying that you
need to, because this is fine.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.820
But if you had moved him to
the center of that picture,

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.210
and you moved close
enough, then this image

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.080
could basically fill
the entire background

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.091
and you wouldn't have
this weird gap, right?

00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:41.840
STUDENT 3: Oh, OK.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.965
PROFESSOR: I don't know if
the image was big enough

00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:46.130
to do that, compared to
the size of his body.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.630
STUDENT 3: The image
was big enough.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.390
I didn't want to do that because
I didn't want him to look

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.990
like he was in green screen.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.699
PROFESSOR: That's a
good point, actually.

00:41:54.699 --> 00:41:55.573
That is a good point.

00:41:55.573 --> 00:41:57.080
STUDENT 3: That's
the reason why.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.350
I have a bit OCD,
so I can't stand

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.380
what's on the right, actually.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.982
But I'm fine.

00:42:04.982 --> 00:42:05.773
PROFESSOR: It's OK.

00:42:05.773 --> 00:42:06.916
It's OK.

00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:08.290
STUDENT 2: Yeah
it kind of-- it's

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.300
blurry enough that's
it's not distracting,

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.008
because I'm not trying
to read the words.

00:42:12.008 --> 00:42:14.000
Because I don't think
they're, like, readable.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I wish
I could have given you

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.584
guys lights, because
that's what happens when

00:42:18.584 --> 00:42:19.750
you rely on the fluorescent.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.500
You get some weird shadows
on your face from overhead.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.036
But it looks nice.

00:42:29.257 --> 00:42:31.340
Do you guys have any
specific questions right now,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.631
or should we just let you work?

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.960
STUDENT 3: I'm planning to
do animations all night, so--

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.000
PROFESSOR: I didn't see
you guys film anything.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.966
I guess I saw you
guys film that stuff.

00:42:45.966 --> 00:42:48.100
STUDENT 3: Like, I plan
to put animation here.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.058
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
definitely-- it's good.

00:42:50.058 --> 00:42:51.150
That's a good surface.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:54.180
As long as you keep the
pictures small enough.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.360
STUDENT 2: And you can
adjust the size, like,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.280
even after you've done
it After Effects--

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.860
and you've exported it or
transferred over to Premiere--

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.824
you can change the size of it.

00:43:03.824 --> 00:43:04.490
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.781
-How much faster would that be?

00:43:06.281 --> 00:43:08.880
PROFESSOR: Did you guys
use the VIXIA for that one?

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.842
Did you use the
VIXIA in the hotel?

00:43:10.842 --> 00:43:12.050
STUDENT 3: What is the VIXIA?

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.216
PROFESSOR: The Canon camera.

00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:13.980
STUDENT 3: Yeah.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.860
PROFESSOR: That's
like, nicely lit.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.860
Surprisingly nicely lit.

00:43:21.176 --> 00:43:22.926
So it's like a lot of
natural light, then.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:32.955
Yeah, it looks really nice.

00:43:32.955 --> 00:43:34.829
STUDENT 2: I think the
white bed sheets help,

00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:36.654
because they're like
a natural reflector.

00:43:36.654 --> 00:43:37.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:39.605 --> 00:43:41.314
STUDENT 3: So they're
all natural light.

00:43:44.334 --> 00:43:45.750
And there was a
lot of stuff here.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.820
That we threw away.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.250
I was like, oh,
I can't stand it.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.240
It's too much.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.514
PROFESSOR: And the
other thing is,

00:43:53.514 --> 00:43:55.430
you might want to bring
the exposure down just

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.875
a tiny bit, because
the whites here

00:43:57.875 --> 00:43:59.740
are really peaking pretty high.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.170
But everything from
here is so nicely lit

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.650
that I'm almost inclined
to just, like, forget it.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:09.020
Just keep it the way it is.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.994
STUDENT 4: How do you
do the exposure on the--

00:44:10.994 --> 00:44:12.410
PROFESSOR: In the
editing software

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:16.560
there should be a way to just,
like, bring down the exposure.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.382
What are you using for yours?

00:44:18.382 --> 00:44:20.090
STUDENT 3: I think
the simplest way would

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:24.754
be to tap the bright area,
and then it would be--

00:44:24.754 --> 00:44:28.330
STUDENT 4: You mean on
the video camera itself?

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.900
STUDENT 3: Like, on the video
itself-- on the touch screen--

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.700
you just tap your shirt.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.802
Then you will have dim down.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.250
PROFESSOR: Nice job, guys.

00:44:43.004 --> 00:44:45.420
STUDENT 2: You just kind of
disappeared for a couple days,

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.211
but you came back with
really good footage.

00:44:52.415 --> 00:44:54.290
PROFESSOR: I'll let--
you guys can just work.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:55.900
We'll stay out of the way.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.984
STUDENT 2: If you have
any questions, then--

00:45:00.984 --> 00:45:03.150
and I'll be able to answer,
like, any of the editing

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.999
questions you have in Premiere.

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:06.790
PROFESSOR: This one,
I would zoom in on you

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:07.870
a little bit more.

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.250
Because you're a little low.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:15.565
So I would crop in like that,
to where the top of the frame

00:45:15.565 --> 00:45:16.970
is just above your head.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.710
STUDENT 2: Usually do the rule
of thirds with, like, eyes

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.810
rather than the top of head.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:22.560
And I think.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.270
And if you look at your eyes.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.690
They're kind of in
the middle so you want

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.770
to adjust it so they're equal.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.770
Yeah, like that.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.140
PROFESSOR: We'll
let you guys work.

00:45:43.443 --> 00:45:45.908
STUDENT 2: If that's
all let me [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:45.908 --> 00:45:47.387
for today, actually.

00:45:47.387 --> 00:45:49.852
STUDENT 3: What time is it?

00:45:49.852 --> 00:45:52.317
STUDENT 2: It's 10 till 3:00.

00:45:52.317 --> 00:45:54.790
STUDENT 3: OK.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.510
STUDENT 2: OK, so now
what-- the problem

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:01.290
is, illustrator
defaults to a brush.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.090
Which we don't
want, because that

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:07.560
will mess up when we
redraw it in After Effects.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.870
So we select the arrow,
we want to change

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:11.637
Brush Definition to basic.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:28.780
Go into Stroke-- let's see,
why are there not more options?

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.580
There we go.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.300
Change the caps and
corners to round,

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.790
so it's, like, nice and smooth.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.170
Like, it looks like a brush.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.047
Basically, we're making
it look like a brush,

00:46:37.047 --> 00:46:38.130
while doing a basic shape.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.510
And then change it to, like,
whatever weight you want.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:41.360
So you want it about that.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.100
And you can play around.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.475
Like, do you want
it super thick,

00:46:43.475 --> 00:46:45.447
or do you want it not so thick?

00:46:45.447 --> 00:46:47.030
And then the last
thing you need to do

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:53.280
before going into After Effects,
is go into this layer-- and so,

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.100
see, it has the different
parts of the arrow.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.575
You want to highlight
everything, click this drop

00:46:59.575 --> 00:47:01.960
down menu, and
click Reverse Order.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.515
Because it stacks it
from the last thing you

00:47:05.515 --> 00:47:06.890
drew to the first
thing you drew,

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.900
and you want to be first
thing you drew to last thing

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.400
you drew.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.890
Then you want to save this.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.090
We'll just save it
in Documents for now.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.859
OK, and then you open
up After Effects.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.370
PROFESSOR: That's
a nice pan, Joshua.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.540
This is nice camera work.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:54.230
STUDENT 3: Oh yeah, I held
the tripod to the right.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.990
I looked really stupid, though.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.842
STUDENT 2: But
it's really stead.

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.800
STUDENT 3: I didn't
actually hold it like that.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.922
I knew that it would be bad.

00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:04.880
STUDENT 2: If After
Effects would open, and not

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.023
give us the color wheel of
death, then I can show you.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:32.198
I can get it.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.390
I have my computer.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.480
It's, like, open.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.048
It's about half
an hour of video.

00:48:44.048 --> 00:48:45.490
OK, After Effects-- hurray!

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:54.730
OK, so we're going to import our
composition as a composition.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.045
All right, double click it.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.510
I'm going to set it
to a white background,

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.250
just so we can see things.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.100
And depending on-- if you
do it on the black portion,

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.270
you might want to set
the background to black

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:11.770
and have the arrow be in white.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.540
Like, depending on how
you want it to look.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.210
OK, so this is the fun part.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:23.970
So we're going to turn the
arrow layer into shapes.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.390
And then what we're
going to do is,

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:30.170
we're going to a
add a Trim Paths.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:31.910
And basically what
that means is, it's

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.490
going to draw the line for you.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.270
And then under Trim Paths we're
going to trim multiple shapes

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:39.490
individually.

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:44.340
Because that means-- so,
if you do it simultaneously

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.830
it'll draw the arrow-- like,
both lines at the same time.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.760
So it'll start drawing the long
arrow and, like, the arrow head

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.790
at the same time.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:52.970
And we don't want that.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.800
So change it individually.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.850
And then wherever
you want it to start

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:00.720
you turn the end down to zero.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.910
Set your key frame.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:04.410
And, say, we want it
to draw in two seconds.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:08.344
You turn the end to 100.

00:50:08.344 --> 00:50:10.385
And you go back to beginning
and you press space.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:18.082
And it will draw the
arrow is as much time.

00:50:18.082 --> 00:50:19.540
Is that like what
you wanted to do?

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.000
STUDENT 3: Yeah, I
wanted to do arrows.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.860
STUDENT 2: Yeah, and
then you can change it.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.080
Like there's some
lines-- like, I

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.540
like writing out handwriting a
lot in animations in my videos.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.850
And so, like, for
example, if you

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:39.760
want it to pause on the
store, you can set it-- OK,

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.900
so it's like a 35%.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.140
So you can set a key
frame there at 35%.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:53.535
And then you can set another
one later on, also at 35%.

00:50:53.535 --> 00:50:55.160
PROFESSOR: And then
what it does is it,

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.330
like, pauses at the
