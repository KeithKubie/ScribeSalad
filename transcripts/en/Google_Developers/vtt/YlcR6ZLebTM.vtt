KATHRIN PROBST: Hi,
I'm Kathrin, and I

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.250
am a software
engineer at Google.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.660
In this video,
we'll show you how

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.990
to create your own
images that you can then

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.040
use to launch Google Compute
Engine Virtual Machines.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.480
Before we get
started, let's make

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.490
sure you have a few things
set up on your machine.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.129
We're going to be
using a laptop here.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.670
And you'll want to
make sure that you

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.390
will have VirtualBox
installed on it.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.960
So I already have that
installed here, as you can see.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.750
You will also want to make sure
that you have an ISO downloaded

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.840
already that you can use
to set up your image.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.320
In this case, I used a
Debian testing AMD64,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.744
as you can see up here.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:48.160
The last thing you'll want to
make sure you have installed

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.940
is a version of Tar that
supports the old style GNU

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.740
format.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.386
So let's get started.

00:00:57.386 --> 00:00:58.760
The first thing
we're going to do

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.410
is create a new VirtualBox VM.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.390
We're going to name it GCE demo.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.770
And what we'll do is
we'll select Linux.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.330
What we will show
you, although we

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.860
use Debian testing in
this video, all of this

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.420
should work roughly the same
for all Linux distributions.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.140
We're going to pick Debian
64 bit, and click Continue.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.722
We want to give this
a little more memory.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.180
This is optional,
but you can do it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.725
if you want to make things
go a little bit faster.

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:36.760
After I've done
that, we also need

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.549
to create a virtual hard drive.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.840
And we're going to create this.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.200
And what would be good is if
you could choose Copy on Write

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.700
here.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.730
Another thing you'll
want to make sure

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.880
is that the disk that you create
is at least 10 gigabytes big.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.500
OK, so now we actually have
our first VirtualBox virtual

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.390
machine.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.530
We'll have to change a
few settings, though.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.560
So go ahead and go
to click on Settings.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.950
And this will bring
up this dialog here.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.980
And the first thing
you might want to do

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.107
is disable Boot from Floppy.

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:29.440
This just makes the setup
process a little bit smoother.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.273
And it's also not
something that we support.

00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:34.490
So you don't really need it.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.550
Under Storage, when
you click on storage,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.370
make sure you click on the
empty under the controller IDE,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.330
and then on this little
CD icon that you see next

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.390
to CD/DVD drive.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.810
When you click on that icon,
it will give you the option

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.940
to choose a virtual
CD or DVD disc file.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.430
It will open a dialog,
and just navigate

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.320
to wherever you have downloaded
that ISO that I talked about

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.690
at the very beginning.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.030
And you select it
and click Open.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.870
In the Audio tab, make
sure to disable audio.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380
Again, this is not something
that we need for our purposes

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.420
here.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.530
And finally, in the Network
tab, click on the Advanced menu

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.720
here.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.480
And we'll want to make sure that
we select the Paravirtualized

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.680
network-- the virtio-net.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.950
And this will make sure that the
correct drivers are installed

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.609
so that everything
will work smoothly

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.650
with the virtual machine
that you will eventually

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.600
launch in Compute Engine.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.920
OK, ready.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.630
Let's click OK.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.072
So this virtual machine
is now ready to go.

00:03:55.072 --> 00:03:56.530
So the next thing
we're going to do

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.779
is we're going to click Start.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.800
And this will actually take us
through the Debian installer

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.030
now.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.090
So you can use your
up and down arrow keys

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.730
to select Graphical Install.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.580
Click Enter, and this will
now start the installer.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.870
For this video,
I'm going to just

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.090
be choosing English and US.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.950
So choose these as you
see fit, of course.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.930
So I'm going to choose English,
United States, American

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.430
English.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.800
Obviously, these
settings should be

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.735
adjusted to whatever
makes sense for you.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.520
So this takes just a
minute to complete.

00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.655
And it's now
configuring the network.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.390
Excellent.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.306
So this has succeeded.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.330
The host name we're
going to leave as is.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.580
This is a good default here.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.610
And for the domain name,
this is not something

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.810
that we're going to be able
to use when this is actually

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.170
launched as a virtual
machine in Compute Engine.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.290
So you can leave that blank.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.160
This is just fine.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.970
Make sure you do not
set a root password.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.840
This will actually
increase the security

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.670
of your virtual machine.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.110
The user account
that we're going

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.240
to pick, pick whatever user
account makes sense for you.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.030
In my case, I'm just simply
going to pick config.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.540
And then you will
want to make sure

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.687
that you use a very
strong password.

00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:58.270
This is the password
that you're going

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.650
to use to log in to
the virtual machine

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.430
that you are going to create
later on Google Compute Engine.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.985
So I'm going to choose a
password that, hopefully, I

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:06.990
will remember later.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.000
OK, because I live
in Seattle, I'm

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.790
going to choose Pacific
Time, although, of course you

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.080
can change that setting.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.450
OK, the next thing we're
going to need to do

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.220
is to partition the disks.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.570
Really, what we want is
we want one large disk.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.740
We don't really
want any partitions.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.320
If you go through
the standard flow--

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.070
this is not what you
want to do right now,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.622
because it will, by default,
install a swap partition.

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.330
And that's not really
something you need,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.940
and it takes up
space, and you'll

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.180
get better performance
if you don't have it.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.140
So let's select Manual.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.790
So we're going to
click on our hard disk

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.250
that we have already created.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.220
And so it says you have selected
an entire device to partition.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.030
Yeah, so this is
exactly what we want.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.275
So you click Yes, and
you click Continue.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.600
So the next thing you
will do is you will Double

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.115
click on the free space
and create a new partition.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.470
The default setting
is fine here.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.040
So we can leave that as is,
and just click Continue.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.720
Similarly, primary is fine.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.030
So we will click Continue.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.240
At this point, we're
actually already done

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.690
setting up the disk.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.156
So we can Double
click down here,

00:07:46.156 --> 00:07:47.405
done setting up the partition.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.390
And finally, what we will need
to do is, all the settings

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.440
that we have just
created and selected,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.500
we will want to write
those changes to disk.

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:01.750
OK.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:08.940
Oh.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.050
So now it is complaining
that I did not actually

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.430
create a swap space.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.834
And it allows me to go
back and change my mind.

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:17.500
I don't actually want
to change my mind.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.541
So I'm going to say, no,
I don't want to do that.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.770
OK.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.050
And finally, yes, this is
simply confirming the choices

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.800
that we have made.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.370
OK, so at this point, the base
system is being installed.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.917
And this will take a couple
of minutes, some time.

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:41.250
So we have a little bit of time.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.190
Excellent, so now
the base system

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.596
is installed based on
what we have given it.

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:53.060
It now gives us the option
to scan another CD or DVD,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.242
but we don't really want
to do that at this point.

00:08:55.242 --> 00:08:56.325
So we just click Continue.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.480
We do want to set
up a network mirror,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.480
because the network mirror will
allow us to pick and choose

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.010
what will get installed
on this virtual machine.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.895
So let's say Yes, and click
Continue, and United States.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.380
This network mirror
is a good choice.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.280
So we will say Yes.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.300
We don't really need
any proxy information.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.216
This may be different
for your network.

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:26.840
So you might want to
make sure that you

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.380
don't need proxy
information or have

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.230
the correct information
available here.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.940
OK, so the Package Manager
is being configured.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.790
And then it will allow us to
pick and choose what we want.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.670
In our case, we'll
want to start light.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.820
This will, of course,
depend on your situation,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.370
what you want to have installed.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.270
In our case, we'll just
start with an SSH server

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.015
and some standard
system utilities.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.150
At this point, we're
given the option

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.020
to actually report
back information.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.730
You can pick Yes or No.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.170
We're just going to say No here.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.130
Great.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.510
We don't really need the
Debian Desktop Environment.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.570
And we don't need the
print server either.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.130
But we do want the
SSH server installed.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.210
Great.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.010
So now that we've installed
everything that we've selected,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.740
we just need to make
sure that we also

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.750
have the GRUB bootloader
available to us,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.260
so we can actually boot the VM.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.030
We'll click dev SDA here.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.530
And we should be good to go.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.150
After it finishes
the installation,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.370
we can actually click Continue.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.755
And the system will
go down and reboot.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.070
So now I should be able to log
in with the login and password

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:54.730
that I created.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.550
So let's hope I
remember my password.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.764
Great.

00:11:02.764 --> 00:11:04.180
So now I'm in this
virtual machine

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.820
that we've just created,
and configured, and booted.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.660
So that's wonderful, and we
now have this virtual machine.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.680
But we haven't tied this at all
to Google Compute Engine yet.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.997
And this will be the next part.

00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:16.580
So what we're going
to do now is we're

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.850
going to shut down this virtual
machine that we have here.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.105
OK, so the system
is now powered off,

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.810
as you can see here in
the VirtualBox Manager.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.010
As we get ready to launch a
Compute Engine virtual machine,

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.100
we want to make sure that
we exit out of VirtualBox--

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.530
we quit, so that the
disk is not in use.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.850
And then, to get
our disk ready to be

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.600
used by Compute Engine,
what we'll want to do

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.880
is we will want to create a
copy in a different format,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.120
in the RAW format.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.210
And for this, you can use
the command that I show here.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:30.250
So to create the
disk from RAW format,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.770
you tell it to take
the format RAW.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:56.870
VirtualBox, VMs,
and then-- so this

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.360
will take a little bit of time
to actually create that disk,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.470
to create the copy of
the disk in RAW format.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.127
OK, now we've created
a copy of our disk.

00:13:08.127 --> 00:13:09.710
And so the next thing
we'll need to do

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.410
is we will actually need to put
this in a specific format that

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.850
is required by Google.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.020
So we're going to
create a archive.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.010
And the way we do that is,
actually, just-- I already

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.640
have that here in history.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.050
So we will create an
archive of the disk

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.050
that we've just created.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.758
And we're going to
call it GCEdemotar.gz.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.640
Great.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.062
Now we have the archive.

00:13:36.062 --> 00:13:37.520
The next thing
we're going to do is

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.400
we are just simply going to
upload this archive to Google

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.800
Cloud Storage.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.350
And the simplest way to
do this is to use gsutil.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.510
Gsutil is our
command line utility

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.400
for interacting
with cloud storage.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.710
So we will simply copy the file.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.210
So you can see here
in this command,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.547
we use copy, gsutil copy,
the name of the file,

00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:03.380
and then you give it
the name of your bucket

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.290
that you want, in
cloud storage, that you

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.420
want this archive to end up in.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.410
In my case, I called this
bucket VirtualBox GCE demo.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.230
Make sure this bucket
already exists,

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.250
otherwise gsutil will complain
and make you create it.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:26.190
So this will be uploading
now for some time.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.630
OK, so our archive
has successfully

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.770
been uploaded to
Google Cloud Storage.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.440
What you can see here
is that gsutil actually

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.140
broke the archive up
into smaller chunks,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.950
and uploaded them
separately, and then

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.570
stitched them back together.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.410
So that's where the separate
uploading lines come from.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.530
Now that we actually have
our archive in Google Cloud

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.640
Storage, we can create a Google
Compute Engine image from it.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.870
The way to do that
is gcloud compute,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.450
which is our brand
new command line

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.340
utility for interacting
with Google Compute Engine.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.060
And the way you
will do this is you

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.229
will say gcloud
compute images, create,

00:15:07.229 --> 00:15:09.520
and then you give it the name
that you want to give it,

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.450
and the source URI, which is
the bucket and the name of where

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.860
you had just put it
in cloud storage.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.550
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.610
And this will also
take a bit of time.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.820
Great, so gcloud compute images
came back, and it said yes.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.070
Great, I've created the image,
and its status is ready.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.550
We're almost finished.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.530
The last thing
that we need to do

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.570
is we actually need to create a
virtual machine from the image

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.970
that we have just created.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.680
And the way to do that, again,
you would use gcloud compute,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.620
instance is create, and,
again, you give it a name.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.120
You give it the
image that we've just

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.230
created, and then
a machine type,

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.000
and the zone where you
want this virtual machine

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.240
to be created in.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.280
The first time you create a new
virtual machine from an image,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.560
it will take a
little bit longer.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.440
The next subsequent instance
creations, or virtual machine

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.200
creations, will take less time.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.650
OK, our instance
has been created.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.060
And the status is running,
as you can see here.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.870
Now it's there.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.620
It's running.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.420
And what we want to
do is to make sure

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.450
that we can actually use
it as we can SSH into it.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.650
Because we didn't take
any special steps to make

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.190
this image GCE
ready, you will have

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.970
to log in with the
username and password

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.840
that we set up earlier
in the process.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.740
So in my case, the
username was config@.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.510
And then you give it
the external IP address,

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.320
which you can see
here as the NAT IP.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.900
So I'm going to select this.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.660
I'm just going to type it.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.290
And then I should be able
to log into this machine.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.210
You say Yes, I want to continue.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:14.910
And then I type in my
crazy password again.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.660
And here we are.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.450
That wraps up our demonstration.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.089
I hope you learned from it
how to set up your own images

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.099
and bring them to
our platform, and use

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.730
it to set up virtual
machine instances.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.480
