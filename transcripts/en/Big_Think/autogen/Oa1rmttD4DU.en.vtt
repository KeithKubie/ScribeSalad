the biggest problem in using technology

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
the biggest problem in using technology
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.359
the biggest problem in using technology
is that if you use technology to improve

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
is that if you use technology to improve
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.490

now when you take technology and place

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
now when you take technology and place
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140
now when you take technology and place
it in the learning environment if you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
it in the learning environment if you
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.450
it in the learning environment if you
make it subservient to the current

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
make it subservient to the current
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.840
make it subservient to the current
linear system then the power of the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
linear system then the power of the
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.899
linear system then the power of the
technology is constrained and then to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
technology is constrained and then to
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.969
technology is constrained and then to
that extent it is not effective then its

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
that extent it is not effective then its
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.280
that extent it is not effective then its
effect is only as much as the school

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
effect is only as much as the school
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.359
effect is only as much as the school
system's effect whereas if you were to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
system's effect whereas if you were to
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.920
system's effect whereas if you were to
remove it from the education school

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
remove it from the education school
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960
remove it from the education school
education system and say the school

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
education system and say the school
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.020

changed to suit the new technology then

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
changed to suit the new technology then
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429
changed to suit the new technology then
you have a particular advantage the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
you have a particular advantage the
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.190
you have a particular advantage the
question is how you do it second part is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
question is how you do it second part is
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.749
question is how you do it second part is
in our parts of the world at least I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

can't say much about the developed world

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810
can't say much about the developed world
 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.800

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
bit sometimes it's good to listen to
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.650
bit sometimes it's good to listen to
elders but you have to you go to the

you answers and the pretension is that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
you answers and the pretension is that
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.470
you answers and the pretension is that
the teacher knows the answers or the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
the teacher knows the answers or the
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.120
the teacher knows the answers or the
textbook nor the answers or somebody

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.570
textbook nor the answers or somebody
knows the answers whereas the whole idea

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580
knows the answers whereas the whole idea
 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.850
knows the answers whereas the whole idea
is that in the modern world you should

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860
is that in the modern world you should
 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.040
is that in the modern world you should
be looking for answers you should become

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050
be looking for answers you should become
 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.810
be looking for answers you should become
a self learner because there's so much

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820
a self learner because there's so much
 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.120
a self learner because there's so much
out there to be learned and there's no

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
out there to be learned and there's no
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.970
out there to be learned and there's no
way that the content that humanity is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
way that the content that humanity is
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.550
way that the content that humanity is
generated over so many hundred years can

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
generated over so many hundred years can
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.440
generated over so many hundred years can
be absorbed over five ten fifteen

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
be absorbed over five ten fifteen
 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.440
be absorbed over five ten fifteen
sixteen years so the important thing is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
sixteen years so the important thing is
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.600
sixteen years so the important thing is
to learn the skills of learning to learn

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610
to learn the skills of learning to learn
 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.090
to learn the skills of learning to learn
cooperatively the old system says you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100
cooperatively the old system says you
 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.470
cooperatively the old system says you
are gonna learn and you're going to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
are gonna learn and you're going to
 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.540
are gonna learn and you're going to
appear for the exam the new system is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550
appear for the exam the new system is
 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.920
appear for the exam the new system is
saying you can work in groups and learn

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930
saying you can work in groups and learn
 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.410
saying you can work in groups and learn
and crack the problem so I think we need

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
and crack the problem so I think we need
 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120
and crack the problem so I think we need
to fundamentally change the way we are

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130
to fundamentally change the way we are
 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.680
to fundamentally change the way we are
learning the way that we are being

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
learning the way that we are being
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.060
learning the way that we are being
assessed and certified as well so

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
assessed and certified as well so
 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.380
assessed and certified as well so
policymakers very clearly everybody says

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390
policymakers very clearly everybody says
 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.530
policymakers very clearly everybody says
put computers in the kids hands that's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540
put computers in the kids hands that's
 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.270
put computers in the kids hands that's
only part of the problem in in my part

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
only part of the problem in in my part

copyright issues so after all those

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900
copyright issues so after all those
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.360
copyright issues so after all those
things are done I think we'll be ready

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370
things are done I think we'll be ready
 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.440
things are done I think we'll be ready
for a proper serious use of technology

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
for a proper serious use of technology

for a proper serious use of technology
right now the technology is only a

right now the technology is only a
helper in the current inefficient system
