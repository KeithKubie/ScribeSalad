00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is this one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's the probability that the message is M divided by the number of keys.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To see why let's think about our probability space.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have all the possible messages being ordered.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We have message 0, message 1, all the possible messages.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There is some message that we've selected that's message M8.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We don't want to assume that the messages are uniformly distributed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The probability that the message is M is not necessarily

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
1 divided by the number of messages.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the messages were uniformly distributed, then this answer would also be correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But they're not. We don't want to assume that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Maybe the attacker has some prior knowledge about the distribution of the messages.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's normally the case.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Even if we don't know anything about the particular messages,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
maybe we know it's a message in English.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Most random strings of text are not messages in English.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The other dimension in our probability space is the choice of the key.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There are K possible keys.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What we want to know is what is the intersection of these two events.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The M even is this line in our probability space.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Each one of these keys maps exactly one message to C.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We saw that before, that there is one key that maps each message to C.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We can think of that as being a diagonal line through our probability space.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is the line where the encryption of Ki and Mi is equal to C.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Depending on what C is, it might not be a diagonal line.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But we can think of it that way, that there's one key

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that maps each message to each cipher text.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That means there's exactly one point here where those two intersect.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If the distributions were normal, that would indeed by the correct answer.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's one point and our space is the size of M times the size of K.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But the distribution isn't normal.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We don't want to make any assumption about the distribution of M.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
For the keys we do want to assume that the distribution is normal,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that each key is equally likely. The keys are chosen perfectly at random.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We have the probability of picking M&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and we're multiplying that by the probability of picking this intersecting key.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We'll call that K&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But because the keys are uniformly distributed, we know that this probability is 1/K--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
1 over the size of K.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We don't know that about the messages.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We leave that probability as it is.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That's why this is the answer to the probability that the message M intersected

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
with the encryption of the message is C.

00:02:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now let's go back to our definition.
