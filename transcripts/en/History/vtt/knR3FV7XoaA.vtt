DANNY: Lonny's been doing
an awesome job painting

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.803
cars for us for years, man.

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:07.273
And while his 1986 Lincoln
was always a beautiful car,

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:09.809
it was lacking that special
Count's Kustoms touch.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.645
So not only did we
do some cool trunk

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.281
upgrades and some
cool stereo upgrades,

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.817
we came up with a wicked
paint job on this thing

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.421
and took it from
badass to world class.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.556
Lonny is so excited
to show this car off.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.259
He's brought along a good
buddy of his named Remo.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.827
Now, Remo's been in
the lowrider industry

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.397
for a long time, a wicked
custom painter in his own right.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.832
So we're going to show
this car off to Remo.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.369
If we get his stamp of
approval, man, we have won.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:38.438
How long have you been doing
the lowrider stuff, brother?

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.173
Over-- Over 10 years now.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.707
Nice.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.109
So he's got it running through
the veins like me and you.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.710
- Absolutely.
- He's got the fever.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:46.512
I think you're
going to dig it, bro.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.681
You know, Remo, everybody here
worked really, really hard,

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.316
and there's a few
reasons why, man.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.385
I mean, first off,
the car is a cool car.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.653
It's a great project.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.721
Second off, man,
Lonny is family.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.290
He's a brother.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.426
Third off, this dude is
so picky that everybody

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.564
had to come out swinging or
it was getting kicked back.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:05.731
So I hope you dig this one.
- Absolutely.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:06.799
REMO: I can't wait to see it.

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.167
Absolutely.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.469
And, you know,
usually, this is my

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.437
point where I yell for
something to come out.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.472
No.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.474
Your car, you do it.
- Nice.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.741
And if you don't
do this right,

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:16.676
I'll make you do it again.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.577
I'll make you proud.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.544
[danny laughs]

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:20.746
Go, brother.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:27.186
Ryan, pull that beautiful
town car out, baby!

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.755
Check this out.
LONNY: Oowie.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.724
Look at that grille.

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.226
Oh, man.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.494
REMO: Ooh.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.162
Nice.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.331
REMO: Excuse my French,
but that's [bleep] badass.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.166
LONNY: Look at that.
Look at that.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.334
Look at the shine on that.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.436
Look at the pinstripe on that.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.737
Yeah.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.906
DANNY: To transform
this car from a nice car

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.909
to a Count's Kustoms creation,
we went to town on this paint

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:53.746
job, adding pinstripes and a
classic lowrider scrollwork

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.382
to the already beautiful
blue base coat.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.651
And he also threw in
a few extra touches

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:02.488
like the incredible water drops
on the trunk and on the hood.

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.624
With all that gorgeous
work that Ghetto Bob did

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.760
on that awesome custom
stereo system neatly hidden

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.929
with those friction-fit
covers in the trunk,

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:12.231
this thing is ready
for the show circuit.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:16.769
I couldn't be prouder of my team
and of this beautiful Lincoln.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:17.803
I think it's gorgeous, man.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:18.804
I'm really happy with it.

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.673
This thing came out so sick.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:23.242
I can't believe how well these
guys did for me this time.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:24.377
Remo, what do you think?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.811
REMO: It's better
than a Lincoln.

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:26.612
LONNY: That's right.
REMO: It's a Count's Lincoln.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.514
[laughter]

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:30.283
The water drops, sick.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.884
[laughter]

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.353
As a painter, I know
it's really, really

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:39.759
tricky to make outstanding water
drops on a dark base like this.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:40.893
That's what's tripping me up.

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.395
I love the way you pinstripe.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.797
Artwork style mixed
with this, the curves

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.899
of a lowrider scrolling style.
- Absolutely.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.534
Beautiful.
LONNY: Yeah.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.703
I wanted to keep it sleek
and elegant, you know?

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.572
Keep the old school
flavor on him.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.675
And then, of course, the
hood matches the deck lid.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.543
Over and under is on the top.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:01.414
The finish on this car--
the clear coat is flawless.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.583
LONNY: If you look real close,
just don't hurt yourself

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.984
on that nice hood ornament.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.586
DANNY: Hold up a second.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.587
I don't have one of these.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.555
[lonny laughs]

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:10.856
Oh, and it's [inaudible]!

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:11.724
LONNY: Completely functional.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:12.992
DANNY: I love that.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:14.460
RYAN: Yeah, that's
beautiful [inaudible]..

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:15.828
DANNY: I got to have
that on my Lincoln now.

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:16.529
LONNY: And here's the
kicker right here, Remo.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:17.563
The trunk.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:18.731
It was a mess back there before.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:19.565
We tucked it.

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:20.833
We cut it to fit.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.602
No screws required.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:27.006
It's just such cut out precision
that it just fits together.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.941
I love the shapes
in all the panels.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.810
Instead of leaving
them flat, just gave

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.545
a little edge or something.

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:33.879
Let's give all the
flavor [inaudible]..

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:38.484
This car it's-- it's you.

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:39.819
There's one more
thing I've got to show

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.420
you guys inside the garage.

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:42.755
Let's go check this out, man.

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:46.259
[music playing]

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.632
Closing this thing down?

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:53.633
What are you going to do?

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.634
Are you going to call your car?

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.502
I'm going to call my car.

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.004
Lights on.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:58.904
No way.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:00.373
[laughter]

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.641
Check you out, man.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:02.775
Hey, this is for the
night's show, guys.

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.310
Let's go to strobe
light, please.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:05.645
DANNY: Look at that.
And it changing colors?

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.980
Oh, dude.
Get down, man.

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:09.915
Dude, the grille?
LONNY: Yes, sir.

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:11.450
DANNY: Underneath?
LONNY: Yes, sir.

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:12.318
DANNY: The wheel wells?

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:12.918
LONNY: Yes, sir.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.620
Come on, man.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:16.055
All phone operated.

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:17.890
DANNY: All from your phone?

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.326
That's cool that you
can talk to your ride

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.927
and make it do this
from your phone.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.330
REMO: That's a
traditional lowrider

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:26.065
with a little modern twist.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.533
Really good job, guys.

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:29.535
And, Lonny,
congratulations once again.

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:30.670
Thank you for
being there, man.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.405
- I love it.
- This is beautiful.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.874
Man, I'm so glad that we could
do something special for one

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.676
of my guys, and I got
to say, this Lincoln

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.544
came out just beautiful.

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:40.746
I'm proud to see this
thing parked in my parking

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.683
lot every day as long as
Lonny will hook me up with one

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:44.950
of them cool hood ornaments.

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:46.819
Right now, I think
he owes me a ride.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.421
Well, Lonny, let's
go to the office.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:49.388
I've got your bill waiting.

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.390
[laughter]

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:54.827
I'll be right there, boss!
Thank you.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.429
- Absolutely, man.
- Thank you, Danny.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.662
Absolutely.
Man, she's beautiful.
