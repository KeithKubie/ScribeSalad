00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
 . 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.730
 What we will do in this show is, through a set of 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.710
 Examples, recognition 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.670
 The coordinate system x, y 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.810
 First, take a look at some of the points 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.500
 Actually set and find its coordinates 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.390
 Then we'll look at some coordinates and find 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.290
 Where are these points located? 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.395
 Then we will solve another issue 

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:19.700
 If let's find what they are 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.890
 Coordinates of these points? 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.550
 Here we have this point A 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 You can see it here 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.600
 You can turn it down 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800
 Which intersection x axis? 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.346
 x = 5 

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:36.960
 It's a 5 point, and y will equal 6 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990
 5.6 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.920
 Now this point B here, what is the x-coordinate? 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 It's 5 to the left 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.940
 5 to the left of the x axis 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.496
 This is -5 

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:50.590
 The x-coordinate is -5 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.340
 The y coordinate is, if we move straight to the right 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 We will reach y = 5 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 y = 5 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.190
 Let's change the colors 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.050
 C 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750
 I think you absorbed it 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.040
 Let's start first with Y. The y coordinate is 3 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.760
 As you see here 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.440
 Then the x-coordinate is -2 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.130
 2 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.850
 We always put x coordinates first. thats it 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.800
 The agreement we use 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.660
 In D, the x-coordinate is -2 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.210
 As you see here 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.750
 The y-coordinate is -2 as well 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.040
 Let me use another color 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 E, let's find the coordinate y 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.650
 We will find him first, but he will 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.450
 You should always write it second 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.780
 He-4 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.510
 As you can see here, y coordinate 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.420
 The x is 3 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.820
 Finally, F 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.046
 The x coordinate is 2 

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:46.000
 The y-factor is -6 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.550
 I hope that this is your idea about finding 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.570
 Coordinates 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.550
 Now let's go in the other direction 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.190
 Let's start with coordinates and find where those fall 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.600
 Points 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 If we have the first 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.560
 I will write it with a small symbol between the brackets until we divide it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200
 About this A 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.190
 It is located at 4.2, ie x = 4 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.500
 And y = 2 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.410
 If x = 4 and y = 2 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.360
 This is the point here 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.855
 Let us solve the following 

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.850
 Let me use a color that is easy for you to read 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.150
 b 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.680
 x = -3 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 y = 5.5 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.480
 We move all this distance to 5.5 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.440
 y = 5.5 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.100
 This is the point (b) 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.050
 Then c, which is 4, -4, ie x = 4 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.300
 And y = -4 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.190
 Here 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.610
 Then the last point 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.230
 I will write it in orange 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.915
 d, which is x = -2, and y = -3 

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:54.760
 x = -2, and y = -3 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.140
 Here 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.180
 These are (d) 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.980
 You can go in the other direction 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.790
 It can say, that y = -3 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.690
 And x = -2 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.360
 Go to the left and down 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.070
 Or you can go to the peppers and to the left 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
 And continue to go until you reach the same point 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.400
 I hope this gave you a good grasp of how to find 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.160
 Coordinates 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 Or if given coordinates, how to find 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.550
 Where coordinates x, y 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.480
 Now let's solve issues that contain more 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.100
 As follows, if we have 3 points are considered three heads 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.000
 For box A, B, C, D 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.440
 Then set them on the graph 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.180
 Then select the coordinates of the fourth point 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.030
 Which is D 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.210
 Well, let's set them on the chart. as such 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.230
 It is required of us 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.860
 this is good 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.890
 This will be the y axis 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.410
 This is the y axis 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.910
 Vertical axis 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.160
 This will be the x axis 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.620
 X axis 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.750
 Let me put some - let me see her 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.800
 x This is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.700
 x This is equal to -1, -2, -3 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.460
 4 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.000
 And y = 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.270
 y equals -1, -2, -3 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.590
 4 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.350
 I can write that y = 4 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.530
 And y are equal to -4, and x = 4 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.950
 x = -4 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.180
 And let's see 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.649
 Let us identify these points 

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.970
 We first have point A and are equal to -4, 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.730
 4 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.230
 We go on x to -4 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.810
 Then y = -4 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.040
 The Fancy 4 is down here 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.790
 This is point A 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.080
 -4, -4 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.350
 So that the appointment is familiar to you 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.790
 If you have not seen it before, that's where 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.600
 Some people call these parts of the coordinate system 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.440
 This is called the first quarter 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.510
 This is called the second quarter 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.850
 This is called the third quarter 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.950
 This is called the fourth quarter 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.290
 These Roman numerals I, II, III and 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.570
 IV, if this point falls in the third quarter 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.480
 When we look at all this here, these points 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.840
 Located in the fourth quarter 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.160
 This is in the third quarter, the second, the first. it's a 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.430
 Something interesting to know 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.920
 Sometimes someone asks you, what quarter 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.540
 Where is this point located? 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.990
 You'll say, well, I'll see 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.850
 If both are negative, they will be in 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.000
 Third quarter 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.100
 If y is negative, x is positive 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.640
 Will be in the fourth quarter 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.560
 If both are positive, they will be in the first quarter. If y 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.760
 Positive, but negative x, will be in the second quarter 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.150
 And we'll talk a little about it when 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.480
 We identify these points 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.880
 Point B, x is positive 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.730
 Namely 1, 2, 3 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.430
 And y = -4 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.710
 We put it here in this quarter 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.580
 This point B 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620
 Namely, 3, -4 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.280
 We can actually see the rectangle button which 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.920
 They talk about him, here 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.700
 Notice, both have the same y value 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.080
 Both are located at the same level below the x axis 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.600
 What is the next point? 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.880
 Point C is 3.3 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.880
 3.3 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.100
 Located in the first quarter 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.600
 Their coordinates are positive 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.490
 3.3 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.910
 Both x and y are positive 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.620
 They observed, it is vertical as B 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.690
 It has the same value of x 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.460
 Both have an x ​​value of 3 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.220
 It's located here 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.910
 above it 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.210
 Now we have to find the last point 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.740
 Well, the point should be the same 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.760
 Straightness like this is the point 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.690
 Will be on the same straightness of these 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.290
 Point, meaning it must have the same value as x 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.250
 this point 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.320
 Its x value is -4 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.360
 Then they are on the same row 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.660
 this point 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.680
 Will be on the same 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.020
 Describe this point 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.560
 It must have the same y value as the same 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.320
 Height above the x-axis 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.270
 Must be 3 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.570
 This is point D 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.850
 They noted it was located at -4, above A 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.230
 And y = 3 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.210
 To the left of point C 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.980
 We're done 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.266
 .
