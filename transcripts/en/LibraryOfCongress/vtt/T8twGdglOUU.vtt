&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.100
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
the 14th Librarian

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.510
of Congress, Carla Hayden.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.140
[ Applause ]

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.800
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden:
Good evening and welcome.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.590
We are so please to see
all of you here tonight

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.600
for a very, very
special evening.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.740
We have to start out with saying
aloha to students and faculty

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.720
of the University of Hawaii
who are watching via livestream

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.220
at the Center for [inaudible].

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.200
I knew I was going to do that.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.670
Oceanography Research and
Education on the University

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.470
of Hawaii's Manoa Campus.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.770
Please excuse me.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.740
I am an arts and sciences
major and I knew that,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
but we are so delighted to have
you here tonight and on behalf

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.180
of the Library of Congress,
it's my pleasure to welcome you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.440
as we continue a wonderful
5-year collaboration

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.870
with the Daniel K.
Inouye Institute

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.080
to commemorate the life,
the legacy and the values

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.300
of the late Senator
Daniel Inouye.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.030
As many of you know, he valued
friendship before politics;

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.590
country before political party;
and honor above all else.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.340
He was a champion of freedom and
fairness, and it is a privilege

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.380
for us to celebrate his
legacy this evening.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.590
This event is made possible
by the generous donation

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.390
from the Daniel K. Inouye
Institute and we are grateful,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.660
very grateful to have with us
this evening the driving force

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.510
behind his legacy,
Mrs. Irene Inouye.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.590
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.890
We are looking forward to
next year's celebration

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.090
and we are hoping that all of
you will join us and be part

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.880
of a wonderful, wonderful
celebration.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.690
I'm not going to call
upon the Director

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.430
of the John Kluge
Center, Mr. John Haskell

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.940
who will introduce the
lecture and the panelists.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.350
[ Applause ]

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.650
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank you.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.430
And as many of you know, Dr.
Hayden has brought a new energy

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.060
and dynamism to the library

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.860
and that she's only been
here two years, a little less

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.160
than two years and many

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.190
of us are excited to
be a part of that.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.020
As for the Kluge Center
itself under Dr. Hayden,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.130
the center had re-centered
on its original mission

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.450
to be a bridge between
scholarship on the one hand

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.450
and policymakers and
interested public on the other.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.560
Tonight's event exemplifies
that purpose.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.070
Senator Inouye was a larger than
life figure here in Washington

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.710
and in his home state of Hawaii.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.130
As a young man, after
the ban was lifted

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.520
on Japanese American
serving their country,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.070
he enlisted in the Army
and served in a unit

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.440
of Japanese American
soldiers who fought

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.990
with extraordinary gallantry
in Italy, France, and Germany.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.920
On October 21, 1945, in the
war's final weeks in Europe,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.920
he was severely wounded.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.880
He had just taken out two
German machinegun nests,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.730
he lost his right arm.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.720
He returned home with a
distinguished service cross,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.200
a bronze star medal, two
purple hearts, 12 other medals

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.290
and citations, and not
incidentally a commitment

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.890
to bipartisanship that may
have stemmed from the long,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.460
lifelong friendship he
formed in an army hospital

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.630
with another wounded veteran,
the future Republican Senator,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.930
Vice-Presidential candidate

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.730
and Presidential
candidate, Kansas's Bob Dole.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.580
After coming home and
finishing law school,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.660
Mr. Inouye became Hawaii's
first representative in 1959

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.230
which was the year
Hawaii became a state.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.760
Three years later, he
was elected Senator,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.130
part of freshman class
inspired by President Kennedy,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.760
which included President
Kennedy's brother Edward.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.310
Senator Inouye served for
nearly a half a century

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.570
in the senate leaving
a rich legacy

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.840
that includes the National
Museum of the Native-American,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.580
prominent service on the Senate
Watergate Committee, as well as,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.560
on the Iran Contra
Committee and, of course,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.320
on the Senate Appropriations
Committee which he chaired

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.830
in the last several
years of his career.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.640
He was awarded the Congressional
Medal of Honor in 2000

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.670
for his military service.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.970
After his death,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.170
he was posthumously awarded
the Presidential Medal

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.510
of Freedom becoming
the first senator

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.680
to receive both of those awards.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.820
Tonight, the John W. Kluge
Center at the library

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.860
and the Daniel K. Inouye
Institute present the 4th

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.250
in a 5-year distinguished
lecture series

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.950
to commemorate Senator Inouye's
commitment to bipartisanship,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.910
moral courage, public
service, and civic engagement.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.330
I would now like to
introduce our distinguished

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.630
panelists tonight.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.910
First, E.J. Dionne who
writes about politics

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.140
in a twice weekly column
for the Washington Post

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.720
where he's worked since 1990,
he's also a government professor

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.630
at Georgetown, a visiting
professor at Harvard

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.100
and a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.580
He's the sole author of 7 books.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.750
Most recently, "Why the Right
Went Wrong; Conservatism

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.260
from Goldwater to the
Tea Party and Beyond."

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.140
He made his name as a major
political intellectual

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.440
with the publication of

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.080
"Why Americans Hate
Politics" in 1991.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.600
It's not a new thing.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.240
Ross Douthat joined the New
York Times as an op-ed columnist

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.110
in April 2009, previously
he had been senior editor

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.410
at the Atlantic.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.020
He is the author of 4
books including this year,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.810
"To Change the Church;
Pope Francis and the Future

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.220
of Catholicism", as well
as, "Grand New Party;

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.790
How Republicans can
Win the Working Class

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.250
and Save the American Dream."

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.030
Our conversation will be
moderated by Ann Compton,

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.950
former ABC News White
House correspondent.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.970
Ann joined ABC News in 1973.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.390
She covered 7 presidents.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.690
She's traveled around the
globe and through all 50 states

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.900
with the presidents,
their vice-presidents,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.520
as well as, first ladies.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.010
We are delighted that
she can be with us.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.770
After the conversation,
we will allot some time

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.740
for audience questions,
that would be

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.620
after some prerecorded
questions from students

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.340
at the University
of Hawaii campuses.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.280
Please join me in welcoming
our distinguished panelists

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.510
to the stage.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:03.790
[ Applause ]

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.080
Take a seat over there.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.380
Thank you sir.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.180
Thanks Ross.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.040
[ Background Sounds ]

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.340
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Good evening.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.640
Thank you.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.330
Aloha to the students who are
watching and to all of you

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.200
who have come tonight to talk
about the American dream.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.600
It probably goes back
to, we hold these truths

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.880
to be self-evident "All men are
created equal, life, liberty

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.350
and the pursuit of happiness."

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.660
But where is the
American dream today?

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.040
Is there some; can there be such
a thing in a world as diverse

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.500
and deeply divided as
our times as these?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.130
Senator Dan Inouye lived
the American dream.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.920
In fact, he bled for it
as President Obama said

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.710
in his eulogy when
the senator died.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.750
Ross I'm going to
start with you.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.910
You wrote recently about
the American dream,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.470
you said "It ain't
in California."

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.760
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat:
But possibly Hawaii.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:18.750
Right, well that, that
column was about, you know,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.720
in certain ways I would
say that the State

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.960
of California has
become especially perhaps

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.320
in the Presidency of Donald
Trump, a kind of idealized view

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.320
of America's political
future for some liberals

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.780
and progressives and
democrats in the sense

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.840
that in California
you have a situation

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.220
where the Republican
Party as nationally

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.520
as pretty dysfunctional,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.650
but unlike nationally is
pretty much irrelevant as well.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.790
And in that sense,
California, you know,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.630
and therefore California is
sort of not only as always sort

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.490
of on the cutting edge of,
you know, new technology

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.340
in Silicon Valley and the
movie industry and so on,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.240
but is also seen as being
kind of on the cutting edge

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.630
of where progressive politics
could hope to be if the darkness

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.240
of the Trump era should pass

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.070
and the emerging democratic
majority should finally emerge.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.170
And so, the column that I wrote
was basically saying that,

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.830
you know, while that might be
true if you look at the sort

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.540
of sociological landscape of
California, if you look at sort

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.720
of the social structure that has
emerged there, it doesn't look

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.090
at all what, like what I
think many progressives,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.340
E.J. probably included,
would argue is the essence

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.560
of the American dream and we,
I mean we could sort of go back

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.190
and forth on what
that essence is,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.750
but I think most people would
say that it has something to do

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.820
with a mix of kind of, you know,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.150
a sort of strong
economically stable middle-class

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.550
and various forms of
sort of social equality

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.140
and upward mobility that sort
of intersect in different ways.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.510
And the society that
California has even

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.800
under progressive governance is
a much more stratified society

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.480
in which for various complicated
reasons of public policy

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.840
and sort of overall
macro trends,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.550
the middle-class has
basically been priced out

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.120
and so you have an
extremely wealthy upper-class

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.780
that has sort of entrenched
its privileges in various ways

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.840
through land use
regulations and restrictions

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.820
on building and everything else.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.440
And then you have an
increasingly immigrant-base

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.830
working-class that
sort of serves as sort

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.120
of the service sector for that
economy and you have very little

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.540
in between and you have, once
you control for cost of living,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.110
extremely high child
poverty rates,

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.200
extremely high racial
gaps, you know,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.300
again whatever else the American
dream means; it has something

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.070
to with the equality of
the races and the quality

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.340
of opportunity and so on.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.160
And so, the takeaway from
the column I guess was

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.430
that if this is the future

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.980
and if this is particularly
the future

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.950
that progressives are hoping
to build after the age

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.090
of Donald Trump should pass,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.280
then there's still
considerable work to be done

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.240
if that future is going to sort
of dovetail with what, again,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.990
I think traditionally
Americans have sort

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.880
of imagined the American
dream to be and to just

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.680
to personalize it a tiny
bit as I did in the column,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.040
I'm from the East Coast,
but I was actually born

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.690
in San Francisco in 1979.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.350
And I was born there
because my father was

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.680
from southern California and
he grew up in Santa Monica

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.160
in a period when that was a
kind of middle-class paradise.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.960
His dad was a pretty
unsuccessful small businessman,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.690
I think it's fair to say.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.570
He ran a bicycle shop badly and
had various sort of salesmany

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:50.200
"Willy" Lomanish jobs
and my grandmother sort

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.610
of held the house
together, but they were

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.430
in no way what you would
consider sort of a, you know,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.330
a major American successes.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.520
They were sort of slightly below
the middle-class, and yet they,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.740
you know, owned a small
sort of mission style home

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.480
in a neighborhood that was
close to the ocean and felt

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.620
like an earthly paradise and
were surrounded by people

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.480
with sort of similar
means and aspirations.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.730
And, you know, there
were all kinds

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.390
of sort inevitable reasons
why that couldn't last,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.700
but it's still notable that it
didn't last and if you go back

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.620
to Santa Monica now, all
those houses like the one

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.360
where my dad grew up have
been torn down to make way

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.120
for structures that are 2 or
3 times too large for the lots

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.320
that they sit on and all
cost 4 or 5 million dollars

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.720
and that world is gone.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.870
And, you know, it was a
racially segregated world,

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.780
it was stratified in
all kinds of other ways.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.330
There are all kinds of reasons
why it's never coming back,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.980
but it's still notable that it
existed and then disappeared

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.950
and its disappearance is one

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.680
of the realities I
think underlying some

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.500
of our present political
discontents.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.120
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: E.J., is the
American dream even possible

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.960
in our society, in a political
society that's as deviant

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.100
as Washington is now,
as this country is now?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.400
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Could
I just say a couple

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.700
of things first if I may?

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.390
One is, you know, whenever I'm

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.540
with my friend Ross I feel
obligated to defend Pope Francis

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.940
and now I will feel obligated

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.040
to defend California
and his grandfather.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.070
[ Laughter ]

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.420
I just want to say, it's a
real joy to be at the Library

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.340
of Congress and I am, I got to
say I'm the son of a librarian,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.810
so to have the opener of a
program like this be the Library

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.040
of Congress is for me higher
than having the President

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.340
of the United States here.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.510
So, I want to a there.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.370
[ Applause ]

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.670
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat:
So, more true now

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.970
than in some administrations.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.270
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Yeah,
I was going to say,

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.520
you could interpret that
many different ways,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.560
so they're probably all
true, but so it's a real joy

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.440
to be here as part of
the in a way, program.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.730
This is my second Inouye event
this year and I got to do a talk

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.520
in Hawaii and learn an enormous
amount about Hawaii politics.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.190
So, it's great to start

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.000
with a little knowledge your
learning curve is awesome.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.860
And, but I really realized that,
you know, when I was thinking

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.480
about the American dream,
Dan Inouye is part of that,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.910
and that it's one of the
ironies of our history

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.050
that Japanese Americans
and non-Whites in general,

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.540
in Hawaii broke through partly
because of their service

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.960
in World War II and that
Hawaiian politics was

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.050
revolutionized by a group of
veterans led by Senator Inouye

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.310
who basically created the
modern Democratic Party.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.510
And so, I just thank the folks
associated with Senator Inouye

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.150
for giving me this education.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.700
Last, I just want to
say, I'm a huge fan

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.660
of Ross despite our
disagreements.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.580
I teach a class at
Georgetown on media politics

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.430
and years ago I realized you
better start paying attention

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.320
to this online thing in
this media politics class.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.300
And my first two guests
were a 23-year-old blogger

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.690
for the Atlantic [inaudible]
my first two blogger guests,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.290
my first two opening to that
world, a 23-year-old blogger.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.970
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat:
I was surely 24.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.370
I must have been at least.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.630
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: And I believe
you were, and I'll double-check,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.680
and a 23-year-old
blogger name Ezra Klein.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.980
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Oh, my gosh.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.280
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: And so,
I always tell my students

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.680
that my class is way ahead
of the mainstream media.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.150
And I've always been grateful
to Ross for being there.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.920
You know, the, I've
thought a lot this topic

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.480
in the last few weeks
thinking, you know,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.980
about the event tonight and the
American dream is a really vexed

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.440
idea that, you know, it can be
seen as a kind of romantic view

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.910
of what opportunity is like
in America given the groups

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.540
over our history who have
been excluded from it,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.960
but the other side of it
and it may be most powerful

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.320
when it's used as a call upon us
to make our country what it not;

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.090
what it isn't yet,
but ought to be.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.750
And two, sort of two uses
like that came to mind;

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:18.050
one was of course Martin Luther
King's "I Have a Dream" speech

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.020
and he was very explicit
in saying

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.730
"It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream."

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.500
And as you suggested
at the beginning,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.040
he too invoked the Declaration.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.460
I have a dream that one day this
nation will rise up and live

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.670
out the true meaning of its
creed we hold these truths

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.160
to be self-evident that
all men are created equal.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.390
But it can also be
used as a critique.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.600
Many of you know probably
Langston Hughes' most famous

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.450
poem, "What happens to a
dream deferred does it dry

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.680
up like a raisin in the sun?"

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.200
And what I had forgotten is
how that poem ends which is

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.070
"What Happens to a Dream
Deferred" the last line

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.020
of the poem is, "Or
does it explode?"

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.330
And it's just sort of a reminder
of what can happen when we hold

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.000
up these ideals and then
don't live up to them.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.650
I was trying to figure out
what is a definition of this?

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:24.050
And I think one take is that
hard work leads to success.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.540
That's one kind of definition
of the American dream.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.150
The other is that the next
generation will do better

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.600
than the previous generation.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.800
Those are sort of vexed now.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.450
We still believe, we're
still optimists even

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.580
after everything
we've gone through;

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.950
61% of our population
according Gallup believes

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.280
that young people will live
better than their parents,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.650
but there has been a decline in
some of these number, you know,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.280
in at the right at the
turn of the millennium,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.830
74% of us believe that people
who work hard can get ahead

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.300
and that fell to 58% at
the end of the recession.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.710
And to go to just briefly to
your point, can we achieve this

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.390
in a country so divided?

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.080
It strikes me that we
will have trouble sort

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.110
of creating public policy
that might move us forward

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.500
because we are so
deadlocked about what

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.840
that policy should
be, but even our view

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.730
of the American dream is
now shaped by partisanship.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:34.530
The optimism that people had
in that Gallup survey when up

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.780
because so many republicans
switched from negative

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.390
to positive after President
Obama was out of office.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.880
That's on the one side, and
the other side there was a;

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.870
I was looking at a
study of millennials,

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.140
at the end of the Obama years
African-American millennials

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.970
were much more optimistic, were
much more likely to believe

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.370
in the American dream than
White millennials were.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.990
So, it's our view of this has
shaped partly by politics,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.870
partly by race, partly by
where we sit in this society.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.170
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: You know,

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.100
you touch on exactly what the
Kluge Center does and that's

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.670
to connect thought to action,
and those two common measures

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.520
of the American dream as you've
just both just pointed out,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.130
are we, are you better
off than your parents were

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.960
and the other is,
do you own a home?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.810
Ross let me start with you and
then the Kluge answer would be

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.770
and what we ought
to do about it?

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.480
Are you better off
than your parents?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.490
Are your kids, although
they're small now I think,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.590
going to be better off than you?

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.310
And are there things that as a
society you think can be done

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.240
to push that along?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.060
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: I mean, on
the personal front we just went

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.640
through a really bad real estate
transaction sort of exacerbated

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.670
by illness, no it's
a, it's a bad time

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.240
to make that assessment.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.860
I wouldn't want to,
I wouldn't want

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.390
to apply our particular
situation for the country

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.080
as a whole, but I,
but to generalize.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.640
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: I hope this
increases your appreciation

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.420
for regulation of real estate.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.490
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: That, that
and the speaking engagements

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.330
and Honoria as well are
incredibly important.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.650
But I, I mean, I think
generally, You know,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.030
there's no question that over
the last 40 years on this sort

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.270
of "are you better off
than you parents" question,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.020
the country has gone through
a long period of stagnation.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.880
Tyler Cowen who, you know,
E.J. knows well is an economist

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.400
at George Mason and wrote a book
called "The Great Stagnation",

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.220
basically sort of
describing this long period

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.770
where the median income which
is, you know, as good a way

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.570
of sort of measuring you
know the sort of heart

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.260
of American life as any,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.010
the median income basically got
stuck and so it wasn't a period

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.490
of collapse, it wasn't the
Great Depression, you know,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.770
we slowly we've had obviously
a severe recession recently.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.930
We've slowly climbed back from,
but basically it's a story

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.380
of a society where the economy
for most people seems kind

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.630
of stuck and where you aren't
sort of, you're doing okay,

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.230
you're not in poverty, you know,
you have Welfare State Programs

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.620
that sort of stabilize
things during recessions,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.390
but what we had gotten used to
during these wave of expansion

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.590
in the, you know, during
the Industrial Revolution

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.880
and then again in
the post war boom,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.350
just hasn't been
there for most people.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:32.150
And over that same period
you've had a kind of hollowing

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.320
out of community
in American life,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.790
because I think another aspect
of the American dream is,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.740
you know, if you go back to
sort of the people who came

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.630
to visit America in
the 19th-century,

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.410
Alexis de Tocqueville
most famously,

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.980
and sort of what they remarked

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.600
on about American
life they said,

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.270
well you know you have
a weaker state here

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.820
than you often do in Europe.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.470
You don't have an
established church.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.760
You don't have a lot of
the big institutions,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.200
but you have this incredible
community spirit often rooted

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.040
in religion, but also just sort
of rooted in civic engagement

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.640
in other things, you know,
from sort of the, you know,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.420
New England Town Meeting through
the culture of the Midwest

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.390
and so on, and that has
obviously taken a hit

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.670
over the last couple of
generations and there's a long

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.060
and complicated argument about
how those two things intertwine;

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.680
how is the decline of
marriage rates and the decline

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.900
of church going and the decline
of you know bowling leagues

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.790
and all these things,
how is that related

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.800
to economic stagnation,
how the two fit together?

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.690
But that tangle is the sort of,

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.350
that's the central
policy problem I think.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.420
It's sort of, you know,
how do you figure out one,

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.060
how to get the economy working
better for most Americans?

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.990
And at the same time, how do
you have a kind of, you know,

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:52.670
a sort of civic and familial
and religious sort of,

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.420
sort of a knitting back
together of the social fabric?

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.080
And, you know, we have a lot
of evidence from the last 5

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.720
or 10 years that this,
you know, that things,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.040
things have actually gotten
worse in a lot of respects.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.520
I mean, the opioid
epidemic, you know,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.360
suicide rates have gone up.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.430
You know, you have a decline
in American life expectancy

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.530
for the first time and
all, that's you know sort

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.770
of concentrated in
particular parts of the country

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.680
and especially to E.J.'s
point, it seems to be a,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.380
there's more sort
of social anime

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.540
and despair among White
Americans than among minorities.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.430
There's more pessimism
among working,

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.360
in working class White America

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.340
than there is among
Blacks and Hispanics.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.200
But whatever it is, that's,
that's the policy problem

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.650
and to the extent there's
a solution in, you know,

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.830
I think it lies somewhere
at the intersection

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.170
of the social and economic.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.240
That we should be looking for
policies that basically say,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.860
well on the one hand you
probably do need to find ways

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.480
to raise wages, get more money
into the hands of the middle

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.480
and the working class,
at the same time,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.070
you want those policies to sort

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.020
of somehow create a
virtuous cycle with families

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.770
and communities and so on
and not just become the kind

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.200
of things that I
think, for instance,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.200
a lot of Trump voters sort of
rebelled against the idea that,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.880
well you know, your, I think
the Democratic Party has ended

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.180
up in a position

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.580
where technically its economic
policies are more popular,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.070
but people don't like the idea

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.140
that well my community
has been hollowed out,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.950
the jobs are never coming back,

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.110
but at least you
know I have Medicaid.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.920
They liked more the idea that
Trump was selling of, you know,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.510
you're going to get the
jobs back, things are going

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.140
to be the way they were
before and I don't think

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.790
that was a completely honest
sales pitch, but it spoke

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.210
to a challenge that I think
both parties haven't been able

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.180
to meet that combined
idea of sort of solid jobs

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.060
and solid civic life
that slipped away

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.360
in big parts of the country.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.660
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yeah,
let's stick with some

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.230
of economics, go ahead.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.170
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Yeah, I think we
agree to a significant degree;

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.370
I actually think one of the big
questions we need to grapple

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.990
with is whether that decline
in community, family breakup

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.210
and all of that is primarily,
conservatives tend to talk

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.720
about the causal era going from
there to economic conditions;

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.740
progressives tend to look at
economic conditions and say,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.620
those are actually fostering
the decline of community,

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.980
the problems families confront.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.750
And in some different
worlds it would be nice

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.010
to have a conversation
where I would continue

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.700
to argue the importance in
economic, but that progressives

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.440
and conservatives could say, you
have to care about the family

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.500
and civic life and you have to
care about the economic base,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.090
but I think we've had
a real crisis, I mean,

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.370
measured by the numbers
in social mobility

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:52.530
since you can date it from
1973, you can date it from 1980,

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:58.110
but opportunity does seem to
be sticking more to people

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.550
in the upper middle-class
and above.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.130
My colleague at the
Brookings Institution,

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.870
Richard Reeves wrote a book
called "Dream Hoarders"

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.820
about the upper middle-class
and that the, it's been easier

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.170
for the and that's not
even counting the extremely

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.540
privileged, this just is that
broader top of the society,

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.120
have been able to pass
along their advantages more

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:27.380
efficiently to their kids than
earlier upper-classes have been

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.360
and actually I discovered
Richard quoted something I said

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.840
over lunch in a book and
thank God he's a friend,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.900
because he quoted something I
kind of liked to repeat instead

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.000
of some damn fool
thing I said over lunch

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.710
of which there were
many, but you know,

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.430
I said that I spend my weeks
writing columns announcing

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.940
inequality and my nights
and weekends increasing it.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.750
You know, because as
somebody who is effectively

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.530
in the upper middle-class
whatever class I'm in somewhere

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.900
up there, I have an opportunity
to pass along benefits

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.830
to my kids, you know, for no
particular virtue of mine,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.400
just because I happen to
be here and I am going

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.480
to do whatever I can to help
my kids as all of us will do,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.440
but those kind of, you know,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.080
the way in which
those advantages kind

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.100
of bundle together we
have less social mobility.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.730
Second thing is,
we have had less,

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:23.000
a far less equally distributed
income growth that in the sort

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.130
of great period from World
War II through the mid70s,

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.250
1980 each quintile tended
to go up roughly equally.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.900
We had not only a great
period of economic growth,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.700
but a great period of
shared economic growth.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.520
Since then, we have, it
has not been shared at all

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.760
that the middle and bottom
have stagnated and a lot

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.020
of the benefits have gone
to the top and especially

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.260
to the very top, and
what we're discovering,

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.790
and this is I think a question
Americans have to be tough

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:58.210
on ourselves about,
is that you know

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:02.130
in some ways the American
dream is now a sort

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.260
of Scandinavian social
democratic dream.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.620
Which is to say,
that the societies

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:13.680
that have less inequality tend
to have more social mobility

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.860
and that there, you know, I have
my conservative friends always

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.210
like say I'm not for
equality results,

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.460
but I am for equality
of opportunity.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.500
But what appears to be the case
is if you're class in incomes,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.530
your class system and your
income distribution gets too far

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.780
out of whack, you
lose the capacity

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.370
for mass upward mobility.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.820
So, again, this probably
reflects the difference

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.120
in our political view,

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.480
but I think we need somewhat
more egalitarian public policies

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.420
in order to produce
the degree of mobility

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.430
that the American dream
suggests we ought to have.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.150
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Both of you and
I'm turning to education now,

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.100
both of you went to Harvard and.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.400
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: He wrote
a whole book about it.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.700
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Well,
and I was going to say.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.000
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: His
about Harvard and mine is

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.320
about criticizing Harvard.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.910
He joins the Catholic Church

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.400
and mine's a book
criticizing the Pope.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Ross, Ross you,
it's been more than a decade

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.890
since you wrote so lovingly
of your Harvard years.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.560
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: It was a
found; it was a found critique.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.040
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I want you
to boil, boil the 300 pages

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.690
down for 6 to 60
seconds for this audience

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.600
and my question is, a decade
later any second thoughts

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.650
about your alma mater?

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.950
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Oh, no.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.020
I mean it's worse than it was.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.320
I mean, no.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.440
There haven't been, haven't
been second thoughts.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.590
I mean, E.J. has
sort of teed this up.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.480
I think effectively
what E.J. was talking

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.250
about in the Richard Reeves
"Dream Hoarders" phenomenon is

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.910
in a sort of more personalized
way, part of what I was trying

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.840
to get at in that book which
was called "Privilege."

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.610
And the argument was basically,
you know, sort of ripped off

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:00.310
from smarter people, the late
Christopher Lash among others

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:05.450
that the system of meritocracy
is not, does not, in fact,

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.770
tend to be democratic, right?

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:12.040
It tends to create a new
aristocracy that becomes

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.540
in a different way jealous of
its privileges that has sort

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.720
of different forms of capital
and so on and, you know,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.030
SAT scores obviously matter
much more than ancient pedigrees

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:27.040
and so on, but that in
practice it recapitulates many

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.780
of the vices of older
aristocracies

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.360
and also developed certain vices
of its own like the belief that,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.640
you know, well because
we're meritocrats we deserve

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.520
to rule unlike those old
aristocrats and so we don't need

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.440
to worry about no bless of
[inaudible] things like that.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.130
So, that was sort of it in
a nutshell that basically

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:51.240
if you look around these
schools that are there to sort

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.780
of educate the elites, they are
in effect perpetuating an elite

00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.200
that is itself sort of both
increasingly segregated

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.900
from the rest of
American society.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.780
I mean, that's one of the
interesting things about sort

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.800
of the post-70s dynamic in
American life, that you have

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.430
if you go back 40 or 50
years and you look at sort

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:15.660
of the distribution of people
with Ph.D.s and JD.s these sort

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.050
of advanced degrees, they're
pretty evenly distributed

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.350
around the country.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.170
You know, you have clusters in
each state sort of local groups

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.430
of academic elites and
legal elites and so on,

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.520
and then you flash-forward
to the present era

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.420
and they're much more
concentrated in these sort,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.220
you know, the sort
of major East Coast

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.150
and West Coast urban
centers and then sort

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.620
of college towns scattered
around the country.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.850
So, you have a kind of a
much stronger segregation

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.330
by education in the U.S. than
you had 40 or 50 years ago

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.390
and you have sort of fewer
local elites that are sort

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.690
of in touch with, you know,
Iowa, New Hampshire or whatever,

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.130
you know, whatever
state they come from

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.670
and you have this nationally
elite that's less in touch

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.550
with the country than it would
have been 40 or 50 years ago

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.690
and that's a dynamic
that, you know,

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.300
the Ivy League schools
and sort of the U.S.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.100
; I mean, it's also
notable that the U.S. news

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.080
and world report
rankings, right?

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.130
I mean, when you think about
sort of what, you know,

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.810
the U.S. news and world
report rankings never change.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.460
There's never, I mean they of
course, they change from year

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.990
to year sometimes it's
Harvard, sometimes it's Yale.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.290
You can, schools can sort of
work their way up the University

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.490
of Chicago sort of changed
its submission policies 10

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.200
or 15 years ago and it's
climbed dramatically,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.500
you know, things change.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.800
But there's never, you know,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.790
there's never a startup
university in the top 10

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.760
in the U.S. News and
world report ranking.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.920
I mean, the newest university
that's ever there is Stanford

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.330
which was founded a mere, you
know, a mere 120 years ago

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.850
or whatever, and that in
itself I think is sort

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:54.560
of a significant statement
about what these sort

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.970
of meritocratic factories do.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.770
They're there to sort of
protect their own privileges

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.990
by creating, you know, by sort
of reproducing the privilege

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.010
of the families and students
who attend them and, you know,

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.410
all societies have elites,
this is an inevitable,

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.390
an inevitable phenomenon,
but it's still notable

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:21.670
in a society sort of that has
such a democratic self-image

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.160
that people often think of
meritocracy and democracy

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.210
as being sort of
working hand in hand.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.910
But, in fact, they often
cut against each other.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.210
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yeah.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.950
E.J. I won't point out
that E.J. graduated

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.000
from Harvard before
Ross was born.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.300
E.J. and I are.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.720
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Oh God,
did you have to do that?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.820
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Because I'm
even older than E.J. And,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.610
but E.J. well go ahead and
defend not only Harvard,

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.460
but the idea that, that but the.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.910
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: He
can't defend Harvard.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.210
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: That, that.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.510
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: The Pope he
can defend but not Harvard.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.810
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: What
can the generations look

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.050
at the generations coming
out of the colleges now,

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.870
they've got that college degree
and they are crushed by the size

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.800
of their college debt?

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.560
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Well, I want
to; one observation I want

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.550
to make is that two of my very
favorite conservative writers,

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:14.630
Ross and David Brooks whom the
late Charles Krauthammer once

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.420
referred to as his
favorite liberal columnist.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.200
God bless Charles.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.750
I find that their critique of
American society is this close

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.900
to being radical and if we
progressives have done something

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.510
right both Ross and
David would be radicals

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.640
and not the conservatives
they are, because there is a;

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:38.820
there is a radical element of
that critique that I would,

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.040
I don't want to go on a
long defense of Harvard.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.010
It's a wonderful institution
I happen to love it.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.640
It was very important to me.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.390
They have made efforts
both, you know, particularly

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:51.890
in recent years with both Larry
Summers and Drew Faust to try

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:55.170
to create more opportunities
for people of, you know,

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.790
sort of in the middle and at
the bottom, but it is still

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.530
about replicating an
elite and it's not;

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.360
the problem isn't Harvard.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:09.380
It's system of meritocracy
where people come to believe

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.920
that they have earned all their
privilege even when they haven't

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.090
and that I think the
problem with meritocracy

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.940
as an idea is not that we should
discourage people from trying

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.130
to be smarter or trying to work
harder and all those things,

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:28.460
it's that people develop a sense
of dessert and then they look

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.470
down upon all kinds
of other people

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.640
who have not had the same
good fortune they had.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.880
I found over the
years in my long life,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.620
that you can tell a lot
about someone's world view

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.990
by whether they think of
themselves as totally self-make

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.130
or the product of good fortune.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.150
Now, you know, we're all
obviously have mixture

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.450
of those things.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.560
None of this is to not effort
or the hard work people do,

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.780
or the fact that there
are indeed people who rise

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.310
from the bottom to the top,

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.250
but it is to say
not only is the idea

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.920
of being self-made a
biological absurdity,

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:11.080
but it also overlooks all the
opportunities that came your way

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.450
through chance, through good
fortune, through one teacher.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.670
I grew up in a placed called
Fall River, Massachusetts

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.940
which is and who's
a Fall River parts?

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.650
Ah, and today by the way,
if I read my Twitter right,

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.510
is Lizzie Borden's birthday.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.320
She is from my own town.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.460
The most famous person in my,
from my home town I think.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.810
But I was having Ernie Moniz
the former Energy Secretary

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.880
from Fall River and
I was talking to him

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.000
about Durfee High School
and my dad and my dad's,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.610
one of my dad's best
friends was a physics teacher

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.360
at Durfee High School named
Mr. Delare [assumed spelling]

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.140
and Moniz looked at me and said,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.200
"Mr. Delare is why
I do what I do now."

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.620
And it was a great high
school physics teacher

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.580
who inspired this working
class kid to become one

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.880
of the world class people.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.410
So, that's good but somebody

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.140
like Ernie Moniz would
acknowledge no Mr. Delare

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.620
perhaps no career
like his and all

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.360
of us can tell those stories.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.480
And so, in general, I share
a lot of what Ross said

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:22.730
about the problem of meritocracy
because it suggests to an elite

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.920
that they don't have any
obligation to give back ,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.940
hat everything they earn they
earn because of their own,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.980
you know, merit, you know,
grace doesn't enter into it,

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.700
luck doesn't enter into it,

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.830
somebody else's generosity
doesn't enter into it,

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.560
the help from the state
doesn't enter into it.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.860
I'll just close with one of
my favorite tweets I ever sent

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.200
out which was during the
Republican Convention

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.040
and Chris Christie was giving
a speech where he talked

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.890
about his father going to
Rutgers a state university,

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.760
on the GI Bill a government
program and I just,

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.060
it was a friendly tweet.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.610
It just said, "It's lovely

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:02.290
to see Chris Christie
acknowledge the role

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.930
of government in
his father's life."

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:09.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: But, you
now touch, I want to switch

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:16.930
over to the overarching current
theme that affected my life

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:21.490
as a reporter for ABC News over
the course of 7 presidents.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:27.090
The digital age has changed
so much in our society.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:32.720
I look at not only how my kids
communicate, what they read,

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:39.370
how they communicate, but
also how Americans sometimes

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:43.520
withdrawal from personal
communications, how they rely

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.190
on information that
doesn't have the same kind

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.770
of good bone structure
of the reporting

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.680
and the Washington
Post, New York Times,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.160
ABC News as it once was.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.060
The digital age has changed
everything hasn't it Ross?

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.050
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Yes.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:08.630
Although, one thing it
hasn't changed is sort

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.760
of the economic landscape
to the degree

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.060
that people thought it would.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.920
I mean, this is one of the
interesting, it's not a paradox,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.030
but it is interesting
tension which is

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:21.660
that the digital age is sort of
its where everything has ended

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.550
up poured and other
areas of innovation

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.210
and technological
progress and so on,

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:33.210
have tended to whither a bit
as we've focused more and more

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.890
and more of our energy
and interest

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.830
on these tiny glowing screens.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.080
And one of the, there's
an economist Robert Gordon

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.520
who wrote a book about, called
something like "The Rise

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.530
and Fall of American Growth."

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.250
And one of the points that
he made at the end was

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.340
that American growth
historically was incredibly

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.710
diversified, you know, the you
know you had growth in energy

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.220
over here and you had growth
in construction over there

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.510
and so on, and the digital
age has been much narrower

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.690
and there's a sense
in which it sort of,

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.870
it sort of recapitulates
in the economy what it does

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.390
to us psychologically.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:15.280
It's sort of, it's a colonizer
of our psyche, thief of our time

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.830
and focus and attention, and
it's also sort of absorbed a lot

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:23.430
of I think sort of
energy and interest

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.050
that 50 years ago would
have been more diversified,

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.560
sort of spread out more
across the economy.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.010
So, that's the only
counterintuitive point

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.870
that I would make on the
changed everything point.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.720
I think to the question,
I mean what this is sort

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.650
of the big unanswered social
question of American life

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.290
over the next 40 or 50 years,

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:48.130
is to what extent is digital
media a potential substitute

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:52.060
for the decline of
community that E.J. and I,

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.030
I think generally agree is a
real problem in American life.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:59.980
To what extent is, you know,
is social media and sort

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.640
of the communities that form
online sort of are substitutes

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.040
for the decline of,
you know, Elks Lodges

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.640
and churches and so on?

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.230
To what extent is online
dating an effective substitute

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.760
for you know the decline of
real-world sort of institutions

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.930
that brought men
and women together?

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:24.280
Or to what extent is
it a sort of assimilate

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.450
from a hollow substitute
basically?

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.820
And since I'm, you know,
conservative and critical

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.320
and pessimistic, I tend to
sort of emphasize the extent

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.180
to which it might be a sort
of hollow substitute that,

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.300
you know, that of course
people do fall in love online

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.170
and make friends online
and all of these things,

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.270
but very often they
find themselves

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.840
with online friends and,, you
know, a sort of online life

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.230
that seems to make teenagers,
for instance, more depressed

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.120
than their peers
were 20 years ago.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.920
But, but we're really
early in the experiment

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.320
and you could argue
against me and say,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.530
well thee things are just
getting off the ground.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.360
People are just learning
to live online.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.020
It's a disruptive technology.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.320
People will get used to it

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.370
and then it will actually supply
the community that we need,

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.250
but that's, that's the
question I think that is hanging

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.040
over American society

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.270
and obviously not just
American society going forward.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.570
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Alright, Ross.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.870
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Especially
for people younger than me.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.170
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: E.J.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.570
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: You know, it's
funny when I think about it.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.000
I know so many younger people
and even some older people

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.860
who are, you know, who
are, who lost their spouses

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.480
or got divorced who have
met through online dating

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.660
and I sometimes wonder, well
that's probably more sensible

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.180
than meeting in a bar.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.480
You know, which is better and
that people come to each other

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.860
with more information.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.660
I met my wife on the D.C.
Metro and so I always

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.530
like to say I really
am a liberal.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.880
I owe a great deal to
public transportation.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.180
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Transportation.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.320
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: And an
agency of government.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.760
We've been together a longtime.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.520
The, I want to give it a
way the conservative answer

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.630
that I thought actually you were
going to give, which is nothing

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.680
about this technology
changes human nature.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.080
That human; I think one of the
things Ross and I broadly agree

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.040
on is that human nature
is something given.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.670
You can alter the way
people behave and perhaps

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:24.170
over time this effects the
way our consciousness works,

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:27.260
but it doesn't change that and
there's a lot of me that wants

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:32.760
to fight the idea that
technology alters us in all

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.770
of these radical
ways and yet some

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:36.910
of the change is undeniable.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:42.290
And so much of it is
how we educate ourselves

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.030
to use this media.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.310
So on the one hand,
the parody is

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:52.840
of people whose entire friend
groups are sort of online,

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.160
people don't talk to each other
face-to-face, but the other side

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.930
of that is online is often a way

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.820
in which people organize
themselves

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.810
for actual social encounters
to create opportunities

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.230
for face-to-face engagement.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.650
Neighborhoods have
used technology to try

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.450
to bring people together.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.150
If you think back to
the Obama Campaign in 08

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:20.700
which was very innovative,
a lot of it began online,

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.870
but ended with a
door knock, you know,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.490
which is the most
intimate kind of you know

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.650
of a real human connection
being made.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.360
Where I do think it will,
and I agree with Ross.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.390
I think I'm influenced by
the same book, that we have

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.150
to ask ourselves does this
take; has this technology

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:44.730
yet changed our lives the way
the invention of the light bulb

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.680
or the automobile or the
telephone did or not?

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.170
And we could probably
debate some of those things.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:57.580
What I do worry is will we be
innovative enough as a society

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.560
to replace all the jobs
that are potentially lost?

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.380
And while we've been talking
about automation since the 50s

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.310
and 60s, you sense
that that process

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:13.370
of job destruction could be
sped up and the question is,

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.330
will we be innovative
enough to create work

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:20.710
or will the economy create work
that will make up for that?

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.240
I'm reminded about great
Walter Reuther story.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.530
I can't remember if it was
Ford or GM, I'll say it was GM

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.540
and the GM guys take
Walter Reuther the head

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.860
of the United Oil Workers Union
into a brand new, you know,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.630
plant with all these
robots and machines.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:41.180
Then Carson, the GM guy says
to Walter Reuther "You know,

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:44.620
these robots won't
be paying UAW dues."

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.310
And Reuther shot back, "Yeah,

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.130
and they won't be
buying GM cars either."

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.750
And I think that is a kind of,
you know, struggle we're going

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.050
to have going forward.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.350
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I want

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.160
to ask one more question
before we open this

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.310
up to questions not
only from the audience

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:04.800
but from the students in Hawaii,
I was, it was suggested to me

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.940
that one of the good ways
to look forward here,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.800
especially since both of you
have connections to and contact

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.480
with the younger people,
young students, journalists

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:24.860
and how are millennials
rethinking their own view

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.160
of the American dream?

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.830
Let me start with you E.J.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.130
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Um.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:31.430
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Or do
they think about it?

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.480
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Well,
there is some evidence.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.310
I've talked to political
pollsters who have said

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:41.960
that the American dream idea
does not resonate with younger,

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.590
with younger voters with
younger Americans in the way

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.780
that it does with
older folks; although,

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.410
this data on the difference

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.080
between you know
African-Americans and Latinos

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.380
on the one side and Whites

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.470
on the other suggests there's
an even more complicated story.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.240
But I think there
is a, you know,

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.730
in you know I have three kids
in their 20s and I have talked,

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.720
I don't know I've been
teaching now for 15 years,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.720
so and I've had really
awesome students, and my sense

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.200
from them, so I'm not going
to make it any more than that,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:25.920
is that there is for good reason
somewhat slightly less optimism

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.230
about their way forward.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:32.180
They feel like they have had
difficulties thrown at them

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.840
that were not thrown
at someone my age.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:40.980
You know, I was born in 1952 and
sort of reached adulthood in one

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.830
of the most extraordinary
periods of growth

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:47.310
and opportunity in
our country's history.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.840
And actually during the 90s,

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.140
so when my kids were
little I thought,

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.100
gee maybe by delaying having
kids I really lucked out

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.420
and created, you know,
brought my kids into a world

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.500
that will match that
great period

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.270
and then you know came
you know 9/11, the wars

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.710
and then the economic collapse.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.270
And so, my sense is that there's
still a lot of, I mean you know,

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.980
young people have not lost
a natural sense of optimism

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:19.450
but I think there is a stronger
sense of you know the obstacles

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:26.070
that they face and not the easy
sense that we got of, you know,

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.190
when I was a kid that
America was literally sitting

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:30.490
on top of the world.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yeah.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:33.160
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: You know, and
you think of all that optimism

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.640
and call to service
in the Kennedy years

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.520
that this is something
different.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.820
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Ross
takes a swing

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.580
at this before we
actually get questions.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:42.880
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Sure.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.180
I mean, first think
E.J. is right.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.860
I Think that there,
you know, if you think

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.810
of the millennial generation
as people who came of age

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.860
after 2001, you know, we've
been talking about a 40

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.320
or 50-year stagnation,
but really the worst

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.260
of it economically even
setting aside war and terrorism

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.690
and everything else, has
been the last 15 years

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:05.630
and if that's your experience
of sort of entering adulthood,

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.600
entering consciousness as
an American and son on,

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.870
you are naturally going to
be I think more pessimistic

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:15.230
about your prospects because
your prospects have been worse,

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.070
worse by far than
your generation

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:21.370
and somewhat worse
than my cohort.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.350
Although, 9/11 happened
my senior year of college,

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:28.970
so there was you know, there
was a decline in the number

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.140
of consulting jobs that my
fellow meritocrats were able

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.440
to take.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.660
That was our great tragedy.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.900
Thank you for laughing
at the irony rather

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.650
than taking me seriously.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.740
But I would also say
I think this to try

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.570
and weave together the community

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.790
and the internet questions
a little bit, I mean,

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.210
one of the striking
things about millennials

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:53.560
and whatever we're
calling post-millennials,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.860
is that in certain respects they
are the best behaved generation

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.470
in modern American history.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:04.400
If in term of drug use, teen
pregnancy, car accidents,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.040
all you know, the sort
of laundry list of things

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.110
that people worry
about teenagers

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.110
and early 20-somethings
getting up to,

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.520
this cohort is incredibly
well-behaved.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:23.430
But that, that sort of good
behavior coexists with a,

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.670
firs of all, a certain a
higher degree of unhappiness

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.880
which may be rooted in
economic factors, may be rooted

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.290
in sort of, you know,
sort of the digital age

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.060
and the anxieties it produces
and one of the reasons they're

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:40.010
so well-behaved is that you can
socialize online and so you're,

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:42.760
you know, you're less
likely to take the car out

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.260
and get drunk with your friends.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.000
You're less, you know,
there's less teen sex

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.350
because perhaps there's more
sexting that sounds like a joke,

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:53.690
but it's actually
probably statistically not

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.640
and so you have this
question one, you know,

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.540
is the greater safety worth
perhaps the cost in happiness

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.770
and two, this connects
to the economic as well,

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:08.530
are millennials just sort
of delayed in you know,

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:11.120
I mean the basics of, you
know, the American dream

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.690
when you were a kid, you know,
you get married, you have kids,

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:17.160
you own a home, you know, you
own a car, you own a couple

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.930
of cars, if those sort
of visceral aspects

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:24.240
of the American dream
circa 1957,

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.330
millennials are getting
married at lower rates,

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.170
they are buying homes at
lower rates, they are driving

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:33.110
at lower rates, all of
these things that sort

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.900
of culturally we
associate with sort

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.860
of America normalcy
aren't happening in,

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.390
to the same degree.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:43.980
And so, the question hanging
over the next 20 years will be,

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.000
are millennials going to
do all the same things

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.560
that E.J's generation did
just 10 or 15 years later?

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.470
Or is there are real shift?

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.990
Not in human nature, but
in human nature's response

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.890
to the economy, technology and
everything else that's going

00:51:56.890 --> 00:52:00.130
to mean across the lifecycle
millennials are less likely

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.730
to have kids, more likely to
be single, more likely to live

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.160
in apartments that
suburban houses and so on?

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.250
And that's, again, something we
won't know for 15 years or so.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.720
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Could I just
say one quick thing on that?

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.020
The other thing

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.900
about millennials that's
fascinating is they are a very

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.210
progressive generation.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.450
They are probably the most
progressive generation

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:20.700
since the new dealers of
the greatest generation.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.350
Now, some of that is
because they are a more

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:24.650
diverse generation.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.260
That the, you know,
people who are say under 40

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.350
or under 35 are much,

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.780
a much larger percentage
African-American, Latino, Asian,

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.830
but even among White millennials
they are significantly more

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:42.400
liberal than other cohorts of
Whites and I, I tell my children

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.850
that you know when you are,
when my generation is gone

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:47.620
and your generation takes over,

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.400
this will probably be a
more progressive country.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.670
The only problem with
that is I want to be

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:56.260
around to see the country when
you guys take over, so I'm going

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.570
to have to figure out
a way to solve that.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.080
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat:
Silicon Valley is working

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.380
on life [multiple speakers].

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.590
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: But I do think
that they're more tolerant,

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:05.950
they're more, they are open.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:09.310
I mean, there are some very
interesting characteristics

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:13.280
about them that make them
a potential political,

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.700
that may be harbingers
of political change

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.040
when they start voting in force.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: One of the
beautiful parts [inaudible]

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:24.390
of this program every year
is because we are linked

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:28.840
up to students in Hawaii and
they have offered the two

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.670
of you some really
interesting questions.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:37.190
The first question we're
going to hear is from Shannon.

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:38.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. I am Shannon [inaudible].

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:43.560
I'm a communications student
at UH Manoa and my idea

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.790
of the American dream is a place
where people can live happy

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.950
and safely in a community
with friends and family.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.780
My question is, what do you
think our generation can do

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.300
to make sure that we live
happy and healthier today?

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.600
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Oh, preach Ross.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.520
Go ahead.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.610
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: I mean,
my, my nonpartisan answer

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.270
as you can probably tell from
things that I've already said,

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:08.790
is that you should spend
less time on the internet.

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:10.900
That's, you know,
without getting into sort

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.260
of whether you should convert
to Catholicism or which kind

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.580
of Catholic you should
be, I mean,

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.290
that's you know that's
obviously important, you know,

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:22.430
and in a nonsectarian way,
I would say there is a lot

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:25.330
of evidence, it's not just
positive, but there's a lot

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.030
of reasonable evidence

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:34.050
that social life online is
potentially more likely to lead

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:37.620
to depression, unhappiness,
isolation, and less likely

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:41.100
to lead to healthy friendships,
healthy relationships,

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.580
healthy marriages, and so on.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.890
And, of course, you
are, you know,

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.470
as I am still young
enough hopefully

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.760
to know this reasonably well,
of course, like you can't sort

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.150
of become a hermit and a
luddite and sort of opt

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:55.920
out of you know the social world

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.540
of young people is an online
social world, but figuring

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:04.230
out who to have, you know, your
relationships and friendships

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:07.650
as your connection to the
world at large mediated

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:09.420
through old fashioned
reality rather

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:14.520
than digital reality seems
like a really important step

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.220
that either today's
millennials or the generation

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:22.060
after them is going to have
to figure out to get to the,

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.460
to get to the point where
their relationship and all

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.760
of our relationship

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.540
to technology becomes
a healthy one.

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.040
So, that's yeah,
that's a nonsectarian.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.340
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Great.

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.640
Let's take it.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.210
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: I mean,
I think I actually agree

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:38.910
with every single word you said.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:44.370
That, and I do think that
sort of, I'm not the,

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.390
I love the technology.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:48.370
I have all kinds of, I spend
too much time on my phone

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.030
like everyone else does.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:52.250
I can find out if the Red Sox
are actually winning or not,

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.700
you know, instantly which is
very satisfying especially

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.000
this season.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.380
The, you know, so I am
very much anti-luddite,

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.700
but I do think that,
again, there is evidence

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.400
that if you are involved
in politics, or service

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.890
or a religious congregation, or
sports teams, or a whole series

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:19.010
of other activities with other
people direct face-to-face,

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:21.470
that that's a helpful thing.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.760
The other virtue I have
sort of toyed with a lot,

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:29.420
I thought about a lot, because
it's really complicated,

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.770
virtue is a virtual of loyalty.

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:34.760
And I worry a lot
about, on the one hand,

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:40.160
loyalty can be misplaced,
loyalty can demand you know the,

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.290
I mean I think the SS had
loyalty in its, you know,

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:47.260
its slogan which always reminds
me don't put too much on that.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.120
On the other hand, I worry

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.150
about a society that's
lost the sense of loyalty.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:56.610
Maybe this is, you know, from
you know, I'm from Massachusetts

00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:01.280
where loyalties are so strong
that the most powerful,

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.870
you know, it's the old
joke about the version

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:06.410
of Alzheimer's you forget
everything except your grudges.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:10.480
You know, if somebody was on
the wrong team, but I do think

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.460
that there is a; I worry
about the decline of loyalty

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.290
in a society from employer
to employee, from employee

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:19.400
to employer or our
loyalties to each other.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.300
It's how do we strengthen
some of the bonds between us?

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.480
How do we stick with each
other when things get tough?

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.530
How can friendship be
demanding and not temporary,

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.400
not just something you
pass through and, you know,

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.370
geographic mobility makes
friendship more complicated

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.670
than it used to be.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.970
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: But
you can keep in touch

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.270
with each other across the.

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:41.570
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Well, right and
that's one of the advantages.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.870
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: With
much greater ease.

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.170
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: And that is

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.270
where actually you
can be anti-luddite,

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:49.360
because you know it
strikes me with my kids,

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.840
my students that they maintain
their bonds in some ways.

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.140
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yes.

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.440
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: More
successfully than we did.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.740
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yes.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.040
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: That's a
good thing, but I just,

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.920
I sort of like people to try
to think about what is loyalty

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.450
and what does it demand?

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:06.190
Because that's something we
talk about much in our society.

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:07.490
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Oh,
you're right.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.130
We've got two more
questions coming up.

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:14.210
The next one is from a
student in Hawaii, Jordan.

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:15.990
&gt;&gt; Aloha. My name is
Jordan [inaudible].

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:19.740
I'm a recent graduate of the
University of Hawaii at Manoa.

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.440
My idea of the American
dream is freedom.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.460
My question for you is, what
does freedom mean to you?

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:29.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: E.J. what
does freedom mean to you?

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.490
That's just a small.

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:35.660
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: This is like a
college interview in reverse.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And we'll keep
this short because we want

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.830
to get to several
more questions.

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:46.880
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: You
know, I think freedom is

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:53.390
about having the capacity
to effect the decisions

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.400
that are made that affect you.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:59:00.790
Which means that freedom
is partly a social matter

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:05.270
and it's why I am a passionate
small "d" democrat and think

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:11.670
that institutions should be
democratized where they can be

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:14.630
and then I think, you know,

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:18.930
and then I think the First
Amendment, the freedom is sort

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:23.630
of described in the First
Amendment are a reasonable list

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:30.620
of what it means to be
free, but I will stop there,

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.940
because I should stop
and let Ross answer,

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:37.660
but these are a kind of
set of liberal freedoms

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:42.170
and I also think there's
probably another side of freedom

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:45.390
that I'm going to let Ross
describe that may have to do

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:50.250
with the freedom, how freedom
relates to responsibility and.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:51.550
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Ross.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:52.850
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat:
What that, you can't,

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:56.360
you can't setup my answer
like that [laughter].

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.660
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Why?

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.960
I had to.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.260
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: I
have not the freedom

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.560
to answer the question
my own way.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.860
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: I want

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:06.450
to control the conditions
on this stage.

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.750
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: So, yeah.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.730
I mean, I will I guess
I'll try and wrap

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:12.600
in what E.J. was referring to.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.660
I think the; where the
American dream is concerned,

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.270
I associate freedom and I
guess I'll sound, again,

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:21.740
a little bit lit like a
radical, but the freedom

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:27.110
in America is not to be
a prisoner of a boss.

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.640
You have a boss, people have
bosses that's you know that's

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.280
part of life, but I
always come back to a movie

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.980
that may be now is too old
for millennials to have seen,

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:39.020
but "It's a Wonderful Life" the
Jimmy Stewart movie from 1941

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.460
where he plays George Bailey
from Bedford Falls, New York.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.210
And the whole idea in, behind
George Bailey is, you know,

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.810
he's a businessman, he
runs a Building and Loan

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:52.270
and he's trying to get
people into their own homes,

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:55.420
and there's old man Potter right
who's like you know the sort

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.070
of plutocrat of the town who
just wants people to rent

01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:00.070
from him in his slums.

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:02.820
And, you know, the
dream of homeownership,

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.370
the idea of owning your own
home comes from this idea

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:09.140
of being having a kind
of rooted independence

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.590
where you are not a
prisoner of, in his case,

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:15.030
a landlord in the case
of you know being stuck

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:19.200
in a job you don't like, a boss
and so on, and that's, again,

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.530
in the American context
I think that is sort of,

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:23.550
that's the heart of
economic freedom.

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.720
It's the freedom to sort
of make your own choices

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.940
for your own family have the
resources whether it's the

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.320
money, the car to
drive, and you know,

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.820
light up for the territories
all of these sort of icons

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.790
of American life are
connected to that,

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.410
that version of freedom.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:41.710
And then, to make the
conservative point, you know,

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:46.300
the question, the argument
that most American thinkers

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:50.230
in the founding era
and down to the 1950s

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.560
or 1960s would have
made is that, you know,

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.970
freedom is not the
same thing as license.

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.700
And freedom is confirmed
in responsibility.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.730
You want to be free to be, you
know, free to be a moral person,

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:06.170
to be a good person, to be
bound by sort of community rules

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.480
and ideas and aspirations
and that freedom disappears

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.280
if it's just treated as a
freedom to do whatever you want

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.540
and that's the kind of society
that ultimately succumbs

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:19.070
to tyranny, maximal freedom
ultimately leads people to want

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:22.360
to submit themselves
to some authoritarian.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.410
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: I,
"every time a bell rings

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:28.780
and angle gets his wings", and I
just loves what Ross just said.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:31.270
I once wrote a column on "It's
a Wonderful Life" as kind

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:36.520
of embodying the new deal ethic,
and I think what's intriguing is

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.570
in that movie is that moment

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.880
when George discovers what the
world would be like without him

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.520
and Bedford Falls
becomes Pottersville.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.860
And what's so interesting
is that because of a lack

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:54.000
of economic autonomy and
well-distributed property,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.180
Bedford Falls becomes
an immoral town.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.820
It becomes a gambling, gambling,
prostitution, and to me one

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:04.390
of the things I love about that
movie is how it links the need

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:08.990
for economic justice to the
creation of personal virtue

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:12.080
and anyway, so my
wife we have hanging

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.850
and "It's a Wonderful
Life" poster

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:15.880
that my wife gave
me one Christmas

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.180
because I love that movie.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.920
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: But it
is an economic freedom.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:22.330
It's an, I'm sorry, an economic
opportunity that is rooted

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:25.280
in ownership rather
than dependence

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.040
which is this sort of it.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.780
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: But a
particular kind of capitalism.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.080
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Right.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.380
Yes.

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:33.680
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: But
a social capitalism,

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.850
a Christian democratized or a
social democratized capitalism.

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:37.150
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Right.

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.450
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: One
more question coming

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:40.760
from Nichole in Hawaii.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.270
Aloha.

01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.320
&gt;&gt; Aloha. My name is
Nichole Tam and I'm a student

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.630
at the University of Hawaii

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:49.370
at Manoa studying
journalism and Chinese.

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.580
I moved here 10 years ago
from Hong Kong with my family.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.860
Our vision of the American dream
is good access to education,

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.010
as well as, the freedom
to express speech

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:01.070
and express the ways that
we can practice journalism.

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:04.200
My question to you is, do you
think we'll have the same access

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.500
to the freedom of speech

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.480
in journalism the way we have
today despite immigration

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.780
policies that's in
place right now?

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.190
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Immigration
policies in place right now

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:17.790
and whether the future
of freedom

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.710
of the press will be there?

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:23.710
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Well, I'm I
mean I sort of have two thoughts

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:25.890
on this that are
kind of intension;

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:31.050
one is I am genuinely
alarmed as, I think Ross is,

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:36.120
by the current administration,
it's attitudes toward the media.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.720
It's, you know, it's constant
attacks, the media as the enemy

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.460
of the people that term the
president uses is a term

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.730
that Khrushchev of all
people banned in Russia

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:53.430
because it had sort of memories
of solecism and, you know,

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:57.850
I do worry about obviously
what's happened to the kids

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:02.680
in of parents who are
trying to cross the border.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.240
I'm not sure I fully get the
link between the two except

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.940
that I, and that we've gone
through periods of, you know,

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.110
restrictionism in immigration
and more open borders

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.770
and we've kind of gotten
through those periods and I tend

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:18.580
to think Americans are
ultimately pragmatic

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.370
on this question and they open,
they open up the borders again

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:27.820
when they sort of feel that it's
in the interest of the country.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:32.290
But I do worry about a
general attitude that's coming

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:37.800
from the government that
is authoritarian and sort

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:44.460
of a strong man if you
will view of the world

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.310
that is very disconcerting.

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:49.670
Having said all that,
I think that we're one

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:53.180
of the great things about the
U.S. is that we are really good

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.140
at correcting our mistakes,
you know, that Churchill line

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.500
that everybody loves, "Americans
always do the right thing

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.890
after first exhausting all
of the other possibilities."

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:03.410
And we're doing one
hell of a job

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:05.400
of exhausting all the
other possibilities.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.220
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Let me get Ross
in here and then we're going

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.820
to open up with microphones
in the aisles for you.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.120
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Yeah,
I mean it's a weird;

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.530
the freedom of the press
issue is a weird one,

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:21.170
because on the one hand
it is extremely unusual

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:23.470
to have the President of
the United States, you know,

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.100
tweeting attacks on "Fake News"

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.690
and you know institutions
including my employer and so on.

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:32.170
At the same time,
the actual view

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.940
from inside the New York
Times and I think probably

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:39.020
from inside the Jeff Bezos
own Washington Post as well,

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.500
is that in practical
terms you know this is,

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:46.310
this is the Trump era has
been better for journalism,

01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:49.380
maybe worse for everybody
else, but better for journalism

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.860
than you know the 5
or 10 years before it.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.010
I mean, you know, the big
threat to the press in America

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.580
over the last 10 to 15 years
not to bring everything back

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.880
to the evils of the internet,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.030
but has been the
internet's effect

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:04.390
on the media's business
model and the fascination

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:07.480
and obsession with Trump and
the Trump Administration and so

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:14.010
on has you know been a kind
of economic boom in many ways

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:16.090
to the press, and
at the same time,

01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:19.900
whatever Trump himself may want
to do, his administration is not

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:23.680
at all in a position to I
think clamp down effectively

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.500
on the media in the
way that, you know,

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.840
you see in genuinely
authoritarian countries.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.410
So, I'm of two minds.

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.680
You know, it's obviously
a bad thing that you know

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.410
to have a president sort of
delegitimatizing the media.

01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:43.490
At the same time, there is a
kind of weird cabooky theater

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.250
to the whole thing where,
you know, it's Trump,

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.610
Trump attacks the New York Times

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.700
and the New York Times
subscriptions soar

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.500
and the next day Trump
is on the phone to one

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.120
of my colleagues you know
talking, talking to them

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.680
because you know he does that
all the time and so it's sort

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.070
of hard to get an overall
read on the situation.

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:02.570
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Could
I just quickly?

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:03.870
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Real quick.

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:05.170
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Um

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.590
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: I didn't say
anything about immigration, but.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:11.730
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Yeah, no I think
that Trump has the interest

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.390
in Trump the worry about Trump
has been very good to a certain

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:18.660
for a certain number of
national elite organizations

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.640
that basically like the Post
and the Times and others who are

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.390
in a position to have
a national audience.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.670
I still worry very much about
what's happening in journalism

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:29.900
at the local level where
the economic model.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.200
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Right.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.530
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Where you still
have great reporters trying

01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:34.940
to do everything they
can, but the number

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.920
of people covering state and
local government the number

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.140
and these papers don't
have the capacity

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.180
to build big national audiences.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.370
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And that is
not in the last two years.

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:47.670
That has.

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:48.970
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: That's a
long, that's a long problem.

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: We have, it is
your turn now and we will try

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.090
to make our answers short to get

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:55.760
in as many questions
as possible.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.790
Please raise your hand and we'll
have a microphone come to you.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:02.630
There's one right in
the center here about.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.650
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Vital center you
couldn't be more in the middle.

01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:07.950
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yes.

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:10.970
Yes, here's a microphone
coming to you from your left.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:14.170
That's just the geographic left.

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:15.900
&gt;&gt; Is it working, yeah?

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.200
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Hello.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.500
Thank you.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.800
&gt;&gt; Is it working?

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.100
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: We hear you.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.400
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat:
We can hear you.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.000
I'm Katharine Donato.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.300
I'm a professor at Georgetown
School of Foreign Service.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:31.650
I'm going to push you guys, both
of you on the immigration issue

01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:33.730
because on the one hand a lot

01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:36.980
of what you said is really
interesting, fascinating,

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:44.300
I agree on many points,
but I find your description

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:49.590
of the millennials and the
young people a little bit weak,

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:52.570
in part because as one
of you said or both

01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:55.080
of you may have said,
this is a much,

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.460
this upcoming generation
not just the millennials

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.270
but the post-millennials
are more diverse

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:06.940
and certainly more
foreign-born but children

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:10.040
of foreign-born especially,
so I really would

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.840
like to hear a bit more
about the American dream,

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.210
freedom and immigration.

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:21.620
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Okay, run
back through a point or two

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.450
and do we have another
microphone out there

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:26.600
and another person, great.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.210
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Well,
I mean, so I'll try

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.550
and make two quick points.

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:32.750
The first is to try and
connect this all the way back

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.610
to the very first question.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.620
Which is that one
of the questions

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:42.900
for American going forward
is does the society,

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.860
does society end up in this
dynamic that you do see more

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.840
in California than in
other parts of the country

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.460
where you have a
combination of ethic

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.800
and generational stratification?

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.210
And this is part of what drives
the Trump phenomenon and support

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.520
for Trump on the
right, but it exists

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.820
in extremely liberal states
as well where the combination

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:09.460
of declining birth rates
and largescale immigration

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.830
over the last 30 years have
created exactly the phenomenon

01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:13.130
you described.

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:15.240
You have a younger generation
that is much more diverse,

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.890
much more likely to include
ethnic minorities and so

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:21.080
on than was the case
40 or 50 years ago,

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.820
coexisting with an older
generation that is sort

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:28.970
of richer and whiter
and obviously older,

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:35.110
and that is at the moment, a
source of it's a big source

01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:37.910
of our political tension that
you have sort of these three,

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:39.850
you know, you talk about
sort of, we talked a lot

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.120
about class stratification,
we talk a lot

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.170
about racial stratification,
having that kind of sort

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:49.030
of ethnic divide between the
generations tends I think

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:52.100
to exacerbate class, you know,

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.050
when you have generational
divisions sort

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:57.880
of mirroring class and racial
divisions it exacerbates

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.720
polarization and
tension and so on.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.780
And so, a huge challenge for
America going forward is,

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.690
you know, it's we haven't
dived that deep into policy,

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:13.310
but it is to figure out how
to take sort of take a sort

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:17.360
of a younger working class
that's increasingly racially

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.840
diverse and sort of advance
their socioeconomic interests

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.970
in a period where there is
this sort of generational,

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:30.530
intergenerational
alienation driven in part

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:32.270
by race and immigration.

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:35.000
That's just sort of a
macro level analysis,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.320
I'm not providing any solutions.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.150
The second briefer
point I'd make is just

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.910
to echo something E.J. said
which is that when thinking

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:44.680
about the immigration tensions
we're having now you do have

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.190
to recognize that there has been
this ebb and flow of immigration

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:52.720
across American history and the
period that we have been talking

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.460
about as a kind of sort
of a model of what a kind

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.430
of middle-class American
dream hero would look

01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:01.430
like was a period of
extremely low immigration

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:04.780
that had been effectively
cutoff by the, you know,

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.330
not just somewhat racist
immigration rules in the 1920s.

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:11.790
And, so again, one
of the you know,

01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:14.270
I've been what I
would describe as sort

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:16.340
of a moderate immigration
restrictionist

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.650
over the last 10 years,
and what, you know,

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.920
one of the arguments I've
made is that you've ended

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.490
up getting the kind of
extremities of Trump in part

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:29.060
because you had this very large
wave of immigration that sort

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:31.790
of brought America's
foreign-born population

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:34.250
up to levels we haven't
had in a 100 years

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:38.760
and neither political parties
took that seriously sort

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.620
of people who, you know,

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.220
who felt that it was
happening too fast,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.880
and if you can't take those
concerns seriously you end

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.850
up in empowering more
demagogic alternatives.

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.740
I think the optimistic
cases that, you know,

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.220
you actually have
like if you look

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.780
at illegal immigration is
actually down over the last 10

01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.110
or 15 years and in
part sort of some

01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:02.050
of the Trump phenomenon
is a reaction to a trend

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:05.810
that has already crested, it's
sort of a delayed reaction

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:09.900
to much larger scale immigration
especially illegal immigration

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.170
in the early 2000s and as sort

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:14.860
of the culture internalizes
the fact that, you know,

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.740
the great wave of
Mexican immigration

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.690
to the U.S. is probably over,
you will have a lowering

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:22.420
of tensions around that
issue that will lead

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.230
to better policies
and fewer disasters

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:28.200
like the child separation
policy, but anyway.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.820
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I'm going to do
one more quick question up here.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.120
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Sorry.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.420
That was.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.720
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: I'm
going to sneak an answer

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.020
to your question
into the next one.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.320
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: That's good.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.620
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: I've
been asked to move on.

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.920
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Hello.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.220
Yes.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, So, going
off of that theme

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.890
of increasing factionalization,
you alluded earlier to the idea

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:49.300
of other increasing segregation
among other lines particularly

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.640
among educational lines
especially thinking

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.940
of about the recent election

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.200
and how the political divide is
less so, but to in red states

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.050
and blue states more
between blue cites

01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.570
and the red rural
areas, I'm wondering

01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:02.550
if given the centrality
of that idea

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:04.860
to the American dream
the idea of a society

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.090
where the civic nationalism
is based in interaction

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.090
between people of different
educational demographic

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:12.840
immigration and other
backgrounds what policies

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.920
specifically do you think
could be undertaken to minimize

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.560
that segregation
and particularly

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.150
to have more integration
among educational

01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:22.430
and other demographic lines?

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:23.730
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: E.J.

01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:27.910
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: That, that is a
question that I think is central

01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:32.230
to the future and that I don't
think we have good policy

01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:36.100
answers to yet, because we
clearly have a situation

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:42.650
in the country where certain
regions are people magnets,

01:15:42.650 --> 01:15:45.640
job magnets, investment magnets.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.610
It's a figure of something like
85% of the venture capital goes

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.890
to three states and this
is not as you pointed

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:55.590
out correctly simply
red states/blue states

01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:57.950
if you compare Downstate
Illinois

01:15:57.950 --> 01:16:03.080
to Metro Chicago Upstate New
York to Metro New York City

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.810
or in my state, you know, the
mill towns like the one I grew

01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:11.190
up in or Lawrence or
Fitchburg versus Greater Boston

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:14.590
and you saw this, you saw
this economic disparity

01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:18.370
by region reflected
in voting patterns.

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:21.240
This is a huge problem
and economists tend not

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.630
to like regionally-based
economic proposals to try

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:29.390
to lift up one region, because
they see it as inefficient.

01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:32.200
I've heard our economist
argue what you tend to do is

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.990
to benefit already privileged
people in those areas

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.820
and that the benefits
don't spread,

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:41.680
but I there are ways
of pursuing.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.590
I think we do need to pursue
policies that are place-based

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:48.650
and ironically place-based
policies would help two very

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:52.080
different kinds of people on
opposite sides of the divide;

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.660
on the one side, inner
cities who have been hammered

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:59.970
by the industrialization and
on the other hand, smaller

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:05.640
and smaller towns and more
rural areas and factory towns

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.070
that have been hollowed out like
mine, and I think we just have

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:12.720
to find ways of doing that and I
also think we have to find ways

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.320
of making so-called
bad jobs better.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.420
There was nothing that said
that working in a steel mill

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.220
or an auto mill was a good
job, except unions came along

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:27.220
and people got paid a good
wage, began to develop benefits

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:30.710
and we got to figure out how
to do that again for jobs,

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:34.740
for jobs in the service sector.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.040
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: The best thing

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.050
that the Trump Administration
has done in this regard is

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:43.960
to tax Harvard [brief laughter]
and I'm not really kidding.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.390
I think that there is,
there's a case for.

01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:48.690
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Boy,
he's bitter.

01:17:48.690 --> 01:17:50.390
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: Kind
of left; I'm bitter?

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.150
I've done very well
with my Harvard degree.

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:54.270
Eugene here I am
on stage with you.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:59.230
The, I think there is,
there's room for a kind of,

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:02.240
for a kind of experimentation
that, again,

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.720
could cross left-right lines.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.570
I think there's a better version
of Donald Trump that, you know,

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:10.040
when Amazon announced that it
was going to go on the hunt

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.270
for a new corporate
headquarters,

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:14.950
that better version of Trump
would instead of ranting

01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:17.100
against Bezos on Twitter,
would have gotten on the phone

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.640
with Bezos and said, "Look,

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.120
I'm the President of
the United States.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.600
I've got a lot of power.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.050
I want to you know use my
soft power to prevail upon you

01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:27.080
to consider going
to St. Louis rather

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.080
than greater Washington, D.C."

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.610
And, you know, as E.J. says,
that's the kind of thing

01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:33.480
that economists hate
and it obviously sort

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.160
of smacks a little bit
of authoritarianism

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.570
and you could imagine it going
in disastrous directions,

01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:44.310
but I'm open to the
idea that there are ways

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:46.160
that the Federal
Government can sort

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.910
of use soft persuasive
power around sort

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:53.810
of corporate leadership
and also, you know,

01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:56.110
tweak and change tax
policies and do a bunch

01:18:56.110 --> 01:19:00.180
of different things that could
treat some of these glomerations

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.350
of social and economic
capital as sort

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:04.840
of monopolies onto themselves.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.340
The corridor is a kind of
monopoly in its own right

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.670
and if the Federal
Government suddenly announced

01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:13.280
that it was going to
move a bunch of agencies

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.170
out to other parts
of the country,

01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:18.110
that would be a small way of
sort of starting to breakup

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:21.690
that kind of cluster and I don't
think it would be a bad thing.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.990
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Mrs. Airway.

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:26.920
We're going to close with one
last question from Hawaii.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.490
The question comes from
a student named Harrison.

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:32.870
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Harrison
Betino [assumed spelling]

01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:34.170
and I'm a journalism student

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:36.020
at the University
of Hawaii at Manoa.

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.230
My version of the American
dream is doing what you love

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:40.630
and being able to provide
for those who love you.

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:43.960
My question is; if we do what
we love, but we can't provide

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.810
for those who love
us, than how do we

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:49.410
as a society move towards a
place where that can happen?

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.530
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: That man
should be a columnist either

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:53.830
that or a preacher.

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.550
That was a beautiful thing.

01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:57.930
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: It is and that's
why we want to end with it.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:00.080
So, each of you use this as kind

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.380
of your closing argument
for tonight.

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:07.080
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: I mean, I'll
seek common ground and say

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.960
that the public policies we
should seek should be policies

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.670
that seek a little more economic
equality that we have right now,

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:20.520
but that seek it through by
targeting precisely the areas

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.950
that the questioner
is talking about.

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:25.270
Basically saying, we're going
to provide a little more support

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:27.890
for work and a little
more support for family,

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:31.880
and we're going to reorient the
welfare state so that, you know,

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.030
you have a little more money
when you're raising kids,

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:37.150
you have a larger earned income
tax credit or something like it.

01:20:37.150 --> 01:20:41.980
If you're working a blue collar
job and it gets you to a place

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.900
that conservatives could support
because you're effectively,

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.950
you know, like the
GI Bill you're sort

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:50.540
of subsidizing hard work
and childrearing than most,

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.230
you know, the most conservative
things of all, but at this,

01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:54.730
but you're doing it in a way

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:57.940
that does you know push the
society towards a slightly more

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.280
egalitarian income distribution,
because I think that,

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.580
that is the core question.

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.150
You should be able
to if you work hard,

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:08.310
you should be able to, you
know, get married, buy a house

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:10.360
and have a family and not
everybody wants to do that,

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.600
but lots of people do and
when America was working

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.720
at its best lots of
people were able to do that

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.810
and I think that's
a worthwhile goal

01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:20.270
for policymakers today as well.

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:21.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: E.J.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:24.960
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: The
idea of getting

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.590
to do what you love is
one of the, in a way one

01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:33.450
of the great privileges of life
because there are so many people

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:38.500
who are essential to our lives
who are not necessary doing work

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.700
that they love, but work
that they have to do.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.820
And so, I think the
question is, you know,

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.770
in the first instance
what are the ways

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:50.080
of increasing the chances
that people will get

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.850
to do what they love and
that probably has to do

01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:57.700
with both access to
education on the one side,

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:02.050
but also I think a whole lot
more respect than we show

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:06.880
in our society to work that
does not necessarily require a

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.560
college degree, but
reflects commitment,

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.530
reflects craftsmanship.

01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:15.380
I think that one of the
if you compare our economy

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.120
and our social attitudes
to the Germans I think one

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.190
of the things my friend Ed Luce

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:22.930
of the Financial Times has
written quite eloquently

01:22:22.930 --> 01:22:30.450
about this that that society has
come to respect the work done

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:33.420
by those who do not
automatically fall

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:38.980
into some meritocratic elite
and has rewarded it accordingly.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.230
And the I'm heartened
to hear Ross

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:49.630
for his egalitarian
approach and it pains me

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:53.700
that there are not very many
conservatives these days

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:57.250
who are willing to embrace
that kind of egalitarianism,

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:59.590
in a way I think more
conservatives did.

01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:02.370
We look back and think
of Robert Taft as deeply,

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:05.930
deeply conservative and
yet he was in that era

01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:08.270
of shared commitment created

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:12.040
by the New Deal and
by World War II.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.530
He was willing to say that
the market all by itself,

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:16.830
the wardens of the market all

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:21.070
by itself will not guarantee
the good life for people.

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:23.370
And I'd like to see us
have a different kind

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:26.090
of political debate
where a conservative

01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:29.680
like Ross might correct
me in my hope

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.760
or perhaps I have too much
hope in X government program,

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.200
perhaps I'd be more willing
to tax people than he would,

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.730
but yet we would share
a commitment to the idea

01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:46.990
that you can't make the,
create the American dream

01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:52.160
without individual effort,
but you can't create a society

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.230
in which the American
dream is possible

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:58.070
without some collective
action, some collective effort

01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:01.520
and a real commitment
to each other

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.610
and not just to ourselves alone.

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:05.520
&gt;&gt; Ross Douthat: But the
irony it should be said

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.890
since we have both been
in different ways critical

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:09.720
of the President of the
United States tonight,

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.840
the irony of the Trump era is
that one of the many reasons

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.390
that Donald Trump was elected
president was his particular

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:17.690
sort of bludgeoning

01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:21.390
and demagogic way he did
provide that kind of vision.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:24.630
It was, you know, there isn't
actually necessarily policy

01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:28.680
to back it up, but the Donald
Trump Republican vision was

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.660
closer to what you're
describing than the Paul Ryan,

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:34.020
Mitt Romney vision
4 years before.

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.370
That's, I think that's
something that the populism

01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:41.920
of Trump is a sort of
crude grasp at that center

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.910
that you're talking about.

01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:45.210
&gt;&gt; E.J. Dionne: Well,

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:48.420
what I would argue back is
what's particularly insidious

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:53.210
about what Trump did is
that it carried that promise

01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:58.860
with policies that are actually
antithetical to that promise.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:02.830
I always felt, for example,
that when you know progressives

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:07.390
and even moderates say to a
lot of folks who find at age 50

01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:11.100
that they are not in a job that
provides them with the income

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.230
that they used to have
to support their families

01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:17.370
and live a decent life, and
the typical policy person

01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:20.070
who happens to be a college
educated comes along and says,

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:22.130
"Would you need more
training and education?"

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.800
And there's truth to that,

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.670
but I think that person has
every right to think what

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:30.670
that person is telling us is
we got to be more like them

01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:36.310
and it comes off as, as
condescending and not

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:38.390
in any way genuinely empathic.

01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:40.000
When Trump said, "I'm going

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.150
to bring back those factory
jobs and those coal jobs."

01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:44.600
Of course he wasn't
going to do that.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.570
I have a strong suspicion that
many of the people who heard

01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:52.690
that and shared know that's
not true, but they had a sense

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:57.610
from that that he understood
the way they felt better

01:25:57.610 --> 01:26:01.410
than the person who kept talking
about training and education,

01:26:01.410 --> 01:26:04.950
so I during the campaign,

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:08.880
one of the best nicest
moments I had is I suggested

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.420
that the hat I wanted
to wear would say,

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.520
"Make America Empathetic Again."

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.620
And a very nice person in
the audience came up to me

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.920
and said, "I love that.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.220
You're going to hear from me."

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.900
And I got this hat
and I got in my mail

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.900
and it was perfect
grappling of the Trump hat,

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:28.000
but it said "Make
America Empathetic Again."

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.740
And my son said "That's awesome
dad but you can't wear it

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:35.400
because he did too good a job
and it looks like a Trump hat."

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.500
But I do think that
we are, you know,

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.690
if our country dies it will be

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:44.670
because of our absolute
inability

01:26:44.670 --> 01:26:50.000
to understand the suffering and
the pain of people unlike us,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.100
and that the worse kind
of politics is a politics

01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:00.610
that holds one group's pain
against another group's pain

01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:03.430
and that's what we have
to find a remedy for.

01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:08.140
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: The conversation
tonight proves that the concept

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.890
of the American dream
is this conversation

01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:16.720
that is never ending, tonight
true to the Kluge moto,
