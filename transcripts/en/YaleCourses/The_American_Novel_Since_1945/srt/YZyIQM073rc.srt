1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,940
I want to start my lecture today.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,440
Looking back to that handout I
gave you but didn't give you a, uh,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,150
a discussion of a couple of days ago.
Um,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,870
from that essay,

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:16,660
good readers and good writers that I
quoted at the very beginning of class. Uh,

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,583
this term,

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,020
if you took the time to read that,

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,520
what you saw is novakof meditating
on how reader and writers meat.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,970
Yeah.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,490
And so I just want to read
to you a little bit, uh,

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,250
from that, if you still
have it, you can get it out.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,400
The real writer,

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,810
the fellow who sends
planets spinning and models,

14
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,230
Amanda Sleep and eagerly
tampers with the sleepers rib,

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,210
that kind of author has no
given values at his disposal.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,700
He must create them himself.

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,200
The Art of writing is a very few
tile business. If it does not imply,

18
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:10,090
first of all, the art of seeing the
world as the potentiality of fiction.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,730
The material of this world may be
real enough as far as reality goes.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,230
But it does not exist at all as
an excepted entirety. It is chaos.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,450
And to this chaos,
the author says,

22
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:26,410
go allowing the world
to flicker and to fuse.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,140
It is now recombined and it's very,

24
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:32,500
Adam's not merely in it's
visible and superficial parts.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,900
The writer is the first man to map
it and to name the natural objects it

26
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:40,720
contains.
Those berries are edible.

27
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,100
That speckled creature that bolted
across my path might be tamed.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,640
That lake between those trees will be
called Lake Opal or more artistically

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,360
dishwater lake.

30
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,990
That mist is a mountain and that mountain
must be conquered up a track list.

31
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:02,530
Slope climbs the master artist
and at the top on a windy ridge,

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,270
whom do you think he meets?

33
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,290
The panting and happy reader and they
spontaneously embrace and are linked

34
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,300
forever if the book lasts forever.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,780
So this is Nabar coughs,

36
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:21,781
beautiful advocation of how writer and
reader meet at the summit of this misty

37
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,500
mountain of the imagination.

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,970
But I've been suggesting to you over the
course of the lecture so far this term

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,780
that this is for many books,

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,390
a totally idealized sense
of how reader encounters it.

41
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,930
And no book demonstrates that in quite
the same way on our syllabus as Lolita

42
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,100
itself.
Um,

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,420
it's true that black boy
was censored even after it,

44
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,750
it was published in its abbreviated form,
um,

45
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,560
in the 80s. It was censored
from high school libraries,

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,450
but Lolita was censored at the very
start in a different way and completely,

47
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,740
um,
if you read,

48
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:13,390
as I asked you to do the essay at
the back on a book and titled Lolita,

49
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,400
you'll see as Novakof describes,
he circulated it to American publishers,

50
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,234
four of them,

51
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,570
and it was turned down by everybody
finally published in France by the Olympia

52
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:29,290
press, which had also publish to other
controversial books like naked lunch.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,050
Um,
and Lady Chatterley's lover,

54
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,100
MMM Nabar

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,100
cough cannot meet his reader in on the
misty mountain because somebody has to

56
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:44,080
agree to publish this book first.

57
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,920
It has to exist in the world
before that reader can meet it.

58
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,770
And the very fact of censorship.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,930
So the book was published
by the Olympia pressed,

60
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,230
and then it was banned
in France and in Britain.

61
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,180
It was imported into the United States.
And several years later, uh, uh,

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,240
an American publication was made and
it rocketed to the bestseller lists.

63
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:12,490
So it was a very popular book in the u
s but it did have this history of being

64
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:15,340
banned in Europe and it was
certainly controversial here.

65
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,030
Therefore, the mark of censorship
is actually still on this book.

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,720
The essay that you read was produced
at the behest of his French publisher.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,490
They wanted him to write something that
would make people feel better about the

68
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:37,720
book that would give some account of
its origin and give some defense for its

69
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,570
publication and its content.

70
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,040
And so we have it bound
with the book always now.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,900
And so in a way you can say that
although it's Nabar coughs voice and it's

72
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,400
adding to the novel,

73
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,840
nothing was taken away from the novel
in the way that half of black boy was

74
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,670
removed before it was published.

75
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,180
It's still deformed in a certain way
or influenced by the history of that

76
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,024
censorship.

77
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,113
Now

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,660
I think it's worth thinking
about what he says in that essay.

79
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,000
And I'm especially interested in,
um,

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,300
this passage on three 13
about the genre fiction of,

81
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,530
of pornography.

82
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,250
So this is three 13,
if you'll turn to it.

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,753
Hmm.

84
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,250
In modern type times, the
term pornography, keynotes,
mediocrity, commercialism,

85
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,310
and certain strict rules of narration,

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,880
obscenity must be mated with banality
because every kind of aesthetic enjoyment

87
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,910
has to be entirely replaced
by simple sexual stimulation,

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,060
which demands the traditional word for
direct action upon the old rigid rules

89
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:03,920
must be followed by the pornographer in
order to have his patient feel the same

90
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,530
security of satisfaction as,
for example,

91
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,770
fans of detective stories feel
stories where if you do not watch out,

92
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:17,051
the real murderer may turn out to be to
the fans discussed artistic originality,

93
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,670
who for instance, would want a detective
story without a single dialogue in it.

94
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,190
Thus,
in pornographic novels,

95
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:29,750
action has to be limited to
the copulation of cliches.

96
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,790
Artistic originality turns out to be
the murderer to the fans discussed.

97
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,090
Artistic originality here is likened
to the murderer of convention.

98
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,790
It's originality that destroys convention.

99
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,100
And here it's given that free
saw of being a criminal to,

100
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,700
he's suggesting the criminality
of real artistic innovation.

101
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,050
And by doing that,

102
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:07,430
by using that language to
describe artistic originality,

103
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,960
he allies artistic originality
with the figure of Humbert.

104
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,790
So there's,
there's,

105
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,820
there are multiple ways at multiple levels
that Novakof is defending his work in

106
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,390
this. Afterward, he, for one
thing, he insults the publishers.

107
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,140
He suggested that they didn't finish
the manuscript because when his,

108
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,060
his manuscript turned out not to
be pornographic genre fiction,

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,260
they stopped reading because that's
what they wanted. And they said,

110
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,370
this is a terrible,
put it down.

111
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,990
So he insults the people who turned
down the book in the United States.

112
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,860
He ally's originality with criminality

113
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,270
and he suggests that it is the,

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,320
but now attention to convention that
is in fact what needs to be censored,

115
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,470
what needs to be done away with.

116
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,570
Yeah.

117
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,570
He also gives us few notice his little
secret map of Lolita or so it seems as

118
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:16,400
it's presented to us,

119
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,660
his secret map of the scenes that
delight him in his own novel.

120
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,440
And this is on three 16

121
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,173
okay.

122
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,010
I find it Lolita to be
a delightful presence.

123
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,550
Now that it quietly hangs about
the house like a summer day,

124
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,640
which one knows to be bright
behind the haze there,

125
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:47,060
he's playing with the name
Hayes and when I lost,

126
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,130
think of Lolita.

127
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,520
I off out seem always to pick out for
special delectation such images as Mr Tech

128
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,250
Sovich or that list of Ramsdale school
or Charlotte seeing waterproof or Lolita

129
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:05,301
in slow motion advancing towards Humberto
gifts or the pictures decorating.

130
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,520
The stylized Garret of
Gastrin will go down,

131
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,300
or the Kas Been Barber who cost me a
month of work or Lolita playing tennis or

132
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:19,791
the hospital at Elphinstone or Pale
pregnant beloved irretrievable Dolly

133
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,410
Schiller dying in gray star,

134
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,420
the capital town of the book
or the tinkling sounds of
the valley town coming up.

135
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:32,260
The mountain trail on which I caught
the first known female of listed as sub

136
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:36,750
love sub livens. My, my
Latin is bad [inaudible].

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,180
These are the nerves of the novel.
These are the secret points.

138
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,870
The subliminal coordinates by
means of which the book is plotted.

139
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,790
Although I realize very clearly that these
and other scenes will be skimmed over

140
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,870
and not noticed.

141
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,260
We're never even reached by those
who begin reading the book under the

142
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,760
impression that is something along the
lines of memoirs of a woman of pleasure.

143
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,220
He says these are the scenes and I
want you to keep those scenes in mind.

144
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,110
Some of them we've already talked about,

145
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,600
Andrew talked about the class list and
gave you some ways of understanding those

146
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,750
pictures in Gusto Guitars, um, apartment.

147
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,540
So we've talked about those today.

148
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,750
I'm going to pick up on some of those
other scenes that he mentions as his

149
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:25,230
secret points of delight in the novel.

150
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,990
What kind of novel do we see
if we attend to those scenes?

151
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,440
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take that essay,

152
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,660
the product of censorship,
the response to censorship,

153
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,170
and I'm going to use it to
read back into the novel.

154
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,380
And I want to work with you to see what
we can see if we use those scenes as our

155
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:51,060
points of reference.

156
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,310
And so our task today will be to think
about that second road trip in the novel.

157
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,360
So this was your reading for today to
begin at that second road trip that Lolita

158
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,940
initiates and think about what happens
to the novel from there to the end.

159
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,610
Now the most conspicuous things that
happen are an increase in the violence of

160
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:23,160
the novel. He hits her, he pushes her,

161
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,540
he rapes her repeatedly.

162
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,580
We see more of those scenes in
the second half of the novel.

163
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,960
His style becomes more manic.

164
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,820
It gets even funnier.

165
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,940
There are many passages of outright
comedy in this second half,

166
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:52,240
especially the shooting of quilty,
um,

167
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,820
this sort of parody of the
climax of a crime movie.

168
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,740
So there are all kinds of
flourishes in the style,

169
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,150
and Humbert presents himself as
more and more of a hapless madman.

170
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,360
You can see it in his perceptions.
You can see it in his language.

171
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,100
You can see it in the behavior.
He reports as when he, uh,

172
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,220
he vomits at the resort in Colorado when
he thinks that Lolita has gone away.

173
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:30,280
And then he sees her playing
with the dog and he thinks, Oh,

174
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,660
if only she would play with me. She's
playing with a damn dog and then he, he,

175
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,460
he's sickened by this idea.

176
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,450
You see more of that kind
of physical deterioration.

177
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,680
He drinks more so he's
getting very desperate.

178
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,620
Lowly on the other hand becomes more
calculating and it's this that I want to

179
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:51,850
focus in on today.

180
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,930
What becomes of Lolita
in this second part,

181
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,150
and I want to suggest if we turn to page
two of seven in the beginning of that

182
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:01,984
trip,

183
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,440
I want to suggest that in the second
half Lolita takes on the role of the

184
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,124
artist.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,833
Okay.

186
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,080
If you'll recall.

187
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,080
Okay.

188
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,080
The two of them have a fight over her
participation in the play because he

189
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:25,091
suspects her of deceiving him somehow
either with boys or somehow with someone

190
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,080
associated with the play.

191
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,200
He doesn't quite suspect the truth yet
that she has met a quilty through that

192
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:39,080
play.
So they have this big fight.

193
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,210
It's raining.
She rides her bicycle way into the rain.

194
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:47,630
When the neighbor calls to complain
about they're yelling at each other.

195
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,590
So this is on two oh six two oh seven.

196
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,613
Okay.

197
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,220
In front of the first drug
store I saw with what?

198
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:04,570
Melody of Relief Lolita's
fair bicycle waiting for her.

199
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,830
I pushed instead of pulling, pulled,
pushed, pulled and entered. Okay.

200
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,090
There he is struggling with the door.

201
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:14,920
There's that physical comedy and I'll
suggest to you that in that sentence,

202
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,540
the pushing and pulling, you're seeing
part of Nabar coughs, verbal play.

203
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,250
It's not just sort of physical
comedy translated into prose,

204
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,960
but there are a host of other moments
in the novel we're pushing in polling

205
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:33,190
figure darkly.
In one of the rape scenes,

206
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,120
he pushes her into her room.
Um,

207
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,280
less darkly at the drugstore,

208
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,760
the soda jerk pulling on
the Levers of the dispenser.

209
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,760
Look out some 10 paces away.
Lolita threw a glass of a telephone booth.

210
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:53,210
Membranous God's still with us, cupping
the to confidentially hunched over it,

211
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,950
slit her on at me,

212
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,750
turned away with her treasure heartedly
hang up and walked out with a flourish.

213
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,440
So here now we moved from Humberto
verbal flourish to Lolita's physical one

214
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,840
tried to reach you at home. She said
brightly. A great decision. Has been made,

215
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,000
but first,
buy me a drink dead.

216
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,960
She watched the listless Pale
Fountain girl put in the ice,

217
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:22,340
pour in the coke ad the Cherry Syrup, and
my heart was bursting with love. Ache.

218
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,320
That childish wrist. My lovely child.
You have a lovely child, Mr Humbert.

219
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
We always admire her as she passes by Mr
Pim watches pip us suck the concoction

220
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,630
she [inaudible] admitted. Hey Luca
or moan does, who beamed Dubois.

221
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,350
And in the meantime,
the rain had become a voluptuous shower.

222
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,500
So here's his verbal ecstasy
as he watches her look,

223
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,420
she said as she rode the bike beside me,

224
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:54,530
one foot scraping the darkly glistening
sidewalk. Look, I've decided something.

225
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,410
I want to leave school. I hate
that school. I hate the play.

226
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,970
I really do never go back. Find another
leave at once. Go for a long trip again.

227
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:05,450
But this time we'll go wherever I want,
won't we?

228
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,520
I nodded my Lolita.
I choose sales tone do.

229
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,250
She said Womblay wobbling
a little beside me.

230
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,840
Used French only when she was
a very good little girl. Okay,

231
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:21,050
I'll tell him to do now.
How Popup Lenore or you'll get soaked.

232
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,900
A storm of sobs was filling my chest.

233
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,280
She bared her teeth and after her
adorable schoolgirl fashioned,

234
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,950
lean forward and a way she sped my bird,

235
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,320
Miss Lester's finally groomed hand,

236
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,950
held a porch door open for a
waddling old dog keep hunting salt.

237
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,270
Tom Lowe was waiting for me
near the ghostly birch tree.

238
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm drenched.
She declared at the top of her voice.

239
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,210
Are you glad to hell with the play?
See what I mean,

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,600
and invisible hags clause slammed down
and upper floor window in our hallway

241
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,320
ablaze with welcoming lights.
My Lolita peeled off her sweater,

242
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,670
shook her jammed hair stretched
towards me to bear arms,

243
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,900
raised one knee,
carry me upstairs please.

244
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,720
I feel sort of romantic tonight.

245
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,720
She's juicing him in this scene,

246
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,160
so the flourish passes from his prose.

247
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,720
It's not gone from his prose,

248
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,900
but in this scene very clearly it passes
from his prose into her acting and

249
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:30,201
Humbert reflects that her work in
the play has trained her into certain

250
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:35,670
affectations.
Unfortunately for him,

251
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,250
he doesn't exactly spot this one.

252
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,360
She now is using the cliches of romance
to seduce him into following her map for

253
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:48,540
their second journey.

254
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,290
Starting out on this second journey by
calling forth all his mad love for her so

255
00:17:56,431 --> 00:18:01,380
that he will be in a sense blinded
by that and not see her machinations.

256
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,910
You see it again on two oh
nine little later in this, uh,

257
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,250
in this scene.

258
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,880
His suspicion is,

259
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,440
is aroused when a car pulls up next to
them as they're heading out of town.

260
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,440
It's Dusa gold driving up next to them

261
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,620
and he's asking who, who
was it exactly that, uh,

262
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,510
had been impressed by Lolita's acting,
um,

263
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,550
and Lolita takes him to mean who was
the person in the car next to them,

264
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,270
not who was the person that the
person in the car was referring to.

265
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,200
I was not referring to her. Who exactly
concocted that play. Oh yes, of course.

266
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,630
Some old woman, Claire something. I guess
there was quite crowd of them there.

267
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,110
So she complimented,
you complimented my eye.

268
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:08,111
She kissed me on my pure brow and my
darling emitted that new Yelp of Merryman,

269
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,310
which perhaps in connection with her
theatrical mannerisms she had lately begun

270
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,510
to effect.

271
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:16,810
Okay,

272
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,710
and I just want to skip down to
the bottom of that paragraph.

273
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,430
He gives her a kind of warning, which I'm
going to talk about in a little while,

274
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,500
but at the very end he says,

275
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,483
mmm,

276
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,320
the tour of your thigh, you know, should
not exceed 17 and a half inches. She,

277
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,800
he's warning her not to grow
up essentially more. Might
be fatal. I was kidding.

278
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,310
Of course, we are now setting out
on a long happy journey. I remember,

279
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:45,750
and then look at the paragraph
break there. I remember as a child,

280
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,100
now this is not in quotes.

281
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,160
I remember as a child in Europe gloating
over a map of North America that have

282
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,410
had Appalachian Mountains bolding,

283
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,580
run boldly running from Alabama up to
new Brunswick so that the whole region

284
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:03,390
they spend Tennessee, the
Virginia's Pennsylvania, New
York, Vermont, New Hampshire,

285
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:08,391
and Maine appeared to my imagination as
a gigantic Switzerland or even to bet

286
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:12,030
all mountain glorious
diamond peak upon peak.

287
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,690
This is the realm of that mountain of
imagination that I was showing you in the,

288
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,290
um, passage from good
readers and good writers.

289
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,040
This is hummingbirds meditation on looking
at a map and seeing a range in which

290
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:35,520
imagination can have pure play.
Now, as it turns out, and you,

291
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,750
if you keep reading there,

292
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,640
he's disappointed to find
what the Appalachian mountains
actually look like in

293
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,470
the United States. He finds
them much less romantic, uh,

294
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,780
kind of garbage dump,
a very seedy stretch of the world.

295
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,040
Um,

296
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,040
but what I wanted to note is how that
chapter break brings us from Lolita's

297
00:20:56,471 --> 00:21:01,471
first efforts at motivating
the romantic cliches.

298
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,070
Her first efforts immediately pay off in
transporting him into that mountainous

299
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:10,030
imagination.

300
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,640
This is how we know that she's got him.

301
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,430
She's got him in the imagination.
He,

302
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,610
she's not just seduced his last full body.

303
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,890
She has him

304
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,450
fully under her power at this point and
it's that chapter break that you can see

305
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,490
demonstrating the fact.

306
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,450
Now I want to look at page two 31 to
32 this is one of those passages that

307
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,620
novakof points out as
being special to him.

308
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,440
This is Lolita playing tennis

309
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,660
actually.
So two 31

310
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,130
okay,

311
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,710
my Lolita,
this is near the bottom of the page.

312
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,220
How to way of raising her bent left knee
at the ample and springy start of the

313
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:17,700
service cycle when there would develop
and hang in the sun for a second of vital

314
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,880
web of balance between toed foot,
pristine armpit,

315
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,881
burnished arm and far back flung racket
as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at

316
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:27,210
the small globe,

317
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,360
suspended so high in the zenith of the
powerful and graceful cosmos she had

318
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:36,660
created for the express purpose
of falling upon it with a clean,

319
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:39,960
resounding crack of her golden whip.

320
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,380
It had that serve of her as
beauty directness, youth,

321
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,970
a classical purity of trajectory,
and was despite its spanking pace,

322
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,120
fairly easy to return having as it did
no twist or sting to its long elegant

323
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:54,834
hop.

324
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,213
Okay.

325
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,310
And then a little further down the page,

326
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,630
she who was so cruel and crafting
everyday life revealed and innocence of

327
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:05,464
frankness,

328
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,270
a kindness of ball playing that permitted
a second rate but determined player no

329
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:15,271
matter how uncouth and incompetent
to poke and cut his way to victory.

330
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,070
Yeah.

331
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,870
That pose the pose of tennis service,
the raised foot,

332
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,340
it's the same pose she uses
to seduce him in that scene.

333
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:30,360
I just read after their fight,
I feel sort of romantic tonight.

334
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,590
She is acting out a
form in the first case,

335
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,860
the form of, of, of romantic fiction,

336
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,020
the heroine who swoons back in this scene,

337
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,370
the form of the game,
the perfect form of tennis.

338
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,340
And he says she did a
perfect imitation of top,

339
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,600
not tennis.

340
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:58,601
This is on two 31 her for was indeed
an absolutely perfect imitation of

341
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:03,830
absolutely top notch tennis
without any utilitarian results.

342
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,190
It's perfect tennis but she never
wins and he reflects on two 32

343
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,480
had not something within
her been broken by me,

344
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,170
not that I realized it then she would
have had on top of her perfect form the

345
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:24,830
will to win and would have
become a real girl champion.

346
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:30,130
He reads the Non Utilitarian quality of
her form as the evidence of her broken

347
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:32,624
nature,

348
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,810
but I would like to suggest that it's
precisely that non utilitarian quality

349
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,000
that is the mark of her
wholeness in a certain way.

350
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,750
If aesthetic bliss is what
novakof confesses his,

351
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:55,751
his ultimate aim for art in the
essay on a book and titled Lolita,

352
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
something like that is what Lolita gives
us in her perfect tennis form without

353
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,390
the will to win the frankness,
beauty,

354
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,730
kindness,
lack of deception

355
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,860
and in that sense it is also a
version of play of children's play,

356
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,500
not competitive play,

357
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,140
which is a different kind of thing but
pure play and this gets us back again to

358
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:32,141
that image of the chest problem that I
was talking about in my first lecture.

359
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,210
The chest problem is not
in the middle of a game.

360
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,560
It's a puzzle,
but it has verts delight,

361
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,750
a kind of solitary quality,

362
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,820
both of the composer and of the
solver of the chest problem.

363
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,030
So it's not in the course
of competitive play.

364
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,300
And although he uses the language of
competition to describe the relationship

365
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:01,280
between the composer and the solver,

366
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,820
it's not in that sense a competitive game
as chess would be white against black.

367
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,360
This kind of self absorbed autonomous
play of Lolita's tennis form is the kind

368
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:21,740
of play that children have.
It doesn't have a point.

369
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:23,690
It's all process and form.

370
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,220
If the threat to the work of art to
the novel is something like convention,

371
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,820
I want to think hard about what the threat
to this kind of play is in the novel.

372
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,050
And I want to suggest that the threat
to this kind of play is parallel to the

373
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:45,720
threat to children.

374
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,560
The threat to children
in the novel multiplies.

375
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,050
It is not just Lolita who is threatened,

376
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,020
but all sorts of children.

377
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,470
So let's begin with another of those
scenes on to 13 that novakof points out to

378
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,240
us.
The Kas Been Barbara,

379
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:07,320
why did it take him a month to
come up with the Caspian Barber?

380
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,730
What's going on in this tiny
snippet that's so important?

381
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,590
So here it is in Caz beam.

382
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,990
A very old Barbara gave me
a very mediocre haircut.

383
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,230
He babbled of a baseball playing son of
his and at every exploding spat into my

384
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:29,220
neck and every now and then wiped his
glasses on my sheet rep or interrupted his

385
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,940
tremulous scissor work to produce
faded newspaper clippings.

386
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:38,270
And so in attentive was I that it came
as a shock to realize as he pointed to an

387
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:43,731
easel photograph among the ancient gray
lotions that the mustached young ball

388
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:46,800
player had been dead
for the last 30 years.

389
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,570
So the barber is speaking about his
son in such a way that he seems alive,

390
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,760
but in fact he's dead.

391
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,790
So here is one dead child playing baseball
or the memory of him playing baseball

392
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,150
is alive with his father.

393
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,660
If you look down at the
very bottom of that page,

394
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,860
you see a young woman far
gone in the family way,

395
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:19,310
had seated a wrapped baby on a swing and
was rocking it gently while a jealous

396
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:24,480
boy of two or three was making a nuisance
of himself by trying to push or pull.

397
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,380
There's that wordplay again coming
back to us, the swing board.

398
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,090
He finally succeeded in getting himself
knocked down by it and bawled loudly as

399
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:38,091
he lays Hoopla supine on the grass while
his mother continued to smile gently at

400
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,500
neither of her present children.

401
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,080
And if you skip over to two 15 this
image comes back of this mother.

402
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,770
All cars had disappeared
except in station wagon.

403
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:54,510
His pregnant young wife was now getting
into it with her baby and the other more

404
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,730
or less canceled child.

405
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,560
So here are at least three examples of
canceled children and you can use that

406
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:09,990
phrase I think to characterize Lolita.
She is a canceled child.

407
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,800
Her childhood is stolen
from her by Humbert.

408
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,130
In this scene.

409
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,190
It is the mother's imaginative
preoccupation in a sense that cancels her

410
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:25,914
children.

411
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,970
And you can ask whether she is preoccupied
with the idea of the new child within

412
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,180
her.

413
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:38,180
You get that sense of pregnancy being an
inner meaning or an inner significance,

414
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,550
and perhaps it's a figure
for what preoccupies her
for the world of imagination

415
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:50,050
and possibility. But she has that
kind of distance, distant ETR,

416
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,190
internal smile.

417
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,870
This is the same kind of smile that
Lolita is said to have this beautiful

418
00:29:55,871 --> 00:30:00,871
passage where he Humbert
remembers Lolita's famous smile.

419
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,860
That range is around the room,
but doesn't seem to engage anyone.

420
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:11,370
It says f her smile is the response
to an internal imagined life.

421
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,220
One that's inaccessible to Humbert.
He says of her,

422
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,930
he does not know what regions
there were in her mind, what dim,

423
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:24,430
adorable regions there were in
her mind that he would never know,

424
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:29,620
that he was denied access
to as he raped her.

425
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,143
Okay?

426
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,220
And so children which have this potential
to play are consistently canceled over

427
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,240
and over again.

428
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,530
Okay?

429
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,570
There are other examples.
Um,

430
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,660
on two 23 we find out that Mona
Lolita's friend from the play,

431
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,780
her baby sibling were not told
whether it's boy or girl dies.

432
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:03,780
And we see it in one of those parents.
Pheta acles two 23 this is Mona's letter.

433
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,703
Yeah.

434
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,420
Now that everything is over school
play the Roy mass mother's confinement.

435
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,180
Our baby alas did not live.

436
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,860
It all seems a long time ago
though practically I still
bear traces of the paint

437
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,881
again,

438
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:23,881
that parent theoretical a
aligns the death of the child.

439
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,290
We're reminded in this scene of the
death of Lolita's little brother.

440
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:34,610
I remember Charlotte Hayes speaks in
her letter of a lost son who died at the

441
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:40,360
age of two.
The bodies of children pile up,

442
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,020
but other things happen to children to
remember when Lolita and Humbert are

443
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,430
partially discovered

444
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:55,050
having sex in a field by a mother
and her children gathering flowers.

445
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,670
They're described as
carved blue stone children.

446
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,193
Okay.

447
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,090
And think about the name of that town,

448
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Elphinstone of which novakof
again is proud Elphinstone,

449
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,930
a little child of stone,

450
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,580
a small figure of stone
and the Elf like um,

451
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,440
image is something that he
applies to Lolita over and over.

452
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,620
So what you see is children,
Dad,

453
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,740
children turn to stone and this is the
dark side of that fairy tale quality that

454
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:38,551
we see in other parts of the novel
that's been coming back in our lectures.

455
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,260
These are children turn to stone.

456
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:44,790
Yeah.

457
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,790
And it suggests if you go back
now to that scene on two oh seven,

458
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:55,380
two oh eight,
as they set out for the second trip

459
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,970
in the, in the middle of the,
um, in the middle of the page.

460
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,530
Okay.

461
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,630
Actually a little too,
a little above actually,

462
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:13,631
I was toying with the idea of gently
trickling across the Mexican border.

463
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,620
I was braver now than last year and
they're deciding what to do with my little

464
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:23,570
concubine who was now 60 inches
tall and weighed 90 pounds.

465
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,320
The threat against Lolita is growing
with her body as she gets bigger,

466
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,240
bigger.
So he becomes murderous towards her.

467
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,420
And this is a lied with his desire in a
sense to crystallize what he has taken

468
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:44,684
from her.

469
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,930
And here in the middle of
the page a little ways down
my loves striped black and

470
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:53,570
white cotton frock Jaunty, blue
cap, white sox and Brown moccasins.

471
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,760
We're not quite in keeping with the
large beautifully cut aqua marine on a

472
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,810
silver chain lit,

473
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,340
which jammed her throat a
spring rain gift from me.

474
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,290
He has taken summer rain that the page
before we are told jammed her hair,

475
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,350
shook her gem tear stretched towards
me to bear arms, raised one knee,

476
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,940
her jammed hair takes that
rain and ossified eyes.

477
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,680
It makes it Lapidary,

478
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:29,681
turns it to stone in the aqua marine
and puts it on a chain lit and the

479
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:35,951
diminutive let at the end of the
chain doesn't really cover up.

480
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,520
The chain itself doesn't really
mitigate against the confinement he has

481
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:47,570
perpetrated on Lolita.

482
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,010
She is in chains and just
because it's ornamented,

483
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,270
just because it has the diminutive
doesn't mean that it's not a chain,

484
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,950
it's around her throat.
That vulnerable place.

485
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,423
Yeah.

486
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,960
So if art as play is
something like performance,

487
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:11,280
something like an embodied art,

488
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,630
the art of the tennis service or
even the art of theater or film,

489
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:22,340
there's another kind of art
that is gem like hard cold,

490
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,130
equally formal but dead
blue stone children.

491
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,253
Okay.

492
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,970
So this is the other form
that the aesthetic can take.

493
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:41,050
And I think that Nabar is consistently
concerned about these two valence as of

494
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,420
what the aesthetic can look like.

495
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,990
So if it can look like the gem,

496
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,120
it can last forever as Humbert dreams.

497
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:57,540
At the very end of the novel he says,

498
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,600
I am thinking of our oxen angels,
the secret of durable pigments,

499
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,620
prophetic sonnets,
the refuge of art.

500
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,980
And this is the only immortality
you and I may share my Lolita.

501
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:18,890
He thinks of his account as that kind
of enduring stonelike object and it may

502
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:28,590
give him mortality,
but it traps her there in,

503
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:30,390
in mortality with him.

504
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,720
He is as I'm as immortal as she
is in the pages of this screed.

505
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,253
Yeah.

506
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,000
And so like the chain lit,

507
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,240
it takes that stonelike distillation
of life turning rain to stone,

508
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,620
turning life to the
representation by your tormentor.

509
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,810
It turns into something
durable that will outlast them.

510
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,230
So the problem with art is in a
sense that it is the immortal,

511
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,980
that's the problem.

512
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,133
If

513
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,560
life is threatened over and over
again in this novel by mortality,

514
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,050
dead children, Lolita, growing
up inevitably painfully

515
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,480
putting her at risk, her body grows.
She can't do anything about it.

516
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,060
That's mortality.
The passage of time,

517
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,460
this difference between the art that's
lapidary and the art that's living is

518
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:41,380
that the art that's living by very
virtue of being alive can also die.

519
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,880
So this is the problem with
the autonomous work of art.

520
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,790
If your dream as a writer is to make
an autonomous work of art that has,

521
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,790
as we say, in a very colloquial
way, a life of its own.

522
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,340
The book has a life of its own.
We kind of,

523
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:02,341
we'll say that about a great book or
a great painting it lives on after its

524
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:06,850
author's death.
We use that metaphor.

525
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,230
But the problem is that there's something
about life that's dependent on the

526
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:15,190
possibility of its negation.

527
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,970
That's why on Valentine's Day you might
give your lover real flowers rather than

528
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:23,050
plastic ones.

529
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:29,260
It's the very potential to
decay that makes them beautiful.

530
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,360
And so the problem here is that novakof
dreams of an art that's living something

531
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:41,611
like the butterflies that he was so in
chanted with in his life and work outside

532
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:48,361
of fiction and the butterfly does appear
in just one moment and it's during the

533
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:53,170
tennis scene as Humbert and Lolita play,

534
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,020
there's one butterfly
that flits between them.

535
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,670
It's a mark of very quality
as artists in that moment.

536
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,990
The Butterfly is the perfect work of art
because it is both a representation and

537
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:15,170
alive. It has eyes on its
wings. It looks like a leaf.

538
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,460
It is nature in its aesthetic
form as imitation of itself,

539
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,270
life as an imitation of life.

540
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,953
Okay?

541
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Can you make a novel as he says in the
essay that will sprout wings and grow

542
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:41,120
clause in secret in his mind,

543
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,520
that's an image taken from the
metamorphosis of the butterfly within the

544
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:47,354
Chrysalis.

545
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
He wants his novel to be
like that living butterfly.

546
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:57,530
But the threat is always that it
will be more like the aqua marine.

547
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,030
And I want to suggest to you that the
aqua marine has an even darker personal

548
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:05,300
significance to him.
When his family fled Russia,

549
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,710
the only things of value that they brought
with them where some of his mother's

550
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,813
jewels,

551
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,420
these jewels were hidden in a canister
of talcum powder later buried in the yard

552
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:24,081
under a tree in Europe as they move
from place to place in their exile.

553
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,670
And they were gradually sold off
one by one to fund their life.

554
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,200
Those jewels,
I would suggest to you,

555
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,230
carried with them the sense that they
were the ossified remains of a radiant

556
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,310
Russian life.

557
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,660
And so the image of the jewel is a kind
of dead childhood even for him as a

558
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,070
writer.
So where is newbark off in here?

559
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,760
I think that's one of the
places where Nebach off is

560
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,130
it's novakof meditating on this problem.

561
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,330
I want to read that last,
um,

562
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,690
passage on three Oh eight
that he mentions in the essay.

563
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,190
Actually it starts three Oh seven.

564
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,580
This is Humbert standing on the lip
of our ravine by the side of the road

565
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,520
listening to the sounds of a
small town rising up to him.

566
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:35,210
And Soon I realized that all these
sounds were of one that no other sounds,

567
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:40,331
but these came from the streets of the
transparent town with the women at home

568
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,040
and the Mentawais reader. What I heard
was, but the melody of children at play,

569
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,450
nothing but that.

570
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,500
And so limpid was the air that
within this vapor of blended voices,

571
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:56,501
majestic and my newt remote and magically
near frank and divinely enigmatic one

572
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:01,910
could hear now and then as if released
an almost inarticulate spurt of vivid

573
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:06,740
laughter or the crack of a bat
or the clatter of a toy wagon.

574
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,660
But it was all really too far for the
eye to distinguish any movement in the

575
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:14,030
lightly etched streets.
Ice Did.

576
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:18,650
Listening to that musical vibration
from my lofty slope to those flashes of

577
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:22,760
separate cries with a kind of
demure murmur for background.

578
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,090
And then I knew that hope that the
hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita's

579
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:30,980
absence from my side,

580
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,700
but the absence of her
voice from that Concord.

581
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,210
This then is my story.
I have reread it.

582
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,020
It has bits of marrow sticking
to it and blood and beautiful,

583
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,880
bright green flies.

584
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,810
The living voice is missing.

585
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,860
What you get instead is the corpse of the
novel with marrow and blood and flies.

586
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:02,540
Dolly Schiller aptly named of course
for the German romantic philosopher who

587
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:09,561
advocated play as a mode of the
aesthetic German romanticism of the 19th

588
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:12,864
century.

589
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,710
Dolly takes on that identity
as the romantic figure and
she dies giving birth to

590
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,290
a girl,
to a baby girl.

591
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,630
She dies in child bed.
Remember I asked you from the preface,

592
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:35,280
John raised preface to figure out who
Dolly Schiller is, who dies in child bed.

593
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,110
Well,
by now you should know that's Lolita,

594
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,220
so she dies giving birth to a child.

595
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,190
She has taken on the
mantle of romantic artist,

596
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,730
but she dies giving
birth to a live person,

597
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:58,030
to modes of creativity,
embodied and Lolita in that one act,

598
00:43:58,031 --> 00:44:03,031
and in that name she's giving
birth to a real live thing,

599
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,290
not a creation that is more like stone,

600
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,360
but an actual person.

601
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,380
And so what you see is not
just the paradox of wanting
your work of art to be a

602
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:18,880
living work of art,

603
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:23,881
to be personified in that way or made
animate that then exposes it to mortality.

604
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,580
The Woolworth's workers who don't read
it and who think no one in the world ever

605
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:35,130
reads it,
that kind of risk.

606
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,400
Your book cannot live if it has no reader
to meet it at the top of that mountain,

607
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,270
but Dolly embodies that
other kind of creativeness,

608
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,130
human creativity of the literal
kind giving birth to a child.

609
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,450
I think it's telling that this
kind of creation is a failure.

610
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,850
It cannot succeed in the
confines of this novel.

611
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,240
Nebach off had a way of

612
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:10,140
making an absence at a point
of his utmost investment.

613
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,710
For instance,
in his autobiography,

614
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:19,330
he notes the date and the phone call,
the date of,

615
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:22,780
and the phone call that tells his mother
that his father has been assassinated.

616
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,150
But he doesn't tell you
until many pages later what,

617
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,620
what it was that happened on that date.
He says on whatever the date was,

618
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:33,010
I think it's March 22nd when my mother
received a phone call and then it just

619
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:36,310
goes on about something else. It doesn't
tell you what that phone call was.

620
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,590
It was his father's assassination.

621
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:44,230
Like those absences in
other parts of his writing.

622
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,000
I think this absence,

623
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,660
this failure of any birth,

624
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,670
it marks a sort of vanishing point of art

625
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,290
that art somehow can't quite compete
with the real inventiveness of nature and

626
00:46:04,571 --> 00:46:08,790
of human persons.
He's going to try,

627
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,150
he's going to try to
give us a living prose,

628
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,510
but this is the end against
which it finds itself pressed.

629
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,730
Next week we're going to,

630
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,270
or next time we're turning to a
very different kind of writing, uh,

631
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:35,271
writing equally preoccupied with its
relationship to the world to life,

632
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,640
but very differently
approaching that problem.

633
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:41,820
So try to think about that
as you turn to on the road.
