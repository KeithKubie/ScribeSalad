00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.080
We're asked to graph the
function f of x is equal

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.956
to the principal square
root of 0.5x minus 1.

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:08.330
And to graph it,
we're just going

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.500
to sample some points,
some x values that

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.540
are within the domain of
this function definition.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.740
And see what the function is
equal to for those x values.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.230
And then we could
connect the dots

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.270
and see what the
curve might look like.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.670
So let me do a
little table here.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.400
And so I'm going to
pick some x values.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.780
And I'm going to figure out
what the f of x values are,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.792
given those x values.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.250
Actually, I'm going
to do something

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.710
in between because I want
to have nice, clean numbers.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.700
I want to pick x values that
are nice, clean integers.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.284
And I want to get f of x values
that are nice, clean integers.

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:41.449
So I'm going to be a little
bit more careful in what

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:42.280
x values I pick.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.980
I want to pick x values so that
this part of the expression,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.700
this part of the
function definition,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.900
ends up being an integer.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.720
And if this needs
to be an integer,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.730
then what's underneath
the radical, 0.5x,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.949
that needs to be
a perfect square.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.240
So actually, let me make
another column right over here

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.240
just to make our math
a little bit cleaner.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120
You could pick just
arbitrary x points.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.090
You could pick x to be 1,
2, 3, just go like that.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.399
But on some of those, you
might get strange radicals

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.940
over here, which
would be hard for us

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.320
to graph without a calculator.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320
So let's try.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.080
So let me write over
here what 0.5x is,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.230
and I'm doing this just
so I can pick this.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.640
We want this thing right over
here to be perfect squares

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.590
because if 0.5x is
a perfect square,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.070
then the square root of that
is going to be an integer.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.160
So let's say that 0.5--
let's think about all

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.420
of the perfect squares.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.460
Well, we could start with 0.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.930
Then, we could go to 1.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.060
Then, we could go to-- Let's
see, 2 is in a perfect square,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.390
3 is in a perfect square.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.848
I'm just thinking
of all the values

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:51.990
that if I took the square
root, I get an integer.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.470
And then I go to 4.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.550
Then, I go to 9.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.870
Then, I go to 16.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.154
Then, I go to 25.

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.320
These are definitely the
first five perfect squares.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.861
And, obviously, 0 you take the
principal square root of that,

00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:05.470
you get 0.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.330
So these would be
good values for 0.5x.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.440
But if those are what 0.5x
is equal to, what is x going

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.350
to be?

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.769
So if 0.5x is 0, then x
is also going to be 0.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.310
You could solve it separately
in an equation right over here.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.090
You could say 0.5x
is equal to 0.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.590
x is equal to 0 divided by 0.5.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.550
Just divide both sides by 0.5,
and you get that equal to 0.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.560
So in general, to get
what the x value is,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.966
we just have to take this
number and divide it by 0.5.

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.090
Or, another way to think
about it, take this number

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.080
and multiply it by 2.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.680
So when 0.5x is 1,
that means x is 2.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.826
0.5 time 2 is 1.

00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:47.735
0.5 times 8 is 4.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:50.313
0.5 times 18 is 9.

00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:54.601
0.5 times 32 is 16.

00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:57.942
0.5 times 50 is 25.

00:02:57.942 --> 00:02:59.650
So these are the x's
we're going to pick.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.233
And, once again, I
picked them just so

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.220
that this part of the
expression, this part

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.040
of the function definition,
comes out cleanly.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.130
And now let's figure out what
f of x is at those values.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.950
So f of 0 is going to be equal
to the square root of 0.5

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.360
times 0.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.160
Let me make my radical
a little bit bigger.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.660
0.5 times 0 minus 1.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.795
Well, this part right
over here is just 0.

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:32.210
0 minus 1 is just going
to be equal to negative 1.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.970
Now let's try it
when x is equal to 2.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.960
f of 2 is going to be equal to
the square root of 0.5 times 2

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.060
minus 1.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.990
We already know that this part
right over here is equal to 1.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.000
So you have 1 minus
1 is equal to 0.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.590
Now let's do the next one.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.050
f of 4-- I've already
used that blue color.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.710
I'll use green.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:04.520
f of 4 is equal to
0.5 times 4 minus 1.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.180
So this is we already
know-- Oh, sorry.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.440
0.5 times 8.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440
We're not taking f of 4.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.080
We're taking f of 8.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.240
Let me be careful.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.710
This is what the x values are.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:23.780
So f of 8 is equal to
0.5 times 8 minus 1.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.820
This part right over
here we'll evaluate too.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.380
So 0.5 times 8 is 4.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.840
You take the square root,
the principal root of 4.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.410
You get 2.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.480
2 minus 1 is equal to 1.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.810
Then over here, we'd
want to do this in pink.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:51.150
f of 18 is square root
of 0.5 times 18 minus 1.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.746
0.5 times 18 is 9.

00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:54.120
You take the square
root of that.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.940
You get 3.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.740
3 minus 1 is equal to 2.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.810
We'll do a couple more.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:10.370
f of 32 is equal to
0.5 times 32 minus 1.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.840
So it's the square
root of 16 minus 1.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.450
So that's 4 minus 1.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.470
The principal root of
16, which is 4 minus 1,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.170
which is equal to 3.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.740
And then, finally,
do one more of these.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.320
f of 50 is equal to the
square root of 0.5 times 50.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.040
0.5 times 50 is
this 25, and we're

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.290
going to take the square root.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.850
So this whole thing is
going to evaluate to 5.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.250
5 minus 1 is equal to 4.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.960
So we've taken some
x's is in our domain.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.690
And it's very important
to realize here

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.570
that our domain is restricted.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.282
It is not all real numbers.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.740
And the reason why
it is restricted

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.384
is if we're going to
take the principal root,

00:05:53.384 --> 00:05:54.800
right-- for the
sake of this if we

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.810
don't go into things
like imaginary numbers.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.320
And don't worry about that if
you don't know what those are.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.210
We have to assume that what's
underneath the radical sign

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.900
is positive.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.200
And in order for that to be
positive x has to be positive.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.720
So in order for 0.5x to be
greater than or equal to 0,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.640
which is what the principal
root is defined over,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.920
for our purposes in this video,
then if you divide both sides

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.930
of this inequality by 0.5,
you say that x has got to be

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.450
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.060
So we sampled some
points in the domain.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.730
The domain is all
real numbers, all

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.460
x's or all real numbers
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.800
We sampled some points there.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.820
We've strategically
picked them so that we'd

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.770
get nice, clean
answers for f of x.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.550
But now that we
figured out what f of x

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.870
is at each of these points,
we're ready to plot.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.630
So let me draw some axes here.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.660
So that's our x-axis.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.726
And let's make this our y-axis.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.820
And I'll say y is
equal to f of x.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.404
So whatever f of x
we get for a given x,

00:06:59.404 --> 00:07:01.320
we're going to set that
equal to y and plot it

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.740
on the vertical axis.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.530
This is our x-axis
right over there.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.760
And let's go point by point.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.593
Well, actually, first
let me draw the scale.

00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:10.780
So the x-axis goes
all the way to 50.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.820
So let me divide this.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.640
So let's say that this is 10.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.250
This is 20.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.780
This is 30.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.500
This is 40.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.690
And this is 50.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.950
And then our y-axis,
we're going to have

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.590
to go between negative 1 and 4.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.960
So let's make this negative 1.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.360
Let's make that 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.380
And now we're ready to
plot all the points.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:43.360
So when x is equal to 0, y,
or f of x, is negative 1.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.600
So you have the
point 0, negative 1.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.470
0, which is right over
there, 0, negative 1.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.990
So let me actually-- this
right over here is 0.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.780
But we want to plot the
point, 0, negative 1

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.780
is going to sit
right over there.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.950
Let me give its coordinates
that is 0, negative 1.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.530
Then, we plot 2 comma 0.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:11.710
So 2 is going to be right
around-- So that is 5.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.520
2 is going to be
right around there.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.930
2 comma 0 is going
to be right there.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.950
So that point right over
there is 2 comma 0 in magenta.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.700
Now we go to 8.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.810
Let me switch to that
same green color.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.720
We go to 8 comma 1.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.890
8 is going to be
right around here.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.409
We go 1 in the
vertical direction,

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.299
gets us right about there.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.320
That is the point 8 comma 1.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.270
Then, we go, in this pink
color, to 18 comma 2.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.320
When x is 18, f of x is 2.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.630
When x is 18-- 18 gets
us right about there.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.020
When x is 18, f of
x is equal to 2.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.300
So that puts us
right about there.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.200
So that is 18 comma 2.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.650
Then, what's our next color?

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.835
We'll use orange then.

00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:06.610
Then, we have 32 comma
3 where f of 32 is 3.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.310
So 32 is right about there.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.530
And f of 32 is 3.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.460
So it gets us
right, right there.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.740
So that is the
point, 32 comma 3.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.780
And then we have the last sample
of our domain, which is x is 50

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.900
and f of 50 is 4. x is 50.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.620
f of 50 is 4.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.340
So I'll put it right over there.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.720
So this is the point 50 comma 4.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.420
And now, we can
connect the dots to get

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.524
the graph of the function.

00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:38.440
I'll do that in white.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.800
So if I connect the
dots, I get a curve

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.600
that looks like half
of a sideways parabola.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.110
And that's essentially
what it is.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.637
So my curve will look
something like this.

00:09:49.637 --> 00:09:51.970
It's important to realize
that the graph of the function

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:52.910
isn't just these point.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.326
It's actually any
of these points.

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:56.710
If I were to pick an
arbitrary x values in domain--

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.640
remember the x
values, the domain

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.640
here is x is greater than or
equal to 0, or any real number

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.210
greater than or equal to 0.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.620
So if I pick anything
on the x-axis that

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.640
is greater than or equal
to 0 that's in the domain,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.420
and then if I
evaluated its function,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.250
it should sit on that curve.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.770
It should sit on that
curve that I just drew.
