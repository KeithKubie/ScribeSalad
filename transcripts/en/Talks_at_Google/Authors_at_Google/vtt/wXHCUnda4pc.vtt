[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:08.205
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:09.330
VIRGINIA MILLER: All right.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.880
Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.450
It's good to see you all.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.510
We're going to talk today about
cocktails and about Robert's

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.480
new book, which covers an
exciting change in the last,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.470
actually, 20-plus years,
the Cocktail Renaissance,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.366
the Cocktail Revival.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.740
It goes by a few
different names,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.100
depending on who you talk to.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.110
But I thought we'd
start out by-- for those

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.910
who are aren't quite
sure what that means,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.640
what is the Cocktail Renaissance
of the recent decades?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.062
What is that exactly?

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:37.770
ROBERT SIMONSON: The
Cocktail Renaissance

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.760
has been this period
of time, which

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240
has happened intensely
over the last 15 years

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.650
and somewhat less intensely
over the last 30 years,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.130
where a group of bartenders sort
of reclaimed their profession,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.460
bringing it back from just
a paycheck job, a place

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.280
holder that you did while you
were waiting to do something

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.170
else, and turning
it back into what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.860
it had been in the late 19th
century and early 20th century,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.880
a respected member
of the community

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.030
that had a set of skills
and that everyone looked up

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.560
to, and along with
that, figuring out

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.670
how to make the drinks and
the cocktails correctly,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.270
how to make them with
quality products, with,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.650
say, fresh juice
instead of sour mix,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.790
with good spirits instead
of like bottom-shelf rotgut.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.090
And so it all kind
of came together.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.870
And it took a number of years,
but it finally got here.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.740
It was the last thing to
be brought back and revived

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.140
properly in terms of
culinary aspects in America.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
We went through the food
revolution and the beer

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.700
revolution and the
wine revolution,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.370
but eventually we
got to cocktails.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.840
And that is what the book
is about, how that happened,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.689
why that happened,
and who was involved.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.230
VIRGINIA MILLER: So why did you
decide to write this book now

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.560
at this particular time?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.699
ROBERT SIMONSON: I decided I
wanted-- well, I didn't decide.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.240
I wanted to write the
book four years ago,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.880
and I went to my publisher,
and after a little convincing,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.140
they said yes.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.460
I wanted to write it because
I didn't see anyone else

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.340
writing it.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.251
And I was afraid-- if you write
about liquor and cocktails,

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.750
and you particularly write from
an historical point of view,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.380
you learn a few
things very quickly.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.960
And one of the things is
that a lot of the history

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.230
wasn't written down.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.560
All the "cocktail
historians," and there

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.190
are five or six of them
in the whole world,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.130
they spent a lot of time
trying to figure out

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.770
where the cocktails came from,
the history of the bartender,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.260
and they had to go
dig in old newspapers

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.139
and old out-of-print books,
and it took a very long time

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.430
to piece together this history.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.340
It had all been lost.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.370
And I found it
intolerable that we

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.110
would lose what had happened
in the last 30 years

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.550
just because-- I mean,
it's thoroughly documented

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.830
in the internet age,
but that doesn't

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.010
mean that everybody put all
the pieces together in one book

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.270
or document so that
people would remember it.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.210
And as you can imagine,
history that is written in bars

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.980
gets forgotten, because
everyone's drinking.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.270
And I experienced that as I
interviewed the bartenders

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.530
for this book.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.530
Not everyone remembered
everything the same way.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.130
And I had to figure out-- it
was like Rashomon all the time,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.010
and it was like, OK,
what actually happened?

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.469
It's somewhere in
the middle there.

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.510
And I'm going to write it
down, and someone's not

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.010
going to be happy
with this account,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.600
but it's as close as I
can get to the truth.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.460
So that's why I
decided to do it.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.060
VIRGINIA MILLER: So if you had
to pinpoint a time and please,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.100
where and when would you say
the cocktail revival started?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.100
ROBERT SIMONSON: It's a
little difficult to say.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.870
And it's different
for every city.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.770
The book concentrates basically
on three cities, New York,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.470
San Francisco, and London, as
being the major cities that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.660
got the cocktail revival going.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.700
And in each city,
it began differently

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.130
and at different times.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.030
If you're talking
about New York,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.030
it really kind of
kicked off when

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.980
a man named Dale
de Groff was asked

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.249
to take charge of the cocktail
program in the Rainbow Room

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:19.790
when they reopened the Rainbow
Room at the top of Rockefeller

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.830
Center in 1987.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.420
He kind of worked in isolation
for a very long time.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.480
Some people were paying
attention to what he did,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.046
and a lot of people
wrote about it,

00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:33.610
but there wasn't another
important cocktail

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.140
bar in New York until Milk
and Honey, which some of you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.170
might have heard of, a very
famous bar in the Lower

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.400
East Side that kicked off
the whole Speakeasy thing.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.310
It came along in 2000.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.530
Here in San Francisco,
it's even more complicated.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.950
There were some early figures.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.540
There was a guy named
Tony Abou-Ganim, who

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.280
got his start at the Balboa
Cafe that some of you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.310
may have heard of.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.510
And then he was the head
bartender when they open

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.530
reopened the Starlight Room at
the top of the Francis Drake

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.460
Hotel.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.370
And the Starlight Room was
sort of like the Rainbow Room

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.030
here, right,
basically, isn't it?

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.880
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Yeah, upscale hotel.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.421
ROBERT SIMONSON: And they did
the same thing that the Rainbow

00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.822
Room did, is that they put
the bartender on a pedestal.

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:20.530
And they said, pay
attention to this guy.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.530
He knows what he's doing
as much as our chef does.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.170
So Tony Abou-Ganim was one
of the guys who got it going.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.330
And we're talking
in the late '90s.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.360
And then there was another
guy named Paul Harrington, who

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.470
worked at the
townhouse in Emeryville

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.550
and Enrico's when
it used to exist.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.170
And he was a real
cocktail scholar.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.360
All these people
without exception

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.400
would seek out the old books
that had gone out of print when

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.660
Prohibition came and then
he would comb through them

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.390
and try to figure out, well,
how do I make a Widow's Kiss

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.060
and how do I make
a Sidecar correctly

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.380
so that it tastes good?

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.900
He was in it a
relatively short period.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.600
He wanted to be an architect.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.290
And so by the mid '90s he had
left the profession completely.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.470
But he left his mark.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.550
They made mojitos like
crazy at Enrico's.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.820
And that doesn't sound so
exciting right now, but once

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.490
upon a time, a mojito
was a revelation,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.346
that you'd actually take
fresh vegetables and herbs

00:06:18.346 --> 00:06:19.970
and put them at the
bottom of the glass

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.130
and muddle them and create
these things one by one by one.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.230
And he got a lot of
attention, Paul Harrington,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:32.160
because the press liked to
hang out at Enrico's and drink.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.720
And in particular,
important to his career,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.770
was that the
journalists that went on

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.360
to create "Wired" magazine
used to hang out there.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.600
And so when they
started "Wired" and they

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.220
created the website for
"Wired," which I believe

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.280
was the first professional
website connected

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.970
to a publication, they asked
him to write a cocktail column

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:57.800
in it.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.350
It was called
"CocktailTime.com,"

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.850
and this started
in like '95 or '96.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.040
And this started a long
connection between the cocktail

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.490
revival and the rise
of the internet.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.930
These two are very
interconnected.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.032
Without the internet,
the cocktail revival

00:07:16.032 --> 00:07:16.990
wouldn't have happened.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.531
It wouldn't have
happened as quickly.

00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:19.620
Would you agree, Virginia?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.786
VIRGINIA MILLER: Absolutely.

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:23.230
Is so widespread now.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.690
Every state now you can
go and find amazing bars,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.390
and I think that's largely
to do with the internet.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.306
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah.

00:07:29.306 --> 00:07:31.970
One of the reasons why cocktail
bartending had stagnated

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.330
is because everybody was
working in isolation.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.934
Like if you're trying to make
a good Manhattan in Seattle,

00:07:36.934 --> 00:07:38.350
you don't know if
someone's having

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.430
that same problem in Atlanta.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.330
But once the
internet comes along,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.930
you get on the chat rooms,
you exchange recipes,

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.810
you exchange thoughts,
and a community develops.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.560
VIRGINIA MILLER: So in terms
of New York and London,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.100
you mentioned Dale de Groff, but
who were some other key figures

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.222
kind of in those early days that
really pushed things forward?

00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:01.430
ROBERT SIMONSON: In New York?

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.280
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Yeah, in New York,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.738
and then maybe we can talk
about London, too, a little bit,

00:08:04.738 --> 00:08:07.231
since it was so important.

00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:08.730
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Well, Dale de Groff

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.830
was an interesting figure.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.542
How many people have heard
the name Dale de Groff?

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:16.410
OK, see, bartenders aren't
famous the way chefs are.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.620
They just aren't.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.122
Dale de Groff is the most
famous bartender in the nation,

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:21.580
and he's not that
famous, you know?

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.770
That's just the way it is.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.370
He's been bartending
his whole life.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.310
He's 68.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.860
He's a very charismatic guy.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.440
He's a former actor.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.059
He used to bartend at
the Bel Air down in LA.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.190
And the thing
about Dale de Groff

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.880
is he seems to have never spent
a night at home in the past 40

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.940
years.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.650
And so all through
the book are stories

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.160
where young bartenders
trying to figure out

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.694
their lives and
their professions,

00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:48.110
and all of a sudden,
Dale de Groff

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.480
walks into their
bar out of the blue.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.819
And he goes, hey, how you doing?

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:53.110
I hear you're making cocktails.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.880
What can I tell you?

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.510
How can I help?

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.550
Here-- here's a book.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.480
And so this happened
again and again and again.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.010
And so he developed
proteges in this way.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.940
So his three major
proteges in New York

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.160
was a woman named Julie Reiner,
who actually is from Hawaii

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.610
and spent several years
bartending in San Francisco

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.300
before she moved to New York.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.420
She's a woman who started
a famous bar called

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.944
Flatiron Lounge and
one called Clover Club.

00:09:19.944 --> 00:09:21.610
There was another
woman from Long Island

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.607
named Audrey Saunders.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.070
She had a business
cleaning carpets

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.530
at offices and
celebrities' homes.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.680
And strangely enough,
she didn't like that job,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.180
and she wanted to
do something else.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.220
So she went to one of Dale
de Groff's classes and said,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.545
I'll work for you for free.

00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:42.920
I just want to do
something else.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.332
I love bartending.

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:46.040
And she did work for
free for many years,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.790
and then she opened a
bar called the Pegu Club.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.690
And then there was a New
Yorker named Sasha Petraske.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.620
He's the man who
founded Milk and Honey.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.012
And he was an
interesting fellow.

00:09:57.012 --> 00:09:58.345
He grew up in Greenwich Village.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.370
He grew up in a
communist household,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.860
so he had a very interesting
perspective on capitalism.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.290
And also during the weekends
he saw the bridge and tunnel

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.800
people come in and trash his
neighborhood every weekend,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.040
and he said, one day I'm
going to open a bar where

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.749
we don't have an effect
on the neighbors.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.706
And that's what he did.

00:10:17.706 --> 00:10:20.260
He created this secret bar, and
you had to know it was there.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.580
It had no address.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.900
You didn't know where it was.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.040
You had to text in order
to get a reservation,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.480
then he'd text back and
say it was OK to come.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.980
This of, course, made a
very notorious and catnip

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.190
for the media.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.760
So those were three
of the early figures.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.860
Here in San Francisco, there
was a man named Scott Beatty.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.797
There's a restaurant called
Cyrus up in Healdsville?

00:10:43.797 --> 00:10:44.963
VIRGINIA MILLER: Healdsburg.

00:10:44.963 --> 00:10:45.750
ROBERT SIMONSON: Healdsburg.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.960
VIRGINIA MILLER: It was, yeah.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.001
ROBERT SIMONSON: Any of
you guys ever been there?

00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:53.062
Anyway, for its time, it
was a famous restaurant

00:10:53.062 --> 00:10:54.770
along the lines of
French Laundry, right?

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.451
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah, fine
dining, tasting menus only,

00:10:57.451 --> 00:10:57.951
yeah.

00:10:57.951 --> 00:10:58.617
It was woderful.

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:01.020
ROBERT SIMONSON: He took
advantage of his surroundings.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.980
He figured, I'm in Napa
Valley, and everybody

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.050
has these wonderful
herbs and orange groves

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.810
and fruit groves and vegetables,
and I'm going to take all this

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.290
and just stuff it
into the glass.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.590
So his cocktails were
like works of art.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.020
They had like wheels of orange
and tufts of mint and tufts

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.960
of rosemary, and it
was like chartreuse

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.190
in a glass, every
single cocktail.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.810
So he was important, and he got
one of the first book deals.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.760
And then there was a guy named
Marco Dionysos, who actually

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.540
was from-- he wasn't
from Portland,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.080
but he made his
name in Portland.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.290
This was before Portland
was cool like it is today.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.130
And he was impatient, so he
came down to San Francisco,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.220
and he started the
cocktail program at a place

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.880
called Absinthe,
which still exists.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.670
That was the first really
important modern craft cocktail

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.490
program in San Francisco.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.260
It was 1997.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.480
Every drink on the
menu had a heritage.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.860
It had the date it was created,
who created it, what was in it.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.601
And that really turned a
corner in San Francisco.

00:12:03.601 --> 00:12:05.100
There's always been
a big difference

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.740
between the San Francisco
scene and the New York scene.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.790
As Camper English, a
journalist friend of ours,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:16.890
put it rather derogatorily,
the New York bartenders just

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.710
pour things out of
bottles, and that's

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.300
what they know how to
do, whereas you guys

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.970
use fresh produce
and know how it

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.670
changes from season to season,
week to week, to day to day.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.620
And that changes the
way you make cocktails.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.530
So it's all about freshness.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.690
That has changed a little
bit over the years.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.340
There's a kind of
a sameness now.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.760
Everyone makes
the same cocktails

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.513
wherever you go in America.

00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:40.846
But there's still a little
bit of that in San Francisco,

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:41.346
isn't there?

00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:42.262
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah.

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:43.880
We just have so
much accessibility,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.350
so we get spoiled that way.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.140
And I think there's more to
play with throughout the year.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.460
And it's like, what kind
of lemon are you using?

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.970
Is it Meyer?

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.470
Is it--?

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.000
We get down into those details,
where you don't see that

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.770
as much in other bars.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.270
They don't get quite as geeky
about every single detail.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.710
But it does happen.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.140
And there's very spiritus
bars here as well

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.260
that are just booze
out of a bottle as well

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.270
and focus that way.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.260
So it goes both ways.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.570
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yes,
including all the whisky bars.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.160
The whisky revival is part and
parcel with the whole cocktail

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.410
revival.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.640
The bourbon and rye
people saw what bartenders

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.920
were doing and said, oh, people
actually care about our spirits

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.420
now.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.540
And they want good bourbon,
and they want good rye,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.230
and they will use
it in cocktails.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.189
So it's kind of they walked
hand in hand into this.

00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:30.980
VIRGINIA MILLER: I
think that's maybe one--

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.200
not to detour too much,
but one interesting subject

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.950
is how it's changed
the spirits world as

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.990
well over the last
decade-plus, is there

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.450
are so many more distillers
now, dozens, hundreds more.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.059
And also the price of
spirits has gone up so much

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.350
for those of us that follow it.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.620
But I don't know if there's any
like whisky fans or collectors

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.400
or the rest here, but I think
that's one interesting change

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.830
that's happened that really
is due to the cocktail revival

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.720
as well in a large part.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.429
There's a greater
demand for all of this.

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:01.845
ROBERT SIMONSON:
And a lot of that

00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:03.420
started out here
on the West coast,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.420
a lot of those microdistillers.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.960
And when these
microdistillers got started,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.110
they really wanted
to get their products

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.270
in the hands of these
bartender influencers,

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.940
because they became influencers.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.260
The liquor companies started
going to the bartenders

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.185
and saying, what do you
think of my new product?

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:21.810
Do you like it?

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.440
Should I back to
the drawing board?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.220
Will you carry it?

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.310
Will you use it?

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.310
As opposed to like 25 years
ago, when they would say,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.140
I got a new product.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.330
You should carry it.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.992
And I'll buy you a television.

00:14:34.992 --> 00:14:38.139
[LAUGHING] And that's all they
cared about their opinion.

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:39.430
They didn't think much of them.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.824
So it's really
changed everything.

00:14:41.824 --> 00:14:42.740
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.860
And there's those key St.
George and Hubert Germain-Robin,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.730
or Germain-Robin
craft distillers now,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.530
but those, back since the
'80s here in the Bay Area,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.990
have been so important.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.990
ROBERT SIMONSON: Indeed.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.240
VIRGINIA MILLER: And there's
so much about seasonality

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.240
and local sourcing for
their gins and rest

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.470
as well, or the grapes
that Germain-Robin

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.180
are grown around the
vineyards in [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.130
So I feel like all this has
trickled into many areas,

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.824
but yeah, actually, that's one
thing I was thinking about.

00:15:11.824 --> 00:15:13.490
How would you say
this has trickled down

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.390
across the country?

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.223
Because of course, then
there's these cities

00:15:16.223 --> 00:15:20.190
we don't think of for cocktails,
like Tulsa or the rest,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:24.354
but we can go middle
America and find speakeasies

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:25.520
and these kinds of bars now.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.100
So how do you think
the rest of the country

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.360
specifically has been
affected by what has really

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.760
started on the coasts?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.830
ROBERT SIMONSON: Well,
like with a lot of things,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.640
the middle of America
looks to the coasts

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.610
to see what they're doing, and
they take their tips culturally

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.870
and culinarily from there.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.795
And so it would trickle.

00:15:43.795 --> 00:15:44.740
It's not trickle down.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.720
It's like trickle in, into
the rest of the country.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.580
And so after San
Francisco and New

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.920
York started getting their thing
going, then Chicago did and LA.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.800
And now you get the secondary
cities and the tertiary cities,

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.192
where you can find one or two
or three good cocktail bars.

00:16:02.192 --> 00:16:03.150
And it's kind of funny.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.520
They have to go through
the same growing pains.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.240
They start off rather
self-important and pretentious,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.870
just like New York
and San Francisco

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:11.860
were at the beginning.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.770
And then they eventually figure
out that doesn't work so well,

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.440
and then they get back
to the hospitality part.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.490
They just have to go
through the same baby steps

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.410
over and over again.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.284
I'm sure you've had
this experience going

00:16:22.284 --> 00:16:22.950
to other cities.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.330
And it's just like, oh, how this
feels like San Francisco five

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.966
years ago.

00:16:26.966 --> 00:16:27.392
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah.

00:16:27.392 --> 00:16:29.475
I'll say, oh, they just
got their first speakeasy.

00:16:29.475 --> 00:16:32.085
And it's a real snobby and
passwords and exclusive.

00:16:32.085 --> 00:16:33.460
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Yes, and they're

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.712
making a barrel-aged cocktail.

00:16:34.712 --> 00:16:36.670
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah,
or you think like Denver

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.400
with Sean Kenyon, who's a
major figure in the cocktail

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.000
world and a bar manager there.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.850
He had a speakeasy a few years
ago and took Denver by storm.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.110
And now I go back, and
he's opened the Occidental.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.650
And it's arcade games and
flat screens with sports.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.230
And they kind of go
through that phase

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.900
where, well, we were
snobby and fancy,

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.830
and now we're just over it.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.670
So you see that.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.211
But New York and San Francisco
have gone through those phases

00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:03.270
a few times over, I'd say.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.000
What are some specific
bars around the country

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.250
that have been really surprising
or unexpected for you?

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.000
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Surprising or unexpected?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.896
Hm.

00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:15.582
VIRGINIA MILLER: Stood out.

00:17:15.582 --> 00:17:17.790
ROBERT SIMONSON: I mean,
you have to go through time,

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.069
and like there was a time
where the so-called molecular

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.520
mixology bars were surprising
because they were doing

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.690
outlandish things with
flames and hydrogen.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:32.580
And like what's-- is there
a proponent in San Francisco

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.379
of that style?

00:17:33.379 --> 00:17:34.920
VIRGINIA MILLER:
There really wasn't.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.550
There was a couple people
that tried to start it,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.790
and it never really took.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.340
San Francisco didn't find
it quite real enough.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.035
I kind of wish it would have,
just as another element, but--

00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:43.951
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah.

00:17:43.951 --> 00:17:48.080
Has anyone ever been to a
place called Aviary in Chicago?

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.200
Yeah, there you go.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.060
So they go to great
lengths to make a cocktail.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.870
It's amazing.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.145
It's like every cocktail
is a science experiment.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.070
And those kind of bars
are good in their way.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.820
I mean, as long as
the drinks taste good,

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.830
who cares how they made them?

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.260
And surprise?

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.700
Well, and then cocktail bars,
it became such a big business

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.960
that they became
events, event bars.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.140
I mean, the interior
design was done

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.060
within an inch of its life,
and there was usually a theme.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.290
The epitome of this is this
bar in New York called the Dead

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.440
Rabbit Grog and Grocery.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.320
And they wanted to
create this bar that

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.680
was supposed to be like
1850s in New York City.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.650
And on the bottom
part it was like where

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.750
like the young immigrant
Irish toughs would drink,

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.530
and they'd have their
whisky and beer.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.910
And then if you were
like a bon vivant who

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.170
had like a diamond stickpin in
your tie, you'd go upstairs,

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.430
and you'd have the
fancy-dancy cocktails.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.340
And it's done very well.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.780
And it's quite an experience.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.620
And the cocktails are good.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.190
It does kind of feel like a
theme park every now and then.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.780
The same people have opened
a place called Blacktail

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.540
recently, which is supposed
to be like what a bar would be

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.920
in Havana during Prohibition.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.330
So there's always been
this big fantasy element.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.440
Because we're all
just trying to imagine

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.670
what drinking used to be.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.930
And that's why bartenders,
they couldn't help themselves.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.090
They get the vest.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.550
They get the mustache wax.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.030
Tattoos are modern.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.180
But anyway, they were
dressing the part.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.610
And it can seem foolish,
but you have to remember,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.750
it's just like dress the
part, be the part if you're

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.420
going to embrace this.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.600
And if you're going
to ask for respect,

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.590
it's like, I'm a
bartender, look at me,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.810
this is what a
bartender dresses like.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.830
They eventually are
stopping dressing like that,

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.940
but there's nothing
wrong with a bartender

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.975
looking spiffy behind the bar.

00:19:54.975 --> 00:19:56.350
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Well, and I find

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.670
there's a part of it
that, like you said,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.910
it gets a little silly,
and it's trendy for sure.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.430
But I've always been kind
of a retro, old-school girl,

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.450
and I think one thing I love
is that this crowd draws people

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.510
who really respect the past.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.400
There's a lot of geeks, and
they dig into their history.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.390
And so sometimes that
translates to dress.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.550
And they listen to a lot of
jazz, and they collect vinyl.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.120
And I find it attracts
that kind of person.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.203
ROBERT SIMONSON: Vinyl
does seem to be a big thing

00:20:21.203 --> 00:20:22.360
in the bartender world.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.120
VIRGINIA MILLER:
It's not a given,

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.780
but it does seem to
attract that crowd.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.200
ROBERT SIMONSON: Well, it's
all about authenticity.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.410
They're just chasing after that.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:38.930
So we were asked to talk about
how you can know whether you're

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.050
in a good bar or not,
just some ways like

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.970
if you walk into
these cocktail bars,

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.780
it can be a little intimidating.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.780
And that's a shame.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.170
It shouldn't be that at all.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.940
Remember, they're
there to serve you.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.220
They want you there.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.940
And they want you to
be happy and come back.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.020
But they look beautiful.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.540
The bartenders are
sometimes dressed very well.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.510
Everything about a bartender
is intimidating in a way.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:09.430
He's standing-- he's in
charge, or she's in charge.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.570
But there are also a lot
of charlatans out there

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.980
and a lot of wannabes and
people who are doing it wrong.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.580
And what's Wayne Curtis' phrase?

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.945
All mustache, no merit.

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:21.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:27.860
So what would be the first
thing-- you go to more bars

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.280
than I do, I think.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.030
Because you're just on the
road all the time, and you

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.710
see more cities.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.200
What's the first thing you
look for when you go in a bar?

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.085
How do you know you're
in the right place?

00:21:39.085 --> 00:21:40.460
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Well, I actually

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.250
check the websites ahead of
time and look at the menu.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.620
And I get frustrated if I
can't see an example of a menu,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.890
because I just want to look
for either a little originality

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.790
or a focus with a cocktail menu.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.240
If I start to feel like
it's all over the place

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.480
or looks like a copycat
of everything else,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.443
then I start to worry.

00:21:58.443 --> 00:21:59.810
ROBERT SIMONSON: That
they've pieced together

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.220
their menu from other people's
menus by looking on the web?

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.070
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Or a consultant,

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.236
which is a thing these days.

00:22:04.236 --> 00:22:06.150
Cocktail consultants
are a dime a dozen.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.670
And they come in
put together menus.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.870
And there's not really a bar
manager necessarily doing that.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.950
But when I walk
into the bar, I'm

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.100
looking-- I love both
dives and upscale bars,

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.377
so I actually look at the
spirits behind the bar.

00:22:19.377 --> 00:22:21.210
I look to see, is it a
thoughtful selection?

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.520
Do they have a nice mix
of small and big brands,

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.540
obscure spirits?

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.700
Or if they're focused on
Italian amaro, let's say,

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.310
is it just Fernet and
a couple big-- Cynar,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.320
or do they have a
broader range if they

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.007
claim to have that focus.

00:22:38.007 --> 00:22:39.840
So I kind of look for
those kinds of things.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.670
ROBERT SIMONSON: I
look at back bar,

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.977
too, although sometimes
it's a case of they've

00:22:42.977 --> 00:22:44.560
collected all the
right tools but they

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.596
don't know how to use them.

00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:46.846
VIRGINIA MILLER: That's right.

00:22:46.846 --> 00:22:49.590
ROBERT SIMONSON: So you
have to look out for that.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.330
I was talking with some
bartenders recently,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:23:00.110
and they were saying that
they thought the two most

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.340
important things in a bar--
it doesn't have anything to do

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.200
with the drinks or the menu.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.460
You walk in, and it's the
music and the lighting,

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.750
if the music seems
thoughtful and right

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.980
for the place, if it's not
too loud, that it actually

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.550
contributes and
doesn't take away

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.970
from the idea of conversation,
and if the lighting makes

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.830
the bar look attractive,
but more importantly makes

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.520
the people in the
bar look attractive.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.546
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:32.960
Then you know that they've
thought through everything.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.610
And then as we were
talking, we came up

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.690
with a third thing,
which is actually

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.300
as important-- temperature.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.216
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah!

00:23:39.216 --> 00:23:39.867
It's true.

00:23:39.867 --> 00:23:42.450
ROBERT SIMONSON: Who wants to
be in a hot bar or an incredibly

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:42.994
chilly bar?

00:23:42.994 --> 00:23:44.910
It's got to be the
perfect, right temperature.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.260
Because that puts you at ease.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.310
Why do you go into a bar?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.640
To relax at the end of a day.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.160
If the temperature is wrong,
you're not going to do that.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.634
So those are some
things I look for.

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:56.550
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.560
And service, right?

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.060
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Service, of course.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.770
VIRGINIA MILLER: This is
a whole big discussion.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.270
ROBERT SIMONSON:
You should be given

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.800
a greeting within-- how long?

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.090
30 seconds, I think.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:06.952
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Ideally right away.

00:24:06.952 --> 00:24:07.868
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah.

00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:08.520
You walk in.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.630
That bartender better see
you, and if they're busy,

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.560
just say, hello,
be right with you.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.545
If you're sitting at
the stool for like five

00:24:17.545 --> 00:24:19.170
minutes and nobody's
acknowledging you,

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.530
you already feel bad, and
they've already failed.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.330
And also not just the hello, but
you don't have your drink yet,

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.870
but cocktail napkin
right in front of you.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.830
Somebody put this really well.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.520
I forget who it was.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.620
That's your patch
of real estate.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.600
They've given you a piece
of land in their bar.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.360
It belongs to you.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.870
There's going to be a drink
on that cocktail napkin.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.440
And so you feel like
you're part of the bar.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.020
So there is that,
and glass of water.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.799
Bars where you keep
ordering drinks

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:51.590
and you still don't
get the glass of water,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.150
it's either one of two things.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.770
They are inattentive,
they're not doing their job,

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.066
or they're cheap.

00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:00.440
They don't want
to give you water

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.070
because they want you to
order only drinks that

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.904
actually cost money.

00:25:02.904 --> 00:25:04.403
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Or there's a crowd,

00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:05.810
which we do face in California.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.620
But still, you're supposed
to get it if you ask for it.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.794
ROBERT SIMONSON: If
you ask for it, OK.

00:25:10.794 --> 00:25:13.235
So do bars not do it out
of conscientiousness here?

00:25:13.235 --> 00:25:14.610
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Yeah, it's true.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.950
But you are supposed to ask
and then get it right away.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.530
So we've been going through
that the last year-plus.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.310
Yeah.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.170
ROBERT SIMONSON: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.760
Yes, they did ask
last night whether I

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.550
wanted a glass of water.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.180
VIRGINIA MILLER: So that's why.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.650
But yeah, I prefer it when
they ask me, actually,

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.030
because then I don't
have to think about it.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.540
ROBERT SIMONSON: As far
as the menu is concerned,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.450
when I go to a new bar and
I feel duty-bound to order

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.390
their original drinks because
that's the flag they've

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.320
put in the sand--
there's a certain way

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.170
that people read menus.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.080
And their eyes go to
the top left corner.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.800
And so find the drink there.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.210
That drink is
there for a reason.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.970
Either they're really proud
of it, they think it's good,

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.290
and you should drink it.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.680
Or they think it's going to
have a lot of public appeal

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.980
and a lot of people
are going to order it.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.880
It's a good way to get
a gauge on the place.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.674
OK, this is their badge.

00:26:12.674 --> 00:26:13.840
This is what they're saying.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.660
We serve this kind of thing.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.270
So I always start there.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.799
So that's a good tip.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:23.840
VIRGINIA MILLER: That's
one of my rules of thumb,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.360
too, because it's
like a restaurant.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.440
You're not going to go
to a Peruvian restaurant

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.382
and then ask for
something that's Mexican.

00:26:29.382 --> 00:26:31.090
So I kind of think
the same with the bar.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.950
It's like, well,
what's your specialty.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.060
It's like that's what
I want to focus on.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.480
But of course, I
drink everything,

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.460
so I guess if there's
something you hate,

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.850
you want to outline
that to them.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.457
But I think it's a
good question to ask.

00:26:44.457 --> 00:26:46.540
ROBERT SIMONSON: It's a
good idea to read the bar.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.350
Not every bar is right
for the same thing.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.250
So if you go into a
sports bar and they've

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.720
got the latest game
on and you go up

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.739
and you order, what, a Sidecar?

00:26:59.739 --> 00:27:01.155
VIRGINIA MILLER:
A Ramos Gin Fizz?

00:27:01.155 --> 00:27:03.110
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yes, or a
Ramos Gin Fizz, you're an idiot.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.330
You're gonna have a bad time.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.032
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:05.032 --> 00:27:06.990
They're going to make
you a bad Ramos Gin Fizz,

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.390
they're going to hate you
because you asked for a Ramos

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.224
Gin Fizz when you
walked into a sports bar

00:27:11.224 --> 00:27:12.390
and instead of getting beer.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.160
So just get a beer.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.889
But if you go into
a cocktail bar,

00:27:15.889 --> 00:27:17.680
and they're obviously
proud, and it's like,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.320
we make cocktails well,
then you order a cocktail.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.090
VIRGINIA MILLER: Then you
ask for a vodka tonic.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.256
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah, you
can ask for a vodka-- no,

00:27:23.256 --> 00:27:27.330
they should make you the vodka
tonic, and they should smile.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.620
But why not take advantage
of what the bar is?

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:34.625
It's like not every bar is for
every occasion or every mood.

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:35.875
VIRGINIA MILLER: That's right.

00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:38.350
ROBERT SIMONSON: So, yes.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.310
So it's somewhat
up to you as well

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.890
if you're going to have
a good time in your bar.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.940
VIRGINIA MILLER: And we
have a few more minutes

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.370
before we'll take questions.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.600
But maybe getting into some
specifics with San Francisco,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.040
lets talk a few specific bars.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.979
What do you think in terms
of iconic or longtime bars?

00:27:56.979 --> 00:27:59.437
What are ones that have made
a real impression on you here?

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.380
ROBERT SIMONSON: The
important cocktail bars,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.300
for some reason they have tended
not to stick around as much

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.690
here.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.230
Bar Agricole is a restaurant,
but it's an important bar.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.530
It's run by a guy
named Thad Vogler, who

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.990
also owns Trou Normand.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.550
He's a very opinionated,
very principled guy.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.990
He only carries
liquors and spirits

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:28.180
that he approves of, not just
taste-wise but ethically,

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.519
the way it's made and
where it comes from.

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:32.060
And so when you look
at his back bar,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.790
there aren't many
bottles back there,

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.620
and you probably don't
know any of them.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.670
I mean, he says, if it's a big
brand and it's well advertised,

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.835
chances are it's probably bad.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.540
And he has his own
way of doing things.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.070
So I think he sets up a really
interesting example, one

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:57.270
that I don't think many follow,
because it's too difficult.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.240
Trick Dog is an important
bar that our friend over here

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.680
has discovered by
accident and found

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.050
that every drink she ordered
was excellent, correct?

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.440
That's by a group called
the Bon Vivants, which

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.340
is made of three gentlemen.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:12.935
Is that right?

00:29:12.935 --> 00:29:13.965
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah,
it started that way.

00:29:13.965 --> 00:29:16.480
And now they've got a whole
staff around the country.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.560
But all San Francisco guys
started it originally.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.060
ROBERT SIMONSON:
It's a good example

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.050
of a bar that has tried to
do things very well, very

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.840
exquisitely, but putting
on no airs, no pretension.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.160
It just feels like a bar
when you go in there.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.150
You just can get
really great drinks.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.570
And they also have
these thematic menus

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.030
that they bring out with a lot
of fanfare every six months.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.002
The current one is based on
politics, presidential politics

00:29:41.002 --> 00:29:41.960
or something like that.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.240
VIRGINIA MILLER: Right.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.639
I haven't seen this one yet,
but yeah, the past ones--

00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:46.680
ROBERT SIMONSON: They've
had based on the Zodiac.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.570
They had a menu that
looked like a Chinese--

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.028
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Chinese food menu.

00:29:50.028 --> 00:29:51.720
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Chinese food menu.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.970
VIRGINIA MILLER: Dog calendar.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.386
ROBERT SIMONSON:
The first one was

00:29:54.386 --> 00:29:57.680
based on a Pantone paint wheel.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.581
And each cocktail was named
after one of the weird colors

00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:01.080
that the--

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:01.435
VIRGINIA MILLER:
You got a swatch

00:30:01.435 --> 00:30:04.740
when you got in the bar with
your drink on each-- yeah.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.377
ROBERT SIMONSON: So I think
they've been influential,

00:30:08.377 --> 00:30:10.210
not just in terms of
the way they do things,

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.000
but also they've got
a lot of attention.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.130
They're kind of a good blueprint
on how you become a nationally

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.502
famous bar in a city.

00:30:18.502 --> 00:30:20.960
VIRGINIA MILLER: But I think
one thing with the Bon Vivants

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.020
is they've been very
humanitarian focused

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.560
or giving-back focused as well.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.476
So they've gotten a lot
of attention for that.

00:30:27.476 --> 00:30:29.922
They've thrown these Pig and
Punch, now Swig and Swine--

00:30:29.922 --> 00:30:32.130
ROBERT SIMONSON: Swig and
Swine, Pig and Punch, yeah.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.643
So they do charitable events.

00:30:33.643 --> 00:30:35.600
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah, that
they're famous for as well.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.016
ROBERT SIMONSON:
They're festivals

00:30:37.016 --> 00:30:40.160
that I have roast pig
and punch, lots of punch.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.790
And historically speaking, there
is a restaurant in Richmond

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.112
called Tommy's
Mexican Restaurant.

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:48.370
AUDIENCE: [WHISTLING] Who

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.096
ROBERT SIMONSON: Whistled?

00:30:49.096 --> 00:30:49.637
AUDIENCE: Me!

00:30:49.637 --> 00:30:51.900
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yay!

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.690
If you want to know
why you're able to get

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.550
better tequila or better
mezcal these days,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.510
that restaurant is a
big part of the answer.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.170
The owner, Julio Bermejo,
started making his margaritas

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:13.940
with 100% agave tequila instead
of like crappy tequila back

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.590
in the early '90s.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:21.040
And he got rid of the triple
sec because he wanted people

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.840
to taste the tequila and
not taste anything else.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.460
And that became the
Tommy's Margarita.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:29.230
And the Tommy's Margarita is
served all over the nation.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.930
So he became an
evangelist for tequila,

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.400
which back in the '80s and
'90s was thought of as,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.322
I don't know, like a bad
choice, the kind of choice

00:31:41.322 --> 00:31:43.530
you made late at night, and
you drank too much of it,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.540
and you felt bad in the morning,
and you never drank it again.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:52.230
It was a dangerous spirit
that college students drank.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.900
But now it's become respected,
and people sip a tequila,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.000
and they talk about it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.500
And they even drink
mezcal, and they

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.630
know that it doesn't
have to have a worm in it

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.970
and kind of thing.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.670
So if you haven't been, go.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:09.160
It's mediocre Mexican food, but
you can get a Tommy's Margarita

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.490
made at Tommy's.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.840
And they have the best selection
of tequila in the city,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.500
don't they?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.583
VIRGINIA MILLER: Oh, yeah.

00:32:16.583 --> 00:32:18.457
It's over 300 was the
last count I heard.

00:32:18.457 --> 00:32:19.790
But I think it's more than that.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.370
And they have a lot of
things under the shelf

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.620
that are no longer being made.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.559
So if you just ask for the
special off-the-rack stuff

00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:29.600
for the things you can't
see from behind the bar,

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.492
they can offer you some
very special tequilas.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:34.450
ROBERT SIMONSON: San
Francisco is a cool place,

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.360
because unlike New
York, you never

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.020
really forgot cocktail culture.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.770
It was on a low flame,
but it kept burning

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.940
through the '70s and '80s.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.856
There were places, if
you wanted to find them,

00:32:44.856 --> 00:32:46.630
that made good cocktails.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.340
And there are places
like the Buena

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.440
Vista is famous for one
cocktail, the Irish Coffee.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.770
And so it held onto
it a little bit.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.390
And there's always
been a big history

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:02.230
here with spirits from
Latin America, like tequila.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.280
And also because of
the Italian population,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.350
people have always
drunk Negronis here

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.410
and things like that.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:14.024
So it's a special place
bar-wise and drinking-wise.

00:33:14.024 --> 00:33:14.940
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.720
And there are bars like
Zam Zam that have been

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.920
going strong since the '40s.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.540
ROBERT SIMONSON: I
haven't been there yet.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.000
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Oh, my goodness.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.630
You should go.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.430
It's very special.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.980
Has anyone else been to Zam Zam?

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.480
Yes?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.930
OK, great.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.150
ROBERT SIMONSON: And
like the Tonga Room--

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:24.950
that's an old tiki place.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.325
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Yeah, Tonga Room

00:33:26.325 --> 00:33:28.420
was designed by a Hollywood
guy back in the '40s,

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.225
and it looks like a movie set.

00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:31.350
It's pretty understandable.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.744
ROBERT SIMONSON: Is
that Steve Crane place?

00:33:33.744 --> 00:33:34.700
VIRGINIA MILLER: No.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.990
Well, it's a hotel.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.640
It's a pretty hotel
kind of situation.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.580
So the drinks aren't-- they had
a revamp a couple years ago.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.710
Don Ronan helped them, consulted
with the Fairmont Hotels.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.630
But it's not the best drinks,
and they're expensive,

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.289
but he improved
them quite a bit.

00:33:49.289 --> 00:33:50.580
But the space is one of a kind.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.000
They say it's the last in the
country left of those great,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.130
expansive-- it's got a pool in
the middle where a boat floats

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.314
back and forth with a band
on it and plays yacht rock.

00:34:00.314 --> 00:34:02.500
[LAUGHING] And it
looks like you've

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.407
stepped into a tiki movie set.

00:34:04.407 --> 00:34:06.240
I guess that's one other
aside, because that

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.170
has some strong ties
locally, but the tiki revival

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.139
has kind of brought-- rum has
been the latest craze, I'd say,

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.014
the last two, three
years around the country?

00:34:14.014 --> 00:34:15.430
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Yeah, tiki drinks

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.420
are one of the last
category of cocktails

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.989
to be brought back,
because they had been

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.620
in eclipse for many decades.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.659
And people, even
bartenders, mixologists,

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.900
tended to think of them as
silly, sugary, rummy drinks

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.500
with umbrellas in them.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.376
And we're trying to get
people to respect us,

00:34:31.376 --> 00:34:33.374
and they're not gonna
respect us if we give them

00:34:33.374 --> 00:34:34.800
a drink with an umbrella in it.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.100
But there was a historian
named Geoff Berry who

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.790
did the research and
got the original recipes

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.840
for all these old tiki
drinks like the Mai Tai

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.380
and the Zombie and
the Pain Killer.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.050
And once he got the
real raw material,

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.560
everyone started to see,
oh, yes, these were actually

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.510
once well-crafted drinks.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:02.195
They weren't crap made with sour
mix and bad rum and Bacardi.

00:35:02.195 --> 00:35:03.170
Sorry, Bacardi.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.960
VIRGINIA MILLER: [LAUGHING]

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.380
ROBERT SIMONSON: And the
greatest, shining example

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.560
of the tiki revival
here in town, Smuggler's

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:18.220
Cove-- you will see it
in all its glory there.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.600
And I believe there's another
tiki bar, opened recently

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.790
by the Future Bars?

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.547
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yes,
that's Pagan Idol.

00:35:25.547 --> 00:35:27.130
That one is in the
financial district.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.000
And it's a crazy
environment, too.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.490
It's got pyrotechnic kind
of lights and a volcano

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.240
in the back, and the front
area looks like a ship,

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.950
the hull of a ship.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.182
It's pretty fun in there.

00:35:39.182 --> 00:35:40.140
ROBERT SIMONSON: It is.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.130
It is.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:46.400
And also, I mean, I think
now it's kind of turned over

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.270
on its head.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.400
The cocktail revival
owes a lot to tiki.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.360
People have been going
crazy with garnishes lately.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.550
Like the creativity has
gone from inside the glass

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.820
to outside the glass.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.000
And that's totally
taken from tiki.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.040
And also, with all
these thematic bars

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.470
like Dead Rabbit and Black
Tail, it's a fantasy world,

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.290
and tiki was always about that.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.620
You walk in, and it's like
you're not in San Francisco

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.120
anymore.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.640
You're on some Pacific isle.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.650
So that's that.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.170
VIRGINIA MILLER:
And I was going say,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.460
historically, actually,
talking about tiki,

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.760
the roots are from
California, both here

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.980
and Don the Beachcomber.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.396
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Los Angeles, yes.

00:36:24.396 --> 00:36:26.387
Yes, San Francisco,
home of Trader Vic's.

00:36:26.387 --> 00:36:28.220
VIRGINIA MILLER: Is
everyone familiar with--

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.270
ROBERT SIMONSON: Anyone ever
been to the Trader Vic's

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.600
in Emeryville?

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.500
Any good?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.500
Should I visit?

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.220
Yes?

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:33.720
OK.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.011
VIRGINIA MILLER: It's historic.

00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:37.540
I guess this is disputed,
but supposedly the invention

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.770
of the Mai Tai was Trader Vic's.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:40.560
ROBERT SIMONSON: That's
not disputed, no.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:40.940
It's his.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.950
VIRGINIA MILLER: It's a
style of Mai Tai, right?

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:43.880
Some people claim to--

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.630
ROBERT SIMONSON: Well,
Don the Beachcomber

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.340
claimed that Trader
Vic's stole it from him,

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.250
but most historians
side with Trader Vic.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.670
Mai Tai is his.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.310
It's his.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.851
VIRGINIA MILLER:
It's Bay Area, yeah.

00:36:54.851 --> 00:36:55.764
ROBERT SIMONSON: OK.

00:36:55.764 --> 00:36:57.180
So why don't we
open to questions?

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.170
Anybody have any
questions about anything?

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.070
AUDIENCE: So everything is craft
now, craft this, craft that.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.690
What about these
things like tonic

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.106
and these other categories
that people are going craft in?

00:37:08.106 --> 00:37:10.170
Is that really like
elevating drinks?

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:15.360
Or have we gone too far,
sort of down the craft road?

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.590
ROBERT SIMONSON: Well,
taking tonic as an example,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:19.940
I'd say yes.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.820
I know people get annoyed
by the craft term now.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.780
It just means that they're
taking a little care

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.660
to make it, as opposed to
some assembly-line process.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.570
The tonic water
that we were using

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:37.750
from Canada Dry or Schweppes, it
didn't have any quinine in it.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.360
And it was very sweet.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.030
If you've ever been
to London and had

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.700
the tonic water over there,
it's more dry and bitter.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.742
So have you had like a gin and
tonic with like store bought

00:37:49.742 --> 00:37:51.200
and then one of
the fancier brands?

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:51.890
AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.360
ROBERT SIMONSON: Compare
them side by side

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.155
and see what you think.

00:37:54.155 --> 00:37:55.370
AUDIENCE: What do you think?

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.340
ROBERT SIMONSON: I think one
with like-- there's Q Tonic,

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.440
there's Fever Tree tonic.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.900
There are actually quite
a few at this point.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.120
And you do have to pay a little
extra for it, because they

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.530
are small businesses.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.990
I won't drink a gin and tonic
with like Canada Dry anymore.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.140
It doesn't taste good.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.600
I mean, it just taste sort
of like a little sweet, kind

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.770
of soda-y beverage.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.770
In some cases, though, the craft
thing always goes overboard.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.310
I'm not exactly sure whether
we need craft simple syrup.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.390
You know, simple syrup
is sugar and water.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.820
I can make some right here.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.410
And it tastes as good as
anything you buy on the shelf.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:39.860
So--

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.352
AUDIENCE: Bit, I mean, if
you're using craft sugar--

00:38:42.352 --> 00:38:44.136
ROBERT SIMONSON: Aha.

00:38:44.136 --> 00:38:45.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.792
But simple syrup goes
inside a cocktail.

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.750
And once it gets in there,
are you really going

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.310
to notice that taste anymore?

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.250
It's sort of like the
vodka in a Cosmopolitan.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.040
You can use Belvedere,
Gray Goose, whatever

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.540
you want to use, Smirnoff.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.700
Once it's in the cocktail,
you lose all those nuances.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.660
It's just vodka.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.439
AUDIENCE: The top-left
menu thing was cool.

00:39:07.439 --> 00:39:08.980
Do you have any
other tips and tricks

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.900
to navigating cocktail menus?

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.874
Like I always feel like I
sort of like everything,

00:39:13.874 --> 00:39:16.040
and so I look at a menu,
and I'm like, I don't know.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.355
I have no idea how to
figure out what to order.

00:39:19.355 --> 00:39:20.730
ROBERT SIMONSON:
The menus can be

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.730
pretty large and intimidating.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.360
Do you have a general
idea of the kind

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.526
of things you like to drink?

00:39:26.526 --> 00:39:28.155
Or do you like to
drink most things?

00:39:28.155 --> 00:39:29.125
AUDIENCE: That's what
bartenders always ask.

00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:29.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.560
ROBERT SIMONSON: Well, yeah, no.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.250
That's true.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.500
They're trying to be
helpful, but I, too,

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.420
get annoyed by that question.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.150
It's like, what
do you recommend?

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.640
And they throw it
right back at you.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.170
Well, what do you like to drink?

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.820
And it's like-- and
I always tell them

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.210
I like to drink
everything, because I do.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:48.800
And I really just want to know
what they think they make well.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.790
But they're not going
to tell you that.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.920
I wish they'd be more
honest, like, you know,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.440
I really like this drink.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.860
I think it's spectacular.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.080
We do this well.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.190
I guess you just have to
throw it back in their lap.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.420
But they also do
hate that question.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.590
Don't ask them,
what do you drink?

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.890
They hate that question.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.194
How do you crack that nut?

00:40:13.194 --> 00:40:14.110
VIRGINIA MILLER: I do.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.050
I push it back on them.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.180
I don't ask them
what they drink,

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.263
because they do hate that.

00:40:17.263 --> 00:40:19.606
But I'll say, what
do you think's

00:40:19.606 --> 00:40:21.230
really exciting on
your menu right now?

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.300
Or sometimes even, what is the
most popular drink on your menu

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:24.800
right now?

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.060
So I can see what
everyone's ordering if it's

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.380
my first time at the bar.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.800
But that's not always the most
interesting to me, either.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.520
What's popular might
be the vodka drink,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.480
and I don't want that.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.750
But I ask those questions,
and I'll kind of

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.880
dig a little deeper.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.640
Or if they force me
to, I'll pick a mood

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.030
and go, well, you
know, something bitter

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.080
sounds great right now.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.999
And then we narrow
it down to a couple.

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:47.040
ROBERT SIMONSON: If you
give the bartender a sign

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.748
that you're inquisitive
and you're really

00:40:48.748 --> 00:40:52.230
thinking about your
order, then choose

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.210
a couple drinks on the menu
that are intriguing to you

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.040
and ask about a specific
ingredient in them.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.240
And then the bartender says,
OK, we've got a thinker.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.170
All right, we're going to have
a little conversation here.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.010
And you'll learn more,
and pretty quickly,

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.770
I'd say probably
within a minute,

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.515
you'll be able to decide where
you want to go with your order.

00:41:11.515 --> 00:41:13.890
AUDIENCE: What do you think
are the most important things

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:15.575
to have stocked
in your home bar?

00:41:15.575 --> 00:41:16.950
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Important things

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.845
to have stocked in our home bar?

00:41:18.845 --> 00:41:20.314
AUDIENCE: In like
my own home bar.

00:41:20.314 --> 00:41:21.730
ROBERT SIMONSON:
In your home bar.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.186
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:22.186 --> 00:41:22.685
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:22.685 --> 00:41:25.440
Which, just so you
know, is very minimal.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.630
But like in like your
own personal collection

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:29.390
if you're trying--

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.389
ROBERT SIMONSON: Do you
like to drink cocktails?

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:33.056
AUDIENCE: I am learning
more about them.

00:41:33.056 --> 00:41:34.055
ROBERT SIMONSON: Uh-huh.

00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:34.770
Uh-huh.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.860
AUDIENCE: Which is why
this has been helpful.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.300
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Well, I guess you

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.760
start with the things
you like to drink.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.670
So, say, if you like
Martinis, then you

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.100
want to get some gin and some
vermouth in your back bar.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:55.490
I mean, it's just--
you sort of should

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.450
start in a small, narrow place.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.140
Like if suddenly you just
decide, I'm a Negroni girl,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.797
I'm mad about
Negronis, so you're

00:42:04.797 --> 00:42:06.630
going to want the gin
and the sweet vermouth

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.560
and the Campari
there all the time.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.020
And then eventually, probably
you'll get enough Negronis.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.330
Let's see what else I like.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.890
And as you drink new drinks,
you say, I like those,

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.185
so let's all have those.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.564
What do you think?

00:42:23.564 --> 00:42:24.980
VIRGINIA MILLER:
I think sometimes

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.700
if you want a
little variety, too,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.700
there's this simple-- like
limes are kind of genius

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.444
for a few key cocktails.

00:42:31.444 --> 00:42:33.610
So it's like let's say you
have a bottle of tequila,

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.020
a bottle of gin,
and a bottle of rum.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.740
You got some limes, and you
make some simple syrup, which

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.610
I make and keep in my fridge.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.820
Then I can make a
gimlet with the gin.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.470
I can make a classic
daiquiri with the rum,

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.900
and I can make a Margarita
with the tequila.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.950
And I've basically just
got lime, simple syrup,

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.130
and three bottles of spirits.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.890
And then those each--
they're all citrusy,

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.606
so you got a
problem there if you

00:42:58.606 --> 00:42:59.980
want something
more booze-forward

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.580
if your mood changes.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.420
But those all three
tastes very different,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.461
depending on what spirit
you have, and yet you've

00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:08.105
still kept it kind of simple
and your tools are the same.

00:43:08.105 --> 00:43:09.730
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Yeah, that's one thing

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.146
that people forget as they're
like shopping for their home

00:43:12.146 --> 00:43:12.666
bar.

00:43:12.666 --> 00:43:14.290
Most of the classic
cocktails out there

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.730
are sours, meaning they
have citrus in them.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.392
So like when I go
home on a Friday,

00:43:20.392 --> 00:43:22.100
I make sure to stop
by the grocery store,

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.760
and I get an orange,
I get a couple lemons,

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.010
and I get a couple limes.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.200
I don't know what I'm going
to have when I get home,

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.211
but I'm going to be
mad if I suddenly

00:43:30.211 --> 00:43:32.710
decide that I want to daiquiri
and I didn't get any freaking

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.396
limes.

00:43:33.396 --> 00:43:36.140
And I can't make the
daiquiri without the limes.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.290
So you need the produce as well.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:43.710
So like you'll need mint if
you suddenly want mint juleps.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.710
And the same with a lot
of other drinks, too.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.760
And make sure you
have sugar on hand.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.970
I don't know who runs out
of sugar, but make sure

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.620
you have sugar on hand.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.310
And well, you definitely need
a bottle of angostura bitters,

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:01.310
or else you're pretty
much out of business.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.049
It goes into too many things.

00:44:03.049 --> 00:44:04.882
VIRGINIA MILLER: Or
good tonics for easy gin

00:44:04.882 --> 00:44:07.209
and tonics or things
like that, vodka tonics.

00:44:07.209 --> 00:44:08.000
That's always easy.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.860
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.020
And if you like whisky or if you
have friends who like whisky,

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.420
a carefully chosen
nice bottle of bourbon

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.980
and a bottle of scotch,
which you don't need to mix.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.075
Just pour it out, and
everybody's happy.

00:44:24.075 --> 00:44:25.450
AUDIENCE: I usually
like to drink

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:29.480
stuff that's pretty classical
cocktails, like Old Fashioneds

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.290
or something like that.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:36.030
If I'm going someplace, and so
it will be typically off menu,

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.000
would that be considered
like hazardous,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.700
given that it's not actually
like listed on the menu?

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.210
Or would I expect most bars to
be able to do classical things?

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.090
ROBERT SIMONSON: You're
ordering an Old Fashioned

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.300
or a Manhattan or something?

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:46.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:47.080
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Yeah, they usually

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.950
don't bother-- a
lot of places don't

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:52.430
bother to put it on the menu
because it's so well known.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.430
If you are very particular
about those drinks

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:59.240
and you like them a certain
way and not another way,

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.461
there's no problem asking
the bartender, saying,

00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:03.960
I'm thinking about
an Old Fashioned.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.430
How do you make it here?

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.160
They'll happily tell you
exactly how they make it,

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.480
and then you'll know, OK,
I want that drink, no,

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.860
I don't want that drink.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.670
AUDIENCE: That's really helpful,
because I usually go someplace,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.690
and I get it, and
it's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:20.380
ROBERT SIMONSON:
And these days, they

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.520
take that drink very
seriously, but everyone

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.700
makes it slightly different.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.570
VIRGINIA MILLER: That's true.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.986
ROBERT SIMONSON: Different
bitters, a different sweetener.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.059
It's OK to ask, like,
what bourbon do you

00:45:31.059 --> 00:45:32.350
use in your Old Fashioned here?

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.204
What's your house bourbon?

00:45:34.204 --> 00:45:36.120
They don't mind answering
questions like that.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.210
They like it.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.084
AUDIENCE: They have it
on tap in some places,

00:45:39.084 --> 00:45:40.840
too, which is amazing.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.710
ROBERT SIMONSON: They do, yeah.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:43.700
I see that a lot.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.658
I was just in Cincinnati,
and there was a place

00:45:45.658 --> 00:45:46.891
that had Old Fashions on tap.

00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:48.640
That's because people
order them too fast.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.969
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:52.010
AUDIENCE: I'm just going
to ask a quick question,

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.200
then give it to you.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.210
Again, I'm not cool.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.280
I was the last person
to discover Trick Dog,

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.190
so take this with
a grain of salt.

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.820
But I've noticed something
on menus recently,

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.830
which is shrubs,
and sort of very

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:05.970
like, our shrub is
made with artisanal,

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.610
organic blah-blah-blah.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:10.880
So just maybe you could talk
a little bit about shrubs.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.330
VIRGINIA MILLER: Well,
vinegar-based, as well as-- it

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.554
could go a couple directions.

00:46:15.554 --> 00:46:17.470
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah,
mainly vinegar, though.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.790
VIRGINIA MILLER: Mainly
vinegar, though, and--

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:19.850
ROBERT SIMONSON: Vinegar,
fruit, and sugar.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:20.910
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah,
vinegar, fruit, and sugar.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:21.410
Exactly.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.570
And what I find, what
I love about them,

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:27.390
is it often gives a real bracing
kind of backbone to a drink.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.090
So even if you're getting
something tall and refreshing,

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.590
it will add this nice-- if they
do it right and it's balanced,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.070
it will add this kind of
oomph to it with the vinegar.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.890
But some, you get
them, and it tastes

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.340
like you're drinking
kombucha or all vinegar.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.690
And then others, you can't
taste the vinegar at all,

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.800
and then I say, why
I call it a shrub?

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.771
But it's actually a historic
thing that goes back to 1800s.

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:49.520
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah,
at least 200 years.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:49.760
VIRGINIA MILLER: At least.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.030
ROBERT SIMONSON: This is how
people-- they had their fruit.

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.321
They don't have a refrigerator.

00:46:53.321 --> 00:46:54.292
How do you preserve it?

00:46:54.292 --> 00:46:56.920
You throw it in some
vinegar with some sugar,

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.690
and then in the spring,
they just drink it.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:04.310
And it's usually used as a
replacement for another acid.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.680
So if you don't have citrus
in your cocktail performing

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.150
the acidic role, a
shrub will do that.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:13.290
And bartenders
rediscovered shrubs

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.450
about six or seven years ago.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.186
And some make a
specialty out of it.

00:47:18.186 --> 00:47:20.570
VIRGINIA MILLER: And it's a
way that maybe summer fruit

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.400
can last a little longer.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.540
I'm still seeing strawberry
shrubs and things

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.790
like that on menus right
now, even though they've just

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.170
gone out of season.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.080
It preserves it a
few weeks longer.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.506
ROBERT SIMONSON: But if you see
something with a shrub in it

00:47:31.506 --> 00:47:34.000
on the menu, make sure you
like something that gives you

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.420
a little pucker, kind of mm.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.295
An old cocktail?

00:47:37.295 --> 00:47:37.919
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:44.690
ROBERT SIMONSON: Most of the
big classics have come back.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:50.380
There's a wonderful old cocktail
from like the '10s or '20s

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.580
that I always like
called Cameron's Kick.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.640
It's got orgeat in it,
which is an almond syrup.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.960
It's got lemon juice and
I believe a combination

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.980
of bourbon and scotch.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.876
Is that right?

00:48:04.876 --> 00:48:06.860
VIRGINIA MILLER: That
sounds right, yeah.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.270
ROBERT SIMONSON:
And it seems-- it's

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.610
an odd duck, because
it's a whisky sour

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.710
but with orgeat slipped
in, which is something

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.145
you associate with tiki drinks.

00:48:17.145 --> 00:48:19.270
And I know a lot of bartenders
who like this drink.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.710
And you see it pop up
every now and then.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:24.180
The problem was it was
never really a classic.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.950
It's just a minor drink.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.570
But minor drinks from
the past have come back,

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.790
like the Jungle Bird, a
completely obscure tiki drink

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.520
that is all over the place now.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.910
So that's one I'd like to see.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.876
What would you like to see
come back there, Virginia?

00:48:39.876 --> 00:48:41.126
VIRGINIA MILLER: Oh, goodness.

00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:43.490
Well, I'd have to think
about this for a minute.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:47.170
But I was going to say, one
thing, a modern classic,

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.140
that I loved in the last
section of your book--

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.680
at the end of his book,
there's a section on cocktails

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.200
that you think maybe did deserve
a little more recognition.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:54.555
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Yeah, that I had

00:48:54.555 --> 00:48:56.460
hoped that would become
modern classics, yes.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.390
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah, and one
is Owen Westman's Laphroaig

00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.890
Project.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.599
And I remember that
at Bourbon and Branch

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:04.014
when it first opened when Owen
was still bartending there.

00:49:04.014 --> 00:49:06.385
And I used to get that one
all the time, and I loved it.

00:49:06.385 --> 00:49:08.760
ROBERT SIMONSON: It was like
a sensation for a nanosecond

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.620
in San Francisco.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.670
For a year, everyone was
drinking the Laphroaig Project,

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:16.600
which is a little
Laphroaig, peaty whisky.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.040
It's got yellow chartreuse,
green chartreuse, lemon juice

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:20.810
or lime juice?

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.100
VIRGINIA MILLER: I
think it's lemon.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.270
ROBERT SIMONSON: It's
in the back of the book.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.060
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah,
it's in the book.

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.470
ROBERT SIMONSON:
Delicious drink.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.350
Expensive drink.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:31.240
You need expensive
stuff like the Laphroaig

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.110
and the chartreuse.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.470
And the chartreuse is like
gonna set you back $150

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.930
just to make the drink.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.450
And that's why you don't
see it on menus anymore.

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:40.936
But it is really,
really delicious.

00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:43.310
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah, I love
that you included that one,

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:45.830
because that's one I miss.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:46.730
Penicillin Time, too.

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:48.350
I kind of thought I
liked it almost as much.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.720
ROBERT SIMONSON: Yeah, the
who made it is Australian.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.650
He worked at Bourbon
and Branch for a while.

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.120
But he got homesick and
went back to Melbourne.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.040
And he took the drink with him.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.117
I guess they drink it
a lot in Melbourne now.

00:49:58.117 --> 00:50:00.740
AUDIENCE: What legal
[INAUDIBLE] still exists?

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.780
ROBERT SIMONSON: There
were a lot for a while.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.800
Prohibition left a nasty residue
all over the legal system

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.190
in this country, weird
laws, not just things

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.040
like you couldn't open
your bar on Sunday

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.910
or liquor stores couldn't
open on election day.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:23.080
There was like one weird
law in the South, one

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.440
of those Southern states,
South Carolina, I think,

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.600
where you could only
mix cocktails out

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.700
of those little
mini liquor bottles.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.590
I guess this was supposed
to impede drinking.

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.259
You had problems here
in San Francisco.

00:50:36.259 --> 00:50:38.550
There was one point where
the health department started

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.900
cracking down and
saying that infusions,

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.560
where you put something
in a spirit to flavor it,

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.950
were illegal.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.010
And this was like a
crisis for a while

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.335
until some politician got
it overturned or something.

00:50:50.335 --> 00:50:51.210
VIRGINIA MILLER: Mhm.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.200
Yeah, the Distillers Guild
and a few different groups

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.170
were working on it.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.800
ROBERT SIMONSON: There was
another time in New York where

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.424
like the health department came
in and said, oh, my god, you're

00:50:58.424 --> 00:51:01.410
making drinks with raw eggs,
and we're shutting you down.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.380
So there were a lot, but
they're mainly gone now.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.937
They're mainly gone, these
legal hurdles, aren't they?

00:51:09.937 --> 00:51:12.270
VIRGINIA MILLER: Yeah, there
are still a few weird ones.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.894
I mean, we've had
some recent successes

00:51:13.894 --> 00:51:17.620
in California in terms of
now distilleries are actually

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.060
able to sell their own
bottles at their distillery

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.780
and do that sort of thing.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.085
ROBERT SIMONSON: Oh. yeah,
that was totally unfair.

00:51:23.085 --> 00:51:25.020
And the wine country,
you go to the winery,

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.450
and of course you get a taste
and you can drink there.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.090
It took so long
for the distillers

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.740
to get the same privilege.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.747
But now you can
go there and have

00:51:32.747 --> 00:51:34.330
a little sip of their
wares and decide

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:36.400
whether you want
to buy it while you

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.070
take a tour of the distillery.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.000
VIRGINIA MILLER: But
there are still states,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.340
like Oklahoma-- there's
that three-tiered system,

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.380
and things have a high mark-up.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.299
There are still a lot of issues
with spirits in some states.

00:51:47.299 --> 00:51:49.840
It makes it tough for the bars,
because they pay so much more

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.240
for their basic spirits.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.240
ROBERT SIMONSON: You do
have the control states.

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.730
The control states don't
want to give that up.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.010
It's too much money.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.530
It's ridiculous that-- I
mean, Pennsylvania it has

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:06.780
been laboring under this
ridiculously arcane system,

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.590
where you can only buy
liquor through the state.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:12.870
And the state buys
what it chooses to buy.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.760
So bartenders basically
have to smuggle

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.050
in this stuff from
other states that they

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.240
want to use in their drinks.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.109
I don't see that going away--

00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:22.400
VIRGINIA MILLER: Unfortunately.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.608
ROBERT SIMONSON: --for the
states that still have it.

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.789
I think it's about 16
states are still-- yeah,

00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:28.580
all the liquor is bought
through the state,

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.220
and you have to go
to package stores.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.450
Yeah.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.950
One more?

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.600
AUDIENCE: Anything
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.200
ROBERT SIMONSON:
A trend with a lot

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:42.460
of bars these days is low-proof
cocktails, low ABV cocktails,

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.620
which can be delicious.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.300
These are cocktails that
are made with liquors that

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.750
have a lower alcohol content.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:53.380
Most spirits are 40% or above.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.170
But if you're dealing
with some of the liqueurs,

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.950
you're like 20% and below.

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:03.000
If you don't mind
starting with one of those

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.980
just to see a greater variety
of what they're doing,

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.030
you'll probably
last one drink more.

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:14.370
Do remember, the brown,
bitter, and stirred drinks,

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:19.540
you also-- get ones
that are on the rocks.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.380
You can sip at them
for a long time.

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.490
And you can spend a
half hour on that drink.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.000
As opposed to the
ones served up,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.180
you pretty much have to
drink within 10 minutes

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.760
or else it goes warm.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.132
So there's a couple tips.

00:53:33.132 --> 00:53:34.340
Thank you so much for coming.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.677
I hope you enjoy the book.

00:53:35.677 --> 00:53:36.510
Thank you, Virginia.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:37.390
VIRGINIA MILLER:
Thank you, Robert.

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.890
Thanks.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:41.640
[APPLAUSE]
