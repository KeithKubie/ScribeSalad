00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.800
Let's explore this notion of
using something other than

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.550
actual physical gold as
a unit of exchange.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.900
So let me draw my
balance sheet.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm going to draw it a little
bit neater this time.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.840
So I built my building, my bank,
my vault, whatever you

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.100
want to call it.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.130
And I used 100 gold pieces
to build it.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.820
This is just my bank's
balance sheet.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.070
Bank of Sal.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.920
When I say 100 gold pieces,
this is equity.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.390
Hopefully you're familiar with
it by now, but it's not like

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.570
there's actually 100 gold
pieces anywhere anymore.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.430
I took this 100 gold pieces,
paid the builders of my vault

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.940
looking, temple looking bank--
and maybe they live someplace

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060
else and they just took
that gold with them.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.850
So I'm just saying
I have 100 gold

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.140
pieces worth of a building.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.210
Maybe if I had to sell this,
someone else would give me 100

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.280
gold pieces for them.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950
And that's why I say
I have 100 gold

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.070
pieces worth of equity.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.990
Anyway, that's not the
point of this video.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.080
So I go, I tell everyone, hey,
you can keep your money, say,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.130
for your gold, safe with me.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.500
So let's say that-- I don't
know-- citizen A says, well,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.880
this looks like a good bank and
Sal, you've lived in this

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.880
village all your life and I
trust you and your ancestors

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.040
so I'm going to deposit 500
gold pieces with you.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210
So that becomes an asset
in the bank.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.250
Got the width off a
little bit, but I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.270
think you get the idea.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.690
The width shouldn't matter.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.460
The height kind of represents
the quantity.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.760
So this guy-- maybe it's my
uncle-- 500 gold pieces,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.070
deposits in the bank because
this vault that I built seems

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.650
a lot safer.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.260
And I say, well, do you want
it all in your checking

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.610
account sir, or would you
like some cash back?

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.680
And he says, oh, well, I need
some cash to just transact

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.390
every day and to buy supplies
or food, et cetera.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.290
So why don't you put
400 equivalent

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.230
in my checking account.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.540
Let me draw that.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.580
Let me do the cash back first.
Let's say I do 100 cash back

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.830
first. So then I have this
liability here of 100.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.310
So it's 100 gold pieces
equivalent of notes

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.820
outstanding, N.O. for
notes outstanding.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.780
And maybe I just hand him
five 20s for that as

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.250
most ATMs today do.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.290
I just don't want to confuse
things too much.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.920
Remember, this is in
my fictional world.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.230
These aren't necessarily
dollars just yet.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.030
These are bank notes from the
Bank of Sal, saying that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.470
anyone who were to hand back
one of these 20s to me will

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.540
get 20 gold pieces.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.330
That's all it says.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.550
I've signed them and I've made
them hard to forge, just

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.320
because I don't want anyone
printing these notes and then

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.700
coming to me and getting
my gold pieces.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.050
I only want the ones that I
printed coming back to me.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.480
But anyway, that depositor-- so
he got 100 gold pieces of

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.170
notes-- and that's what I've
drawn here-- and then the rest

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.570
will just stay in his
checking account.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.610
It's a liability for me, right,
because he can at any

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.240
point withdraw that checking
account and get back 400 gold

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.955
pieces 400 gold pieces for
A's checking account.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.260
There's a bunch of ways you can
write it, but this is a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.420
liability for me.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.230
These are my assets.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.330
Fair enough.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.800
Someone else who trusts A says--
call them person B--

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.160
says, if it's good enough for
A, it's good enough for B.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.000
So let me put my money in this
bank account as well and I

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.760
want to do similar type of
transaction as A, although

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.000
maybe they don't have
as much money.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.680
So let's say that they
have-- I don't know.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.110
Let's say they have
200 gold pieces.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.270
Let me draw that on the left
hand side first. 200 gold

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.980
pieces from person B.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.920
That looks like about 200.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.320
and they want to half of it in
cash and half of it as a

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.570
checking deposit account.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.025
About half of will be 100 gold
pieces for B's account.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.770
And then we also give him some
cash, which are essentially

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.890
bank notes in our current
universe.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.400
And lets say he wants
it all in 10s.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.940
We give him, let's say 100 gold
pieces equivalent, notes

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.310
outstanding, and I'm going to
hand him-- let's say he likes

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.000
it all in ones.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.250
I don't know.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.950
He likes the weight of the money
or he has to-- I don't

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.810
know what he does with the $1
bills, but 100 times a one

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.230
gold piece denominated
bank note, right?

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.840
I give him 100 of these.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.800
Fair enough.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.330
So let's explore a little bit
about how some transactions

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.060
can occur with A and B.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.370
Let's say A needs to buy
an apple from B.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.050
So let me draw this up here.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.170
I don't want to run
out of space.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.890
I'll draw it actually
down here.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.300
So let's say I have person
A and I have person B.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.075
So B has an apple.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.010
That's my drawing of an apple.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.100
And person A wants it and asks
person B, how much does an

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.320
apple cost?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.060
And person B says, well, an
apple costs two gold pieces.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.450
So person says, well, that's a
little high, but I'm hungry so

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.560
I will give you two gold
piece for it, but

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.710
I'll tell you what.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.810
There's this new thing called
a bank and I don't have gold

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.980
pieces and I think you know
what it's all about.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.830
Instead let me just give you
these pieces of paper that the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.930
bank says at anytime I can go
and trade for gold pieces.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.280
So person B says, that's
fair enough.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.250
I'm very familiar with
that concept as well.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:11.650
So person A gives person B-- so
person A has-- maybe some

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.500
of these weren't 20s.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.050
Maybe some of these were
$2 bills or something.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.960
Let me just say they
were $1 bills.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.770
So one gold piece note--
actually let's just make it--

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:30.830
since he's got five 20s, let's
say he gives him a 20.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.660
I should draw it in green
because that's the color that

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.940
I originally drew the 20 gold
piece notes-- one of these.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.120
He hands one of these
over to person B.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.640
B hands over the apple to person
A and he also hands

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.550
over 18 of those $1
notes that he got.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.340
These were these notes here
that person B got.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.560
Hands over 18 of these $1
notes, so times 18.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.360
And so the net effect is that
you had two $1 notes switch

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.430
hands and an apple
was exchanged.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.100
And what's neat here is
a couple of things.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.970
One, no gold ever had
to exchange hands.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.720
Gold is heavy and you
don't want to carry

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.820
around a bunch of gold.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.270
You're able to do very exact
change in this situation.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.700
You could imagine a world where
gold is worth 20 times

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.500
your smallest unit of
exchange you want.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.945
So it would be very inconvenient
to have to break

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:28.920
up little gold coins.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.280
In this case, our smallest unit
of exchange is a one gold

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.430
dollar bill or whatever
you want to call it.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.400
But you could imagine-- you
could break these up.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.610
This bank could issue notes that
are a quarter of a gold

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.120
piece or an eighth
of a gold piece.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.470
And that's a lot easier than
actually cutting up gold

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.360
pieces and then having to put
them all back together.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.810
And of course, these notes can
then switch hands between

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.990
people as the economy needs, as
it functions, and the bank

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.985
doesn't have to worry about
anything and the gold doesn't

00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:58.930
have to be moved around.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.220
So everyone is happy.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.970
Let's say that that person
B actually wants to buy

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.410
something large from person A.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:15.260
Let's say person B wants to
buy-- Person A is richer so

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.770
let's say person A is buying
something from B.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.350
Let's say B is a home builder.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.840
And person A is going to get him
to build a house for him.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.900
So he's going to say, well, I'll
pay you 200 gold pieces

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.210
to build a house.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.240
That's a huge amount of money.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.820
I don't like walking
around with that.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.539
How about I write you a check?

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.500
And person B says, well,
what is a check?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.909
Well, a check, person A says, is
I just write you a note and

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.970
that essentially instructs the
bank to transfer that amount

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.040
of gold pieces in my name to
it being in your name.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.560
And person B says, oh, well,
that sounds reasonable enough.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.250
So person B gives person
A a home, works for

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.200
weeks to build a house.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.790
And then person A writes
B a check.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.350
And now we're getting an
introduction to checks and the

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.730
check will look something
like this.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.280
Person A will fill out-- it'll
have A's name there and it'll

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.160
say 200 gold pieces please and
then A will sign it and

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.980
probably date it-- 10 I don't
know-- 2008-- and then give it

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.480
to B and then B can take
it back to this bank.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.790
And the bank will
do the transfer.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.640
And all the bank has to do is
take 200 gold pieces from here

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.420
and put it there.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.520
So this is all the bank
has to do really.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.400
Right now 400 gold pieces in
A's name, just take 200 of

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.000
those and put them
in B's name.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.290
So now this is B's new share,
which would be 100 plus 200--

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.800
so it's 300 gold pieces.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.840
And then A's share has
shrunk to just being

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.410
this part right here.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.250
But notice, the bank didn't have
to do anything except a

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.720
little bit of paperwork.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.680
200 gold pieces.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.070
And that was useful
because you didn't

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.620
have to exchange cash.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.250
We talked about gold being
dangerous to keep at home

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.190
because obviously someone
could steal it.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.000
It's also inconvenient because
it weighs a lot.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.030
It's hard to break up and carry
around if you're doing a

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.930
lot of it, but cash
is the same thing.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.930
These bank notes are also
dangerous because someone can

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.660
steal them and no one is keeping
track of who has which

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.500
bank notes.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.520
So they're still something
that's very stealable, but a

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.870
check was nice because one, you
could write a very large

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.640
amount and also only, if we're
doing our authentication

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.030
right, person A can
write the check.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.090
So it's not like someone could--
in an ideal world,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.680
someone could not have stolen
A's checkbook and signed for

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.610
him because hopefully this
bank has A's signature on

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.030
record and can recognize when
A has written a bad check or

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.220
maybe they'll even check with
A to say if something is a

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.700
little bit suspicious.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.010
But anyway, that's an
introduction to banks notes

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.140
and checks.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.620
In the next video, I'll talk
about how we can use all of

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.330
these notions actually lend
money also without

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.520
giving out any gold.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.310
See you in the next video.
