00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.810
Vsauce!

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.810
Kevin here.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.830
A robot opened a door.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.100
Why did tens of millions of people watch this?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.850
Why is opening a door a big deal?

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.250
Just five years ago there was a big robotics
competition and only one team nailed the door-opening

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.250
challenge.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.099
Getting robots to perform common human tasks
was the central feature of the DARPA Robotics

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.539
Challenge, a competition sponsored by the
US Department of Defense that challenged robots

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
to perform in emergency and search and rescue
settings.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.020
In 2013, a team from the Florida Institute
for Human and Machine Cognition was the only

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.540
one of 16 competitors to earn a perfect score
on the door-opening task… and many of the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.250
2-legged humanoid bots fell on their face.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.850
Just five years later, the 4-legged, well-balanced
Boston Dynamics’ SpotMini is capable of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.080
sneaking into your bedroom as you sleep.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.900
So for now, four-legs are better than two
for door-opening robots.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.190
So why did this go viral?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.259
It seems kinda creepy to some people for robots
to bypass the human-made barriers of doors.

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.990
And the reason opening a door has been difficult
for robots to do is because of the Moravec

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.990
Paradox.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.910
Basically, that high level reasoning like
computing math equations doesn’t require

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.340
much computational power but low-level reasoning
like walking on a sandy beach or opening doors,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.350
requires a ton of computational resources.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.259
So things humans are able to do without thinking,
biological skills that have been refined over

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.259
millions of years, are really hard to get
robots to do and things we’ve developed

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.110
more recently like playing chess are a lot
easier.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.110
So that’s that.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.819
But that’s not all because this is Mind
Blow.

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.959
The Dumbo octopus got its name because its
fins resemble the Disney character’s big

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.490
ears, and for the first time we’ve seen
that baby Dumbo octopuses are actually born

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.319
as tiny adults.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.490
Tim Shank of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts used a remote-operated

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.530
vehicle over a mile below the ocean surface
to collect samples of what appeared to be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.470
egg cases -- and then one hatched.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.750
When the baby octopod emerged it had all the
characteristics of an adult.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.340
An MRI confirmed that, from the outside features
to the central nervous system, this rare baby

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.000
Dumbo was fully-formed and ready to go.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.099
He probably grew to be about 10 inches long…
and danced around like this.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.730
We know from Mind Blow #116 that rats are
heroes who can detect landmines and diseases,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.600
but they’re also all-around nice folks.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.379
Researchers at the University of St. Andrews
found that rats who have had something nice

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.500
done for them return the favor.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.269
Rats trade food and grooming services -- and
it’s shedding light on our built-in instinctual

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.329
responses to kindness.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:07.329
So next time someone calls you a dirty rat
- say, “Thank you, I am kind.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.170
And I do need a bath.”

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000
Israeli ramonauts have returned safely from
a 4 day mission on Mars.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.579
D-MARS.

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.410
Just like HI-SEAS in Hawaii, the Mars simulation
I visited for my Planet Behind Your Eyes video,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.549
the Desert Mars Analog Ramon Station in the
Negev Desert simulates the arid, desolate

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.500
environment of the Red Planet.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.859
Inside the Makhtesh Ramon crater, researchers
can undergo the daily routine of life on Mars

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.640
and deal with its serious limitations.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.180
Experiments from the first mission included
determining the optimal materials for 3-D

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.140
printing on Mars and a psychological study
of the correlation between stress and language

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.049
variability in writing.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.209
It turns out that research subjects write
less and use a smaller vocabulary when they’re

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.219
under stress, so the first D-MARS simulation
is helping to show how our communication changes

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.250
when our environment changes.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.640
The main takeaway I had from the lavanauts
I interviewed in Hawaii was that developing

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.959
technology to live on Mars will help us better
understand and live on Earth which seems good.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.170
And now a word from 1981.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.750
There's nothing we want to watch on TV tonight
but we're still gonna watch something great.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.340
With our RCA Video Disc Player and VideoDiscs.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.889
Just flip a switch and on our TV we see Airplane!,
or The Pink Panther, The Godfather, or Grease,

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.470
Muppets, Monsters, Mickey, MASH, and a hundred
more.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.710
Starting as low as $15.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.300
And the player costs less than $500.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.600
Put it this way: we're watching a great movie
and you're watching us.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.210
A new inkjet bioprinting technique uses common
cells and molecules found in biological tissue

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.389
to create lifelike tissues in the lab.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.530
Researchers at Queen Mary University of London
are using droplet printing to assemble biofabricated

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.319
structures that can make testing drugs or
researching cancer growth easier.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:12.020
And the method utilizes molecular self-assembly
that builds microscopic structures like Lego.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.639
African Matabele ants frequently raid termite
colonies, and they never leave a wounded comrade

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.639
behind.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.900
Research published in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society B shows that after intense termite

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.110
battles in which limbs are bitten off and
the ants are gravely wounded, they send pheromone

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.170
signals as a cry for help.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.800
Ants come to the rescue by picking up their
wounded, carrying them home, and then engaging

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.199
in intense “licking sessions” that prevent
infection until the wound is healed.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.169
The ants have a two-step process that determines
who can be saved and who… can’t.

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.830
The mortally wounded are passed over, while
the lightly wounded are saved.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.970
One model calculates that reducing the mortality
rate in termite battles allows the ants to

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.490
have colonies up to 29% larger than if they
continually lost soldiers -- and they demonstrate

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.970
to us that even insects can show compassion.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.410
To come up with new breakthroughs in science
and technology, you can’t just memorize

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.789
formulas you have to learn how to think through
complex problems.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.470
Brilliant's interactive problems are a great
way for you to really understand math and

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.470
science.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.379
They have everything from 2D Geometry, to
Math of Poker, or this one I really like on

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.970
Physics of the Everyday.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.880
This crime course allows you to use the physics
of a bike track to solve a murder.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.690
Which way did the killer go?

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.190
Your brain will thank you.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.479
Now I’m gonna leave you with a video telephone
concept for shopping over long distances in

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.660
1961.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.710
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:56.039
These are the shapes of the future, the tools
for communication now being forged and tested

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:58.310
against tomorrow’s unfolding needs.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.580
Not yet, but sooner than you may realize.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.440
And some of what’s on the drawing boards
may be… a little out of this world.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.370
“And now may we show you one of our newest
models designed by Howard of Hong Kong.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.629
Notice the dramatically-shaped bodice and
the gentle form of the neckline.

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:22.639
The model comes in red, yellow…”

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.139
“I don’t know.

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.530
Do you have it in green?”

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.530
“Certainly.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.349
Here it is.”

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:32.750
“Yes, fine.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.160
That’s it!

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.280
I’ll take it.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.699
Please send it out to me.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:39.870
Here’s my credit card.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.889
Oh, and don’t forget the striped pillowcases.”

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:44.500
“No, we won’t.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.250
We’ll send them in the first delivery.”

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.860
“Thank you, bye.”

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860
“Goodbye.”

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.899
There’s an old saying: “The more things
change, the more they stay the same.”
