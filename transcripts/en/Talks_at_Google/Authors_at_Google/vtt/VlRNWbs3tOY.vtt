00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.470
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Before we get started,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.039
I wanted you to know that as
I was going through your book

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.080
and reading your book, I
was struck by something.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.210
And the thought that kept
going through my head

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.040
is, what inspired you?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.930
Where were you when
you decided, I'm

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.081
going to write a book about
my grandfather Nelson Mandela,

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.580
but I'm going to
write it completely

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.580
from the perspective of being a
grandson and, in many respects,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.280
a son?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.740
NDABA MANDELA: Well,
this year, we're

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.840
celebrating 100 years
of Nelson Mandela.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.920
So it is my dedication to him.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.520
And also, it's a new
perspective on Nelson Mandela.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.970
Nobody's written on him
as being as human being.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.505
It's always the president, the
revolutionary, dot dot dot dot

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:49.540
dot da, right?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.284
The big man?

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.200
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yeah.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.450
NDABA MANDELA: So I just wanted
to, first of all, be able to--

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.210
make Nelson Mandela
relate to young people.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.040
Because every young
person has a grandparent

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.600
who they can think
about, who told them

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.470
a story, who is trying to
teach them some kind of lesson.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.590
So that was really
my main thing,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.390
to say that Nelson Mandela,
for many young people,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.635
they don't really know him.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:18.260
They know him as the
first black person

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.280
of South Africa who's been
jailed 27 years, but nothing

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.550
beyond that.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.080
I mean, he is the best
example of leadership

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990
in the 21st century, right?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.150
You have all these
leaders in today's world

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.690
who will tell you about how
great Nelson Mandela is.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.090
But do they follow
in his footsteps?

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.500
Do they use his values?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.430
They don't.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.530
So I said, OK, since these
guy's are not going to do it,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.070
how do we then influence the
young people to find the Nelson

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.895
Mandela inside of themselves?

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:52.020
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Excellent.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.720
You write a lot in
the book, though,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.060
about this interesting
juxtaposition of the private

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.060
and the ways that
Nelson Mandela was

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.990
very private about his family
life, but also the public

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.009
and serving as an example,
and the pressure of being

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.130
the grandson of Nelson
Mandela and having

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.690
to outperform in school,
outperform in life,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.810
and how, through
transitions in school,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.360
through transitions
as you grew, you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400
came to terms with that,
reckoned with that,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.060
and got into a comfortable pace
with it as you grew into a man.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.430
So can we talk a little
bit about how that evolved

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.944
and how you negotiated
that with your grandfather?

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:36.360
NDABA MANDELA: Well, there's
no negotiation, first of all,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.550
with my grandfather.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.340
What he says goes.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.215
You know what I mean?

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:43.650
His word is the final thing.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.020
That's it.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.600
And that's very typical in
an African home as well.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.950
You don't ask questions.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.130
You do as you're
told pretty much.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.080
But of course, there
was lot of pressure.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.410
He once said to me,
Ndaba, you're my grandson.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.360
Therefore, people will
look at you as a leader.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.640
And therefore, you must get
the best marks in class.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.890
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Straight A's.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.348
NDABA MANDELA: I
was like, Grandad,

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:09.680
that's a lot of pressure now.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.420
I just want to get by, you know?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.970
And I was a naughty boy.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.930
I was, like, sitting in
the back of the class,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.930
you know, shooting those
little peas [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.460
the straws and the girls.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.219
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.260
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I believe
you described yourself

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.672
as a little shit [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:27.672 --> 00:03:29.796
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:33.350
-- which I think I laughed out
loud in real life for about

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.030
five seconds.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.640
It was extremely--

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.140
NDABA MANDELA: I was--

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.800
I was terrible.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.425
I was terrible.

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:37.060
I was a bully.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.650
I was bad to girls.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.960
Like, I dissed
girls all the time.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.420
The only girls I was nice
to were the pretty ones.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.360
Otherwise, I was like,
please, whatever.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.620
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Ow.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.974
NDABA MANDELA: But, yeah, of
course, as life progressed,

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:53.390
you get to understand
who you are.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.400
Because at school, you
just want to fit in.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.960
You just want to be
treated like any other kid.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.850
You know what I mean?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.640
You don't want to
be sticking out.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.390
And every time somebody comes
to school-- a new person,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.500
a new teacher--

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.700
or you go play sports
against another school--

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.495
you travel to another school--

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:12.912
you hear people
whispering, that's

00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:14.078
Nelson's Mandela's grandson.

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:15.466
That's Nelson
Mandela's grandson.

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:18.320
Hey, do you know that's
Nelson Mandela's grandson.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.570
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: How did you
evolve in that awareness?

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.550
When you're writing about
yourself as a child,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.010
and you're saying,
hey, listen, I

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.910
was moved around from place to
place while my grandfather was

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.690
in jail.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.560
Got to see him--

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.519
you talk about the first time
you saw him at seven years old

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.060
and how someone
saying to you, you're

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.184
going to go see your
grandfather Nelson Mandela was

00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:39.680
like saying you're going
to see Michael Jackson.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.540
And it was just like, OK.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.964
But it was said
so matter of fact.

00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:45.380
And then you also talk about
the pressure of understanding

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.380
that you were a Mandela.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.370
So how did that awareness
that you're a Mandela

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.500
and what that meant,
how did you grapple

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.604
with that as a teenager?

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:54.770
NDABA MANDELA: As a teenager,
to be honest with you,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.680
I didn't want to
grapple with it.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.540
That was the furthest
thing from my mind.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.226
As a teenager, you just
want to be a teenager.

00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:04.100
You want to have fun.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.780
You want to do what
other teenagers do.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.510
You want to be
naughty, basically.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.010
You know?

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.390
You want to run away.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.760
That's pretty much-- it only
happened much later in life,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.200
to be honest with you.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.760
So when I started
going to university,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760
first year, of course,
first year is first year.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.756
Right?

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.230
[LAUGHING]

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.980
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: First
year is first year.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.170
NDABA MANDELA: First
year is first year.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.830
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Which is kind of--

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.040
NDABA MANDELA: I
hardly went to class.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.070
I never went to class.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.903
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: No.

00:05:30.903 --> 00:05:31.426
Fine.

00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:31.925
Fine.

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:32.857
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:33.690
NDABA MANDELA: Yeah.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.690
And then eventually
you realize, OK, it's

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.920
time to be serious now.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.730
I'm getting older.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.410
My friends are,
like, beating me.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.610
My friends are graduating.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.740
I'm still in class.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.520
And, eventually,
you want to-- you

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.156
want to get your shit together.

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:48.030
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.920
NDABA MANDELA: Right?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.253
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: But you spend--

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:52.950
so I read your book a few times.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.810
And then I listened
to you read your book.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.180
And then I watched lots of
interviews about this book.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.263
So I'm going to push you
a little bit here, Ndaba,

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:01.890
because you spend chapters
4 through 6 talking

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.770
about the difficulty
of your identity

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.110
both as Nelson
Mandela's grandson

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.030
but also sort of grappling
with the decisions

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.530
that your parents are making.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.252
And at the time, they were
going off and studying.

00:06:15.252 --> 00:06:17.085
You were still living
with your grandfather.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.620
And at a certain point,
there was a decision

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.214
made without consulting
with you that you would stay

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:23.880
with your grandfather
and that you would

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.470
live with your grandfather.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.280
And then you talk quite deeply
about what that meant for you

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.460
both as his grandfather,
but also as a Mandela,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.791
and how you struggled
with that decision,

00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.540
and that that decision
didn't include you,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.130
and that it was much
larger than you,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.540
and that everybody
was witness to it.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.890
So I'm going to push you here
to talk a little bit more

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.424
about that.

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:46.340
NDABA MANDELA: Yes, you
see, that's the thing.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.265
You know, I'm trying
to be a normal kid.

00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:49.140
I'm not a normal kid.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.810
I live with my grandfather.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.680
I don't stay with my parents.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.440
I'm the only child at home.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.720
You know?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.600
It's me and my grandfather,
and then, literally,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.825
20 staff in the house.

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:05.640
So I'm looking for normality.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.437
I'm looking for something to
say you are just a good boy.

00:07:11.437 --> 00:07:12.270
You're a normal boy.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.760
But nothing I can
find that's around me.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.920
And when you go to
school, wherever you go,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.065
you are treated like
that special boy.

00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:23.940
You know what I mean?

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.200
So I was just really
looking for normality,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.840
and it was just very
difficult to find it.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.840
I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.960
And so you end up doing
all kinds of things

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.290
to make you feel normal, whether
it's mind altering substances--

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.680
smoke a little something,
drink a little something.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.096
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I have no
idea what you're talking about.

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:47.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.990
NDABA MANDELA: --to get
you away from that, right?

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.300
But eventually, it was
really just accepting

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.170
that all this normality
that you're looking for

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.070
is not for you, my friend.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.770
That is not for you.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:11.250
You have a special,
different, particular road

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.980
that you have to walk on.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.960
And that road is not
walked by many people.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.030
And so as you walk
that road, you

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.000
have to ask yourself,
what are you going to do?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.640
Are you going to try to
run away from the road?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.310
Or you going to take
the road by the horns?

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.031
Grab it by the cojones.

00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:32.530
Right?

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.490
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Did
you decide to do that?

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.130
NDABA MANDELA: You have to.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.901
You have to.

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:36.400
You have to.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.608
You don't really-- you don't
have a choice, you know?

00:08:38.608 --> 00:08:41.250
People in my position
don't have a choice.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.549
We are privileged.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.210
Therefore, we have a
huge responsibility.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.490
So it's hard to
strike that balance.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.840
It's hard to strike
that balance in life.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.200
NDABA MANDELA: So, Ndaba,
we're talking now, right?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.100
So this is the Ndaba the
man who has grown up.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.202
But you did a really
good job of-- throughout

00:09:02.202 --> 00:09:04.660
every single chapter of your
book-- talking about the state

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.160
of mind that you were in.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.600
And one thing that I
found as a reader that

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.660
is one of the most beautiful
aspects of the book

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:18.260
is the nuance and
the layers between--

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.620
you pick up the
book, and it says,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.230
lessons from my
grandfather, Nelson Mandela.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.060
And I said-- earlier, I said--

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.150
I read this book and I thought,
I'm just like Ndaba Mandela,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.460
except that my grandfather
is not Nelson Mandela.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.490
But, really, when
you read the book,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.610
you go back and forth
between relating

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.110
to the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.000
There's this really
beautiful passage

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.970
where you talk about
how much you can relate

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.400
to the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.160
Or your older brother was
very much like him, had got

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.570
sent away to live
with relatives,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.220
in many ways should be
this disadvantaged youth,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.680
but, really, the beauty
of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.680
is how much the Fresh Prince
teaches his extended family.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.500
And you talk about that,
about how you did not

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.470
grow up in the suburbs.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.890
You grew up in the
ghettos of Soweto,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:12.320
but you bring this extra dynamic
to your grandfather's life

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.210
to that home.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.160
And also you see this parallel
between this very different

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.250
childhood and then this very
iconic American TV show.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.374
And then we'll talk
a little bit more

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:25.790
about some more
parallels that you

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.730
draw between African-American
communities here

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.770
and the experience
in South Africa.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.190
But do you feel like that was
your perspective as a man?

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.702
Or do you feel like
narrating the book?

00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:40.160
Or do you feel like you actually
had the understanding when

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.792
you were a teenager that
there were some parallels?

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.530
NDABA MANDELA: No, I
felt those parallels.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.390
Like I said, there
was no normality.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.800
I mean, for example--

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.620
I don't know-- if you ask some
people what they wanted to be

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.130
when they grew up--

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.220
what did you want to
be when you grew up?

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.600
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Say, I wanted
to be engineers at Google.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.370
No?

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.557
No?

00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:04.140
NDABA MANDELA: Can
I get some answers?

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.460
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Raise your hands.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.130
That's a live
[? audience ?] question.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.990
NDABA MANDELA: Yes?

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.010
Scientists.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:09.760
AUDIENCE: Teacher.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.910
NDABA MANDELA: Teacher.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.890
AUDIENCE: Cop.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.055
NDABA MANDELA: A cop.

00:11:13.055 --> 00:11:13.930
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.540
NDABA MANDELA: You know,
these are the normal answers.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.440
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.357
NDABA MANDELA: Right?

00:11:17.357 --> 00:11:18.190
AUDIENCE: Astronaut.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.356
NDABA MANDELA: An astronaut.

00:11:19.356 --> 00:11:20.350
You see?

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.854
That was not me.

00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:24.270
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: What did you
want to be when you grew up?

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.350
NDABA MANDELA: wanted to be--

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.308
I wanted to go to jail.

00:11:26.308 --> 00:11:27.392
I wanted to be a prisoner.

00:11:27.392 --> 00:11:29.266
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: You
wanted to be a gangster.

00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:30.330
You talk a lot about it.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.621
NDABA MANDELA: I wanted to be--

00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:34.110
I wanted to go to
jail, pretty much.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.224
Because-- let me
break it down to you.

00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:40.390
Let me break it down to you.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.440
OK?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.000
So in the book, my
parents taught me,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.610
we're going to visit
your grandfather in jail.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.480
Right?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.052
So I had a typical image
of what jail is like.

00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:53.200
Right?

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.020
Concrete bars, lots of security,
dogs, et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.950
But when we got there,
as an 8-year-old boy,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:06.580
I didn't understand that,
actually, your grandfather

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.160
is in jail, but he's
a political prisoner.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.410
So it's not a normal jail.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.200
It was actually a
house more beautiful

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.600
than the house I lived in.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.041
Right?

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.040
And I didn't understand.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.610
They put him there in
isolation to try and break

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.420
him down mentally to
say, Nelson Mandela,

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.690
for the rest of your days
when you come out of jail,

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:35.590
spend the days with your
grandkids, denounce the ANC,

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.730
denounce your comrades, and
spend the rest of your days

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.840
in luxury.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.570
And leave this
political life of yours.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.430
But we all know how
that went, right?

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.388
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Right.

00:12:46.388 --> 00:12:48.660
NDABA MANDELA: He stood
true to his convictions,

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.354
to his beliefs.

00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:52.270
So when we got there,
it was a beautiful house

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.311
that had a swimming pool.

00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:56.570
I never had a swimming pool.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.380
There was a chef.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.600
We watched the
"Neverending Story."

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.060
We met the man, of course--

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.826
tall, dark handsome man
who was talking to us, each

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:05.950
and every single one of us.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.030
What's your name?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.750
How old are you?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.430
What's your favorite subject?

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.410
Very warm, right?

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.840
So I said, wow.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.370
This is prison?

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.124
I want to go to prison.

00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:18.790
This is the kind of
life I want to live.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.665
You know what I mean?

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.670
Because, to me,
it looked amazing.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.770
Because I lived in the
village at that time,

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.930
not even in Soweto.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.690
And the village was much
better than living in Soweto.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.450
The village is more
like a farm style.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.990
Soweto is the
ghetto, people living

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:40.330
on top of each other,
bottle stores everywhere.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.507
I mean.

00:13:41.507 --> 00:13:42.340
You know what it is.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:42.790
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: We're familiar.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.240
Yes.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.080
NDABA MANDELA: Yes.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.450
You know what it is.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.950
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: --the
ghettos in the United States,

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.491
in many ways.

00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:47.440
NDABA MANDELA: Yeah.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.120
So when you watch
TV, you get to see

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.150
what's happening in the world,
and there's the first prince,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.260
the coolest kid.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.580
Right?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.299
But you watch the
stories like, he was

00:13:59.299 --> 00:14:00.590
living in a rough neighborhood.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.140
His mama got scared.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.595
Then they took him
to his uncle's house.

00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:05.470
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.630
NDABA MANDELA: Right?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.466
Me, to the grandpa's house.

00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:09.340
You know what I mean?

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.640
And that was a decision
taken by my grandfather,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.950
not even by my parents.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.310
Because my grandfather wanted
my parents to have an education.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.820
Because they never had the
opportunity to go to school.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.450
So my father went to
university for the first time

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:33.650
at the age of 45, qualified
as a lawyer at the age of 50,

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.205
died at the age of
55 due to HIV/AIDS.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.650
So again, normality,
what is that?

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.400
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: What
does that look like?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.570
NDABA MANDELA: What is that?

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.320
I don't know.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.747
All right?

00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:52.580
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Well,
thank you for sharing

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.720
that, because that's
another thing,

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.345
I think, too, that
people don't realize

00:14:55.345 --> 00:14:59.540
is that it was an incredibly
brave thing to stay at the time

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.592
that your father passed
away from HIV/AIDS.

00:15:01.592 --> 00:15:03.800
Because it was something
that stigmatized-- and still

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.090
is-- in many places.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.370
NDABA MANDELA: Still
is in many places,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.320
although, in South
Africa, it's going well.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:17.240
But yeah, because unlike
any other disease,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.640
HIV/AIDS comes with
this moral question

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.530
to say you got this disease
because you were sleeping

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.900
around, because
you're promiscuous,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.240
because you are dirty.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240
It's not cancer.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.710
It's, you got it because you
were doing something nasty.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.970
So, therefore, you
are a bad person.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.320
Therefore, you cannot
disclose your status.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.590
You must hide, and people
end up dying in silence.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.440
You understand?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.550
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.160
NDABA MANDELA: And
so when my father--

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.130
because my mother actually
died from HIV/AIDS--

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.950
and my family were
still hush hush about it

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.770
when my mother died two
years before my dad.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.870
And then when my dad came out--

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.040
again, my grandfather
played that lead role.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.050
Because my cousin,
when we discussed

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.730
what we were going to say
to the world, she said,

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.560
well, we can say
pneumonia or TB.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.050
Because AIDS doesn't kill you.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.010
It kills your immune system
so you can't defend yourself

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.700
against common illnesses.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.440
And he said, no.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.520
We shall not do that.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:37.600
We shall simply say, my son
died of HIV/AIDS full stop.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.290
Right?

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.590
And we went out.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.010
It actually happened inside
my house in the garden.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.460
We set up a little thing.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.680
We invited the media to come in.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.530
And my grandfather
read the statement.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:56.790
And it was the first time a
prominent family had actually

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:02.730
disclosed to the world that we
had been affected by HIV/AIDS.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.270
And so it gave
other people courage

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.740
to say, oh, Nelson Mandela's
son died from HIV/AIDS.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.500
We can now talk about
it, because we are

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.400
like Nelson Mandela's family.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.480
You understand?

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.339
It was my father.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.119
It was my uncle.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:19.869
It was my brother.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.339
It was my cousin.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:28.280
So in many respects that's
a normality in our country.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.660
That's the kind of
normality that I found.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.920
Because in South Africa,
you have a whole generation

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.430
of child-headed households
because their parents all

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.620
died from HIV/AIDS.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.570
So it's a very common thing.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.520
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And
before in your book,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.660
you talk about the
generational loss that's

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.470
multiple generations, even
before the HIV/AIDS crisis hits

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.170
in the late '70s, early
'80s, into the '90s,

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.570
you talk about just the
loss because of apartheid,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:11.380
just the loss of socioeconomic
well-being, health, pride,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.240
culture, access.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.780
And then the HIV/AIDS
crisis begins to really hit.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.510
Your family continued
to be, in many ways,

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.900
an example of the ways in which
you can supersede and triumph,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.400
but also in the
ways that you're not

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.670
immune to those challenges and
the way that made it relatable

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.740
to the rest of the community.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.900
How does that legacy
continue today?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.790
How do you feel like the legacy
of not just Nelson Mandela,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.400
but just the history
of your family,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.730
and how it serves as
an example for what

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.560
happened to so many
communities, how

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.430
do you feel like that
legacy today continues?

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.320
NDABA MANDELA: Well, out of--

00:18:54.196 --> 00:19:00.220
out of great tragedy, when
the darkest, deepest things

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:08.640
are happening, when the worst
human atrocities are being

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.050
committed, out comes the light.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.090
Right?

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.390
Nelson Mandela,
the greatest leader

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.460
that we know of in
the 21st century,

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:26.080
comes from one of the worst
history's known to mankind.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.630
And that is a balance of life.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.770
Right?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.360
And so for us, you
know, Nelson Mandela

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.880
comes from a very
poor background.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.250
My grandfather went to school.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.980
His first day at school, he
went to school with no shoes

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.960
on, wearing his father's pants.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.020
Because he could not
afford to buy shoes--

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.780
or buy anything-- so he
wear his father's pants.

00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:57.800
And that's how he got his name.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.360
He got his name the first day.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:06.300
So if a young person from a poor
background with having almost

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.814
nothing can grow, and
triumph, and become

00:20:10.814 --> 00:20:12.730
this person that is known
all over the world--

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.000
when he was president,
his name Mandela

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.870
was the second most known name
after Coca-Cola in the world.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:35.490
So for me, it says to me that
if Nelson Mandela can do that,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.610
each of us can do that if
you set your mind to it.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.120
For me, the legacy of Nelson
Mandela is one of compassion.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.420
Passion is very
important because you'll

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.210
come across hurdles,
speed bumps,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.540
people who don't believe in you.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.400
And that's why it's
important to dream.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.100
Because Martin Luther King
had a dream, JFK, Rosa Parks--

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.110
it all starts with a dream.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.060
And then you work, and
it becomes reality.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.800
So for me, as-- and
you can imagine--

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.380
I met Michael
Jackson at my house.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.255
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:19.660
So talk about the birthday.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.620
NDABA MANDELA: I met Fidel
Castro at my house, Mike Tyson

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.820
at my house.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.310
I didn't have to go
to some special event.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.402
I literally, I
remember one time--

00:21:30.402 --> 00:21:31.735
does anyone watch football here?

00:21:31.735 --> 00:21:33.780
Are there any football
fans-- soccer fans?

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.340
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Show of hands.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.970
NDABA MANDELA: OK, nice.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.560
So I like Real Madrid.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.180
That's my team.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.640
And so I was in Cape Town and
had a wild night partying.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.690
So I woke up with a
hangover and, literally, I

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.660
step outside my door,
and I look to the right.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.350
And I see Ronaldo and
Figo walking down.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.037
I'm like, no, man.

00:21:58.037 --> 00:21:58.620
I walk inside.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.790
I wash my face, brush
my teeth quickly.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.560
I'm like, no, man.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.360
Go into a lounge, and it's,
indeed, Figo and Ronaldo

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.650
sitting in the lounge.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.650
I'm like, what the hell?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.620
You know?

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.710
But the important thing
is that whether it's

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.930
the president of the
USA, whether it's Oprah,

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:21.570
whether it's whoever, my
grandfather treated everybody

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.130
equally.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.040
He treated them the same way as
he treated Mama [INAUDIBLE] who

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.990
cooked for us, [INAUDIBLE]
Mike who was a driver,

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.460
Albert, who cleaned the garden.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.700
Because he understands
that we each have

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.824
the capacity and the potential
to achieve greatness.

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:40.240
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
That's wonderful.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.906
So I'm going to talk
to you a little bit

00:22:41.906 --> 00:22:45.760
about that equilateral
treatment and also in your book

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.370
how you discuss so much
about family dynamics

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.150
and how families, no matter
who they are, fundamentally,

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.840
families, they have, I
think you say, specifically,

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.260
areas in which
they come together,

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.810
decisions that are made
that others resent,

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.290
opportunities that some are
offered that others are not.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.990
And you talk quite
a lot about how

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.270
that is challenging
for your family

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.570
and how that continues
to be a challenge today.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.630
If you had one thing
that you could change

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.220
about the last five years as it
relates to how your family has

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.800
come together, moved
apart, upheld the legacy

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.630
of Nelson Mandela, what is it?

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.277
And how do you
intend to change it?

00:23:25.277 --> 00:23:26.360
NDABA MANDELA: Five years?

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.010
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Five years, yes.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.540
I'm giving you some breath
so you can be picky.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.860
You choose.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.910
Five years.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.910
NDABA MANDELA: I don't
know about the five years

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.490
to be honest with you, but
for me, we need more unity.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.300
We need more love.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.570
Because what's happening is
that competition is good,

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.490
but also competition
gets to a point

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:52.320
where it's bad,
where it's negative.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.450
Competing to the level where
you push your brother down

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:02.430
and you don't acknowledge him,
or go with him, be together,

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.790
that is negative
competition for me.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.120
So that is the one thing
I would like to change.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:15.330
But also these are all
normal family dynamics.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.510
Each and every single one
of us who come from a family

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.390
experience that in our families.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.040
You know?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.870
So for me, we should
not be caught up in it.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.240
We should always try--

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.700
at least try-- even if they
cut you out of whatever event,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.580
always incorporate your family.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.320
Because, for me, I wouldn't
be here in this position

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.250
today if I didn't
have my family.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.680
So you can imagine
it's quite difficult.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.157
Because we are from a
polygamist background.

00:24:53.157 --> 00:24:53.990
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: OK.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.570
NDABA MANDELA: We are
polygamists by nature.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.790
And, actually, our tribe
are the originators

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:03.900
of polygamy in the southern
African region of Africa.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.180
We are the ones who came up with
the rules and coven polygamy.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:13.130
So a lot of the time when you
have one wife, second wife,

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.310
third wife, and then
those, children,

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.440
the children are
the ones who get

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.810
affected the most because
they are used as pawns

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.880
in trying to play
important roles when

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.240
it comes to who gets what.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.240
The man has died.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.210
He was worth $10 million.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.451
Who's getting what?

00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:35.450
Who's getting the house?

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.305
Who's getting what?

00:25:36.305 --> 00:25:37.220
You know what I mean?

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.010
So this is where you
see the real predatory

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.050
side of human beings.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:49.450
And so in our culture
as polygamists,

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.110
our rule is that
your second wife

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.540
has to be related
to your first wife.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.230
Your second wife is
actually a niece,

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.110
is a cousin of your first wife.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.030
It's for the protection
of the children.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.470
Because if you marry
sisters, then they

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.760
won't fight over the kids,
because they're sisters.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.850
These are your kids.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:13.350
Right?

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.770
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Right.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.390
They become communal.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.510
NDABA MANDELA: It
becomes one thing.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.450
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:21.620
NDABA MANDELA: So in a way, I
mean, it sounds a bit savage.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.401
But it's got its points.

00:26:23.401 --> 00:26:23.900
Right?

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.650
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Like, it's like
your first exposure to politics

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.090
in many ways is at home.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.590
Yeah.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.910
NDABA MANDELA: And so
our family, the Mandelas,

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:38.300
come from the fourth house
in the royal kingdom.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.540
So the first wife
is the great house.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.810
The second wife is
a right-hand house.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.510
The third wife is
the left-hand house.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.960
And we are from
the junior house,

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.770
and we have a very specific
role in the kingdom.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.880
We are counselors to the
king, and we are mediators,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.460
because the first house
and the second house

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.994
are always fighting
over the crown.

00:27:03.994 --> 00:27:05.660
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And
that's interesting,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.180
because a lot of the
legacy of your father

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.280
is actually to
unite, in many ways,

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.400
with your grandfather, who I
now think of as your father

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.280
since you speak so much of
him being as a father to you.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.890
But you talk a lot
about counseling,

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.620
and reunification, and the
way that Nelson Mandela

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.979
dealt with South
Africa as a new nation.

00:27:24.979 --> 00:27:27.020
You talk about how you
really thought of struggle

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:32.750
as black and white, as white
people being oppressive

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.649
all of the time, and
black people needing

00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:35.690
to fight and resist that.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.765
But Nelson Mandela,
in the beginning,

00:27:37.765 --> 00:27:39.140
and the formation
of the country,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.780
took a very different tact.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.340
How did that develop?

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.060
And how did that inform
your perspective now?

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.120
NDABA MANDELA: Well, I think you
have to go through it as well.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.290
Like-- like Nelson
Mandela went through it.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.960
He was obviously fighting
against the white, apartheid

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:05.120
government, and at some
point, they got frustrated.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.950
They felt that their peaceful
protests and marches were not

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:14.570
going anywhere and felt
that they need to hit back

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.620
at the enemy, which they did.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.830
So Nelson Mandela actually
trained military six months

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.740
in Algeria, six
months in Ethiopia

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.230
with Emperor Haile Selassie--

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.930
for those who are Rastafari
or Jamaican who know who that

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.440
is, great emperor of Ethiopia--

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.060
and came back into the country,
organized his comrades,

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.740
and started bombing
the apartheid system.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:47.277
So Mandela was not always
peaceful and forgiving.

00:28:47.277 --> 00:28:49.360
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Right,
but then he develops that.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.970
So how did that
transition happen for you,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.187
and how did it happen
for the country?

00:28:54.187 --> 00:28:56.020
Because at one point,
that's the expectation

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.000
is that he was very
different than-- you know,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.230
you talked about Dr.
Martin Luther King.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.940
You talked about civil
disobedience came from that.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.180
But Nelson Mandela took a
completely different tact.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.490
He took a tact that was more
like, by any means necessary.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.490
And then there is a
shift when the country

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.790
comes into its formation of
having to do the reunification.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.800
How do you feel like
that evolution happened?

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.569
And where do you think the
country is at now with it?

00:29:20.569 --> 00:29:22.360
NDABA MANDELA: I think
for me it was really

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.180
through traveling,
meeting people

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.310
from different backgrounds.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.430
You know, in our country,
the white people,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:39.360
they are still stuck in those
caveman era is what I call it.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.630
And it's very hard
for them, because they

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.570
don't understand that
our country was built

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:50.140
by black and white people.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.410
It was built by everybody there.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.160
Yes, you designed
it, and you had

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.880
the machines, and the
engineering, but who actually

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.080
did the physical work?

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.140
It was black people.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.390
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: That's right.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.265
NDABA MANDELA: So both
black and white people

00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:06.820
built this country.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.860
And so I was also quite angry
at white people in South Africa.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.980
But then when I traveled--

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.490
and that's also why I started
Africa Rising Foundation--

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.800
I met complete
strangers, white people.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.330
You know?

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.590
You meet them, and
they want to help you.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.489
And you're like, wow, OK.

00:30:27.489 --> 00:30:29.155
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Maybe
you're all right.

00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:29.490
You know?

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.490
NDABA MANDELA: You know?

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.340
You're not so bad.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.260
And then you continue, and you
continue, and meet strangers

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.956
and you're like, wow, and
then you go back home.

00:30:39.956 --> 00:30:41.580
It's like, oh, but
these ones are still

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.587
stuck back in the days.

00:30:42.587 --> 00:30:44.170
And then you travel,
you're like, hey,

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.889
but we are moving forward here.

00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:47.680
But then you go back
home, you're like, oh,

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680
but we're still stuck.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.554
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:30:49.554 --> 00:30:52.680
NDABA MANDELA: So you
realize that, actually,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.070
because you are exposed, because
you are privileged enough

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.820
to travel and see
the world at large,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:05.230
shouldn't you then go back home
and show them the better way?

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.150
Shouldn't you go home
and try and inspire them

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.050
to say, guys, we can
actually move forward

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:17.090
in a way that is beneficial
for all of us, for all of us?

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:21.300
And so that was one of the major
things that happened to me.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.950
You know, the traveling,
meeting people,

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.140
and seeing a
different perspective.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.300
And that's why I think it's such
an important thing to travel.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.660
Because you learn about
yourself as much as

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.170
you learn about other people.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:36.850
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: That's right.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.520
NDABA MANDELA: And you learn--
the different cultures teach

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.550
you how people do the
same things you do,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.890
but in a different way.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:50.624
And there's no substitute
for that kind of learning.

00:31:50.624 --> 00:31:52.040
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
That's excellent.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.360
I want to thank you--

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.560
because I want to open
it up for questions--

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.830
but I deeply want to thank
you for writing a book that

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:01.460
takes us through the very
personal and political,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:06.680
but mostly enriching story
about you and your family

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.020
and growing up with
your grandfather.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.780
Thank you so much.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.100
NDABA MANDELA: Thank you.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:10.700
Thank you very much.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.241
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Thank you very much.

00:32:12.241 --> 00:32:12.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.640
I just want to open it up.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.950
There are mikes on either side.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.000
So go ahead and line up for any
questions that you might have.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.780
And we have 15
minutes for questions.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.987
So we'll take about six or seven
questions for the audience.

00:32:25.987 --> 00:32:27.570
Otherwise, I'm going
to keep grilling,

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.790
because I have many more
questions right here.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.956
NDABA MANDELA: I saw a lady
there with the blue top.

00:32:31.956 --> 00:32:34.370
She wants to ask a question.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:35.990
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Any questions?

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.740
NDABA MANDELA: No?

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.615
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:38.990
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
We'll let it sit

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.350
in the silence for a few
minutes while they decide.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.880
It just takes them
a few minutes.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.470
Yes?

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.540
Please say your name.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.550
AUDIENCE: I'm Cathy.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.330
And thank you for
coming to Google today.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.330
Because I just want to
keep going on this point.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.870
You're talking
about travel and how

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.270
that changed your perspective.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:00.650
Is the answer to world peace
travel for the average person?

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.980
Should the United Nations
become a travel agency

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.450
and just move people around?

00:33:08.155 --> 00:33:09.530
NDABA MANDELA:
No, of course not.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.180
It should not be
a travel agency.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:17.630
But I definitely urge
people to travel.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.820
Because you guys
work for Google.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.340
You have lots of money.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.740
You guys are rich.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.200
So travel at least once a year.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.200
I mean, you have money.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.060
Yes, I think it would
be a great opportunity

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.270
to allow ordinary people--

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.450
everyday people-- to be able
to have that opportunity,

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.170
especially young people.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.176
I work a lot with Americans.

00:33:49.176 --> 00:33:50.300
They travel to our village.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.750
They sponsor us.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.945
We do all kinds of programs.

00:33:52.945 --> 00:33:57.890
So now we're working on a
program to take some of my kids

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.120
in our village to bring
them here for two weeks

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.570
and do the whole thing.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.300
I think that's very important.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.219
And what's also important,
just as much as travel,

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.400
is mentorship.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.320
Mentorship today it's not
like it used to be before.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:22.301
Like, we've grown up wanting
to be lawyers, doctors.

00:34:22.301 --> 00:34:23.800
Now, you ask the
kids what they want

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.810
to be, they want to
be DJs, and dancers,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.989
and super creators in
that creative space.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.800
But those people are not
always the best role models,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.530
because they don't even
acknowledge their own role--

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:43.360
the influence they
have on young people.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.159
So it's very important that
we mentor and take time

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.929
to mentor young people.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:55.160
And I say to everybody,
what does it take out

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.910
of you to sit with a
young person one hour

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.725
a week on a Saturday?

00:34:59.725 --> 00:35:04.330
It doesn't take anything,
one hour a week sitting with

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:09.400
a young person, finding
out how their week was,

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.980
questions from their
homework, doing anything,

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.240
even if you sit with somebody
you in your beautiful apartment

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.560
in Chelsea, or Tribeca, or
wherever you are-- in Harlem,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.340
right--

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.550
and you talk to a
young person in Togo,

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:31.390
in a village in [NON-ENGLISH],,
[NON-ENGLISH],, anywhere.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:37.060
But our kids, they
finish high school

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.360
without even
touching a computer.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.430
So how are we going to be
able to compete and stand

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.280
shoulder-to-shoulder
with global citizens

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.580
when my kids don't even touch
a computer by the time they

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.330
finish high school?

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:58.520
So it's important that we bring
this access to information,

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.980
this access to the
world to young people,

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.530
whether it's through
mentorship or traveling.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.200
Those, for me, are the
two critical things

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.795
that we need to do more of.

00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:12.920
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.586
I'm just going to
take another question.

00:36:14.586 --> 00:36:17.960
AUDIENCE: I'm trying to
reach the mic [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.910
Thank you for coming here today.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.750
I wanted to touch back
on where you expressed

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:29.910
that you were angry at
the whites in South Africa

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.780
because you didn't understand
until you ventured out

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.200
through travel.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.300
Now, we all in this room know
that there are parts of the US

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.290
today where a lot
of our colored folk

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.650
are not exposed to the
opportunities to travel,

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:49.640
and that some of our children
may very well be angry

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.890
because they are not
aware unto what connecting

00:36:54.890 --> 00:37:01.220
with other people outside of
the situations or circumstances

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.340
that they may be going
through, like through poverty.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.170
So how do you feel about--

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:13.580
how would that shift for
kids that may not have access

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.630
to those resources to broaden
the way that they may think

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.485
or experience interactions with
different races and cultures?

00:37:21.485 --> 00:37:23.610
NDABA MANDELA: How can that
shift for young people?

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.151
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:27.380
So you stated that you
grew up privileged,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:32.390
and so you were allotted the
experiences to travel and meet

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.280
others, even though
at some point

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.080
you were angry at the
whites in South Africa

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.650
and that meeting people, other
whites in other countries,

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.800
helped you to break that
mental state that you were in.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.520
So I'm saying that you do
have, even here, where there

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.850
are some children that may never
get the opportunity to travel,

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.760
being that their parents may
not be able to afford it,

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:01.970
or they don't have parents,
how would you advise

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:06.167
would be a way to shift that
focus in the circumstance

00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:07.250
that they're in right now?

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.715
How would they be able
to break out of that?

00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:11.840
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: What's
your advice to young people

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.520
here in the States who
may not be able to travel?

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.894
AUDIENCE: --be
able to have that?

00:38:18.586 --> 00:38:19.710
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:25.610
NDABA MANDELA:
Well, again, we need

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.980
to empower young
people to believe in

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.850
themselves so that they can
understand that they are

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:41.180
the masters of their destiny and
that they can achieve anything

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.250
they set their mind to.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:48.630
So that's why a mentorship
is so important.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:52.480
Because when you tell a
young person to dream,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:58.860
and I want them to dream so big
that their dream scares them,

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.200
right--

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.700
the dream that they
dream, they must

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.790
think that it's
impossible to achieve.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.560
Because if you think about
Nelson Mandela, at that moment,

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.455
people thought it would be
impossible to achieve freedom.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:20.300
You know, when they started
organizing themselves

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:26.920
and saying, we need to get back
at the system, it was his PA,

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.740
Barbara Masekela,
very powerful lady,

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.390
told me that it was only the
two of them in that class.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.160
And the rest of the class--

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.860
40 people-- said, no.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.460
Stop this.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.793
You're going to get us in
trouble with the white people.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.767
When you start coming here
talking about freedom,

00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:48.100
you're going to get us in
trouble with the white people.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.290
Stop your nonsense.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.280
Right?

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.470
And because they were dreaming
and they believed so much--

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.260
so that's what we have to
do to our young people.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.970
We have to give them that
opportunity and the freedom

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:09.420
to dream, to make them
understand that they are

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.000
the masters of their destiny.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.860
And we have to surround them
with people that encourage them

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.880
every day to dream,
people that love

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.250
them who want to
see them succeed,

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.687
who want to see them grow.

00:40:24.687 --> 00:40:26.270
Because you don't
have the opportunity

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.870
to travel or anything,
but in your own place,

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.420
you need to surround
yourself with the people that

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.980
believe in you.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.770
And we have to do the
same thing for kids,

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.380
to make sure that
they're in an environment

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:44.370
even they see terrible
things happening around them,

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.240
but if they have one or
two people in their lives

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.180
who believe in them
wholeheartedly and will

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.050
do anything to make
sure they succeed,

00:40:54.050 --> 00:41:00.960
to give them that encouragement,
it's very important.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.655
That's what I think.

00:41:02.655 --> 00:41:04.280
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: What
I hear you saying

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.000
is that in the case of Mandela,
he had one other classmate who

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.830
believed in him,
and that's really

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.350
all it took for him to see
beyond the circumstance,

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.434
beyond the potential anger,
repercussion, to action.

00:41:15.434 --> 00:41:17.600
And we need to make sure
that we supply our children

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.970
with at least one person
who believes in them

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.600
and can move them forward.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.750
Thank you for that.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.790
AUDIENCE: So tell us more about
what you do with Africa Rising

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.240
and what are your dreams for
building a better Africa?

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:29.880
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.715
NDABA MANDELA: Thank you.

00:41:30.715 --> 00:41:31.215
Thank you.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.520
So we started Africa
Rising because we realized

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.920
that people outside
the continent

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.130
had very little
understanding of Africa.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.040
And most of the understanding
that they have was negative,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.040
that Africa was a place
of poverty, war, disease,

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.805
dictators, and the only positive
thing, really, is safari.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.800
So the positive things
in Africa is the animals,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.930
not the people, the animals.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:05.252
So as I traveled,
I said, no, man.

00:42:05.252 --> 00:42:06.710
We have to do
something about this.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.720
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.450
NDABA MANDELA: And
so we went back

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:12.695
home, gathered our friends.

00:42:12.695 --> 00:42:14.820
You know, at that time, I
was working for Investec,

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.510
which is the number one, or
one of the top investment

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.490
banks in Africa.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:22.950
So I gathered all the eight
people that worked there,

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.309
all the eight black
people that worked there--

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:30.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.300
And when I was trying
to explain to them,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.450
they already were on the
same perspective as me.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.560
They felt the very same way.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.220
And I realized that it
was nothing special to me.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:47.170
It was on the minds and the
hearts of young Africans

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:51.430
that people need to engage
with Africa on a much more

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.200
positive level.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.420
Because majority of
people don't know that

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.300
the top seven growing economies
in the world are in Africa.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.200
When you look at Hugo Boss,
or Louis Vuitton, or H&amp;M,

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.540
all the inspiration to
design those clothes coming

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.325
from Africa.

00:43:10.325 --> 00:43:12.450
I don't have to tell you
about the music and dance.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.430
You already know.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.460
Right?

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.460
But everything now
that you see is really

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.690
getting inspired from Africa.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:25.390
So I want people to
travel to Africa,

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:26.990
to come and spend the holiday.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.270
You go to Mauritius,
which is an island

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:31.370
on the east coast of Africa.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.290
You go to the west
coast of Africa.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.690
There's another
beautiful island--

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.740
or many beautiful islands.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:45.440
You go to Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zanzibar, the most splendid,

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:52.670
crystal blue water, pink lakes,
pink sand, natural pink lakes.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.460
Where have you ever seen that?

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.410
Only in Africa.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:04.990
So for me it's about
empowering the new generation

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.590
of African leaders to be at
the forefront of Africa's

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.770
development so that they
can be the number one

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.010
beneficiaries of the
development that's taking place,

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.680
not the multinational
corporations that are coming

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.440
just to take away the value.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.760
I want Africans to
be at the forefront

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.980
so that they empower
themselves so that we

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.610
can break the cycle of
poverty that exists.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.250
I dream of an Africa
where we don't know--

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.450
I don't have to--

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.599
I don't need a visa
to go to Nigeria.

00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:35.140
Because right now
I need a visa to go

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.210
to Nigeria and vise versa.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.880
I dream of an Africa where
the leaders are actually there

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.660
to take care of the people
and actually do what

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.662
their job is supposed to do.

00:44:49.662 --> 00:44:52.120
Because, currently, leaders
are there to fill up their bank

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.360
accounts using state resources
to put in their pocket.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.452
Not all, but majority.

00:45:02.452 --> 00:45:06.500
Majority of the leaders
don't want to step off.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.805
You've got a guy who's been
in prison for 27 years.

00:45:10.805 --> 00:45:12.680
Do you know the
longest-serving president was

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.510
from a country called Gabon.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:15.620
40 years.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:16.770
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: 40 years.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.840
NDABA MANDELA: 40 years
the man was president.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.910
How ridiculous is that?

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:21.950
Right?

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:25.160
So I wanted a more
united Africa,

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.520
an Africa that trades more
with itself than with China

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.290
or with Europe.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:35.320
Because we have
everything that we

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:41.980
need in order for us to
stop exporting iron ore,

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.870
or rough diamonds.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:49.540
We can actually produce
beautiful rings,

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.810
and beautiful clothes,
and not all is just

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:56.750
exporting primary products.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.125
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Control the
entire cycle of development.

00:45:59.125 --> 00:45:59.916
NDABA MANDELA: Yes.

00:45:59.916 --> 00:46:02.610
We need the whole value
chain, the whole value chain.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.800
And we have it.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.450
But of course, without
the leadership,

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:11.905
it becomes very difficult.

00:46:11.905 --> 00:46:13.030
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:17.230
I'm going to take one last
question and then a few closing

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:18.981
statements, and we're
going to get going.

00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:19.480
Yes?

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:19.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.410
I'm Christina.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.795
Thanks for coming today.

00:46:21.795 --> 00:46:22.160
NDABA MANDELA: Thank you.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.950
AUDIENCE: I actually
just moved back here

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.960
after living in
Kenya for six years,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.535
and I work on the Africa region.

00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:28.576
NDABA MANDELA: Very nice.

00:46:28.576 --> 00:46:30.910
AUDIENCE: So I would love
to know how can Google,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.070
or what role can
Google play in helping

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:34.880
Africa Rising and your mission?

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.880
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: You just
took my last question.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.588
That's excellent.

00:46:37.588 --> 00:46:39.394
Thank you.

00:46:39.394 --> 00:46:41.560
NDABA MANDELA: Do you want
me to be honest with you?

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:41.740
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:42.323
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:44.242 --> 00:46:45.700
NDABA MANDELA: You
know, I traveled

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.060
to the Google Zeitgeist
three or four years ago.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.340
It was in Arizona, Phoenix.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.311
And I met all the
top dogs there.

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:55.060
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: You
didn't meet me there.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:55.685
I wasn't there.

00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:56.518
NDABA MANDELA: Not--

00:46:56.518 --> 00:46:57.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:57.800
NDABA MANDELA: Where were you?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.540
Where were you?

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:58.795
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Continue.

00:46:58.795 --> 00:46:59.050
Continue.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.175
NDABA MANDELA: Anyway, nah.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.660
Nick Cash at the time,
all the top guys.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.590
Lorraine Twohill.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.200
Where's she at?

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.650
She's a lovely lady.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:16.430
Anyway, so there
was a Google person

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:20.010
who was now sent into Africa.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:26.960
And that person was
there to make business--

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.640
to make business.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.490
They were not there to
support, to encourage.

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:32.290
No.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.150
They were there to
establish a business.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.600
So Google needs to
change their perspective.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.870
You have so much money.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.930
Why are you're always
looking for more money?

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.237
What are you going to
do with all this money?

00:47:43.237 --> 00:47:45.320
Are you going to die in
your grave with a Ferrari?

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.064
Are you going to bury yourself
in the Ferrari under the grave?

00:47:48.064 --> 00:47:49.480
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
I'm not going to.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:49.970
NDABA MANDELA: You
understand what I'm saying?

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:50.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:58.440
So Google needs to also
look at how can they

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:05.100
grow with the people,
not take from the people,

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.020
but grow with the people.

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.992
You need to train and
empower young minds

00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:13.200
to become at the forefront
of this development that's

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.310
taking place and not always
look at it from that perspective

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:22.372
to say, oh, there's a huge,
growing young population here.

00:48:22.372 --> 00:48:24.330
You know, the buying
power in the next 10 years

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.640
is going to be over
a trillion dollars.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.300
How do we make sure
that we get a big pie?

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.454
What a big pie.

00:48:30.454 --> 00:48:31.620
We want a big piece of that.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.090
No.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.490
How do we make sure that
we're helping people

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.340
to break the cycle of
poverty so that they

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.820
can live better lives?

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.050
And so they don't have to
struggle with HIV/AIDS?

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:48.204
That's what Google needs to do.

00:48:48.204 --> 00:48:51.676
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.090
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I'm
smiling because we're often

00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.920
told that you have
to make a business

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.214
case for doing the right thing.

00:49:01.214 --> 00:49:02.630
But we don't need
a business case.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.070
We can just do the right thing.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.100
That's what I hear you saying.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.440
NDABA MANDELA: Nelson
Mandela says, time

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.195
is always ripe to do right.

00:49:11.195 --> 00:49:12.320
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.819
And with that, we're
going to close.

00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:16.380
Thank you so much for joining
us at Google New York.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:16.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.021
NDABA MANDELA: Thank you.

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.130
Thank you.
