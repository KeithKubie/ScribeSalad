00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.950
Welcome to the wild and fabulous world of
Max Ernst "Beyond Painting."

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.569
If everybody will pause.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.299
This is a wonderful photo of Max Ernst taken
in 1941 by Arnold Newman and it shows Max

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.131
Ernst sitting in Peggy Guggenheim's apartment
here in New York City where he lived out part

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:20.870
of World War II.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.890
Ernst was born in 1891 in a little town just
outside Cologne in Germany.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.560
He went on to serve for four years in the
German army during World War I, and he returned

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.370
from that experience traumatized to Cologne
where he founded Cologne Dada.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.399
So, this is the exhibition.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.320
One of the fabulous things about this show
is that it is drawn virtually entirely from

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.949
the Museum of Modern Art's own collection.

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.860
There are 100 works on view here and as you
look around you can see that Max Ernst is

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.890
an artist who works on paper.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.660
He makes print portfolios.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.660
He makes books.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.749
He makes oil paintings.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.190
He makes collages and he makes reliefs.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:10.050
So we're looking at a group of collages and
over paintings that Max Ernst made while living

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.460
in Cologne in the 1920s, 1920 and in 1921.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.030
So one thing

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.300
So one thing that's very fun to do in the
show is to pay attention to all the little

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.910
inscriptions that he puts on things.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.780
Here he's made it a little hard for you to
see but if you look along the bottom it says,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.770
"La Biciclette graminée garnie de grelots
…” blah, blah, blah, which translates,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.040
we did this for you, as "The Gramineous Bicycle
Garnished with Bells the Dappled Fire Damps

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.060
and the Echinoderms Bending the Spine to Look
for Caresses."

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.341
The way that he made this picture is he took
a pedagogical chart, a teaching chart, that

00:01:55.341 --> 00:02:02.760
was used to, I believe, illustrate the mutation,
the metamorphosis of brewer's yeast cells.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.129
So he takes this poster and the first thing
he does is he turns it upside down.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:15.900
He goes in with black paint and he begins
to cover over...to over paint, to censor out

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.810
parts of the original image.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.349
He adds along the bottom this wonderful little
gray platform or stage which sort of angles

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.349
in like that.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.249
And if you think about how, in old fashion,
a Renaissance painting, the device that's

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:37.290
used to construct an illusionistic perspectival
space, that kind of orthogonal recession,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.159
as one of the key things.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.540
But, of course, Ernst quotes it.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.359
He sets the stage and then at the same time
other parts of the picture are so resolutely

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.359
flat.

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:55.680
he goes in and he adds little wheels and gears
and these great kind of flippy flappy...I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.010
don’t know what you would call them…fins
on the side of what was a yeast cell.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.959
And it now looks for all the world like some
sort of tightrope walker.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.739
So he creates this great animated...I think
one author has described it as a circus, right,

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.569
kind of a circus fantasy from something that
at the start was prosaic and didactic.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.799
So all of these are over paintings or collages
that use found imagery in different ways.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.749
So I’m just looking here…

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.209
“Weib, Greis, und Blume.”

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.180
So now, again, you get the little text here,
his signature.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.439
So Ernst, even before leaving Cologne, is
thinking about...he's thinking about what

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:42.540
happens if you translate his collage or his
over painting strategies into the larger format

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.419
of oil on canvas.

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.279
This work was one that he began in 1923.

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:53.950
He completed and then he went back to it later
just like it was a found poster, a reproduction,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.329
but it's his own picture.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.359
He said one of the things that he loved about
this was that it enabled him to achieve a

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.489
much insaner effect, right?

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.840
So a more immediate, hallucinatory quality
that I think comes through.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
Okay.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.620
So should we look at other things?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.620
Okay.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.919
So what we're looking at here is one of my
very, very favorite groups of works in the

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.120
show.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.460
It’s 16 images selected from a portfolio
of 34 that was called "Histoire Naturelle"

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.081
or "Natural History" that Ernst published
in 1926.

00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:37.289
The technique used to generate these images
is called frottage which is a French word

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.650
for rubbing.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.699
And if you get in close to any one of these,
you can see that the way that Ernst generated

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:54.889
these pictures was by placing paper over found
objects, found textures, and then he would

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:55.889
rub.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.580
And then he would rub over those found textures.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.800
So now he's gone from found imagery to found
materials, again, another way of having an

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.620
assist, a collaborator, something, from the
real world that he is using to provoke images

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.330
in his art sort of as a quasi-automatist technique.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.490
And then he goes back in, right, and selectively
adds details to transform what could have

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.250
just been an inert pattern into these strange
beings and beasties.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:35.080
He welcomed the way that reproduction, printing
processes removed his image one further step

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.800
from the tactile material physical thing because
it heightens the illusionism of them.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.349
Anyway, this is called, this collage, "Loplop
Introduces Members of the Surrealist Group"

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:52.509
and Loplop was Ernst's most beloved and well-known
alter ego.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:59.879
He described Loplop as a hybrid creature that
was half bird, half human.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.110
This was first published in a surrealist magazine.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.699
It's almost an advertisement of sorts for
who belong to the surrealist movement at the

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.280
moment this was created in 1931.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280
And as you go through it, saw this point out.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.220
You can see Max Ernst right there.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.629
There's Salvador Dali; Paul Eluard who collaborated
with Ernst in some of his poetry books; Andre

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:26.410
Breton; the photographer, Man Ray; Luis Buñuel,
the great filmmaker; Tanguy; Giacometti—they're

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.810
sort of all there.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:36.360
Passing by I should point out that Max Ernst,
beginning in the mid-30s, started to make

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.830
sculptures so we're very lucky to have some
examples of those in the collection too.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:54.710
And ,he in 1941, escaped from Europe and moved
to the United States and here on this wall,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:02.000
and this picture in particular, is one of
the first that he completed upon his arrival

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.349
in 1941.

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:08.539
Its title is "Napoleon in the Wilderness."

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:16.389
It's work that he began in France before he
left and then completed in the United States,

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.220
in California.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.360
Apparently, he drove to with Peggy Guggenheim
in her convertible on a road trip across country

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.389
from the East Coast.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:31.860
It was produced using a technique that is
referred to as the decalcomania.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:39.490
The way that he makes all these different
textures and variegated tones and colors is

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:47.360
by taking a pane of glass or paper, pressing
it in wet paint and then transferring it to

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.970
the canvas that again produces a chance or
a semi-automatic texture.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:05.009
He wrote about this work subsequently as one
that perhaps was an inadvertent expression

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:09.719
of how he felt himself to be at the time that
he could empathize.

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:12.789
This isn’t a triumphant Napoleon in the
wilderness.

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:14.999
It's not a victorious Napoleon.

00:08:14.999 --> 00:08:20.849
It's Napoleon in exile on the island of Alba
painted at a moment when Ernst himself is

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:22.039
living in exile.

00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:25.949
The latest works in the show or the last work,
the culminating work which is, in fact, the

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:26.949
most recently acquired.

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:33.810
It's a book called "65 Maximiliana" that Ernst
created in collaboration with a book designer

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.110
and publisher called Illiazd.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:44.970
so just in brief, what this is, "65 Maximiliana,"
is an homage on Ernst's part to unsung 19th-century

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:50.800
astronomer named Wilhelm Ernst Tempel or maybe
it's Ernst Wilhelm Tempel.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.880
I can't remember.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.800
Anyway, Ernst is in there somewhere and the
title "Maximiliana" refers to the name of

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:05.010
a planetoid that Tempel discovered in 1861
and named after the then king of Bavaria.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:11.080
But, of course, Max Ernst I'm sure, with his
penchant for self-reference and self-mythologizing,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:19.250
must have loved that Maximiliana contains
the name Max and that Tempel's first name

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.579
includes Ernst.

00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:23.420
So there's always kind of that circling back.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:30.829
We love concluding the show with this because
if you think at the beginning of Ernst looking

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:37.140
at these small microscopic worlds, and then
by the end of his life looking up right to

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.370
the planets and to the stars.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.779
And back to his saying when asked, "What is
your favorite occupation?"

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:47.550
he's always saying, "Seeing.”

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:53.279
This project and this homage to an unsung
astronomer who has parallels with his own

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.110
life seems like a very poignant way to end.
