00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.181
The Suprising Cost of the NIke Logo

00:00:02.181 --> 00:00:06.700
The creator of one of the most well-known
logos in history, the Nike “swoosh” logo,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.860
was originally only paid $35 for it.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.450
The woman is Carolyn Davidson.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.100
At the time she created the now world famous
logo, Davidson was a student at Portland State

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.710
University where one of the co-founders of
Nike, Phil Knight, was teaching as an assistant

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.380
professor in accounting.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.800
On the side, Knight ran a business called
Blue Ribbon Sports, the precursor to Nike.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.350
(Blue Ribbon Sports primarily was a distributor
of Onitsuka Tiger shoes from Japan.)

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100
It was simply by chance that Davidson met
Knight at all.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.039
She was in the middle of a conversation with
a fellow student in the graphics design department

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.749
explaining that she didn’t have enough money
to take an oil painting class.

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.050
Knight overheard and later approached her
and asked her if she’d be interested in

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.600
doing some graphics work for his business,
offering her $2 an hour for the gig (about

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479
$14 per hour today).

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.239
Davidson accepted and began doing various
freelance jobs for Blue Ribbon Sports, mostly

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.350
making charts and things of this nature.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.030
A few years later, Knight decided it was time
to take his business to the next level, moving

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.270
away from being just a U.S. distributor of
Japanese running shoes and, rather, producing

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.630
and selling his own shoe lines.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.869
Thus, in 1971, Knight asked Davidson to design
a “stripe”, which was the slang term at

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.189
the time for a logo for a shoe.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.920
He further instructed her that he wanted it
to give the impression of motion.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.121
Knight was particularly fond of the Adidas
logo, and though he said it couldn’t look

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.159
too similar to that, he was apparently enamored
by it.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.820
As Davidson said,
“Oh, he loved Adidas.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.509
That was part of my problem.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.369
He loved the Adidas stripes, he loved them.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.590
Well, when you really love something, try
to get somebody to look over here at something

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.829
different.”

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.320
Davidson doodled for nearly three weeks, estimating
she worked well over the 17.5 hours often

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.500
touted, to come up with the logo.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.670
Her process was to draw “a picture of a
shoe and then I drew (logos) on tissue.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.079
I’d lay it over.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.630
And then I’d [crumple it up] because it
has to look good on a shoe.”

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.170
Finally, with a deadline looming, Davidson
presented five or six designs for Knight,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.149
Jeff Johnson (who would later suggest the
name “Nike” for the brand), and Bob Woodell

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.149
to look over.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.730
(She can’t remember the exact number of
logos she presented, nor does anyone remember

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.700
the exact date it was created.)

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.280
Knight’s response was underwhelming.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.250
The first design he looked at was the “swoosh”,
he passed it up and looked at the rest, than

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.269
came back to it and said the words every designer
longs to hear, “I don’t love it, but I

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.150
think it will grow on me.”

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.879
Somewhat disappointed at his reaction, Davidson
asked for time to perfect the design, but

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.900
Knight said no.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.100
She then submitted her invoice of $35 (about
$195 today).

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.700
Some might think she was ripped off for the
work, considering the logo she created went

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.129
on to become one of the most well known in
the world.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.330
However, Davidson didn’t see it this way
as she was happy with the wages at the time

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.330
and had agreed to make the logo for that amount,
so fair’s fair.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.450
The fact that it became world famous was simply
a nice feather in her cap.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.330
However, this is not the end of the tale.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.590
For starters, after leaving Nike in 1975 (she
had been given a job there after graduating

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.500
from college in 1971) she went on to freelance,
and being the designer of the Nike logo certainly

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.870
helped her acquire clients over the years.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.530
A more direct benefit happened in 1983, a
few years after the company went public.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.670
Knight decided to honor Davidson for having
created the company’s logo and for her early

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.470
work with Nike, so invited her to lunch, which
actually turned out to be a surprise party

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.659
in her honor.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.379
At the party, he gave her a gold ring that
had the swoosh on the top with a diamond in

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.379
it.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.379
But this wasn’t the big payoff.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.970
He also gave her, according to Davidson, 500
shares of the company.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.189
So how much were 500 shares of Nike worth
at the time?

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.530
Around $8000 or about $18,000 today.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.360
Quite a sum given Knight was not obligated
to give her anything, nor was there any pressure

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.420
to do so.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.769
But this wasn’t the end of it.

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.130
Davidson never cashed out those 500 shares
of Nike stock.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.579
Since that time, there have been four instances
where the stock has been split, meaning today

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.570
those 500 shares are now 8000 shares.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.110
At the current stock price of a little over
$97 per share, the $8,000 gift of stock in

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.530
1983 is now worth about 3/4 of a million dollars.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.060
Not too bad for producing something in a couple
weeks of part time work that is essentially

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.019
just a curvy checkmark.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.460
Bonus Facts:
• “Nike” is the Greek goddess of victory,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.749
strength, and speed, the daughter of Styx
and the Titan, Pallas.

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.710
• In the beginning of his shoe selling career,
Knight sent some samples of the Tiger brand

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.880
running shoe to his old track coach, Bill
Bowerman, to get his thoughts on the shoes

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.770
and perhaps get some of Bowerman’s students
to wear them.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.560
Bowerman was impressed and asked to become
a partner in the new company, Blue Ribbon

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.500
Sports, which was officially founded on January
25, 1964.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.370
They started out by buying 300 pairs of the
shoe and selling them out of Knights trunk.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.310
They also began experimenting on the shoe,
to try to make improvements, with Bowerman’s

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.270
track team serving as the guinea pigs.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.120
• Before Nike took off, jobs held by Knight
included an accountant at Coopers &amp; Lybrand,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:24.990
as well as Price Waterhouse, and then an assistant
professor at Portland State.
