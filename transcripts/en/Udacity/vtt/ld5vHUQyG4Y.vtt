00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now for the moment of truth--calculating the circumference of the earth

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in the same way that Eratosthenes did.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now we have this data. The important stuff seems to be this angle alpha.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This distance d which was the distance from Syene to Alexandria and that's 5000 stadia

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and remember 1 stadium was equal to 185 meters.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We have this equation which we found out from the geometry of the earth,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and now I want to know can you tell me in kilometers what is the circumference of the earth.
