00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.730
Most of us are familiar with
the equal sign from our earliest

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.330
days of arithmetic.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.480
You might see something
like 1 plus 1 is equal to 2.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.180
Now, a lot of people might
think when they see something

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.440
like this that somehow equal
means give me the answer.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.100
1 plus 1 is the problem.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.540
Equal means give me the
answer and 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.940
That's not what
equal actually means.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.860
Equal is actually just trying
to compare two quantities.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.250
When I write 1 plus 1
equals 2, that literally

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.640
means that what I
have on the left hand

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.370
side of the equal sign is the
exact same quantity as what

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.420
I have on the right hand
side of the equal sign.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.990
I could have just as easily have
written 2 is equal to 1 plus 1.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.950
These two things are equal.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.250
I could have written
2 is equal to 2.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.040
This is a completely
true statement.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.500
These two things are equal.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.970
I could have written 1 plus
1 is equal to 1 plus 1.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:12.650
I could have written 1 plus 1
minus 1 is equal to 3 minus 2.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.860
These are both equal quantities.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.880
What I have here on
the left hand side,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.680
this is 1 plus 1 minus 1 is 1
and this right over here is 1.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.580
These are both equal quantities.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600
Now I will introduce
you to other ways

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.520
of comparing numbers.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.760
The equal sign is when I
have the exact same quantity

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.805
on both sides.

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:37.180
Now we'll think
about what we can

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.430
do when we have different
quantities on both sides.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.780
So let's say I have the number
3 and I have the number 1

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.140
and I want to compare them.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.130
So clearly 3 and
1 are not equal.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.630
In fact, I could
make that statement

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.080
with a not equal sign.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.740
So I could say 3
does not equal 1.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.410
But let's say I want to figure
out which one is a larger

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.860
and which one is smaller.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.210
So if I want to have some
symbol where I can compare them,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.900
where I can tell, where I can
state which of these is larger.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.536
And the symbol for doing that
is the greater than symbol.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.130
This literally would be
read as 3 is greater than 1.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.450
3 is a larger quantity.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.580
And if you have trouble
remembering what this means--

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.105
greater than-- the larger
quantity is on the opening.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.200
I guess if you could view
this as some type of an arrow,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.370
or some type of symbol, but
this is the bigger side.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.540
Here, you have this
little teeny, tiny point

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.895
and here you have the big
side, so the larger quantity

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:50.850
is on the big side.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.860
This would literally
be read as 3

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.550
is greater than--
so let me write

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.420
that down-- greater than,
3 is greater than 1.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.100
And once again, it just doesn't
have to be numbers like this.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.470
I could write an expression.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:18.130
I could write 1 plus 1 plus 1 is
greater than, let's say, well,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.110
just one 1 right over there.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.800
This is making a comparison.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.910
But what if we had things
the other way around.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.620
What if I wanted to make
a comparison between 5

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.040
and, let's say, 19.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.500
So now the greater than
symbol wouldn't apply.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.320
It's not true that 5
is greater than 19.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.800
I could say that 5
is not equal to 19.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.647
So I could still
make this statement.

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:45.980
But what if I wanted to make
a statement about which one

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.124
is larger and which
one is smaller?

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:49.540
Well, as in plain
English, I would

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.110
want to say 5 is less than 19.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.720
So I would want to say--
let me write that down-- I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:08.890
want to write 5 is less than 19.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.189
That's what I want to say.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.480
And so we just have to think
of a mathematical notation

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.769
for writing "is less than."

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.010
Well, if this is
greater than, it

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.329
makes complete sense that
let's just swap it around.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.292
Let's make, once
again, the point

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:26.400
point towards the smaller
quantity and the big side

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.710
of the symbol point to
the larger quantity.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.810
So here 5 is a smaller
quantity so I'll

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.390
make the point point there.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.050
And 19 is a larger quantity,
so I'll make it open like this.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.320
And so this would be read
as 5 is less than 19.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.160
5 is a smaller quantity than 19.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.700
I could also write this
as 1 plus 1 is less than 1

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.620
plus 1 plus 1.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.830
It's just saying that this
statement, this quantity,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.401
1 plus 1 is less
than 1 plus 1 plus 1.
