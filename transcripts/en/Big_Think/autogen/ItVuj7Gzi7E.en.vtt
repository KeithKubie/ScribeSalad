to even private many provincial towns in
countries like the Netherlands you'll

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000
countries like the Netherlands you'll
 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.850
countries like the Netherlands you'll
suddenly see a very large number of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
 
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.460
 
well if by conservatives you mean

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
well if by conservatives you mean
 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.370
well if by conservatives you mean
Christian conservatives I think because

Christian conservatives I think because

there is a historical antagonism towards
Islam but not it's not necessarily

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
Islam but not it's not necessarily
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.350
Islam but not it's not necessarily
entirely true that there is no common

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360
entirely true that there is no common
 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.690
entirely true that there is no common
ground I think for example when the book

a song on rusty's book was burnt the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100

in favor of tightening up blasphemy laws
and so it's not always true that there's

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
and so it's not always true that there's
 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.069
and so it's not always true that there's
no common ground
