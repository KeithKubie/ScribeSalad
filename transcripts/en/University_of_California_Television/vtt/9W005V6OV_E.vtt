bi-pedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.650
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:48.630
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.130
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

- [Bernard] This is a topic that I have
been thinking about for some time as you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.890
can gauge by the difference in hair color
in that picture and now. But what I want

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.510
to do today is to try and use the
experience of those years to see whether

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.070
it's taught me anything and also to use
some data from some young people. And I'm

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.590
very grateful to Eve Boyle and to Andrew
Du and to David Patterson who are all

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.650
graduate students in the Home Power
Program at the university where I come

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:51.930
from. And I'm mentioning Mark Collard here
because he and I worked on this now a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.380
little time ago and I'm going to say some
things that he might or might not agree

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.450
with and I'm just giving him a warning. So
what, what are we looking for? Homo is a

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:13.740
genus and when Mark and I started to think
about this, we could not find a definition

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.180
of a genus that was universally supported.
So we put together, for our own purposes,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.840
a working definition of a genus and we
suggested that it was “a species or a

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.040
monophyletic group whose members occupy a
single adaptive zone. ” Now let me try and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.900
unpack some of that. For a species to be
included in a genus, it should belong to

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.600
the same monophyletic group as the type
species of that genus. Now the type

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:54.960
species of a genus Homo is Homo sapiens so
what we argued was that the different

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.080
species deserve to belong to Homo then it
should be in the same monophyletic group.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.510
Now a slightly shorter term for
monophyletic group is the word clade and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.030
how do you define a clade? The definition
that we use was “all of the taxa, no more

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.780
and no less, that are descended from a
recent common ancestor. ” Now I like

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.940
metaphors from the car industry and so as
not to let my colleagues down, I got some

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:38.700
new ones here. The common ancestor of all
Toyotas is a Toyoda, it's a model which

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.560
was developed in 1935 by a company, the
company originally made machinery to made

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.100
textiles. So it did not start as a car
company, but they decided that they wanted

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.460
to make cars and they went to America to
learn how to make cars then they went back

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.410
to Japan and they made a car, and it was
the A1. So that's the common ancestor of

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.030
all the models of Toyota that are and have
ever been. So that's what we're looking

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:21.210
for. The notion of the second criterion
was that for a species to be included in

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.980
Homo its adaptive strategy should be
closer to the one of the type species,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.260
i.e.modern humans, than to the type
species of any other genus. So the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.190
candidate species that we are thinking
about including in the genus Homo, that

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.890
and the type species should be part of the
same grade. So, what is a grade? It's just

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.620
a series of questions that I keep... So a
grade is “a group of taxa that shares a

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.390
suite of what we call adaptive features. ”
So we would suggest that if you do share

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.360
those features you are in the same
adaptive zone.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.040
So back to the cars. So the Toyota Motor
Company decided that it should make a

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.690
jeep. It saw the success of the Willys
Jeep, it was a four wheel drive car. So it

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.350
decided to make its own four wheel drive
car. My suggestion is that as soon as you

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.050
make a four wheel drive car, you are in a
new adaptive zone. You are in a different

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.340
adaptive zone and this is the one that
they made. And so my contention is that in

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.270
the Toyota clade, that the BJ which is
what this is, marked the beginning of a

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.000
new adaptive zone of four wheel drive
vehicles. Now you could argue that hybrid

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.480
cars might be a new adaptive zone as well.
You could argue that the design of a

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.100
minivan which was introduced by the Toyota
Motor Company and it was called very

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.630
imaginatively the first one, it was called
a van. Okay. And then the next model was

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.870
called the Previa, and the model that
exceeded that was the one that you see now

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:17.650
called the Sienna. My contention and my
suggestion is that the notion of a minivan

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:25.500
is a new adaptive zone. There are levels
of sophistication. Now the doors open

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.960
electronically and you can argue that, you
know, does the addition of electronic

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.080
opening doors make it a new adaptive zone?
That's up to you. My sense is that it's

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.000
not much different as to whether you open
the door yourself or whether they open

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.300
electrically and so I wouldn't call that a
different adaptive zone. So here, there

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.140
are people who are interested in the
evolution of the four wheel drive vehicles

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:59.430
made by Toyota. And here is an image that
was very kindly found for me by another

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:04.460
graduate student
who is called Alexander Pruca [SP], and

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.250
you can see that there are people who are
interested in the evolutionary history of

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.370
the Land Cruiser. And so, they are
interested in what we are interested in.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:20.110
But the problem is but if all the evidence
you had for the evolutionary history of

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:26.440
the Toyota was a few fragments, maybe part
of the windshield, a little bit of the

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.680
wheel, something from the grill, a little
bit of the fender, or something from the

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.980
hood. And the problem is you didn't even
have the same parts for the different

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:43.450
models that you're trying to link. That
gives you a sense of what we are trying to

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:50.590
do. We do not have the equivalent of the
luxury of all this information about the

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.290
models and the developments within the
evolutionary history of the Toyota Land

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:01.650
Cruiser. So the second question, what
about the who? The genus Homo was

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:11.160
established by Linnaeus way back in the
18th century. And as the years have gone

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:20.080
by, more and more taxa have been added and
they have been included in the genus. So

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.540
initially, the neanderthals were included
and then the taxon called Homo

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:30.550
heidelbergensis and then the taxon called
Homo rhodesiensis and then a taxon called

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:37.520
Homo soloensis. And maybe the biggest
addition was made by Ernst Mayr during the

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:45.390
second World War when he suggested that
the taxa that had been in the genus of the

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:51.460
genera, tymantrabus and the genus
phyticantrobus, should be included in

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:59.810
Homo. So as the years went by, the genus
Homo became more and more inclusive.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:06.710
The criteria for admission were relaxed.
The initial criterion was you had to have

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:12.740
a brain as large as ours. So admitting
Homo neanderthalensis, that wasn't a big,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.020
that wasn't a huge deal because they had
large brains, too. But by the time you get

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:24.010
to including Homo erectus in Homo you are
admitting that this is a genus that can

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:29.810
have individuals that can have brains half
the size of the average modern human. Then

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:37.040
in 1964, Louis Leakey and the person of
the Leakeys had recruited to help them

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.990
interpret the anatomy of their fossils,
Phillip Tobias and John Napier, they

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.210
published a paper in Nature suggesting
that some fossil that had been found at

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:54.570
Olduvai should be included in a new
species and that species name was habilis.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:11:00.040
But maybe more controversially, they
suggested that that species should be

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.710
included in Homo. Now that meant relaxing
the criteria even more and the question

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:15.150
is, was that process of relaxation, that
last process of relaxation, to what extent

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.950
did that stay within the definition of a
genus that Mark and I suggested? In other

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:26.500
words, is Homo habilis part of the same
clade and is Homo habilis part of the same

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:33.570
grade? What we argued in a paper in
Science way back was that we didn't think

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:39.150
the evidence was all that strong, but
let's get back to that. So how has this

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:44.710
process of progressive inclusivity
affected the grade definition of Homo?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.340
This is an extremely speciose
interpretation of the Hominin fossil

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:55.750
record. Modern humans are in the top left.
What I call a gray...which I call

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.180
pre-modern Homo which includes
neanderthals and the heidelbergensis and

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.560
Homo erectus is in the blue.
And then the hominids that Bill Kimble is

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.380
going to be talking about, the mustard
colored ones are down in the bottom right.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.830
And then there are some rather brownish
ones which are rather like the mustard

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.860
colored ones except they have extremely
large molars and pre-molars. These are

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:24.570
animals with very large mandibles and very
large post canine teeth. So the inclusion

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:31.290
of Homo habilis in Homo meant that the
genus Homo would include what I've called

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:39.650
pre-modern Homo plus the taxa that have
called transitional homonins on the basis

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:45.400
of the findings that Mark and I published
way back in 1999. Now I think that paper

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:53.580
was superbly well argued and was extremely
clearly written, but it made hardly any

00:12:53.580 --> 00:13:00.340
impression on my colleagues. And it's fair
to say that apart from a few discerning

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:06.930
and discriminating scientists, most people
still include the taxa Homo habilis and

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.890
Homo rhodesiensis within the genus Homo.
So that's one way of interepreting the

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:17.530
genus Homo. So the origin of the genus
Homo would be how do you explain the

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.300
appearance of Homo habilis? That's another
way of asking the same question. In which

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.550
case, you would include Homo habilis and
Homo rhodesiensis which is some people

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.170
think might be distinct from Homo habilis
but it's a similar sort of organism. You

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.890
would include them in the dark blue
category, in the dark blue grade. If Mark

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.560
and I are correct then you would extend
the genus Homo down that far. You would

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:48.490
stop at the beginning of Homo erectus. In
which case you would regard Homo habilis

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:54.730
and Homo rhodesiensis as not the same
species as the other australopiths but

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.730
nonetheless, within the same adaptive zone
as the other australopiths.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.650
So what has happened since the publication
of the paper in Science that nobody took

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:11.210
any notice of in 1999? More fossil
evidence has been found and not only has

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:16.870
more fossil evidence...more fossils been
found that the existing fossils have been

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.310
reanalyzed and reconstructed and so on. So
that's one development. The other

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.940
development is that we have new data and
there people who are reassessing the

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.200
existing data which relate to what I call
the functional capacities of these

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.420
animals. What can we infer about how
dextrous they were? What can we infer

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:40.240
about how smart they were? What can we
infer about what they were eating? These

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.590
are just a few of the publications that
are relevant to this, but I want to talk

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:53.180
about the categories of the data that
speak to cognition and some new data that

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.680
speak to diet. Now in relation to
cognition, these are not new data. Most of

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.690
the data that were analyzed were the
specimens which were used by Leslie Aiello

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.710
who's in the audience and she will be
speaking later. And this was a plot which

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:15.970
was published in a paper and this was a
paper which looked at the relationship

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:21.890
between brain size and other revolutionary
trends. And it was this plot which gave

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:29.470
rise to this notion that there was a
burst, there was a period of relatively

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.410
sudden increase in brain size of the
origin of the genus Homo and then there

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:38.190
was another burst of increase in brain
size at the origin of the species Homo

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:44.210
sapiens. But these data, the plot looks as
if it is consistent with that

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.540
interpretation, but the plot represents
each value as one point. And the problem

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:55.810
with the plot is that the data are subject
to error. In other words, there is error

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.700
in the estimation of the endocranial
volume and there is error in the

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.490
estimation of the age.
So what a bunch of graduate students did

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.900
led by Andrew Du was to look at these data
again. And so these are the data and it's

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.760
the other way around, in other words, the
older data are to the left and the younger

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.770
data on to the right. So theirs are also
point there. But then if you add the

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:22.180
error, the error of the age and the error
of the estimation of the endocranial

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.180
volume, you see that the data look rather
different. Then when you do some very

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.620
fancy statistics, which I was very tempted
to pretend that I knew what they were but

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.320
I decided that I wasn't going to pretend
that I knew what they were. And then they

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.850
tested the data against various modes of
change, random walk, or gradualism, or

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:49.240
stasis, or punctuated equilibrium which
was the hypothesis of the relatively

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:56.150
sudden increase in brain size, and so on
and so forth. They found that the mode

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:01.000
which had much the greatest amount of
support was gradualism. So in other words,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.060
the data if you account for the error of
the age and the estimate of the

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:13.620
endocranial volume, there is no evidence
of a punctuated event. So how about diet?

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.450
Well, this is work of David Pattison. And
you can see here that there are three

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.920
color bands. The australopiths that Bill
is going to be talking about. So you can

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.450
see they are in the light green band and
then the first of the red columns

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.860
represents the early evidence for Homo in
the Turkana Basin which is either Homo

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.220
habilis or it's Homo rhodesiensis. And
then the second of the red columns is the

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.370
evidence for Homo in the Turkana Basin
which is Homo erectus or Homo ergaster. So

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:49.960
if the major grade shift was between the
australopiths and the first red column,

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.600
you wouldn't expect the first red column
to be where it is because these are carbon

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.900
isotope values. So there is a shift
between the first red column, in other

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.070
words, Homo habilis and the second red
column which is Homo erectus.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:07.030
Here is David and he's the one who's
collected these data. So if you look at

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:13.680
this plot, you can see the blue squares
are Paranthropus boisei who are living in

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.450
exactly the same lake basin as what is
alleged to be Homo habilis and widely

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:25.630
accepted to be Homo erectus. And there is
no change in isotopic signal or the

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:31.760
Paranthropus boisei individuals, but there
is a change in isotopic signal for Homo.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.430
So there is a more C3 signal for Homo
habilis and then there is a significantly

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.920
different, more C4 signal for Homo
erectus. You might say, "Well, that's just

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.240
because the environment was changing and
everything was changing and Paranthropus

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.720
boisei was the only large mammal that
wasn't changing." Well, that's not true.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.520
If you look at all the other large
mammals, they don't change and

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.130
Paranthropus boisei doesn't change, it's
just Homo that does. So there is a dietary

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:05.820
shift from Homo habilis to Homo erectus
and the isotopic signal for the diet of

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.940
Homo habilis is no different from the
isotopic signals of the creatures that

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:18.050
proceeded it and we call australopiths. So
my suggestion is that we just should not

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:24.540
assume that the interesting things were
happening around the appearance of Homo

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:31.580
habilis. My suggestion is no different
from the suggestion we made in the paper

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.660
in 1999, that most of the action is around
the appearance of Homo erectus and it's

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.680
not around the appearance of Homo habilis.
Thank you very much.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.220
- [Carol] What I'm going to do is either
it can be considered as a sobriety

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.530
checkpoint or something completely crazy,
but I've been given some might consider

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.020
the enviable task of talking about the
evolution of early human body form and

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.100
particularly in the context of
understanding shapes of everything from

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.540
the neck down associated with the origins
of genus Homo. Now we have this idea about

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.710
the transition from australopithecus to
Homo. When we look at australopith

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.440
skeletons we see they're different from
ours. They tend to be smaller in body

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.040
size, males are much, much larger than
females. We tend to see that they seemed

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.850
to have shorter lower limbs, longer upper
limbs. They have longer, more curved

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:33.100
fingers and toes. They look pretty
different in body form and we have the

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.400
idea that to go from something like an
australopith to something like us involved

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.700
a series of changes that we see when we
make a comparison like this. And sure

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.850
enough, when we look at some of the early
Homo erectus fossils like this beautiful

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.380
Turkana boy from Kenya, he's about 1.6
million years old. We see that he also

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.730
seems to share some of those features of
the post cranial skeleton that we see in

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.590
humans and that he seems to have more
human-like limb proportions with longer

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:03.870
stronger legs, bigger lower limb joints,
smaller upper limbs, thinner body form. So

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:08.740
this transition has shaped our ideas about
what the adaptive changes would have been

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.070
to go from point A to point B. Because
after all, if we're trying to understand

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.260
why and how our genus evolved, we need to
know what changes happened. Did they

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.240
happen together? Did they happen as a
package, were some of the features

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.860
evolving at different times in different
places? Those are the data that we have to

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.790
come up with our ideas about why it all
happened. So when we look at something

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.260
like this, we see australopiths here. They
sort of had the stocky ape shape. They're

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.780
maybe living partly in the trees. And then
we have these more savanna-dwelling,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.990
animals that may have been doing long
distance walking and running, using fancy

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:47.000
pants stone tools, all kinds of things.
But in terms of the post cranial skeleton,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.860
some of the features that we think of with
this transition that fuels our adaptive

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.690
ideas is have to do with changes in limb
proportions, changes in lower limb joint

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:00.840
size, changes in the shape of the torso,
changes in body size and dimorphism or

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.520
difference between males and females.
So what I'd like to do today is take you

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.990
through a little bit of the evidence we
have and there's only a little bit to talk

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:13.270
about so I won't be up here very long, to
see first of all was australopithecus

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:18.140
different from what we think of as Homo as
we thought. And I'm also going to talk a

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.890
little bit about what we have from the
earliest part of the Homo fossil record in

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.480
the way of post cranial bones that may
tell us something about what was

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.500
happening. So we'll start with
australopiths because that's the easy

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.620
part, we have more fossils. If you open up
any human evolution textbook you'll see a

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.580
picture something like this where you look
at the body shape of the torso of

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.510
australopithecus and you see this
reconstruction. This is based on fossils

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.620
done 35 or 40 years ago. There are more
fossils that have come in to change our

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.360
ideas a little bit. But you see, the
stocky anamode with this cone shaped rib

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.390
cage. If you connect the dots there and
imagine the belly of this. Big belly, very

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:56.520
stiff and immovable and this would shape
our ideas of locomotion and how these

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.070
things moved around and maybe even
digestive biology and so forth. Well, we

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.520
know from a whole lot of fossils that this
probably is no longer really an accurate

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.530
way to look at things. We have a number of
different vertebral columns that show that

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.770
the characteristic curvatures in the human
vertebral column that holds us upright

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.570
were present in early australopithecus.
There are lots of vertebrae in the lower

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:21.550
back so they can stand up fully upright.
So they're not that ape-like that way. And

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.370
there are new fossils that are bringing
new bits of data and I'll show you one of

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.540
those bits of data. This is a skeleton
called Kadanuumu, it means big man. It's

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.200
an australopithecus male and he's nice and
big. And we're very excited, those of us

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.620
who care about ribs are very excited
because it actually has some ribs. And you

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.240
can measure the curvature of those ribs to
say something about what maybe the rib

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.580
cage would have been like. And you see,
apes have this cone shaped rib cage of

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.210
very sort of straight ribs. Humans' curve
around, give you this more slender barrel

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.920
shape rib cage. You can measure this in
Kadanuumu and you can see it's right down

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.490
here with humans and gibbons who also have
this rib cage shape. Very different from

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.290
something we see in great apes and data
like these are giving us the picture that

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.550
in fact the body shape of australopithecus
may not have been so different from our

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.550
own as we had long thought.
We also can take a look at limb length. We

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.560
have this idea that australophitecus has
more ape-like limb proportions, longer

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.570
upper limbs, smaller lower limbs. Based
partly on good old Lucy here, Lucy is

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:23.860
teeny tiny so this is lower limb to upper
limb. You can pretty much pick your

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.730
favorite measure, it doesn't much matter.
And you can see that chimps and gorillas

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.330
here have bigger upper limbs than humans
for their lower limb size and Lucy seemed

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.130
to fit that picture. But new data like
these ones showed here again from

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:41.590
Kadanuumu show that once you get larger
and fat, australopithecus don't really

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.210
have very short legs. They maybe have
longer arms, but they don't really have

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.920
short legs. And Trent Holiday and other
people have done similar analyses to

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.460
suggest that maybe the lower limbs weren't
that much shorter than australopiths,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.420
they're just littler animals. So they may
not be as big a change in limb length from

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.750
australopiths to Homo as we have thought.
Another thing we've learned recently comes

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.880
from the foot. An ape has a foot with not
just a grasping big toe, but the whole

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.020
thing is flexible, so it can wrap around
branches and hang on in the trees. Whereas

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.430
our feet are very stiff and they form a
nice propulsive lever to move us forward

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.030
when we walk on the ground on two feet,
and that propulsive lever is supported by

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.020
arches that go from front to back and side
to side that are built into the structure

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.820
of the bones of our foot. So one we lift
our heels off the ground, they stiffen up

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.560
and they let us work well. We've known for
a long time from fossil footprints that

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.860
australopithecus did not have a grasping
big toe. But recently, Bill Kimble and his

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.310
colleagues found this bone from the middle
part of the foot, it's called a metatarsal

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.730
and it shows us that the australopith
foot, just like what we see with maybe

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.010
Homo habilis or Homo erectus, had nicely
developed arches from front to back and

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.780
side to side, a fully modern human foot
really well adapted for long distance

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.980
travel on the ground. So this isn't really
maybe as different as we would have

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.770
thought a long time...or a number of years
ago as a difference between

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.550
australopithecus and human.
And if you blow up an australopith to be

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:08.190
about the same size you see this really
fairly human-like lower limb, fairly human

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.210
like body shape, and some of the other
differences maybe a little bit less

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.500
dramatic than we thought. So maybe this
transition isn't as dramatic as we thought

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.710
from the australopith side. What can we
now say about early Homo? We have now 2.8

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:27.300
million years ago we see the genus Homo
appear based on this jaw. That's only a

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.850
couple of hundred thousand years after
Lucy was roaming Ethiopia and it's a long

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:37.160
time ago, but it's just a jaw. I'm going
to talk about the post cranial fossils

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:44.710
associated with the origin of Homo. Right,
I'm done now. Thank you, have a nice day.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:48.630
I'm out. So let's take a look at what we
actually have. We have quite a number

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.330
starting around two million years ago.
There are a whole lot of isolated post

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.950
cranial bones, bits of thigh and arm and
this and that and they're great. But

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.650
without heads and teeth we can't tell what
species they belong to. So they're not as

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.000
useful to us as we'd like. What about Homo
erectus? Well, when we find bones that are

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.590
associated with the heads and teeth we can
tell what species they belong to. These

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.020
are three skeletons and as you see as you
move over this way, I'm using the term

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.000
pretty liberally, associated bones of Homo
erectus from the beautiful Turkana boy

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.440
1808, 803 from Koobi Fora. But these are
all about a million and a half years ago.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.250
That's over a million years after the
origins of the genus. The Dmanisi fossils

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.730
are a little bit older, 1.8, but that's
still a million years after the origin of

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:38.380
the genus Homo. Well, what about the other
early Homo species, habilis and

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.660
rudolfensis? These are the associated
skeletons we have for habilis. Looks a bit

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.330
like they were hit with an artillery
barrage, somewhat underwhelming but

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:50.370
they're a little bit older. Koobi 42.0,
Olduvai Gorge 1.8. There are some post

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.180
crania from the type side of Homo habilis.
The association with actual habilis has

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.000
been questioned by some people so they're
a little bit less certain in terms of

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.410
their taxonomic assignments but they are
there too, so we have some of those.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:11.300
What about Homo rudolfensis post crania?
That's all we've got, right? We know

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:16.690
absolutely nothing about its skeleton
which is unfortunate. And so this whole

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:21.460
exercise is a bit like trying to squeeze
blood from turnips which either means it's

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.570
really, really hard or it means I can make
anything up and there's no data to falsify

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:30.090
it. That's all fine, too. But what can we
actually say about that supposed set of

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.400
characters that may seem to have gone
together with the origin of Homo. Well, we

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.710
can take a look at maybe body size and
Mark Rabowski and colleagues published

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.740
some new body size estimates and is there
really a difference between australopiths

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.740
and Homo? Well, when we look at
australopithecuses we see there's a pretty

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.650
good range in body size. They're not
particularly large, they're all fairly

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:55.380
similar. And when we look at Homo habilis
just a little bit more recent in time, we

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.520
only have a couple of specimens but they
fall right in that australopith range; not

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.540
particularly large. When we look at some
of these Homo erectus fossils that we know

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.830
are Homo erectus, even the Dmanisi
sample's really about similar to

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.470
australopithecus, you start to get a
little bit larger individuals but remember

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:15.210
again this is 1.5 million years ago. This
isn't very early in the evolution of the

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.180
genus. And so maybe we're saying, "Ah,
here's one that's trended increasing body

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.920
size happens." But we can look at the size
of some of these isolated fossils and

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.640
here's a fossil I'm going to talk about a
bit. It's a partial pelvis called 3228. It

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.950
was from somebody who is about as big as
the Turkana boy and it was 1.9 million

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:37.140
years ago. So what can we say about this?
There doesn't seem to be a great trend in

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:42.590
early evolution of Homo in either range of
body sizes or absolute body sizes. So

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:46.590
we're not seeing anything really dramatic
happening early in the origin of the genus

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.480
with body size and dimorphism.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.010
Well, what about limb proportions and body
build? Well, when you're looking at the

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.260
oldest things like habilis it's a little
hard to do limb proportions when they're

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.910
pretty fragmentary. But what Chris Russell
was able to do is instead of looking at

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.000
bone length he was able to look at the
bone strength.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.380
And if you compare it to chimp, you take
the leg to the arm here and you see

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.130
they're pretty similar in strength. They
plot out about like this. Humans, the

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.540
lower limbs are stronger than the upper
limbs so they plot out up here. And he was

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.290
able to take these measurements for at
least the OH 62, the one in black here,

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.710
and put them on the graph with some Homo
erectuses and what you see is these two

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:27.260
Homo erectus skeletons are very human-like
in their strength proportions, but Homo

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.710
habilis is not. Homo habilis seems to have
a different build. And actually when you

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.780
take the very few measurements you could
take on this scrappy specimen, it also

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.590
seems to have a little bit larger upper
limbs relative to lower limbs than we tend

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.660
to see in humans and maybe in these Homo
erectus. The Dmanisi sample,

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.410
interestingly, doesn't seem to have the
sort of proportions. It seems to be more

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:50.220
like the erectus although the same studies
haven't been done. So there seems to be

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.270
some sort of a difference here between
habilis and erectus perhaps in body

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:58.850
proportion, given how fragmentary the
fossil evidence is. This is an interesting

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:04.020
fossil I want to mention because Meave
Leakey and her colleagues found this in

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.300
2009, actually fit on this bit was found
in 1980 which is kind of cool. And it's

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.270
associated piece of pelvis and femur, but
this captures the hip joint. And the hip

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.110
joint is interesting partly because we
have a bunch of them in the fossil record

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:20.010
but partly because the hip joint seems to
be a place that there isn't a lot of

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:25.950
difference among these early Homo species
as best we can say. Here's athe3228 pelvis

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:31.070
again. In this pelvis shows a series of
features that we only see in humans, we

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:36.280
never see in australopithecus, so it's not
a bad hypothesis for a Homo. These two are

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.160
almost dead ringers for one another but
this one is just much smaller. So either

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.270
these are a male and female of a really
dimorphic species or they're two species

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.200
that happen to look the same. But they're
both 1.9 million years old so they're nice

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:55.090
and early. Well, when we look at those
Homo-like features, we see them in this

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.880
5881, pardon me, this new specimen here.
So here's Lucy and you look at the front

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.630
border of the ileum, part of the pelvis
it's straight and every australopith we

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:09.430
have is bent in every Homo that we have
and it's bent in 5881. When we look at the

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:13.460
ileum from the side you could see this
buttress called the iliac pillar here is

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.630
more vertical and set back from the edge
of the bone and it's big. In the Homo

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.980
pelvises, it's very weak in every
australopith and angled right into the

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.660
front of the bone. In 5881 here is looking
like Homo. So this looks kind of like a

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.760
Homo sort of a creature. When we look at
the other side of the hip joint at the

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.890
proximal femur, every time you see an
australopith that has a relatively small

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:38.850
femural head. So relatively small hip
joint. You see that in the pelvis too,

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.230
where Homo, including modern humans, have
a much a larger femural head. 5881 needs a

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.590
little bit of digital reconstruction which
you can do actually for quite accurately

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.790
using CAD software, it also would have had
a large femural head, and we can see them

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:56.280
in the pelvis too. And it's interesting
that every femur we have that seems to be

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:02.010
Homo, attributed or not, has a big femural
head. In every australopithecus we have

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:06.130
which is associated with post cranials has
a small one. So this seems to be a feature

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.290
that characterize all Homo, not related
perhaps to body proportions. So changes in

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:16.750
body proportion, change in hip joint size
don't seem to co-occur in early Homo.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:21.060
Well, again, squeezing blood out of more
turnips here, we can come back to our bone

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.250
cross sectional shape. And this is more
work by Chris Ruff Mosley, so you can take

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.900
a femur, you can slice it open in the
middle and you can look at these sections.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.250
And everything we have that we know or
suspect is Home erectus, actual Homo

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:39.940
erectus that we have data for has this mid
shaft femur is very wide from side to side

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.750
and short from front to back. And it has a
really indistinct marking on the back of

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:48.480
the femur for attachment of muscles. When
you put Homo habilis on there, it's a very

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:54.130
different shape; rounder and it's longer
from front to back. 5881 is a dead ringer

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:59.210
for OH 62 in this feature and they both
also have this big, thick attachment here

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.170
for those thigh muscles.
So, ah, you say, maybe this is Homo

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:07.300
habilis, maybe 5881 is habilis, that's
great. But if you put data that Phil

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:11.870
Whitemyer kindly lent me from the Dmanisi
skeletons, they are actually shaped like

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.530
the habilis also. Now either this says
that Dmanisi is not Homo erectus which I

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:21.040
really wouldn't want to say based on one
character here, or something else is going

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.470
on. Chris Roth's idea about the
explanation for these differences is that

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:30.430
in Homo erectus, when the pelvis gets
bigger to accommodate larger brains, the

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:35.280
whole body gets wider and that puts more
medialateral bending stresses on the bone

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.350
and so they're wider to accommodate that.
So that this shape would indicate a

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:45.550
narrower body form than this shape. Well,
we can look at little bit of pelvic shape

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.040
and turn 5881. You can take this curvature
here which gives you a little bit of an

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.190
idea of the inlet. You could see
australopithecus very wide, a little wider

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.900
in Homo erectus and then these are later
Homo things, but 5881 it seems to be

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:04.080
narrower, which seems to fit with Chris'
hypothesis about the explanation for the

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.740
femural bone shapes. In which case,
perhaps then, Dmanisi may have had a

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.970
narrower shape than we see in East African
Homo erectus. Does this mean it's not Homo

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:17.200
erectus? It's hard to say. Remember that
Dmanisi individuals are 300,000 years

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.960
older than the Homo erectus individuals I
have on this graph. That's a long time.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.400
Think about what happened in the
neanderthals and humans in the last 50,000

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.180
or 100,000 years. So this could be
something happening through time. It could

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.990
be species related. It's very hard to say
given how scrappy the fossil evidence is.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:37.280
But it does say that some of these
characters aren't necessarily co-varying

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.790
and there seem to be different morphotypes
within the genus Homo. All Homo doesn't

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.370
look like all the other Homo from the neck
down. And that's an important factor to

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.910
think about when we then constructing our
adaptive explanations for what's going on

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:55.160
in this transition from australopithecus
to Homo. So we have these creatures that

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.450
may be not quite as stocky as we thought.
The lower limbs may have been much better

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:04.350
adapted for decent amounts or quality of
travel while on the ground,

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.210
and they may not have been as ape like as
we've previously thought with

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:12.610
australopithecus. When we look at the
earliest Homo, we may see at least some

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.590
that may have even more apey limb
proportions than we see in

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:20.420
australopithecus. We see that the
combination of features of having larger

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.310
lower limb joints, of having larger limb
joints, longer lower limbs don't

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:29.550
necessarily co-vary. Limbs were already
long, hip joints may have been gotten big

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.110
at the beginning of Homo, it's hard to
say. Body form may have evolved

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.440
differently in different species and/or at
different times. But we no longer have

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.260
this idea of one change associated with
the origin of the genus. And these well

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.010
adapted features that we see here that
make this complex, that make Homo erectus

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.910
great that do things like hunting and tool
using and everything later, may be

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:53.670
something that weren't associated with the
origin of the genus but came in much

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:58.450
later. So in fact, if we compare
australopithecus to earliest Homo, this

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.670
might be a more reasonable picture to have
in our mind. Animals that weren't really

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.930
very different especially from the neck
down, weren't really different in

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:11.320
locomotor capabilities. If I had more
reconstructions of different Homo species

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.160
you might have seen them look a little bit
different from one another. But basically,

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.700
the picture is that there's not a dramatic
change here in the origin of Homo that has

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.840
anything to do with the post cranial
skeleton. Perhaps the adaptive changes

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.510
associated with the origin of the genus
had to do more with diet, other behaviors

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:34.090
or something else. And that's what we need
to be thinking that what happened to the

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.140
origin of Homo to give rise to all the
other great things that we've been hearing

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.960
about today. I say thank you.

00:37:42.863 --> 00:37:45.863
♪ [music] ♪

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.500
- [Leslie] So, one thing that I sort of
noticed this afternoon is the number of

00:37:54.500 --> 00:38:00.490
times some of my earlier workers have been
criticized and that's good, that's normal.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:05.360
It shows how the field is growing and
developing and building. And I've been

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:11.710
asked to talk about the evolution of human
life history patterns. And this is also a

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:18.800
reasonably new approach to study in human
evolution and we can understand a lot

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:25.170
about the evolution of the genus Homo by
looking at life history and by looking at

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:31.390
modern people. So basically, life history
is more than just looking at the evolution

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:37.340
of the physical body form. What it is is
looking at how we got to this body form.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:42.550
Life history is your tempo and mode of
growth and development. And if you look

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.740
across the primates, you'll find a variety
of different patterns. And if we delve a

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.740
little bit into life history, as I said,
we can learn a tremendous amount about

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:59.880
ourselves. And it starts out in childhood.
You have a difference in the growth and

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.530
development pattern that's very obvious.
For example, chimpanzees all mature by the

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:10.890
time they're about 12 years old. For
humans it takes up until your late teens,

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:18.300
17, 18 years old. And our colleague, Barry
Bogan, has been very clear about the tempo

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.930
differences that you have if you compare a
chimpanzee with a human. The chimpanzee

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.720
graph there shows that you have a rapid
decline in the velocity of growth. A

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:35.330
relatively small plateau period, that's
the juvenile period. And then another

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:41.960
relatively rapid decline in how fast
you're growing. Humans are very different

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.910
in the corner. We have that same decline
in the velocity of growth but we have a

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:53.280
much longer plateau period where our
children are not growing very rapidly. And

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.750
this is followed by the adolescent growth
spurt and then it falls off again. This

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:04.100
pattern is very unique and it's very
important to our evolution.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:09.540
The last graph is from the work of Kristin
Hawkes who's here in the audience. It

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.150
shows you not only do you have the
difference in the pattern of the growth

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:20.560
but we also have a very much longer
longevity or life span. Now what I find

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.600
fascinating particularly about the early
childhood growth is that it has a lot to

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.510
do with the brain. We know that humans
have brain sizes about three times the

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:37.870
size of a chimpanzee and that brain grows
and develops at different paces in the two

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:45.430
species. Now in humans, as a child is
growing, a very young child with a huge

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:52.210
head uses about 60% of the energy budget
just to support that brain size. And as we

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:59.400
grow and our body begins to grow, the
brain growth slows down and the energy

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:06.780
balance tips. One of our colleagues, Chris
Kozawa, has come up with I think is a

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:13.360
brilliant look at the relationship between
this brain growth and body growth. In

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:19.410
these graphs, the red line, one for males,
the second graph for females. The red

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:26.680
shows the energy that the brain takes as
you move from birth up through five years

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:33.160
of age that is one of the most energy
expensive periods of brain growth in

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:38.930
childhood because of all the mileazation
that's going on and then it drops off. The

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:45.120
blue line is the velocity of your somatic
growth, your body growth. So basically

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.080
there's almost a perfect play off between
brain growth and somatic growth. And this

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:58.840
goes terribly long ways to explaining why
we have this extended period of childhood

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.820
that basically correlates and is a
necessary correlate in energetic terms

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:08.480
with the growth and development of the
large human brain cells.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.660
Now we all may think this is fine and good
but it's actually not. So some of our

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:21.150
other colleagues from Switzerland, Karin
Isler and Carel van Schaik have developed

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:26.800
something they called the gray ceiling.
And what the importance of this is you can

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.490
just take so long in your growth and
development or you aren't going to be able

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:40.510
to replace your population size. Now think
in terms of dependent childhood and if a

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:45.890
child is dependent on a mother for five
years, six years, seven years, she's going

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:52.010
to come back into fertility. You're going
to extend that inter birth interval. You

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:57.890
aren't going to be able to have enough
surviving children to replace your

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:03.070
population from one generation to another
generation. Okay, this is what they call

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:09.360
the gray ceiling. And if you look at the
graph here, there is a lot of primates.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.350
The red dots are the apes with the
increasing brain size. And what this shows

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:21.180
is that with some of our apes like the
orangutans, the gorillas and all, what

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.660
they're arguing is they're hitting the
gray ceiling and the only way to avoid

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:33.370
that gray ceiling is to somehow increase
your reproductive output. Now if we go

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:38.990
back to that same little chart I chose
earlier, at the bottom is the period of

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:44.740
infancy. And in chimpanzees, infants are
dependent on their mother, they're still

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.870
nursing. They are four to four and a half
years old before they're weaned. In

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:54.580
humans, it's of course very much shorter
and this particular graph shows about two

00:43:54.580 --> 00:44:01.460
years, it varies. But what the take home
message of this is is you can have twice

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:06.070
as many kids if you shorten that period of
infancy.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:10.730
And if you then shorten your interval
between birth. Now again you may think

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:16.050
this is fine, this is a good trick, we've
all developed it, but it has tremendous

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:21.040
problems. And I've got this picture
hanging in my office and whenever I think

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:28.050
I'm having a hard day I think of her.
Because what you have once you start to

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:36.760
double up this is you have a woman who may
be pregnant. The infant that she's

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:43.680
probably in the last stage of nursing and
a dependent kid. And she has to get the

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:49.670
food to support her own large body weight,
her own large brain size, and to provide

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:56.170
all of the calories for the kids she's
nursing. She has to provide the food for

00:44:56.170 --> 00:45:01.750
the young infant. Now this is very
different from what we see in the

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:09.020
chimpanzees or other apes where mothers
focus on one infant. And once the infant

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:14.820
has stopped nursing they will gather their
own food. There's very little energetic

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:20.820
involvement with the mother. Now this is a
huge paradox and this is where the

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:26.550
evolution of sharing and cooperation comes
in. And of course this is where we have

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:33.410
the grandmother hypothesis and the
argument that a lot of the extra resources

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:39.220
for the grandkids come from the
grandmother by provisioning the mother and

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:45.160
the kids. Now there's a number of other
arguments also that involved greater

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:52.430
cooperation among all individuals in the
society, males as well as sibling care and

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:58.180
sibling cooperation. The take home message
is that once you begin to develop a large

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.700
brain size, you have growth and
development implications.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.710
And these growth and development
implications have implications for the

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:11.950
evolution of what we would recognize as a
human type of cooperative social

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:18.160
organization. Okay, the big question is,
can we tell when this all happened in

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:23.280
human evolution? And we'd like to think,
oh, this is a characteristic of the root

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.300
of the genus Homo, that's a hypothesis.
Now if we go back to the evolutionary

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:34.210
tree, we have one way into this in terms
of cooperation. And if we go back to the

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:39.760
gray ceiling and I know Burden isn't going
to like my brain size against a million

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:46.640
year graph. But if we put the gray ceiling
onto this and again what Isler and van

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:53.700
Schaik argue is that gray ceiling is about
700 milliliters. Now of course there is,

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.820
you know, big ranges of variation around
this, but what's interesting about this is

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:07.220
this just about divides our Homo erectus
from the earlier hominids. And if we put

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.680
it on our evolutionary tree here, it comes
at this very interesting time between two

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.970
million and one million years ago where
you have a proliferation of hominids, a

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:26.890
variety of different species, and you have
this big variation in the brain sizes that

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:31.990
we have. Now as we've also heard, this
time period correlates with the radical

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:37.300
change in human adaptation. And
particularly in evidence for the

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:43.670
precedence of animal based tissues in the
diet, it also correlates again with our

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:49.470
Turkana boy here and this general time
period where you have the evolution of

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:55.230
what we call Homo erectus. Now what's
interesting about this also is it also

00:47:55.230 --> 00:48:01.000
correlates with the time period where
hominids begin to move out of Africa.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.900
So our question here is how much does this
cooperative behavior that we can infer

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:12.580
from the brain size and we can refer from
the life history really affect the

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:19.360
hominid's ability to adapt to a variety of
different habitats not only in Africa but

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:25.020
also throughout the world? Now the only
direct evidence we have for any type of

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:32.620
cooperation comes from the side of Dmanisi
and our friend here with no teeth. And I'm

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:39.240
sure it feels very familiar with the
argument that this individual must have

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.330
whatever you want to argue, been taken
care of. The message from this is we don't

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:50.080
really know how to recognize this
cooperation in the fossil record. It would

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:57.120
be very nice if we could. Now if we come
back to the fossils, is there any way from

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:03.400
the fossils we could tell what their tempo
of growth is? And in this case, one of our

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:08.650
colleagues, Chris Dean, has been working
on how to infer growth and development

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:14.240
from the formation of the teeth. I've been
very impressed by some recent work by

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.130
Chris and his colleague, Helen Livesidge
in London. Not on teeth this time in

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:25.990
particular, but on body size because what
Chris has done is sort of bracketed the

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:31.650
age of our Turkana boy at death to
somewhere between seven and eight years

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:38.340
old. Now what these graph show were really
startling to me because the green one is

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:45.330
stature. And the histogram is the stature
of modern human kids who are between about

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:53.090
7 and 10 years old. The red line there is
the estimate for the Turkana boy. It's way

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:59.680
in excess of the stature that you would
expect. The blue is body mass or body

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:05.670
weight. Again way outside of what you
would expect in modern human kids.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:11.080
Now what does this tell you about the
growth and development of the Turkana boy?

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:17.910
If we go back to Barry Bogan's figures,
what it's telling you is that the Turkana

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:28.600
boy was growing on a trend very much more
similar to the apes than to modern humans.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:35.390
And if you look on the chart, in fact just
above age there on the chimp chart is

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:42.090
eight years old. And you've come out of
that plateau of slow growth velocity, the

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:47.970
individual would be then growing towards
his adult weight. In humans, it would be

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:54.550
still well within that plateau before that
growth explosion, that's the adolescent

00:50:54.550 --> 00:51:02.280
growth spurt. Now this, to me, is very
convincing evidence that the Turkana boy

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.930
was not growing and developing on the
human pattern. Now what that would mean is

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:12.990
that it would reach maturity much more
rapidly than if it was growing on the

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:20.720
modern human sort of tempo and mode. Now
is there anything more we can tell? Your

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:27.680
eruption of teeth tends to still also
measure how long your growth period is.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.810
And what's become very clear recently is
there's a tremendous amount of overlap not

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:40.010
only between living human tooth eruption
and tooth formation patterns and apes, but

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:44.810
also overlap in the fossil hominids. And
when it comes down to it, if you're

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:49.580
looking at tooth formation, your best
tooth in terms of distinguishing us

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:55.180
between the chimps and humans is your
third molar. But again the take home

00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:03.260
message from this comes in the bottom
graph. And the blue line there is the

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:10.770
tooth development for your second premolar
and that's in the chimps, the red one is

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.610
in humans.
The vertical lines are your early Homo

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:21.410
fossils. The green one is the Turkana boy.
And although the teeth are developing at

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:25.120
the very, very fast end of modern humans
and there's a tremendous amount of

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:32.040
variation, it's squarely within the ape
pattern as well. And if we're going to

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:39.400
argue about what the life history patterns
of some of these early Homo are, basically

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:44.250
we're talking about a much more ape-like
growth and development pattern than a

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:49.910
human-like growth and development pattern.
Okay, the next questions comes in is when

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:57.170
did we start to grow and develop as
humans? And the first indication is with

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:04.360
Homo antecessor which is about a million,
not .9 million years old. The teeth are

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:09.160
still developing more rapidly than ours,
meaning they're developing more rapidly.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.940
But the argument is made that the first
ones that are closer to modern humans than

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:20.460
to the early Homo, the early
australopithecine pattern. And then as we

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:27.930
move up to the top at about a 160,000
years ago at the Moroccan side of Jebel

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:33.050
Irhoud and this is some of some John Jack
Hublin's and his group right there in the

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:39.940
fourth row, where you have a very modern
human growth and development pattern. Now

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:50.290
what I want to do is sort of finish with
what is probably everybody's favorite

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:55.510
fossil and that's the neanderthals. And
they're a long way up the record from what

00:53:55.510 --> 00:54:00.140
we're talking about in the evolution of
the genus Homo. But I think the lessons we

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:05.550
can learn from the neanderthal growth and
development, we can usefully bring down

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:10.070
the record and apply to some of the
australopithecines.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:16.540
Now neanderthals of course are the
alternatives to modern humans. They have

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:24.480
brain sizes that overlap with ours. They
are in the blue series of Xes there. They

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:30.980
lived in Europe during the last ice age
while anatomically modern humans were

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:37.810
evolving elsewhere in Africa. What, again,
another piece of evidence that struck me

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:42.820
that comes out of Martin Gonzales and some
of his colleagues' work from Spain is the

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:49.510
growth and development of the little
neanderthal kids. So the blue lines here

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:56.480
are your growth from not years, up to 70
months. The horizontal lines are the

00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:03.630
equivalently aged neanderthals in relation
to that modern human growth pattern. So

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:09.760
here you can say the little neanderthals
are basically plateauing much earlier than

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:15.670
you would see in the human growth curve.
Now think about being a neanderthal. I'm

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:21.880
often happy I wasn't born a neanderthal
because, you know, what the authors are

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:27.780
arguing here is not only do they have the
energetic stress of growing and developing

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.950
that large human-like brain size, they
also have a serious thermoregulatory

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:39.370
problem. Because in fact with Steve
Churchlin I've done some modeling on the

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.970
energetic requirements in neanderthals and
it's about the same as to say somebody

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:50.880
riding the Tour de France in the Alps.
It's about 500 kilocalories a day. And you

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.800
think of these poor little neanderthals
trying to support that brain and also keep

00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:02.080
warm. Now there is a second piece also
that comes from other research.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:10.540
This is from Smith et al in 2010. And the
green lines here are your expected and

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:17.600
predicted ages for human teeth and the
blue lines are the neanderthals. The take

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:24.050
home message is their teeth are developing
more rapidly so they have a more

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:32.030
attenuated growth and development process.
Now coming back to this and where you

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:36.520
would expect to say a modern human
populations to have more rapid growth and

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:42.600
development. It's in situations where you
have a higher mortality rate. Now think

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:47.500
about these poor neanderthals, they have a
very high mortality rate, every three

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:54.190
calistosis. It's the same as rodeo riders
in the southwest. And you have these poor

00:56:54.190 --> 00:57:01.120
little stressed neanderthals with a
shorter body size. Now if we come back to

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:08.410
all of our, you know, fossil species, our
australopithecines and early Homo, living

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:14.740
in a period of very fluctuating climate in
Africa, and this little zig-zag chart is

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:20.060
just from East Africa, but also
experiencing all of these environments

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:24.920
around the world. What we really want to
know is what their growth and development

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:31.850
patterns are and how these reflect what's
happening in their lifestyle. And what I

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:39.740
tend to think is that the same processes
that affect us today were also affecting

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:45.370
them. And this is a huge challenge, it's
very exciting research and I think as soon

00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:50.590
as we're able to screw down into it, we're
going to find similar neanderthal-like

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:56.940
patterns among the hominids that are
living different types of lifestyles. To

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:03.180
end, I'd like to thank CARTA.
We were all having a great time here. And

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:08.140
I'd particularly like to thank all of the
attendees of a Wandergrand conference,

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:13.000
some of you are sitting in the audience
here, that we held on human biology and

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.900
the origins of Homo. And a lot of these
life history ideas were developed in a

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.880
week-long meeting in Portugal. So thank
you very much.
