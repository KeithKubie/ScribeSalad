MANO MARKS: Hi, I'm
Mano Marks.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.890
LUKE MAHE: And I'm Luke Mahe.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.320
MANO MARKS: We're on the
Google Maps Developer

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.550
Relations Team.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.590
We're here today to talk to you
about the latest version

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.460
of the Google Maps SDK
for iOS, version 1.4.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.200
Let's take a look at some of
the cool new features.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.410
LUKE MAHE: Well, the first big
feature we're launching today

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.850
is Street View.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.210
MANO MARKS: Street View--

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.810
pretty awesome.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.650
And we got it right
in the SDK.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.470
And we've got support for adding
markers to it, as well.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.720
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, and so this
is a really great feature.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.560
If you're going to start
directing your user to a

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.310
location in your app, they
can actually load

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.070
up Street View now.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.910
And you can start exploring,
which is really cool.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.420
MANO MARKS: That
is really cool.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.870
The next big feature is the
new look and feel that we

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.220
announced at Google I/O. So at
Google I/O, we announced that

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.900
maps.google.com would have this
new look and feel that

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.170
you can incorporate into your
JavaScript applications.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.310
LUKE MAHE: So now if you
download the latest SDK,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.165
version 1.4, you're just
going to get it.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:04.390
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.440
The next big feature
is Indoor Maps.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.346
LUKE MAHE: That's very cool.

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:09.590
MANO MARKS: It is pretty cool.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.460
So if your users zoom into your
map and we have floor

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.220
plans for buildings there,
we will show

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.530
them those floor plans.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.720
And we'll even include
a floor picker.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.870
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, the floor
picker's really cool.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.770
You can change floors.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.035
And if you don't want this at
all, you can just turn it off.

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:28.060
MANO MARKS: There's a lot
more that's actually

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.940
really cool in the SDK.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.320
We've got [? zeroing ?]

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.160
for markers.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.740
We've got an improved look and
feel for polylines, and a

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.410
bunch more.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.160
So check it out at
developers.google.com/maps.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.760
And check out the release notes
and the sample apps in

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.500
the SDK to explore some
of these new features.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.010
LUKE MAHE: Well, that's all
we have for this week.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.260
We'll see you next time.
