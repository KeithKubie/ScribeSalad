00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.419
The next time you come across a basket of
fruit, don't just eat it. Have some fun with

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.710
it first. In this project, we're converting
any ordinary apple, into a decorative, and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.270
completely edible, apple swan.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.520
Go find your basket of fruit, and pick out
an apple you think looks good. Now, using

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
a sharp cutting knife, carefully cut the apple
at a slight diagonal, so that it slices right

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.400
through the center, of the apple core. While
we're here, let's save 2 of the seeds, because

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.540
we'll be needing them later. Now that we've
got our two halves, let's take the side that

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.860
still has the bottom attached, and place it
face down on a cutting board. We'll need to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.600
place 2 butter knives perpendicular with the
top and bottom of the apple. Now we can carefully

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.850
cut down along one side of the apple core
until the knife bottoms out on our makeshift

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.440
spacers. Then use the spacers as a guide to
gently cut in from the side. When the two

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.620
cuts meet, you'll have an apple wedge that
pops right out. And while we're here, let's

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.360
cut a piece from the other side the same way.
Now our goal with these, is to cut out 3 more

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.070
"L" shaped wedges, about 1/4 inch thick. And
this time, rather than cutting in sideways

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.110
toward your fingers, try turning the piece
over so you can cut downward, and meet the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.040
first cut at the bottom. Now with a little
wiggle, a new apple wedge should break free.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.080
If you repeat the process 2 more times, then
stagger the pieces back together, the effect,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.720
is a beautifully layered wing. Now, just cut
the other piece the same way, and your swans

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.520
body should look like this. To make a place
for the head, all we need to do is carefully

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.930
cut into the front of the body, and gently
lift the pieces out, to reveal a clean, and

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.600
fairly deep groove. At this point, we can
go ahead and grab the other half of the apple,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.270
and place it between the butter knives like
before. But this time, we're just going to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.650
use them as spacers, to cut an even slice
off the bottom. You can see that repeating

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.049
this process 3 or 4 times, gives us a nice
variety of shapes and sizes. Now look for

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.380
a piece that resembles a heart that's been
slightly flattened on top. All it takes to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.420
form the swan head is three strategic cuts
with a knife. I made one angled cut to form

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.000
the head, a horizontal cut to form the neck,
and one slanted cut at the bottom for the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.440
base. Now you should be able to see how this
is coming together, and to clean it up a bit,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.690
just use your knife to round off the sharp
edges. All that's left now is to place the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.490
apple seeds where you think the eyes should
go, then use the side of a butter knife to

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.099
press them firmly into position. When both
eyes look good, simply drop the neck into

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.030
place, and you're done. You've just created
a beautiful and decorative, apple swan. I

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.830
spritzed mine with a bit of lemon juice to
help prevent it from turning brown, then put

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.180
it on display to show off, for our dinner
guests later that night. If you try using

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.239
different apples, you'll get a nice contrast
of colors, and every bird will look a little

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.619
bit different. Well now you know how to take
any ordinary apple, and turn it into a decorative

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.319
and edible, apple swan. If you liked this
project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
