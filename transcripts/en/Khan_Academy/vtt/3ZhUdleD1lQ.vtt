00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:01.912
Voiceover: What I want
to do in this video,

00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:05.879
is get a little bit of
practice trying to approximate

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.494
the area under curves,
and also get a little bit

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:13.295
more familiarity with the
sigma notation in this context.

00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:15.062
So what we have here, we have the graph of

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:18.628
f of x is equal to one plus 0.1 x squared,

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.546
that's this curve right over here,

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:23.812
and then we have these rectangles that are

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:27.263
trying to approximate
the area under the curve,

00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:32.428
the area under the function
f, between x equals zero,

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:37.227
and x equals 8, and the
way that this diagram,

00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:39.046
or the way that we are
attempting to do it,

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:41.963
is by splitting it into four rectangles,

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:44.228
and so we can call this rectangle one,

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:50.446
this is rectangle two, rectangle
three, and rectangle four.

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.227
And each of their heights,
let's see the interval,

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:55.595
it looks like they each
have a width of two,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.713
so they are equally spaced,
so we go from zero to eight,

00:00:58.713 --> 00:01:02.845
and we split into four sections,
so each has a width of two,

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:04.695
so they're each going to be two wide,

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:07.928
so that's two, that's two,
that's two, that's two.

00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:14.327
And their height seems to
be based on the midpoint,

00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:16.179
so between the start,
between the left side

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.827
and the right side of the rectangle,

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.728
you take the value of the
function at the middle value,

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:21.846
right over here, so for example,

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.277
this height right over
here looks like f of 1,

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:27.762
this height right over
here looks like f of 3,

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:31.212
this height of this rectangle is f of 5,

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:34.263
this height right over here is f of 7.

00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:36.727
So given the way that
this has been constructed,

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:38.712
and we want to take the sum of the areas

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:41.646
of these rectangles as an
approximation as the area

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:44.428
under this curve, how would we
write that as sigma notation?

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:45.845
And I'll get us started,
and then I encourage you

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.045
to pause the video and try to finish it.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:51.811
So the sum of these rectangles,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.762
we could say it's the
sum of, so we'll have

00:01:54.762 --> 00:01:58.297
n equals one to four, 'cause
we have four rectangles.

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:02.762
And I encourage you to finish this up.

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:06.061
Actually, just write it
in terms of the function,

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.077
use function notation, you
don't have to write it out

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:12.394
as one plus .01 times something squared.

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:14.362
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:19.244
So for each of these, so for
the first rectangle over here,

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:22.678
We're gonna multiply two times the height,

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:25.763
so the height right over
here is one, and this is

00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:28.577
the first rectangle, so
you might be tempted to say

00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:32.878
times f of n, but then that breaks down

00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:34.379
as we go into the second rectangle.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.629
The second rectangle,
the two still applies.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.744
This two is the width of the rectangle,

00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:43.595
but now we want to multiply
it times f of three,

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:52.512
not f of two, so this f of n
isn't going to pass muster.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:55.678
And so let's see how we
want to think about it.

00:02:55.678 --> 00:03:04.345
So when n is one, two, three,
four, we're gonna take f of...

00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:07.128
So f of n, I shouldn't say
f of n, we're gonna take

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:10.528
f of something, so here this
first one, we're gonna take

00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:14.477
f of one, then here, for
the second rectangle,

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:18.346
we're taking f of three for the height,

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:22.821
for the third rectangle
we're taking f of five,

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:28.371
and then for the fourth rectangle,
we're taking f of seven.

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:30.440
So what's the relationship over here?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.523
Let's see, it looks like
if you multiply by two

00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:37.391
and subtract one, so two
times one minus one is one,

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.023
two times two minus one is three,

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:42.940
two times three minus one is five,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.457
two times four minus one is seven.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:49.794
So this is two n minus one, so the area of

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:52.488
each of these rectangles, the base is two,

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:59.071
and the height is f of two and minus one.

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:02.421
So that hopefully makes
it a little bit clear,

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:04.787
kind of mapping between the sigma notation

00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:06.919
and what we're actually trying to do.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.770
And now let's just for fun,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.456
let's actually try to evaluate this thing.

00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:13.088
What is this thing going to evaluate to?

00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:18.337
Well, this is going to
evaluate to two times f of,

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:21.572
when n is equal to one
this is one, f of 1,

00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:25.687
plus two times, when n
is two, this is gonna be

00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:30.738
f of, two times two minus
one is three, f of 3,

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:35.220
when n is three, this is
gonna be two times f of 5,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.038
when n is four, this is going
to be two times f of seven,

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:46.519
four times two minus one
is seven, f of seven.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.539
And so that is going to be,
well we're gonna have to

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.870
evaluate a bunch of
these things over here,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.337
so let me actually, let me clear this out

00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:56.554
so I have a little bit more real estate.

00:04:56.554 --> 00:04:59.670
I'm feeling this might get
a little bit messy now.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.371
So this is going to be, actually
we could factor out a two.

00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:05.655
So this is going to be
equal to two times f of one

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:09.238
is one plus 0.1 times one squared.

00:05:09.238 --> 00:05:13.121
So it's one plus 0.1, let me
color-code it a little bit

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.988
so we can keep track of things.

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:23.669
So this right over here is
1.1, so one plus 0.1 is 1.1,

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.361
this right over here, f of
3, so that's one plus .1

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:36.268
times three squared, nine,
so one plus .9, so it's 1.9.

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:40.619
And then, let's see, this
one right over here, f of 5,

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:44.034
is gonna be one plus,
see five squared is 25,

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:50.068
times .1 is 2.5, so one
plus 2.5 is gonna be 3.5.

00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:57.534
And then finally, f of
seven, is going to be

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:59.819
one plus .1 times seven squared,

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:10.785
so this is 49 times .1 is
4.9 plus one, so plus 5.9.

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.933
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:18.118
So let's see, 1.1 plus 1.9, these two

00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:21.285
are going to sum up to be equal to three,

00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:24.568
and then these two are
going to sum up to be,

00:06:24.568 --> 00:06:29.534
let's see, if we add
the five, we get to 8.5,

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:35.734
and then we add the .9, we
get to 9.4, so plus 9.4.

00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:38.818
Did I do that right -
three plus five is eight,

00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:43.620
.5 plus .9 is 1.4, yep,
and so this is going to be,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.418
so once again, we have
the two times it all,

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:50.818
so this is going to be
equal to two times 12.4,

00:06:50.818 --> 00:06:56.619
which is equal to 24.8,
which is our approximation.

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:57.833
Once again, this is just an approximation

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.917
using these rectangles of
the area under the curve

00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:04.917
between x equals zero, and x equals eight.
