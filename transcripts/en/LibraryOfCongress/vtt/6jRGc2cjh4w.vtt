00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:23.090
[ Pause ]

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: On January 6th the
New York Public Library gave a big

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.260
gift to the world, we enhanced
access to 187,000 items

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.180
in our digital collections
that we had determined were

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.640
in the public domain,
providing high res downloads

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.150
of the very best quality available
for everyone to download and enjoy,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.040 position:56%
including so many treasures from our
collections, including photographs

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.500
from Berenice Abbott documenting,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.810
the changing New York City
landscape, cyanotypes of algae

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.320
from Anna Atkins, this is the
first photographic work known

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380
to be published by a woman.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.350
Photographs from the Farm
Security Administration.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.390
Prints from the Works
Progress Administration.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.690
Maps, so many maps, over 20,000.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.570
This is a Bromley map from the
1920s showing the landscape

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.300
of where our workplace is,
the New York Public Library.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.980
Sixteenth Century Japanese scrolls
depicting the Tale of Genji.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.930
And stereographic images,
this one showing a view

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.340
from the Capitol Building
pointing northeast.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.480
So a lot of great stuff.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.610 position:56%
But this offering, it wasn't easy to
do, it posed some challenges for us.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.910
First of all, let's just be honest,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.010
187,000 is not a sexy
number, it's not a million.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.180
We also weren't the first to
do this, so many of our peers

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.690
in the worlds of like libraries
and museums had been there before,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.990
and we knew we were not kind
of doing something brand-new.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.350
And also this is a heterogeneous
collection of materials

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.100
and copyright designations

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.180
and the public domain section
was just one sort of aspect

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.460
of that broader collection, so
we knew that we needed to figure

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.710
out a way to bring this
offering into sharper focus.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.310
We needed a set of strategies
to really launch this properly.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.690
And we developed these strategies
really coming from the work

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.400
that we do in NYPL Labs,
which is the team that sort

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.460
of headed up the release.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.440 position:56%
We're responsible for digitizing the
Library's collections and we believe

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.570
that digitizing our
collections and providing access

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.390
to them is a really important
first step, but not the last step.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.460
We know that the magic really
happens when those materials get

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.470
into the hands of users and they
can use them to create new things.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.160 position:56%
Before I get into this story more
fully let me introduce our speakers.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.740
Myself, I'm Shana Kimball.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.210
I'm the Manager of Public
Programs and Outreach at NYPL Labs,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.050
and with Josh co-led this project
to release our public domain items.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.930
Okay, and this is Greg Cram,
Associate Director of Copyright

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.640 position:56%
and Information Policy at the New
York Public Library, and Josh Hadro,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.950
the Deputy Director of
Labs and, like I said,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.580
my co-conspirator in this project.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.370
I'm going to hand it
over to Josh now.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.250
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: Okay, yes, I'm
Josh, Deputy Director, NYPL Labs.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.280
The three of us are the ones up
here doing the song and dance

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.580
and telling you about the
PD release that we did,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.540
but it is obviously the work of
dozens of current colleagues.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.410 position:56%
But some of the ways you think about
it is this is in some ways the work

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.320
of all of the people who have
worked at NYPL, right, gathering,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.940 position:56%
preserving and making available all
those assets since 1895 up to today.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.850
So, I don't know, I
haven't counted them,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.640
but hundred if not
thousands of people.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.920
So to give you kind of an overview
of the program that Shana and I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.540 position:56%
and Greg were working on, we broke
it out into four different sections.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.140
The first covering kind of the
raw interface updates and the way

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.440
that we made the images available

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.180
through our digital
collections platform.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.570
Also, some of the API updates and
the repository release that we did

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.730 position:56%
to make the data available, but also
some of the rights work that Greg

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.020
and his team worked on to
make it really easy to know

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.470
which materials were
available for use and reuse.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.900
And then kind of the last piece
that really tied it all together,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.700
that made it appealing, I
called it the honey pot, right?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.270
Setting it out and making
it desirable for people

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.680
to use the materials
and incorporate them

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.270
and put them back into the culture.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.230
So to start this is our
digital collections platform.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.530
I'm very proud of it.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.830
We're all very proud of it.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.840
I actually spoke at DPLA Fest
2015 to a similar group of you all

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.620
about our then newly revised
digital collections platform,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.500
and we had undertaken kind of a
wholesale rewrite of the interface

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.300 position:56%
and how we made the images available
and the metadata available.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.560 position:56%
For the January release we were able
to update the interface once more

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.080
and this time really put a lot of
energy on the specific engagement

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.800
around the public domain materials.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.710
So figuring out ways to surface
just the assets that are available

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.050
in high res and get people
to click on the download link

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.350
so that they could use them.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.350
There's a little kind of
interaction video here

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.920
that shows you the search filtering
that we put in front and center

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.680
on all the different pages.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.650
So the search filter for the
public domain materials is front

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.560
and center, highlighted green
so that people wouldn't miss it.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.650
And then once you get to the
asset page we really called

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.890 position:56%
out all the derivative types that
we had available and put those front

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.630
and center, along with
the right statements

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.040
that makes it really obvious which
materials are able to be downloaded

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.170
without any kind of restriction.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.500
So beyond that we also
made some improvements

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.310
to the underlying infrastructure.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.320
So by volume that interface
is the mechanism

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.750
by which the most people were
accessing our assets, right,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.560
just viewing them, getting
at them from Google results,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.370
all sorts of ways, social media.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.910
But there are a lot of developers
and other sorts of folks who want

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.680 position:56%
to kind of get bulk access, right,
they want to drink from the firehose

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.890 position:56%
of data and public domain materials.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.870
So we took a crack at
revising some of the end points

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.470
in our digital collections API that
we first made available in 2013.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.660
We were able to update the
documentation and our colleague,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.370
Shawn Averkamp, was here yesterday
at the Hackathon working with folks

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.860
and making some recommendations
about how it could be used

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.030
and showing off some of the
newly revised documentation,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.420
including a filter that
we were able to put

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.920
on that limits all the queries
to just public domain materials.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.850 position:56%
And the reason that's useful is
because in the API wherever possible

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.320
for the public domain
materials we have

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.520
in the captured responses direct
links to all the derivative types

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.330
that we have up to the
archival TIF that is the largest

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.870
and highest resolution version
that we have for these materials.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.950
So that was great,
that was good work,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.770
but then there was a third class
of folks that we started to think

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.260
about wanting to get access to the
data and maybe weren't really ready

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.270
or willing to out-of-the-gate
do some software development

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.910
and some coding to access the API.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.700
And for those folks we put together
a release and put it on GitHub,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.390
following the footsteps
of colleagues

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.690
in the Glam [Assumed
Spelling] community,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.690 position:56%
like MOMA [Assumed Spelling] and the
Cooper Hewitt [Assumed Spelling].

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.620
We took a snapshot of our
data, so this is a set

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.030
of records that's just our
public domain material.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.980
And we put up item level records
and collection level records in CSV

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.470 position:56%
and JSON formats for folks who maybe
are more comfortable in other tools,

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.980
like opening it up as a spreadsheet

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.400
and just sorting different
sections as columns.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.690
And there was one other small
component of that GitHub release,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.070
where we put a couple of
example scripts and utilities,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.360
just to again sort of prime those
engines and give people examples

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.640
of the kind of things that they
can use to interrogate the data

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.780
that we made available
through GitHub.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.230
So we put all that work in all
that release and made it available

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.720
on January 6th, but wouldn't
really have been possible

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.240
if we hadn't had some really clear
and unambiguous right statements,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.680 position:56%
right, some really clear signals
about which materials were available

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.330
for use and how they
were available for use.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.840
Greg is going to tell you
all about how we did that.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:28.910
&gt;&gt; Greg Cram: So my story at
NYPL begins with this date, 1923.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.870
NYPL had been digitizing material
for 10 years before I arrived

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.730
at the Library, before my
position had even been created.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.000
NYPL was digitizing bookplates from
books published primarily from 1923

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.600
because they thought that
was safe and comfortable.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.030
And, as Maura [Assumed
Spelling] said this morning,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.400
it's become apparent that having
a digital library that ends

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.720
in 1923 was not sufficient
for today.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.220
We wanted to expand our
digitization efforts and break

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.710
through this 1923 barrier.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.740
That means that we need to take
advantage of the exceptions

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.230
and limitations in copyright
law, but we also need

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.380
to understand the contours
of the public domain.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.870
And that's where I come in, I was
hired just over five years ago

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.860 position:56%
at NYPL and I help manage the
Institution's risk by gathering data

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.770
about our items, analyzing
it and recording it

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.100
to describe how we
can use each asset.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.320
Expanding the scope of digitization
meant taking on some risk,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.330
admittedly, of copyright
infringement

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.510
and that risk isn't
something to be taken lightly.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.430
Statutory damages are up to
$150,000 per work infringed.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.820
Digitizing 10 items and
hitting that elusive,

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.440
that magical number is $1.5
million in potential damages.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.840
We don't digitize 10 items at a
time, we digitize in the thousands,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.150
so digitizing a thousand items

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.310
and getting copyright
wrong would be $150 million

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.820 position:56%
in the absolute worst case scenario.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.410
So those numbers get really scary
really quickly when you're talking

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.270
to a Board of Library Directors.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.080
So because these stakes were
so high the libraries needed

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.900
to do the research
necessary to understand

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.810
and accept these kinds of risks.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.570 position:56%
So after all that research was
done, it is done about these assets,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.040
the question was how do we
make this research actionable?

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.870
So we began looking for
prebuilt rights databases

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.590
where we could input the
data and have a control

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.830
of downstream web properties.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.330
Unfortunately, what
we found surprised us.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.260
In an industry that cares a
lot about standardized metadata

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.610 position:56%
and standardized schemas we found a
real significant lack of consistency

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.010
in rights metadata schemas.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.430
For the most part rights metadata
today is found in some kind

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.490
of free text field, usually in
some kind of DC rights field,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.080
and it's really not useful.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.360
So without having a rights database
prebuilt for us we ended up having

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.610
to build our own, and it's part
of our metadata management system.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.960
In the right side of the MMS
systems we record the provenance

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.340
of how we acquired an object,
do we get any donor restrictions

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.270
or any licenses that came
with that acquisition,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.280
did we secure any licenses
that we can record subsequent

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.700 position:56%
to the acquisition of that material.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.720
We also want to record
the information

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.340
and research that's useful in
determining the copyright status

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.020
of these assets, and we also want
to note how the object can be used

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.660
so it can be programmatically
actionable

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.060
by NYPL's digital properties.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.870
We do all of that by entering
data into the rights database,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.890
which is part of this system.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.510
So we didn't start out recording
copyright status determinations.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.660
Five years ago we made
educated guesses

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.790
about what the copyright status
might be and what we can do

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.410
with those assets and reviewed
each object for those uses,

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.340
but after a few years it became
really clear really quickly

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.710
that we weren't going to be able to
predict every single use NYPL wants

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.370
to make of a digital asset.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.710
So we needed to find another way

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.590
to classify these assets
in our repository.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.030
So thanks to [inaudible] rights
database we could see the potential

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.400
applications for recording the
copyright status determinations

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.700
and making them

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.350
into a programmatically
actionable statements.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.290
So about three years
ago we began evaluating

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.220
and recording copyright status
from nations in our database.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.040 position:56%
Unfortunately, determining copyright
status and determining what is

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.800
in a public domain isn't so tricky,
there isn't some magical database

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.010
in the copyright office across
the street that has a registry

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.470
of all things in the public domain.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.840
So without that official
database of identified works

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.390
in the public domain we had

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.180
to do the same thing,
we had to build our own.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.950
So we've had to make those
determinations ourselves.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.550
Luckily, we've got some really good
tools, some really helpful tools

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.710
to make the law easier
to walk through,

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.350
but those tools are
really only as good

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.210
as the factual information
we have on hand.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.790
Unfortunately, we're often
missing important information

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.400
to help us make a high
confidence determination

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.220
about the copyright status.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:48.520
Take, for example, this letter from
1879 written by Samuel Clemens,

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.260
although this letter appears
to be in the public domain,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.540
for some very quirky reasons
in copyright law it's actually

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.260
in copyright because
of the publication

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.920 position:56%
of it during a certain magical time.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.780
[laughter] So it's really difficult
just looking at an archival item

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.130
to determine whether that item
was subsequently published

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.720
or is in copyright today.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.710
That's the problem we've struggled
with with archival material.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.300
So I started five years ago and
my team's assignment has been

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.650
to review the last 10 years
of digitization at NYPL,

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.510
as well as keep up with the
going forward digitization.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.190
So here's my team, at NYPL we've
got our team researching, analyzing

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.060 position:56%
and entering the rights information.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:37.480
There's me, there's a guy named
Kiowa Hammons, and that's it.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.290
[laughter] So although we're
a really small team we've been

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.870
averaging about a thousand
captures a day at this point,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.420
it's determining and adding
copyright status information

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.040
to those captures.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.130
And by capture I mean a single
page in a book or a photograph,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.300
but we're adding about a
thousand captures a day.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.770
This is our burn down chart.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.160
This is our internal tracking

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.980
of how fast we're moving
through our database.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.360
Since May of 2014 we've added
copyright status determinations

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.750
to about 640,000 captures, and
of the database we have 17% left

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.850
to review and add statuses to.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.790
We think we're going to get through
that in the next six months or so.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.500
We're hoping that the rest of it
is going to be as straightforward

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.990
as the previous, and we'll see.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.120
So of the 847,000 items
we've digitized we believe

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.640
at least 196,000 are
in the public domain.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.710
And by public domain in
this case I mean no known US

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.620
copyright restrictions.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.620
The New York Times described
that phrase as a wonky phrase,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.410
and we agree, but there's a reason
why we had to say, we didn't want

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.240
to say public domain at this point.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.270 position:56%
And, in part, because we wanted to
be a little more accurate than that.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.320
There's two problems with just
saying public domain and leaving it

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.060
at that without some
reference to something else.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.910
First, there's no - first,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.570
this public domain
determination is inherently limited

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.790
to the country's law that
you're applying it to.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.200
There is no international copyright
law, instead we've got a patchwork

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.420
of individual country's laws.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.660
So we had to limit this
down to US copyright

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.030
because that's the only
law that we evaluate under.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.040
Second, we also wanted to be clear

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.120
that we've only evaluated copyright
issues, not other kinds of issues

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.170
like trademark or rights of
publicity, so we wanted to be clear

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.680
about that and that's why we used
the phrase no known copyright

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.270
restriction, no known US
copyright restrictions.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.960
But today with the launch of
rightstatements.org we are going

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.160
to be switching over
our wonky phrase to one

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.160
of the three public domain
options that's out there today.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.300
So with this foundation
of copyright information

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:45.820
and copyright status determinations
the Library felt really comfortable

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.740 position:56%
about the risk issues in making
this high resolution release happen.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.470
So after working with the
Director of the Library,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.740
she ended up approving the high
resolution release of these images

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.670
and that's why we have 197,000 up.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.840
And one other note about public
graphic metadata that's relevant

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.650
to copyright issues, copyright
doesn't protect factual information

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.960
and most of the bibliographic data

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.070
in our repository is just
that, it's just facts.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.370
However, to the extent that
there is any kind of copyright

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.110
in the metadata we have
we've applied a CC0 waver,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:21.510
we've waived our rights under
copyright to that information.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.840
All right, so my team will
continue to review the digitization

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.000
and chip away at our backlog
and we'll keep knocking

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.490
down that number as
low as we can get.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.650
I'll handle it over to Shana now.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.230
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: All right,

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:40.020
so we've got our copyright
house in order.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:45.050
We've enhanced our access
to our API and data.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.490
We've turned brighter lights
on in digital collections

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.390
to the public domain items.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.960
Next up is how do we go about like
revving these engines for reuse?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.480
The first way we did this
was issuing a formal call

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.490
for what we're calling an
NYPL Labs Remix Residency.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.270
This is including a stipend,
two people will be chosen

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.450
and it includes a stipend,
the opportunity to consult

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.500
with Library experts on
projects, the opportunity to work

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.770
in the Library at one of
our research study rooms,

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.960
and to showcase what's made
at NYPL through this program.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.770
In issuing this call for sort of
remixing these public domain works

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.780 position:56%
through this residency program
we're really building on a tradition

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.180
that the Library has had for,
and many research libraries have

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.770
of supporting scholars and
researchers in the creation

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.390
of new works through
offerings of special space

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.730
and consultation opportunities

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.500
and sometimes stipends
to do that kind of work.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.560
And we know that at Labs
we want to sort of bring

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.910
that core mission forward
and apply it

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.180 position:56%
to the creation and digital context.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.510
We're also building on something
that we prototyped last year,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.160
a Net Artist Residency that
we launched in collaboration

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.070
with Electric Objects, a
startup that creates screens

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.370
for the display of digital art.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.640
We paired this with a prior
public domain release we had done

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.750
with our cardographic
works back in 2014,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.850
and we positioned those
open access maps

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.050
as source material
for new creations.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.370 position:56%
Through a competitive review process
we chose Jennie O'Dell [Assumed

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.150
Spelling] as the winner
of this residency,

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.620
and she's a San Francisco
based artist who works

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.050
with Google satellite imagery

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.170
and creates really
amazing digital collages.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.160
Here you're seeing a
collage that she created

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.050
out of shipping containers.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.040
Here's one of cropped circles, and
so she kind of crops these and sort

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.830
of rearranges them and really
plays with perspective in scale

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.360
in really interesting ways.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.400
For a residency with her

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.320
and Electric Objects she took an
interest in the decorative elements

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.950
on the borders of 17th and
18th Century Dutch maps

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:52.430 position:56%
and created this series of collages
that kind of applied her methodology

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.520
but to these historical works.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.930
To round all this out we had an
artist talk at the Map Division

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.040
in NYPL, and this work is on
display still in our Map Division.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.710
So again this is really
what we are trying to drive

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.600
at with our Remix Residency
and really opening this

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.470
up to the fuller sort of
public domain release overall.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.410
To round all of this out and to
kind of continue to drive attention

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.010
to that residency, that call
for proposals for the residency,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.160
and also to kind of
continue to communicate

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.150
about the public domain release
for the months or for the weeks

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.970
and months after the January
drop date, we wanted to also sort

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.920
of have our staff be blogging
about particular collections

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.560
and also position those collections
for different kinds of users,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.680
so educators or creatives,
things like that.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.440
So that was good, that should have
been enough, and December 2015

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.780
like that's where we were.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.450
At the same time, though,
our developers and our R

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.630 position:56%
and D team were busy kind of working
on some elective hack projects,

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.970
some really cool demonstrations
of kind of like using the data

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.290 position:56%
and coming up with some new projects
that really demonstrated sort

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.990
of both what people could apply
to do with the Remix Residency,

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.760 position:56%
but also just to really provide some
like new ways to kind of explore

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.570
and experience these
really rich assets

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.080
that we had in this collection.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.850 position:56%
So Josh is going to take you through
how we really like put the pedal

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:29.890
to the ground in revving these
engines for reuse and sort of talk

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.770
about these hot projects.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.690
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: Okay, these are fun.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.480
The developers had a
lot of fun doing these.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.880
As Shana said, these
were kind of born

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.180
out of personal interest, right?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.260
So they sort of found the segments
of the public domain release

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.760
that were of interest
to them or spoke to them

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.710
and then built some projects on
top of these, and that's part

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.480
of why we kind of held the
release to be able to include these

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.240
with that to show kind of the
passion projects and what can come

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.520
out of the public domain collection
materials that we were offering.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.780
So there's three of these projects
I'll talk through and then kind

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.380
of a fourth overarching one
that was more of a visualization

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.820
of the entire body of stuff.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.370
This first one, Mansion Maniac,

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:10.500
takes as its source
materials a neat publication

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.390
from the early 20th Century that
was these beautiful floor plans

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.170 position:56%
of these massive New York City
apartments, right, these like grand,

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.940
elegant named buildings and showed
all the different rooms, right,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.550
the parlors and the maids
quarters and the libraries and all

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.910
of the entrances and each room and
the square footage and all of that.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.260 position:56%
And the developer kind of cut these
apart and then created an interface.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.560
I'll show you the interaction in
just a second that allowed you

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.180 position:56%
to traverse from one room to another
with a little sprite character

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.390 position:56%
and see how many different rooms you
could chain together as they're sort

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.580
of randomly composed by connecting
the portals to the different rooms.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:54.830
So you start always at the entrance
to one of these grand buildings.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:01.410 position:56%
[pause] And so you sort of wander
around, right, some of the hallways,

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.150
sometimes it's a kitchen, sometimes
you chain together a couple

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.450
of different hallways.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.340
I can't exactly see where
the sprite is in the process,

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.000
but some of these you can,
you end up chaining together

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.180
and there's almost a game-like
element where people have competed

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.610
to see like how large an
apartment you can create,

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.260
especially since most of us live

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.130
in shoebox style apartments this is
kind of like a fun little way of,

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.280
you know, fantasy lands,
apartment building project.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.960
So that's Mansion Maniac.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.010 position:56%
Another one that takes a similar era

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.350
of source material is
Street View Then and Now

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.650
in New York City's Fifth Avenue.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.300
And so there's a publication
from 1911 that took,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.510
that published wide-angle images
of every block of Fifth Avenue

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.690
from Washington Square Park to
what became our Discovery Park

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.160
up in Harlem, so images
of every block

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.190
and then essentially just
juxtaposes the 1911 view

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.600
with a Google street view
and adds a few engagement

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:02.530 position:56%
or interaction opportunities to
navigate from one side of the Island

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:07.140
to another and switch around sides
of the street and you can kind

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.640
of view many of the buildings
that are still there,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.550
many of them that have
been remodeled or torn

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.730
down as the skyline has
changed and all aspects

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.840 position:56%
of Fifth Avenue have kind of updated
over those 104 years, is that right?

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.840
Yes, 104 years.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.920 position:56%
So two kind of more playful
interventions, but there was a third

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.730
that actually took the
historical materials

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.530
in our public domain release and
injected it into the conversation

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.070
about ongoing racial
inequality in the country.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.770
This one takes as its
source material a set

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.500
of publications called The Green
Books, which were published

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:48.230
from 1936 to 1967 and were each
year listings of places like hotels

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.450
and restaurants that were
welcoming to black travelers

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.560
as they traveled the
country in an era

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.670
of Jim Crow laws and Sundown towns.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.590
And so there are - there's
an element here where each

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:05.510
of the listings we were able to
extract, to do some OCR processing

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.060
and extract those things and place
them on a map so there's kind

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.060
of a cluster view, but there's
also a tool I'll show you

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.960
in just a second that
allows you to kind

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.800
of apply modern mapping
technology, right,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.800
sort of Google Map style path
creation using just the listings

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.100
from these volumes.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.310
And so as you take a look
at the - hopefully working -

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.680
interaction here, we were
able to get two volumes done,

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.550
so we have data from
1947 and data from 1956.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.740
There's actually another
kind of neat example

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.830 position:56%
of cultural heritage cross
promotion, the 1947 volume - or, no,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.970
sorry - the 1956 volume is actually
data extracted from that volume

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.960
from the University of South
Carolina, so we were able

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.030
to use their data from that volume
merged with our data from 1947.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.420
And this has proven to be like
a really popular tool just

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.780 position:56%
to see the listings, as well as
we've heard about uses in classrooms

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.660
and all sorts of things like that.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:07.480 position:56%
The final piece, the final projects,
I guess, was meant to answer kind

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.360
of a sub-question about
this 187,000 items,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.960
the question of how do you help
people even look at 187,000 items?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.320 position:56%
So this was a visualization
experiment in giving access to those

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.060
and it creates a sprite, a little
tiny thumbnail for each one

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.620
of the 187,000 items and gives a
couple of different browse paths

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.980
to sort them and then click
through from each image thumbnail

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.500
to the item page on the
digital collections platform.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.490 position:56%
And so you can see here there are
four different ways of sorting them.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.810
You can sort by date
created, pulling metadata

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.760
from the underlying
objects, there's also a way

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.510
to sort using the genre terms from
the metadata, but the final example

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.290
up on the screen is
kind of a neat one

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.450
that used the average
color value of the image.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.450
I was able to sort those,
so what you don't see

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.100
in that example is the fact
that something like 60%

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.150
of the collections are yellow or
brown, right, it's the problem

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:08.290
of the 19th Century,
everything is the same color.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:12.980
And so this is kind of the set
of material that we were able

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.210
to put together and wait till
January to release all together,

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.980
to really give those kind of
shining examples of what we did

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.320
with the materials and
hopefully set kind of the bar

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.020
for what we are hoping
other people will do

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.110
with the exact same
body of materials.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:34.310
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: Okay, so
how did the public respond?

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.600
I'm going to start with sort of
an overview of press responses.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.230
First up was a really amazing
feature in the New York Times

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.460 position:56%
that really kind of went through
every sort of aspect of our release.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.870
It really even started
out with Mansion Maniac,

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.460
which kind of really validated
like our strategic choice to kind

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.100
of package all of this up together.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.000
Got a shout out to Dan Cohen
for giving us an amazing quote,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.010
thank you for blurbing our
public domain release, Dan.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:08.170
And then from there like the news
was just really kind of a flood,

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.730
like we had like over 100 news
outlets that really picked

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.400
up the story, everything
from national news outlets,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.360 position:56%
like Washington Post, The
Atlantic, PBS News Hour, local news.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.280
In the US all kinds of
outlets, like really sort

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.610
of finding their own
sort of collections,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.270
like things that represented
their locality in our collection.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.800
The same thing with international
news outlets, Japan, Russia,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.470
Singapore, India and many more,
so finding that sort of story

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.230
and that representation in
our digital collections.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.050
And some of them were
really putting history

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.350
in the context of the present.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.840 position:56%
This is one of my favorite examples.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.920 position:56%
What would Beyonce's formation might
have looked like if it were set

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.610
in the 1930s, so kind of pulling
in some photographs from the FSA

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:55.550
to kind of like illustrate
what a historical version

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.360
of that video would be.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.910
More seriously, PRI's the world
took 19th Century photographs

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.660
of Ellis Island that were - of
Ellis Island immigrants that are

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.370
in our digital collections and
juxtaposed those with those

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.550
of contemporary Syrian refugees
to really sort of draw some sort

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:17.170
of commonalities between
these across time,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.270
and that was really amazing to see.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.310
Also the public kind of
went nuts on the internet,

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.730
people are comparing our digital
or our public domain release

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.630
with the biggest drop in Beyonce,
and this is the first time

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.500
and only time I've referenced
Beyonce twice in a presentation.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.310
So thank you for giving
me this chance.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.370
I also got some great
kudos from Cory Doctorow,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.500
a great open access advocate who
gave us a nice pat on the back.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.970
And then like it turned out
that we had sort of developed

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.730
like everyone's favorite
procrastination machine,

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.750
so people are getting like
lost in the collections,

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.990
they're getting addicted
to exploring and browsing,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.740
I think our visualization
tool was a big engine of this.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.750
Land ladies in rural
Vermont are sort of trying

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.150
to bribe Jessamyn West, one
of our librarian colleagues,

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.120
with fudge to help her
find public domain items.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.830
As Josh mentioned, people were
really enjoying sort of sharing

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.850
out their generated sort of
mansions, using Mansion Maniac.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.000
MEMs [Assumed Spelling] start
getting feeded, I'd like to add you

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.700
to my professional
network on LinkedIn.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.730
Gift making, actually one of our
gift makers is in the audience -

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.030 position:56%
Derek [Assumed Spelling], thank you,

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.950
you made this one I'm
showing right now, yes?

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.550
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: And then also
we issued a call or just asked you

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.510
to hashtag really for
any sort of examples

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.720
of organic reuse that
were coming about.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.740
We've seen hundreds of uses of this
hashtag and remix on both Instagram

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.600
and Tumblr, I would encourage
you to explore those,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.780 position:56%
including one of our favorite
examples of some guy in Williamsburg

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.530
who has been remixing public
domain images and using them

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.490
on skateboard decks
and like selling those,

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.090
which has been really
kind of fun to see.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.390
So like check those out.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.040
Illustrators, designers
drawing a lot of inspiration

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.440
for their own creative
works from the collections.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.430
A couple weeks after the release
we participated in a Glam wide sort

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.940
of promotional effort called
Color Our Collections.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:22.040 position:56%
We created a little coloring booklet
out of a select 12 or so images.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.990
Made those available for
download and participated in this

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.660
like sort of, like I
said, this broader sort

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.600
of celebration of open materials.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.040
And DeUser [Assumed Spelling] just
created her own coloring book,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.890
as well, out of Bernice
Abbott's photos.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.590
Seeing some examples of reuse

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.820
in the digital humanities
community, as well.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.800 position:56%
I want to thank John Ressig [Assumed
Spelling] for teaching me how

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.050
to say paste-C [Assumed
Spelling], this sort of tool

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:51.000
that Ryan Baumann is using to kind
of do an image recognition analysis

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.720
across our open collections
and those

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.230
of the Rijks [Assumed
Spelling] Museum.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:58.340 position:56%
And also Miriam Posner, a Digital
Humanities Professor, really excited

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.230
about using these in her class.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.800
Our API has been used to
create some Twitter Bots,

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.790
including one by Shawn Averkamp,

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:11.130
our colleague in the audience here
today, I Classify Bot is hers.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.980
And, finally, another
sort of category

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.840
of response has been the response
to the call for proposals,

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.360 position:56%
so we received close to 300
applications by computer scientists,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.600
artists, hacktivist collectives,
educators, filmmakers,

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.460
data visualization
designers, uralists,

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.180
a well-known Indy rock musician,

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.070
a designer of a classic
video arcade game.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.690
We're in the selection process
right now, but we're so sort

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.410
of thrilled by this response.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.280
People are proposing new works
as diverse as like transmedia,

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.100 position:56%
narratives starring an army of Bots,

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.490
immersive visual reality
experiences, scavenger hunts,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.290
animations, and the list goes on.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.610
We're going to be really
excited to be sharing the results

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.010
of that work in the coming months.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.960
And to tell you, no
presentation would be complete

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.690
without some numbers, so
I'm going to turn this

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.140
over to Josh to give you a rundown.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.600
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: Okay,
you wanted big numbers,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.400
you're going to get big numbers.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.070
So this is my favorite,
sort of an anecdotal piece,

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.360
but in the first five weeks of the
launch, right, January 6th just

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.550
into February, we had more traffic,

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.830
more visits to our digital
collections platform than we had

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.170 position:56%
in the entire calendar year of 2015.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.260
And previous to the launch we had
thought that the calendar year

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.520
of 2015 was going pretty well.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.810
So that was really edifying.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.950
Three months out, so
January 6th to April 6th,

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.540
we had 1.8 million
sessions to the site,

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.680
but we also had 3.2
million calls for API,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.080
right, trying to pull the data.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.820
So it kind of confirmed our
suspicion that both aspects

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.940
of this were desirable
and being used.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.540
We had 680,000 some
downloads of assets

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.300
from our digital collections
platform and 290,000 of those were

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.830
of these kind of previously
uncovered high resolution assets

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.640
that we were making available.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.730
Beyond that, right, so we're
now 14 weeks out from the day

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.730 position:56%
of the drop and we had a huge spike.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.990
Then, right, as these things
go the traffic comes back down,

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.880
and it has come back down but it
hasn't come all the way back down.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.470
Every day, we haven't had
a day that has been less

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.650
than one-and-a-half times
the previous traffic.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.850
So we're feeling like that
we're settling into a baseline

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.180
of one-and-a-half to two
times increase in traffic.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.540
There's been an ongoing 50%
increase in pages view3ed,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.170
25% increase in the
length of the session.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.280
So people, it sort of stuck, right?

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.210
That's the takeaway,
separate from the numbers,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.330
is that this wasn't sort
of a blip on the radar,

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.280
this had a lasting impression
in terms of the way it's lodged

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:49.160
into search results and
traffic to our site.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: I'm going to bring
this on home with some takeaways

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.910
and then leave some
time for questions.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.230
So I guess for us, obviously,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.190
there's a huge demand
for this stuff.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.240
And like we knew it
was going to be big,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.480
but like people really,
really love this.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.630
We thought we were in the giving
away free content business,

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.210
but it turns out that we're really

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.990
in like an audience
development business,

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:16.240
that we really developed a huge
sort of, yes, audience and people

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.580 position:56%
who are not just like looking at
the stuff but really want to use it.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.790
What's going to be a challenge for
us ahead is sustaining this demand

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:27.040 position:56%
and interest and kind of
continuing a sort of steady drumbeat

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.150
of promotion and for like
things that we digitize,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:36.090
things that Greg's team, his
huge team, is sort of clearing.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:40.090
We're going to be soon approaching
200,000 public domain images,

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.020
so like these are new opportunities
for us to kind of like continue

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:47.280
to share out about the
public domain collections

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.120
and position them for reuse.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.310
And I also think a big takeaway
for us has also been to think

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.940
in a new way about our R
and D capacity as a lab.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.570
These were like lightweight
rapid proofs of concepts

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.110
that demonstrate what can be done
with open collections and data,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:05.230
and we just really feel
like that they were

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.970
such a critical part of
this release overall.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.460
And so that's something that we're
going to be really thinking about

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.860
and sort of applying I think in
the future for other projects.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.420 position:56%
And, finally, because we are at
DPLA Fest if we achieved what we did

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.960
with NYPL collections, like sort
of imagine like what happens

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.230
when we were all like
revving our engines for reuse

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.990
and it's a collective like
at the community as DPLA.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.930
So thank you.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.430
We have some time for questions.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.510
You guys want to come up?

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:45.230
[ Pause ]

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:51.340
Oh, okay. No, Dan deferred to you,
so we'll go Derek, then Dan, yes.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.650
Sorry, misread the language.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.510

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:18.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.380
&gt;&gt; Greg Cram: So everything
- identifying things

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.490
in the public domain was
tricky and that was hard

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.330
and because the copyright
office doesn't keep a record

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.250
of that it was even harder.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.310
I think doing things like this,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.640
demonstrating that we can identify
things in the public domain

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.800 position:56%
and hopefully all of us using
rightstatements, dot org statements,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.380
we're going to develop
almost by accident

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:43.860 position:56%
but probably not a public domain
registry of cultural heritage items.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.870
And I think that there's
some power in that,

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.620
demonstrating what we think
is in the public domain.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.350
because what we expect is
going to happen is that things

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.180
in NYPL's collections that we mark
as public domain are going to be

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.860
in your collections and you might
be able to rely or want to rely

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.230
on our determination so you can
kind of move past that item.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:07.180 position:56%
In the context of a larger copyright
policy we are heavily engaged

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.260
in those conversations in DC.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:14.290 position:56%
I'm down here a lot, talk to
Congress and to the copyright office

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.540
about better copyright
policy and not messing

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.940
up what we've got right now.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.780
I think that demonstrating the
value of public domain is good

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.530
when we start talking
about whether we're going

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.780
to extend copyright
protection for another 20 years,

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.510 position:56%
if that proposal ever goes anywhere.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.090
I think things like this, showing
the value of public domain,

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.440
will eliminate or hopefully
reduce that argument.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:38:06.490
[ Inaudible ]

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Greg Cram: Okay, so the first
step is start to identify the things

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:12.800
that are in the public
domain, and then ...

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.540
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: Yes, I
mean I guess, you know,

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.490
I think that thinking about
collection strengths and thinking

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.070
about audiences that
might be interested

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.810
and not the usual suspects.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.460
And I think that there's like so
many different forms of that kind

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.270
of activation of this
kind of content can take.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:36.040
Hosting hackathons, you know,
inviting artist commissions.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.170
It doesn't have to be
something that's a competition,

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.180
it can be something
that's a collaboration.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.300
I think by creating
an experience around,

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.890 position:56%
like thinking about like what are
sort of like interesting experiences

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.600
that you can create
around these collections.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.230
And, like I said, so they
could take, yes, several forms.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.030
I also want to shout out to F.E.
Kobsolus [Assumed Spelling],

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.250
who is here from the
Smithsonian Archives,

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.880
who has just created this
amazing case study institutions

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.580
across the Glam sector who have
opened their materials and has

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.050
like done a really amazing job
of sort of like gathering sort

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:14.390 position:56%
of anecdotal and other kinds of data
that are sort of showing the impact.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.920
And so that other institutions
who are thinking about trying

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.740
to do something like this will have
that as like a really great tool.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.390
F.E. if you could like
tweet that out, yes, great.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.590
So, yes, I would say
like read F.E.'s report,

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.060
get your copyright house
in order, and like think

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.370
about unique opportunities to
activate those collections.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.820
Did you want to add anything, Josh?

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.420
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: Like creating
context around it, right,

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.340
like it's one thing to do - you
know, we chose to do this kind

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.860
of all-in heterogeneous
drop of 187,000 things,

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.940
but we had considered doing
more of a serialized approach

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.490
and doing batches and
collections, right?

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:52.020
We did, actually, the first one
we did was 20,000 maps in 2014

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.650
and that actually was really
powerful in its own way

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.930
because it was able to be targeted
and we were able to create context

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.230
around it in its own way.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.360
So I think that could
be another strategy.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.450
If it isn't necessarily the right
way to do it, everything all

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.250
at once, you can maybe
serialize it and do - you know,

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.300
to do smaller amount of
materials with the right context,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.270
that will help it sing, that will
help it reach the activation energy

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:18.510
to probably extend it even further.

for now I don't think we're going

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.590
to be enabling high res
downloads of undetermined,

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.350
things that are undetermined.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.920
I think that for us although
we like to push the envelope

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.560
in some ways we are still
a little more conservative.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.310
We don't have sovereign immunity.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:11.170
We are a private corporation
and we report to a Board.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.610
So there's - I think there's a
little bit of a concern there

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.910
with some of that material.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.330
I think, though, that we can
- we're exposing more items

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.780
that would have otherwise
been kept in the dark

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.230
by doing this rights review work.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:28.030
things that are, you know,
even things published as late

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:31.170
as 1989 we've been able
to make available online

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.140
because we've been using
the copyright laws,

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.840
we've identified them as
public domain, or even orphans

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.590
where we think that the work
is an orphan work and we think

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.690
that there's no potential
for a lawsuit,

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.820
I think we've been making those
things available more broadly.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.370
So maybe not in a high res, but in
a way that exposes that collection

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.310
in a way that we wouldn't
have done that 10 years ago

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.880
or even probably five years ago.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.070
We've felt more and more
confident with their use.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.350
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: Just
to answer another part

00:41:58.350 --> 00:41:59.650
of your question, what next?

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.420
Another part of what's next is
applying the right statements

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.750
and I think we'll do that
basically as soon as we can.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.730
And beyond that I think we're
not racing to double the number,

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:13.320
2017 we need to now
have 400,000 statements.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.730
I think for us adding more -

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:18.040
that is not necessarily the
best thing to do for us.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.670
I think it's more about continuing
what we have been able to do,

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.040
highlighting gems that have
been digitized for 10 years.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.910
there's a new project that we
didn't build called [inaudible]

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.900
which used not necessarily
public domain photos but photos

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.050
from our collection, but they'd
been online for 10 or 11 years

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.570
but it was this mapping [inaudible]
that really allowed them to sing.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.380
And so helping I think identify
those areas and helping developers,

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.020
whatever, get access to those.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.400
So it's about activating maybe
the stuff that we already did,

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.900
instead of doing a whole new
release, just refreshing that one.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.790
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: Yes, and I'll
say, too, just like from the reuse,

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.030
sort of like the program
aspect of this,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:56.610
like the sort of public outreach
aspect, this idea of reuse is just

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:58.940
so interesting to our
like our Library overall,

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.740
like both on the digital
side of things but also

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.130
in the Research Library
more broadly.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.630
So we're really interested
in sort of starting to think

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:09.320
about how do we continue
to sort of tell the stories

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.520 position:56%
of how our collections are being
used, the kind of interesting things

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.970
that are being created out of
them, eBay, an academic book,

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.410
work of journalism or some kind
of interesting like math interface

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.850
to a historic collection.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:51.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.340
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: So the development
of The Green Book project,

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.480
I mean this is - we love telling
the story because this is kind

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.950
of a perfect series of events.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:01.730
So it was proposed for digitization
more than a year-and-a-half ago,

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.070
I mean almost two years ago
at this point by a curator

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:09.630
of the Schomburg Center who knew
the history of the materials.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:15.140 position:56%
We had basically a complete run, I
think we're only missing one volume.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.010
And said we have to digitize these,

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.170
they're kind of some amazing
artifacts that we have.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:24.510
So we digitized them
and we put them online.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.430
Again, they were online
for a year-and-a-half,

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.440
and a few people say them and maybe

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.700
to them it wasn't the
right format for use.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:41.730
And so we had been talking
to the curator and sort

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.170
of just said a back
burner idea for us.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:50.940
And then in the run-up to the
public domain release the developer

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.330
who built that kind of said,
okay, this is what I want

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:59.430
to spend a couple of weeks
doing, and then actually worked

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:03.410
with a bunch of folks to
do the text processing

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.680
and extracting all
the different things.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.330
So that was a great example
of an idea that had been sort

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.630
of waiting to activate [inaudible].

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.930
And in terms of sort of
long-term sustainability,

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.230
like these were basically meant
to be quick projects released

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:13.530 position:56%
as examples and they're [inaudible].

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.830
It's not like there are servers
that are running or a lot

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:16.130
of infrastructure that's
involved in keeping these,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.430
but we publish all the code
openly for all of those, too,

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.730
so that's not a sustainability
strategy but it is like meant to be

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.530 position:56%
as an example that hopefully other
people can take and use [inaudible].

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:39.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.300
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: To answer the second
one first, I don't talk to donors

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.950
and there's a whole
separate staff that does,

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.840
but we know anecdotally it
absolutely has, just the response

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.510
to this has informed
conversations that have been had

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.560 position:56%
about trying to acquire collections.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:55.430 position:56%
And so that, positively in basically
every case that we've heard.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.850
And in terms of how
it's informed digitized.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.150
The conversation about what

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.980
to select is sort of
changing every week.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.940
It's like we had already been
talking about the privacy

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.080
of public domain and
how that really aligns

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.260
with our mission before we
did the public domain release.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.090
So I think that was
already pretty well baked

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:14.110
into what is usually
selected for digitization,

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.550
but it is absolutely informing
and especially as we get more data

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:22.120
and more anecdotal use about
what has really surprised us

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.250
in terms of use and reuse.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.190
It has, but it's hard to
tell you exactly how it has.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.400
We have so many different
streams we're feeding

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.510
into what is desired
to go into the cameras.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:47:28.170
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.910
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: I mean Josh
and I both have like shady pasts

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.510
in publishing and so does our
Director [inaudible] and like, yes.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:47.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.360
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: It must have.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.660
[laughter]

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.960
&gt;&gt; Josh Hadro: An editorial,
I mean, yes.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.630
I don't know that we like
mapped it out into the sort

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:56.510
of publication schedule
or exactly, right.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:14.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.240
&gt;&gt; Shana Kimball: I mean I guess
like part of my role is kind

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.180
of helping the NYPL's like
flagship social media channels,

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.080
kind of like activate
what we're doing in Labs.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.520
So it's like we're running
our own social media.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:31.130
We have this whole sort of program
design, but a big part of what we

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.740
like jokingly call it, like the
institutional hacking - you know,

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.940
so it's like how do we make sure?

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.530
Because we don't like think
of Facebook, I mean it's just

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:42.220 position:56%
like another communication
channel, Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.720
and our channels have so many -
like those flagship accounts have

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.420
so many followers and so that was
a really critical part of helping

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.320
to kind of like get the word
out and sustain interest.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.520
And even Labs, like I think our
account is like 10,000 followers,

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.520
like that's good but it's
not like web scale, you know?

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.600
And the NYPL accounts - I mean

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.960
if I'm answering your question
appropriately, like, no,

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.260
we don't see that that is
like a bad way for people

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.260
to be encountering these images
or sharing them or, if anything,

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:21.200
it's like this very visible daily
reminder that, yes, people are just

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.320
like enjoying just the sharing.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.620
Like this is an amazing collection.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.060
There's this radio producer,
I think it's Science Friday,

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.770
who just has become obsessed with
our - it's like every day he does

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:36.590
like some sort of like
tweet storm of his favorites

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.210
or science related tweets and
like he's a fan, you know?

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.420
And he's helping to kind of
share with his audiences,

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.080
and we see that as a
really great outcome.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.210
All right, thanks.
