ASH SCHEDER BLACK: Tech up
level is a student engagement

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.080
experience in which
we hire students

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.643
on to develop software and
web-based applications for U

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:14.510
of A faculty or
administrative units.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.440
But to do it in a way that
allows the students to learn

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.450
a tremendous amount on the job.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.590
HAZZA ALKAABI: In a sense,
this is actually a very rich

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.680
learning experience.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.460
I learned, not just
software skills,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.060
it's more than, just team
skills, communication skills.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.510
You hone all these skills.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.500
You have deadlines that
you would love to make

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.470
and so you always
try to make them.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.960
And that's why
it's exciting here.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.790
ASH SCHEDER BLACK:
When we pull together,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.560
we learn a lot faster.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.766
We invent a lot
quicker, and we spread

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.890
the knowledge a lot faster.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.250
It amazes me every day for
like the things that I can do.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310
And every day when I
solve another problem,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.380
I'm just so proud of
myself because it's just

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.410
so amazing like the
things that I can do now.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.459
It's so interesting how
everything works together

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:11.220
on so many different
levels to produce this.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.400
It's amazing.
