00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:12.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.470
JILL DOLAN: I don't think people
who aren't LGBT can

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.630
quite imagine what it feels
like to hear the lyrics of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.700
"Old Nassau" and feel both
inside and outside of the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.840
University's anthem.


00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.470
Can they imagine how it feels to
hear, tune every heart and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.520
every voice, bid every care
withdraw, sung at alumni day

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.310
or after a basketball game, and
want to tune your heart to

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.550
the song's invitation to
community, but to wonder

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.740
whether your voice
is part of the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.140
every to which it gestures.


00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.010
Living an invisible subcultural
life in a school

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.240
like Princeton, which takes such
pride in its traditions

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.550
of belonging, is heartbreaking
to contemplate, and to many

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.220
LGBT alumni, painful
to remember.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.450
BILL THOM: A recurring theme
is the sense of isolation,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.820
that you were the
only one world.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.400
AMY CAMPBELL: We separated
our work life from

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.900
our personal life.


00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.720
And as long as we did that,
the secret was safe.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.400
HELEN ZIA: Being in my early
20s then, I just was like,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.520
OK, how do I answer this?


00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.760
Am I a lesbian?


00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.400
ALICE MILLER: I used to go to
the university bookstore and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.630
flip through abnormal psychology
books to try to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.790
identify something that looked
like how I felt.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.960
KAREN KRAHULIK: I thought, well,
gee, if I have a chance

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.000
of being straight,
it's probably

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.020
going to be at Princeton.


00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.860
GARY KING: I can only point to
one member of my class who I

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.520
knew at the time I was an
undergraduate who was out as

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.560
an LGBT student.


00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.960
KAREN MAGEE: It was very
much of a kind of

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.780
secret society, almost.


00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.150
GARY KING: When it comes down
to writing a history or

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.990
researching a history for a
group, which may, in a lot of

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.420
people's minds, be an
invisible group.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.510
I think it is a challenge.


00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.570
BILL THOM: When I entered
in 1959, we were

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.660
10 years from Stonewall.


00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.690
Nobody I knew either there or
anyplace else for that matter

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.820
was openly gay, man or woman.


00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.240
ALICE MILLER: I've never heard
of another trans person there.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.720
There has to be statistically.


00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.920
And I used to like to think
I was the first woman to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.020
graduate from Princeton.


00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.210
But I don't really
believe that.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.370
The university in those days
was a couple hundred years

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.100
old, and there has to have been,
even if nobody knew what

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.490
transsexual was and is.


00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.030
PETER LIGHTE: In certain ways,
there was nothing easier about

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.570
sexuality than there was about
classical Chinese.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.580
And both were dispatched,
I'm happy to say, in an

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.300
environment that let
that happen.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.270
But it certainly wasn't
a walk in the park.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.260
HELEN ZIA: For being at
Princeton in those days when

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.800
there was so much activism,
there was also so much

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.620
homophobia.


00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.820
I think there was,
not just for me--

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.050
I'm sure everyone who might have
come out or might have

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.280
been questioning at that time
was also subject to the same

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.950
homophobia that was there.


00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.330
GARY KING: One of my classmates
was the head of the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.440
Gay Alliance of Princeton
during our time there.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.780
On his freshman year dormitory,
he hung out a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.490
banner for the Gay Alliance
of Princeton.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.940
So if anybody was walking across
near Wilson college,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.280
there was no way you could do
this huge Gay Alliance of

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.540
Princeton orange and
black banner.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.290
Early in the second semester,
the room was vandalized.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.670
So people broke into the room,
vandalized the room, took the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.400
banner, and tore the banner, I
mean, just tore it to shreds

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.270
There was a full
investigation.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.130
Any of the students who were
found who broke into the room

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.500
were suspended.


00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.350
So there was reaction from the
university that this kind of

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.230
action will not be tolerated
by the university.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.960
We will not tolerate
vandalism.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.310
We will not tolerate going
into anybody's room.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.530
And we will not tolerate any
prejudice against any of our

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.600
student body.


00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.670
SUE ANNE STEFFEY MORROW: I'm Sue
Anne Steffey Morrow, and I

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.710
became associate dean of the
chapel and religious life.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.740
I think for some of us it's hard
to imagine, but maybe not

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.530
for others of us, is how deeply
closeted the students

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.310
were at Princeton.


00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.830
KAREN MAGEE: Thinking back on
it, I don't think the world at

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.650
Princeton back in the late '70s
and early '80s was much

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.630
different than the
world at large.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.150
I mean, there weren't a lot of
people that were out at that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.140
point in time anywhere.


00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.180
TIM WU: I came to Princeton
in 1980.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.980
And that was a time when the
campus was really just

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.560
starting to embrace the ideas
of difference and diversity.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.240
It was a new paradigm.


00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.420
SUE ANNE STEFFEY MORROW:
We wanted to reach

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.920
out to the gay students.


00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.920
But where were they?


00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.880
And when I came in the fall of
'81, I talked, I asked, I

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.700
asked around.


00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.310
And it took me time to discover
that in fact, there

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.240
was a small group that met in
the dark, back corner of the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.950
Murray-Dodge Cafe.


00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.360
The first meeting I went to,
there may have been four or

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.750
five undergraduate men there.


00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.920
The lesbians met in the women's
center, which was in

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.770
Aaron Burr Hall on
the second floor.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.940
KAREN MAGEE: I was very involved
in the women's center

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.950
when I was at Princeton.


00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.260
So there was certainly a
community around that.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.440
SHAWN COWLS: The role models
there were the handful of

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.050
students who are brave
enough to be out and

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.890
outspoken and known.


00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.410
One professor who was openly
gay, Michael Cadden, was

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.580
definitely somebody
I looked up to.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.390
KAREN KRAHULIK: I'm Karen
Krahulik, class of 1991.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.230
I wrote my senior thesis
on gay and

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.960
lesbian marriages, which--


00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.910
god, I don't even know how I
knew about them, but I knew

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.960
that they existed.


00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.570
I loved doing this work.


00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.670
I loved going out there, finding
people who had been

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.680
married, finding the ministers
who had performed the

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.800
marriages, investigating
the legal aspects,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.460
the historical aspects.


00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.760
SUE ANNE STEFFEY MORROW: I
officiated at the first gay

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.370
marriage in the university
chapel.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.270
SUMAN CHARKRABORTY: When I was
at Princeton, and because we

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.760
were such a small community,
we really wanted to

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.580
be noticed on campus.


00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.880
We wanted the issue of closeted
students and support

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.110
for out students to be something
that the campus was

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.950
thinking about and that
the administration

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.800
was concerned about.


00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.240
And we used to have events
throughout the course of the

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.710
year in order to make
that happen.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.870
Gay Jeans Day was one of them.


00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.380
And the message was simple--
if you support the LGBT

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.970
community, wear jeans.


00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.360
On the college campus, where
most people wear jeans, that

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.290
was a tough message to sell.


00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.150
We used to have a Gay
Jeans Day rally

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.640
right outside the chapel.


00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.090
And people would be
furious with us.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.590
They'd say, how can you put a
message on something I wear

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.700
every single day?


00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.750
For us, it was the


00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.770
conversation that it was starting.


00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:33.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.700
AMY CAMPBELL: Over time, building
upon those quiet

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.610
conversations, when the LGBT
Center came along and the

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.980
strength of Debbie Bazarsky and
the folks in her office

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.450
really created a climate where
it was much safer and where

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.640
LGBT students across campus
were welcomed.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:58.510 position:97%
 


00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.450
[APPLAUSE]


00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.430
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Hi.


00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.910
Thank you.


00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:10.680
I can't tell you how happy
I am at this moment.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.710
This is really a dream come true
to have this center here

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.470
in the Frist Campus Center, but
more importantly, to have

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.440
so many people here
celebrating that

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.760
we have such a center.


00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.970
I think all of you know that
none of this, and I mean none

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.700
of this, would have happened
without Debbie Bazarsky.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.110
[APPLAUSE]


00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.400
DEBBIE BAZARSKY: When I first
arrived at Princeton in 2001,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.390
there were very few out
students on campus.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.300
I could actually name and count
the number of students

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.910
on my hands.


00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.760
There were very few students
in general that were out.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.580
And a number of students I met
chose to come to Princeton

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.260
because they thought it would
make them stay in the closet.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.830
They could have gone to more
liberal or open institutions,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.460
but they thought that Princeton


00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.860
would keep them closeted.


00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.820
I feel like we've come from that
place to the place where

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.630
we are today, where we have 50
or 60 out students coming to

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.700
campus already out every year.


00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.660
And we have a really vibrant
community on campus.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.870
TOBIAS RODRIGUEZ: We should have
a space like that, but we

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.460
also shouldn't take it for
granted, because there are

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.280
many other colleges that
don't have it.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.380
We're one of the few that has
that and has a lot of

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.990
programming come out
of it every year.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.810
SHEHZAD UKANI: It's incredible
to think that in 1972, someone

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.730
release an ad in The Prince
about "Closet Queens Unite!,"

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.220
and it's come to becoming
an entire center.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.690
And I really feel indebted to
so many people because of my

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.430
very, very positive experience
that I've had with a large

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.950
part of my Princeton career
here, particularly to

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.780
President Tilghman, who is the
reason why we have a center in

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.880
the first place.


00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.990
COLE CRITTENDEN: For me, what
was really terrific about

00:09:53.990 --> 00:10:02.090
Princeton is that it felt like
this inclusive and supportive

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.890
place from the day I arrived.


00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.990
KAREN MAGEE: I had the
opportunity to serve as a

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.140
trustee with both Harold Shapiro
as president and

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.840
Shirley Tilghman.


00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.240
And I think both Harold and
Shirley contributed in

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.440
enormous ways to making
Princeton the place that it is

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.930
today, making sure that all
alumni felt welcome there.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.820
JEFF NUNOKAWA: What has Shirley
Tilghman done for the

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.770
gay and lesbian community?


00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.030
What has she done for the gay
and lesbian community?

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.890
I suppose just about as much as
one single individual can

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.850
do for a community.


00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.500
SHIRLEY TILGHMAN: This is, I
think one of the most dramatic

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.130
cultural changes that I'd ever
experienced in my life, which

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:49.160
is the change in people's
attitudes toward LGBT

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.560
individuals.


00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.190
So I think Princeton has
benefited from that.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.970
But I think it is also
attributed to the fact that we

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:03.660
now have three members of our
cabinet who are openly gay and

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.220
have, I think signaled to the
rest of the University

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:15.200
community that this is a place
where LGBT individuals can

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.030
really thrive.
