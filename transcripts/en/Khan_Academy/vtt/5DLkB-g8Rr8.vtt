00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:02.385
- [Voiceover] We’re told, "the
graph of the function f of x

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:03.628
"is equal to x-squared."

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:05.694
We see it right over here in grey.

00:00:05.694 --> 00:00:06.786
It’s shown in the grid below.

00:00:06.786 --> 00:00:08.527
"Graph the function g of x is equal to

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:10.861
"x minus two-squared, minus four

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:12.649
"in the interactive graph."

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.052
This is from the shifting
functions exercise

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:16.797
on Khan Academy, and we can see

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:23.620
we can change the graph of g of x.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.687
But let’s see, we want
to graph it properly,

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:27.649
so let’s see how they relate.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:28.707
Well, let’s think about a few things.

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:31.963
Let’s first just make g
of x completely overlap.

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:34.964
Okay, there you go.

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:36.748
Now they're completely overlapping.

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:38.191
And let’s see how they’re different.

00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:41.558
Well, g of x, if you look
at what's going on here,

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:42.881
instead of having an x-squared,

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.656
we have an x minus two-squared.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:49.359
So, one way to think about
it is, when x is zero,

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.995
you have zero-squared is equal to zero.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:53.583
But how do you get zero here?

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:55.091
Well, x has got to be equal to two.

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:58.659
Two minus two-squared is zero-squared,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.842
if we don’t look at the
negative four just yet.

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:03.582
And so, we would want to shift this graph

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.788
over two to the right.

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:08.551
This is essentially how much
do we shift to the right.

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.490
It’s sometimes a little
bit counterintuitive

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.055
that we have a negative there,

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.518
because you might say, well, negative,

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:17.084
that makes me think that I
want to shift to the left.

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:18.686
But you have to remind yourself is like,

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:21.078
well okay, for the original graph,

00:01:21.078 --> 00:01:23.005
when it was just x-squared,

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.672
to get the zero-squared, I
just have to put x equals zero.

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:30.261
Now to get a zero-squared,
I have to put in a two.

00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:33.756
So this is actually shifting
the graph to the right.

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.624
And so, what do we do
with this negative four?

00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:38.319
Well, this is a little bit more intuitive,

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.956
or at least for me when
I first learned it.

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:42.452
This literally will just
shift the graph down.

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.918
Whatever your value is
of x minus two-squared,

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:47.328
it's gonna shift it down by four.

00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:49.333
So what we wanna do is just shift

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.589
both of these points down by four.

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:53.493
So this is gonna go from nine,

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:56.523
and this is gonna go from the
coordinate five comma nine,

00:01:56.523 --> 00:02:01.051
to five comma, if we go
down four, five comma five.

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.721
And this is gonna go from two comma zero,

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.519
to two comma negative four.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:08.888
Two comma negative four.

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:11.147
Did I do that right?

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:14.043
I think that’s right.

00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:16.727
What, essentially, what
we have going on is,

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:19.788
g of x is f of x shifted two

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:23.148
to the right and four down.

00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:25.792
Two to the right and four down.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.626
And notice, if you look
at the vertex here,

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:31.051
we shifted two to the right and four down.

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:35.216
And I shifted this one also,
this one also I shifted

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:38.596
two to the right, and four down.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:40.328
And, there you have it.

00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:43.880
We have graphed g of x,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.324
which is a shifted version of f of x.
