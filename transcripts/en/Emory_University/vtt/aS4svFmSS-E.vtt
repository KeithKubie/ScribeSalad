First of all there is no typical workday.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.200
My research focus is on how bacteria resist antibiotics,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.620
so I've been studying various issues of antibiotic resistance since my graduate student days.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.980
So when I came here in 1982, I was studying both Staph aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.460
and now my lab concentrates solely on Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.120
I came to the VA here in December of 1986.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.640
I have a variety of administrative 
responsibilities both at Emory and at the VA so I go back and forth.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.520
Our real concern is without new antibiotics coming out of the pharmaceutical pipeline

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.120
that has very severely thinned over the years,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.500
is that there could be cases of untreatable infection.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.020
I think science can cure this issue, but it's going to take a lot of money,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.800
It’s going to take political will. It's also going to take education .

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.520
I'm the product of a military family. My mother and father met in England in late 1943.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.300
My mother was a nurse and my father was in the medical service corps.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.500
Both were young lieutenants. She was from Providence, Rhode Island, and he was from Ft. Scott, Kansas.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.900
I was born in Yokohama, that's where my father was stationed.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.600
He remained stationed in Japan ’till 1956. So I was born on July 4, 1954.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.740
You know as a kid I asked a lot of questions and people didn't ignore those questions,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.120
so, you know, in thinking back, I had a lot of people who influenced me.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:18.500
And then I went off to college in 1972 and I started graduate school in 1975 and finished my PhD in 1979.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.460
I went to North Carolina for my postdoc from ’79 to ’82.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.000
She was a post-op nurse on the orthopedic surgery floor at Duke University.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.800
I have two boys and I have four grandchildren.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.960
You know I get a lot of joy in teaching in the classroom. I give this lecture every year to undergraduates at Emory College

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.580
in Dr. Michelle Lampl’s predictive health course, on the post-antibiotic era.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.160
I also run a graduate training program called Antimicrobial Resistance and Therapeutic Discovery Training Program.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.620
So I'm interacting with students all the time. I love what I'm doing.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.680
I love being a faculty member, a researcher, and that's an incredible feeling that you have.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.680
So I wouldn't trade this for anything. I hope I have shown people some new  possibilities, some new strategies.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.960
I've been fortunate to be funded for some time, and I hope that we can continue for some time,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.410
because I feel like I still have contributions to make.
