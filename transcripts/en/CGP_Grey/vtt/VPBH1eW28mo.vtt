00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Hello Internet. We need to talk about locks

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.280
The physical and the digital.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.620
In the physical world, locks aren't as good as you think they are.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.900
The lock on your door stops worries, not burglars,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.320
As two minutes of searching will reveal.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.300
Spend more, get more; but all fail with tools and time enough.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.120
That physical locks are bad at locking mostly doesn't matter in normal life,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.180
Because burglars are constrained by the physical world.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.540
A burglar must cruise the neighborhood, spending their time to pick a target,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.440
Which makes a house that looks secure most of the way toward being secure.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.660
Each target house can then only be attacked one at a time,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.600
And comes with a risk of being physically caught in the act.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.040
But digital is different. The constraints of the physical no longer apply.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.100
On the Internet, a digital lock must protect you from, not just the neighborhood burglar,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.040
But all burglars everywhere. For, on the Internet, there's no such thing as distance.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.800
Internet burglars don't crack digital locks personally, they build burglar bots

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.680
That try millions of combinations just to see what opens.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.860
One lock down the street or a country-full on the other side of the world — it's all the same.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
Actually, other side of the world is better — a dude in East-whatever-landia stealing your identity

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.540
Has a near-zero chance of getting caught.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.380
This is bad news, but thanks to mathematics, digital locks can be made unbreakable.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.740
This is encryption — a digital lock that, without the password, cannot be opened.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.420
Burglar bots will plough through all the possibilities, but a secure password

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.720
Will take longer than the heat death of the Universe to guess.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.840
No password, no entry. No matter how much of a l33t hacker your mom is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.300
Your private files stay private.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.600
Which might just be the greatest social good mathematics has done mankind.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.260
But it's easy to imagine unbreakable digital locks as bad news.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.900
Maximum lazy: ticking time bomb, the location and off-code of which

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.300
Are locked on the phone of a dead man.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.700
Now, were the information on a piece of paper in a safe room, no problem:

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.740
In the physical world, if you can't crack the lock, then you crack the wall.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.820
Society agrees, under this scenario, it's reasonable for police to get in, no matter what it takes.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.740
Note: this means real-world locks aren't just physically weak, but also legally weak.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.500
We could live in a world with privacy laws that forbade police to break into all locks,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.760
no matter how flimsy, but we don't, because that would be dumb.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760
Hmmm...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.220
This is where gears turn in government heads.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.940
If digital locks are physically invulnerable, maybe they can be made legally vulnerable:

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.220
To require digital locks be built with a keyhole for which police have the key.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.600
Highly secure, top secret, for emergencies only, surely.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.200
This legal vulnerability to ban citizens from owning perfect digital locks,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.760
To require companies manufacture their devices with keyholes, is an idea

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.220
That many, many governments are interested in.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.560
And governments point out that a warrant which lets police into your house and into your papers

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.580
Should let police into your phone.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.460
If your home is your castle, but the need, pressing enough, the police bring a battering ram.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.180
But there's no battering ram to crack open a well-locked phone to comply with a warrant.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.600
Not helpfully, anyway.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.120
Which is a problem: again, we all ideally want police to crack digital locks sometimes.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.160
But at our current level on the tech tree, digital locks that cannot be opened are a thing that exists.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.780
And because they are made of math, something a skilled coder can build at home,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.000
Trying to ban digital locks for everyone is pretty close to trying to ban an idea.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.540
Good luck with that.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.500
But even were it possible to successfully ban perfect digital locks in a country, remember:

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.260
On the Internet, there is no such thing as distance.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.860
Even if your government is a Xanadu bureaucracy of the Seraphim Incorruptible,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.480
There are demons elsewhere.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.260
Unbreakable digital locks are the foundation upon which computing and Internet-ing is built.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.980
Banking, buying, blogging, vlogging, gaming, tweeting, beating, meeting —

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.340
All of this is possible because of unbreakable digital locks.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.300
They've existed since computers filled rooms, but now, with computers in our pockets,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.300
We rely on those locks to protect the content of our lives — the content of our minds.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.920
Forced weakness, even with the best of intentions, places everyone in danger.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.660
The nature of a keyhole is to be cracked,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.300
And the nature of the Internet is to bring demons to the door.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.360
No matter how much we might wish it, there is no way to build a digital lock

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.720
That only angels can open and demons cannot.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.240
Anyone saying otherwise is either ignorant of the mathematics,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.520
Or less of an angel than they appear.

This time, I'm going to recommend Daemon by Daniel Suarez.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.780
I never like to say anything about fictional books, I don't like spoilers,

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.300
but if you've made it to the end of a video about encryption, this one's for you.
