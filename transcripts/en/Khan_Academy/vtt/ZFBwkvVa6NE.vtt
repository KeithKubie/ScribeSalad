00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.370
- [Voiceover] Part b.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.510
"For zero is less than t is less than one,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.160
"there is a point on the
curve at which the line

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.940
"tangent to the curve has a slope of two."

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.750
The line tangent to the curve

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.580
has a slope of two.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.259
"At what time is the
object at that point?"

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.310
So, the slope of the tangent line is two.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.940
That means that the rate of change of y

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.135
with respect to x is equal to two.

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:31.060
Well, they don't directly
give us the derivative of y

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.880
with respect to x, but they
do give us the derivative of x

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880
with respect to t.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.200
That's the derivative
of x with respect to t.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.627
And they give us the derivative
of y with respect to t.

00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:44.140
The x component of the
velocity function is the rate

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.000
of change of x with respect to time,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.490
and the y component of
the velocity function

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.190
is the rate of change of
y with respect to time.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.370
And using those two, we can figure out

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.918
the rate of change of y with respect to x.

00:00:56.918 --> 00:01:01.120
If you were to take the
derivative of y with respect to t

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.520
and divide it by the derivative
of x with respect to t,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.234
derivative of x with respect to t,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.930
well, if you, for the sake of,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.400
I guess conceptually understanding it,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.630
if you view the differentials
the way that you would view

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.330
traditional numbers and fractions,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330
well, the dt's would cancel out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.460
and you'd be left with dy divided by dx.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.760
Or a little bit more formally,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.320
you could go to the
chain rule and you'd say,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.350
all right, the derivative
of y with respect to t

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.800
is equal to the derivative
of y with respect to x

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.280
times the derivative
of x with respect to t.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.460
This comes straight out of the chain rule.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.458
So this is the chain rule right over here.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.800
That is the chain rule.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.840
And then if you divide both
sides by the derivative

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.420
of x with respect to
t, you're going to get

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.134
that original expression right over here.

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.479
Well, how is this useful?

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.160
Well, we know what the derivative
of y with respect to t is.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.270
We know the derivative of
x with respect to t is.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.748
We know them as functions of t,

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.900
and then we can set them equal to two

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.210
and then use our
calculators to solve for t.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.334
So let's do that.

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:10.970
The derivative of y with respect to t,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.230
that is, e to the point .5t.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.780
So we have e to the 0.5t

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.300
and then we divide it
by the derivative of x

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.900
with respect to t, so that's
going to be the x component

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.390
of the velocity function.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.334
So cosine of t squared.

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:31.140
And so this is the derivative of y

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.720
with respect to x and
we need to figure out

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.949
at what t does this equal to two.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:42.170
Or if we want to simplify this,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.200
and in our calculator,
we need to set this up

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.990
so it's some expression,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.180
you know, some function of x

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.220
is equal to zero.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.390
So let me rearrange this equation.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.060
So I have a bunch of things equaling zero.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.290
So let's see, I could just subtract two

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.100
from both sides, or actually,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.880
what I could do is I
could multiply both sides

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.520
times cosine of t squared.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.220
And so I'll have e to the 0.5t

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.980
is equal to two, cosine of t squared.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.350
Then I could subtract
this from both sides,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.940
and I will get e to the 0.5t

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.740
minus two, cosine of t squared

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.338
is equal to zero.

00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.660
And now I could use the
solver on my calculator

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.149
to figure this out.

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.455
So let's get the calculator out,

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:37.950
and let's go to Math.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.700
Whoops, let me make sure it's on.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.032
So, Math.

00:03:41.032 --> 00:03:42.790
Let me go all the way down

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.720
to the solver.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.270
So, select that.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.740
My equation is zero is equal to,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.519
so I'm gonna say,

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.060
e to the 0.5,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.480
and the variable that I'm gonna solve for,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.460
I'm gonna use x instead of t.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.220
The same thing, I'll get the same answer.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.545
e to the 0.5x.

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:05.845
All right.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:09.472
And then I'm gonna have minus two

00:04:09.472 --> 00:04:11.120
times cosine

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.761
of x squared

00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.690
is equal to zero.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.820
All right, so there you have it.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.520
Zero is equal to e to the 0.5x

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.965
minus two, cosine of x squared.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.070
Click Enter.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.600
And then we put our initial guess.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.500
And they tell us that for
t is between zero and one.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.400
So maybe a good guess
would be right in between.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.020
So let's put .5 there.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.650
And then we press Alpha, at
least, on this calculator,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.430
and then you see that
little blue Solve there.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.340
That will actually solve it.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.560
Let it munch on it for a little bit.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.530
And I get

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.830
t is equal to 0.840.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.350
0.840.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900
t is approximately 0.840.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.100
And we are done.
