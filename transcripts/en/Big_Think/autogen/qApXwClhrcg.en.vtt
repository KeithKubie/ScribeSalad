the change in the world today is the
 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.320
the change in the world today is the
availability of immense data as a matter

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
availability of immense data as a matter
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.730
availability of immense data as a matter
of fact every individual has a digital

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
of fact every individual has a digital
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.310
of fact every individual has a digital
footprint and by looking at that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
footprint and by looking at that
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.830
footprint and by looking at that
footprint you can pretty much tell what

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
footprint you can pretty much tell what
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.010
footprint you can pretty much tell what

data therefore let me come up with the
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.010

I have so much data how do I get to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
I have so much data how do I get to
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580
I have so much data how do I get to
figuring out what does that data tell

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
figuring out what does that data tell
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.189
figuring out what does that data tell
you and I think that's the shift those

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
you and I think that's the shift those
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.530

are the new Sciences and here's the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
are the new Sciences and here's the
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.459
are the new Sciences and here's the
problem with data

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
problem with data
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.520
problem with data
Pramod data is I can do a lot off

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
Pramod data is I can do a lot off
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.160
Pramod data is I can do a lot off
garbage in garbage out I can look at

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
garbage in garbage out I can look at
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.310
garbage in garbage out I can look at
data and say here's the relationship

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320
data and say here's the relationship
 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.130
data and say here's the relationship
between this and this and that doesn't

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
between this and this and that doesn't
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.369
between this and this and that doesn't
mean the one thing causes the other it's

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
mean the one thing causes the other it's
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.040
mean the one thing causes the other it's
just that the two are linked so a lot of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
just that the two are linked so a lot of
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.709
just that the two are linked so a lot of
the data Sciences are about this is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
the data Sciences are about this is
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810
the data Sciences are about this is
correlated with this and therefore I'm

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
correlated with this and therefore I'm
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000
correlated with this and therefore I'm
gonna assume they're related I'm gonna

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
gonna assume they're related I'm gonna
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.639
gonna assume they're related I'm gonna
assume they're correlated and that one

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
assume they're correlated and that one
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.229
assume they're correlated and that one
drives the other but that's not the case

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
drives the other but that's not the case
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929
drives the other but that's not the case
that can be pretty dangerous so the best

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
that can be pretty dangerous so the best
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.750
that can be pretty dangerous so the best
new techniques get at the concept of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
new techniques get at the concept of
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.050
new techniques get at the concept of
causality what causes what that's what I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
causality what causes what that's what I
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330
causality what causes what that's what I
really want to know in data and when you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
really want to know in data and when you
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.990
really want to know in data and when you
get to thinking about causality

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000
get to thinking about causality
 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.910
get to thinking about causality
causality is usually some human behavior

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
causality is usually some human behavior
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730
causality is usually some human behavior
that's driving that and so the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
that's driving that and so the
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890
that's driving that and so the
confluence of behavioral economics and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
confluence of behavioral economics and
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.920
confluence of behavioral economics and
behavioral sciences that tells you this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
behavioral sciences that tells you this
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170
behavioral sciences that tells you this
is how humans behave and taking that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
is how humans behave and taking that
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.109
is how humans behave and taking that
together with data and try to create

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
together with data and try to create
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.350
together with data and try to create
these behavioral causal models is really

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
these behavioral causal models is really
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.200
these behavioral causal models is really
the holy grail of data analysis and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
the holy grail of data analysis and
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.460
the holy grail of data analysis and
that's an art you cannot some machines

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
that's an art you cannot some machines
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740
that's an art you cannot some machines
and people can do it due to a great

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
and people can do it due to a great
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560
and people can do it due to a great
extent but the last mile is always about

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
extent but the last mile is always about
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749
extent but the last mile is always about
understanding that human behavior so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
understanding that human behavior so
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609
understanding that human behavior so
today it's still an art it's a very

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
today it's still an art it's a very
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.200
today it's still an art it's a very
powerful art but the benefit of that is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
powerful art but the benefit of that is
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.620
powerful art but the benefit of that is
that you can actually aid individuals

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
that you can actually aid individuals
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.690
that you can actually aid individuals
and saying you know this is what's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
and saying you know this is what's
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.260
and saying you know this is what's
driving this behavior or this is what's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
driving this behavior or this is what's
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.900
driving this behavior or this is what's
driving what you're doing and by the way

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
driving what you're doing and by the way
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150
driving what you're doing and by the way
do you want to correct that or keep

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
do you want to correct that or keep
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.710
do you want to correct that or keep
doing what you're doing and that's so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
doing what you're doing and that's so
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.620
doing what you're doing and that's so
