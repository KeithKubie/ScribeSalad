00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.700
I've been requested to do some
problems on critical points and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
maxima, minima, and concavity,
so I will do some problems.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.430
So these were sent to
me by [? Akosh ?].

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.110
I don't know where he is but
these are interesting problems

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.780
and I haven't done anything
like these before, so I thought

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.400
I would do the exact
problem he's given.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.440
So the first problem says,
identify the critical point,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.140
and find the maximum and
minimum value on the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.860
given interval.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:38.670
And they say f of x is equal
to x squared plus 4x plus 4.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.210
And the interval that they care
about is from minus 4, and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.040
including minus 4-- that's why
we have the brackets

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.100
there-- to 0.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.740
And just so you know, this
interval notation, if it was

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.340
written like this with
parentheses, it would mean all

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.800
the numbers between minus 4 and
0, but not including them.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.830
This is a closed interval,
so you're including minus

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.290
4 and you're including 0.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.520
This is called an
open interval.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.660
But anyway you can ignore
this, because that's not

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.450
what was in the problem.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.310
So the first thing they ask is
what are the critical points.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.020
And different people use
different terminology, but my

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.910
understanding is critical
points are all the points

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.720
that are interesting.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200
So it's the points where the
derivatives equal to 0, or the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.300
derivative just doesn't exist.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.310
But as we see in this interval,
we'll stick to the derivative.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.330
f prime of x is
equal to 2x plus 4.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.050
So why does this equal to 0?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.690
Let's see.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.550
2x plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.430
2x is equal to minus 4.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.660
I just almost made
a mistake there.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.440
x is equal to minus 2.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.960
When x is equal to minus
2, what is f of minus 2?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.570
So we know that f prime
of minus 2 is equal 0.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.560
We just solved for that.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.170
So we know the slope
is 0 at that point.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.170
But I just want to know what
the coordinate point is.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.400
So f of minus 2 is
4 minus 8 plus 4.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.240
So f minus 2 is 0.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.940
Let's evaluate the function
at the end points

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.960
of this interval.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.010
f of minus 4 is equal to
minus 4 squared is 16.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.170
Minus 16, 4 times, so that's 0.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.070
And then plus 4, so
f of minus 4 is 4.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.230
And then what's f of 0?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.670
f of 0 is equal to-- well
that's 0 0, that's equal to 4.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.270
So now we could graph this.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510
Let me graph the difference.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:50.190
So if this is the x-axis and
that is the y-axis, and the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.010
interval that we care about is
from x is equal to minus 4.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.420
From minus 4 to 0.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.930
So the first thing they
said, we'll identify

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.650
the critical points.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.870
Well the critical points were
when the slope is equal to 0.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.330
And that's when f is equal to
minus 2, and that happens at

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.620
the point minus 2,0, so it's
right here, which is directly

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.200
in between those two
points incidentally.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.140
Which is a good intuition
behind why these two values are

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.350
equal, because this is a
parabola and it's symmetric, so

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.140
if you go 2 away on either
side, the function should

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.780
have the same value.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.180
But anyway, ignore that
if it confused you.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.440
So at minus 2 we have
a negative slope.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.110
f of 0 is equal to 4.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.870
And f of minus 4 is equal to 4.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.190
So the graph is going to
look something like this.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.280
And I'll do it in
another color.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.310
And since we only care about
that interval, let's only

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.790
graph it over that interval.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.890
It's going to look
something like that.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.730
And if you said this was a
critical point and they

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.870
want to know the maximum
and the minimum point.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.010
Well the minimum point
is pretty clear.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.930
It's this critical point right
here where the derivative

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.980
was equal to 0.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.930
And if you wanted to use you
know whatever they call

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.190
it, the concavity theorem.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.770
But hopefully you have
the intuition of why.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.430
You would see that the
second derivative at

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.360
this point is positive.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.635
And what's the
second derivative?

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:19.110
If that's f prime of x, f prime
of x for all x is equal to 2.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.410
So really at any point you test
you're going to get the second

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.510
derivative to be positive.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.120
So especially at this critical
point where the first

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.250
derivative is 0.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.360
The second derivative being
positive tells you that the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.860
slope is constantly increasing.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.910
So the rate of change of
the slope is positive.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.830
The slope is really negative
there, little less negative,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.300
goes to 0, and then keeps
increasing, becomes more

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.010
positive, even more
positive slope there.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.620
So I think that was out
of scope of this exact

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.960
problem, but it's good
to have that intuition.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.670
And they want to know
the maximum points.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.551
Well the value here, x
is equal to minus 4 and

00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:55.170
the value x equals 0.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.680
They're both maximum points.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.000
They tie for first place.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.710
So those are the maximum
points, x equals 0

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.900
and x equals minus 4.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.480
You could say 0,4 or minus 4,4.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.080
What's the next
problem they give?

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.730
Let's see.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.050
Understanding the problem and
the terminology is often more

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.470
confusing then the
problem itself.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:29.720
So they give h of r is equal to
1/r, and they care about the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:38.150
interval-- I'm assuming from
this interval on r-- from

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.980
negative 1 to 3, and we're
going to include negative 1 and

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.590
3 because we have brackets.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.870
Well what are the
critical points?

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:54.290
They're the points where either
the derivative is 0, or the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.680
derivative doesn't exist.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.680
Now this brings up an
interesting point.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.730
We'll see in a second there's a
point here where the derivative

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.180
doesn't exist, but the function
also isn't defined

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.040
at that point.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.430
So that's not a critical point.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.580
So in order to get a critical
point-- and this is a

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.310
bit of a technicality.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.790
The easy one is
derivative is 0.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.990
Derivative equals 0.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.360
The other critical point-- and
I was little bit non-rigorous

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.610
with it when I said before-- is
when there's no derivative.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.590
But f of x is defined.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.260
So as you're going to see in
this problem, there is a point

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.470
where the derivative is
undefined but f of x-- or in

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.760
this case, h of r-- is also not
defined at that point, so it

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.210
won't be a critical point.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.940
Or maybe it is.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.300
I don't know.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.530
Depending on how your
teacher defines it.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.870
But the way I learned it is
a critical point-- if the

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.080
derivative isn't defined,
but the function is.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.960
But anyway.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.750
What's the derivative here?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.076
h prime of r.

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:10.150
Well that's r to the negative
1, right, so it becomes

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.050
negative r of the negative 2,
or that's minus 1

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.790
over r squared.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.080
That's the derivative.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.060
Can this ever equal 0?

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.980
Well no, it's never
going to be equal 0.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.440
But where is it undefined?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.930
Well it's undefined
when r is equal to 0.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.980
And r equal to 0 is
in that interval.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:35.040
So h prime of 0 is undefined.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.870
But h of 0 is also
undefined, right?

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.490
1/0 is undefined.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.950
h of 0 also undefined.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.370
So I'm not going to really
consider that to be a

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.560
critical point frankly.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.240
It's just a point at which
the derivative and the

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.980
function is undefined.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.110
And so what will the
graph look like?

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.880
Well let's see if we
can draw the interval.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.430
And we might just want
to draw some points.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.550
That's what I always used
to do if I never got

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.040
stuck on a math problem.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.350
I would just graph some points.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.406
You can ever go
wrong with that.

00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:15.980
Let's see, 1/r.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.783
So we want to go from negative
1 to 3, so we're going to

00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:19.630
have some negative values.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.880
So we want to go from r-- this
is the r-axis, right, because

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.510
this is the function of r,
this is the h of r-axis.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.850
So we're going to go from
r is equal to negative

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.000
1 to r is equal to 3.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.270
And we could plot some points.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.360
What is h of negative 1?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.560
It's 1 over negative 1, so
it's this point right here.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.430
And then what happens is
we get to smaller and

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.220
smaller negative numbers.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.750
Well think about it.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.350
If you have negative 1/2 here.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.830
When r is negative 1/2, it
goes to negative 2, and it's

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.985
actually going to asymptote.

00:09:06.985 --> 00:09:08.450
We only care about this
interval, so it's going to

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.430
look something like this.

00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:17.400
It's going to asymptote to
negative infinity, right, if I

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.130
kept drawing this all the way
down that would just asymptote.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.100
And then what is h of 3.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.830
Well h of 3 is just
going to be 1/3.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.670
It's going to be
relatively low number.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.275
And then what's going to
happen as we get closer

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:28.470
and closer to 0?

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.310
Well if you put a really small
positive value here, you get

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.430
larger and larger numbers.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:40.450
So this actually asymptotes to
positive infinity, so it'll

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.780
look something like this.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.440
I always have trouble
drawing these hyperbolas.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.680
It's going to look something
like that, it's going to

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.670
go to positive infinity.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.620
So that goes to positive
infinity, and this will on this

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.090
side go to minus infinity.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.120
And frankly just looking at
this graph you see why the

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.490
graph is not defined at 0.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.810
From the right hand side
the limit approaches

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.530
positive infinity.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.490
From the left hand side it
approaches negative infinity,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.920
and 1/0 is just undefined.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.870
Similarly that's why you
couldn't get a derivative there

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.090
either because the definition
of the derivative means you're

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.180
taking a limit and the limit
has to be valid from

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.960
both directions.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.060
And as we see the limit
is not valid from

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.330
both directions here.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.990
So what are the maximum
and minimum points here?

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:34.540
Well if we look at this
value, we might say oh,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.900
is that a minimum point?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.440
Well no, because you
have values much lower.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.290
Actually you have values
that go to minus infinity

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.710
in this interval.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.190
And then you say, well is
this a maximum point?

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.150
Well no, you have values that
go to positive infinity

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.340
in this interval.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:55.200
So it actually turns out that
there is no-- I mean this isn't

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.300
very proper-- but to some
degree at 0 you're at both

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.970
positive and negative infinity
depending on what direction

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.710
you're coming from.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.870
But this really has no maximum
or minimum points, because

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.990
the graph is undefined at 0.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.880
And then you know if I said, oh
well what if I get really close

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.370
to 0 and I called that
the maximum point.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.960
Then you say, no, no, no, no,
but there's a point even closer

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.690
that has even a higher value,
that's even closer to infinity.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.230
So there's actually no
exact point that is

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.160
the maximum value.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.740
So that's kind of interesting.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.540
Anyway, I'm already at 11
minutes and people at YouTube

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.290
apparently let me go well past
the limit now, but people told

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.060
me that they like the 10 minute
nuggets of knowledge, so I will

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.980
stop now and I'll continue
these problems in

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.930
a future video.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.070
See you soon.
