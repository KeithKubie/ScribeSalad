00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.069
Dean Koch told me one time

00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:12.043
that occasionally they get calls to

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:13.821
The college of Optical Science

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.041
from the comminity

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.318
about getting a new pair

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:17.133
of glasses.

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:18.311
Oh wow.

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:20.366
Yeah, so how did you

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.292
even know what optical science was?

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.182
Well, my father is a software

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:26.761
developer so when I came

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.068
to U of A I decided to study

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:28.860
electrical engineering,

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:30.200
and it was more of a passive

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.423
decision just because my dad

00:00:31.423 --> 00:00:32.411
is a software engineer so

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:33.507
it makes sense that I could

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:34.921
also do software. But then

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.254
when I was a freshman I started

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:37.686
reading an industrial journal,

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:39.928
and I became convinced

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:42.019
that optics in electronics

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.796
was the future of electronics.

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:44.950
How did you get interested

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.732
in science?

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:46.876
I liked Chemistry in high school,

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:47.859
which sounds a little weird,

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.531
but I did like chemistry and math.

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:50.844
You know, my mom always had

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:52.182
a can-do attitude, you know?

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:52.964
Do whatever you want.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:54.020
So, she showed me schools in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.659
Philly, Boston, and we had to

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:57.981
stop at Syracuse, that's where

00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.980
she went, and D.C., and I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.605
got into Penn early decision

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.592
so I went to Penn.

00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:05.631
And then once you got

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.515
to Penn, the whole world was

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:07.562
open to you, how did you

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:09.275
keep going along this

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:10.928
engineering pathway?

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:12.742
Mentors. Definitely mentors.

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:14.848
I had high school students,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.198
undergrads, medical students,

00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:19.150
grad students, post-docs, and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.529
it seems like everybody learns

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:23.153
from one level above them,

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:25.163
you know, what's the next thing like?

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:27.085
What about the Girls

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.187
who code program?

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:29.463
How did that all get started?

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.548
Well the Women in Science

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:31.746
and Engineering Program here,

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.048
at the University of Arizona,

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:34.393
has a chapter of which I am

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.877
program coordinator and lead facilitator,

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:40.010
and we use the girls who code

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.249
nationally provided curriculum to

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:42.475
teach computer science to

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:44.197
middle-school and high-school

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:45.155
age girls around Tucson.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.514
Mentorship and what you're doing

00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:49.081
with the girls who code

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:50.446
you're already giving back

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.125
and it's really important

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:53.004
for the next wave.

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:54.125
I think that sometimes

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:55.183
it can be difficult if you're

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:56.160
not involved in research to

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.974
find like graduation students,

00:01:57.974 --> 00:01:58.964
for undergraduates to find

00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:00.290
graduate students, or even just

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.762
mentors in the community would

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:06.104
be cool too, like people who

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:07.436
work in engineering

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:09.073
So you can see what it's like

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:10.017
in the real world.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.450
How can I apply and translate

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:15.611
what I'm learning into a job?

00:02:16.308 --> 00:02:17.900
Into a real-life activity.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:19.754
There's a group in the college

00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:20.779
of Optical Sciences called

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.719
Women in Optics and they

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.808
do a lot of demos, they

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.340
go out to a lot of like local

00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.060
school's science nights and do

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.013
demos like "this is what

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:30.217
optics is, look at this cool

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:31.925
light experiment." And so

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.977
I started volunteering with them

00:02:33.977 --> 00:02:35.812
and through that club I

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:37.242
then met a graduate student,

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:39.180
who then contacted me to her P.I.

00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:41.405
who then hired me to work in

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:42.188
this lab.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.020
And it gives you a community,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.881
and one of my big things is

00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:47.043
our retention rate

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:48.507
is not where it should be,

00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:49.591
and I think thats really

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:51.141
important to find your

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.740
community and stay connected

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.229
because you want to get up

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.338
every day and go do the work

00:02:56.538 --> 00:02:58.221
and be with your friends,

00:02:58.404 --> 00:02:59.669
and be with your network.

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:01.083
I think what's really important

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.762
is we're recruiting new faculty

00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:04.361
members to the university and

00:03:04.864 --> 00:03:06.643
retaining the ones we have.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:07.568
I think we have to

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:08.601
maybe take a different

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:09.431
approach to the problem,

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.346
I've been thinking about this

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:11.412
a little bit as with the

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:12.523
graduate students that you

00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:14.154
were, for the graduate students in JPL,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.821
they're a little bit more diverse,

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.793
I mean sometimes we have

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:17.497
to grow our own.

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:18.590
I know people are like

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:20.256
"oh you gotta recruit from

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:21.279
this school, or this school"

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.115
but we get really top students

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:24.189
in some of these areas,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.689
there's no reason why as

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.561
graduate students

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.836
or undergrads like yourself,

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:29.165
we can't, you know, keep

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:30.132
in touch with you,

00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:31.038
make sure that when you're done

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.791
that you apply back here, for

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.457
you know, and electrical engineering,

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:35.477
you know, we could try to get

00:03:35.477 --> 00:03:36.774
you back after you go to

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:38.835
a graduate school. But also, we

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.527
could have someone in graduate

00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:41.989
school mentor them, see if that's

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:42.808
what they want to do,

00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:43.968
send them for a post-doc

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.433
to get an external experience,

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.052
but I think we have to be a little

00:03:47.084 --> 00:03:49.954
bit more strategic in growing people,

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:51.092
especially now that we're

00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:52.017
Hispanic serving.

00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:53.302
Student success has got

00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:54.479
to be out mantra.
