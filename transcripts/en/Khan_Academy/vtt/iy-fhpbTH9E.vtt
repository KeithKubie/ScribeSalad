00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:02.242
- [Instructor] The
entire field of economics

00:00:02.242 --> 00:00:05.151
is based on the idea of scarcity.

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:06.791
And, arguably, we wouldn't even need

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:08.603
a field of economics, if there wasn't

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:11.207
the notion of scarcity in the world.

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:13.015
So what does scarcity mean?

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:14.966
Well, think about what does
it mean in everyday life?

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.739
It means that there's not enough

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.547
of something to go around.

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:20.234
If we're talking about scarce goods,

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.454
scarce services, scarce resources,

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.971
we're talking about
things where if there was

00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:27.365
no cost associated with
them, people would use

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:31.373
far more of that than
there actually is around.

00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:33.119
And in this video we're gonna think

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:34.881
about different types
of goods and services

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.862
or just resources and think about

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:39.387
whether they are scarce or not.

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:43.410
So a related idea to scarce
resources is it's opposite,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.307
which is the notion of a free resource.

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:48.013
So this is something
that, you could argue,

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.074
is infinitely abundant or at least

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:52.004
in a certain context is so abundant

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:53.885
that it feels like people can have

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:55.502
as much of it as they want.

00:00:55.502 --> 00:00:57.268
The more that one person has of it,

00:00:57.268 --> 00:01:00.080
it doesn't take away from someone else.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.986
And the reason why scarcity is essential

00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:04.954
to economics is because
economics is the study

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:07.910
of how do you allocate
these scarce resources.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.785
If there's more demand for it

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.465
than the amount of thing that there is,

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:14.933
well, who gets it, how
much of it do they get,

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.745
and what do they have to give up

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:19.832
in exchange to get those scarce resources?

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:21.453
But for the sake of this video,

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.601
let's just first make sure we understand

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:25.787
and have a good idea of what resources

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:29.955
are scarce and which ones aren't, and why.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.990
So this is a picture of caviar,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.494
which is essentially fish eggs,

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.587
and it's not easy to get.

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:38.467
The fish eggs are deep in the water,

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:40.138
someone has to get to them, and then

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:42.131
they have to package it in some way,

00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:43.837
and they have to get it to your plate.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.988
And so, do you think that caviar

00:01:45.988 --> 00:01:49.321
is a scarce resource or a free resource?

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:52.669
Well, if it was a free
resource, that means

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:54.956
that we're just swimming in caviar,

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:56.640
that it's so abundant
that I could just have

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.015
as much caviar as I want and there's still

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.221
as much as you want and that everyone gets

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.950
as much caviar as they like.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.480
Well, that's clearly not the case.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.244
Caviar is a scarce resource.

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:09.390
In fact it is a quite scarce resource,

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.471
and because of that, if you want it,

00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:15.660
you have to give up a good bit to get it.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.294
This is a picture of some
people working in a factory,

00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:23.427
and the resource that jumps
out here is that of labor.

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:25.450
And labor's interesting because it's not

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.778
as tangible as something like caviar

00:02:27.778 --> 00:02:29.441
but it is a resource.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.460
And one could even argue
that caviar on your plate,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.240
some of its scarcity comes
from the labor involved

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.080
of getting it to your plate.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.996
But here these are clearly, it looks like

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:41.379
these are gentlemen who
are putting together

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.004
some type of fabric.

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.776
And so, would you consider labor,

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:48.029
would you consider that a scarce resource

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.612
or a free resource?

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.911
Well, it would be a
free resource if people

00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.922
were willing to just do as
much work for other people,

00:02:56.922 --> 00:02:58.824
actually willing to do an
infinite amount of work

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:00.933
for other people, which
isn't even humanly possible.

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:02.956
And even is it was humanly possible,

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:04.317
people aren't willing to do that.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.021
They want something in return.

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:10.276
And so, once again, it
is a scarce resource.

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.871
There's many resources that
are pictured right here.

00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:17.593
You have this beautiful town
next to this alpine lake.

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:20.966
And so, some clear scarce
resources are here.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:23.485
Many people would love to have a view

00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:25.942
like you would get from
this house or hotel

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:28.199
right over here, but not everyone,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.926
and many people would love to live there

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:32.615
because of the view, but
not everyone can live there.

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:34.978
So that is a scarce resource.

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:38.372
The water here is an interesting one.

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:40.532
I can imagine in earlier times,

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.445
if before there was a town here,

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:43.734
if there was just a primitive village

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.524
living next to this fresh water,

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:48.215
they would probably view
it as a free resource.

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:50.339
If someone was thirsty,
they would just go up

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.585
to the lake and they would
just drink from the lake.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:55.918
They would not have to give up
anything to drink from that.

00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:58.797
But now the town, it
might be a little bit more

00:03:58.797 --> 00:04:00.469
of a scarce resource.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.690
They might want to preserve
it for various reasons.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.940
In order to get the water to your sink

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.491
in your house, there
might be some services

00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:10.227
or goods or labor involved.

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:11.763
Someone has to set up the pipes,

00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:13.830
maybe it has to be cleaned in some way.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.341
Well, then it might
become a little bit more

00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:17.533
of a scarce resource.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.812
Air for most of human history

00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:22.541
has been considered a free resource.

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.553
And even today I'd argue that something

00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:26.484
like oxygen, at least on our planet,

00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:27.970
is considered a free resource.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.163
When I take a deep
breath (breathes deeply)

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:33.929
it does not affect your
ability to take a deep breath.

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:36.840
It does not take oxygen away from you.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.270
Now is there an infinite amount of oxygen

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.491
in our atmosphere?

00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:43.412
No. But for our purposes it feels

00:04:43.412 --> 00:04:45.245
like there's an infinite amount.

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:49.312
Now if the photosynthetic
plants were to disappear

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:51.741
and all of a sudden oxygen
started to get diminished,

00:04:51.741 --> 00:04:53.956
or if we were in a space
station where there isn't

00:04:53.956 --> 00:04:56.403
a seemingly infinite amount of oxygen,

00:04:56.403 --> 00:04:57.988
well then you could imagine a world

00:04:57.988 --> 00:04:59.918
where it could become a scarce resource.

00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:02.133
You can imagine a colony on the Moon

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:03.941
or on Mars or in the space station

00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.298
where it had some type of economic system

00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:09.885
to decide who gets how much oxygen.

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:11.583
So I will leave you there.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:13.233
As already mentioned, scarcity

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.939
is the central idea in all of economics.

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.232
It's the reason why we even need

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:19.121
a field called economics.

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.823
And as you go forward
in your study of both

00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:24.225
micro and macroeconomics, we'll be looking

00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:27.462
at ways to allocate
these scarce resources.

00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:30.191
We'll try to study what
people have to give up

00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:33.305
in order to have access
to these resources,

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:35.833
and we will have models that will help us

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:38.568
understand what are the implications

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:42.735
for these different methods
of allocating resources.
