&gt;&gt;commentator: So welcome everybody to our
first, well not our first, but first branded

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:06.580
Broadway@Google Series.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.640
I'd like to welcome some of the cast members
from West Side Story.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.750
[applause and cheering]

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.170
I guess we can start talking about ?

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.010
since this is an old show that was brought
back to Broadway and how kind of the history

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.050
of the producers, the writers, the book, and
how it kinda came back and what brought it

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.390
back to Broadway now.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.760
&gt;&gt;John: So you wanna know everything about
the show right now, huh?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.649
&gt;&gt;commentator: Everything about the show.
So why did it, so it came back in what 2009,

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.649
right? January?

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:45.729
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah, 2009. We started rehearsals
2008, early 2008 about October 2008. Took

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:51.789
it to D.C. for out-of-town tryouts in December
of '08 and came back to New York and opened

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.059
on Broadway March 19th of 2009.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.949
Right? [laughs]

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.470
It's been a, I came in as a, as an understudy
for Riff, Action and Diesel and took over

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.170
the role August 4th of last year. So I actually
wasn't in the show from the beginning, from

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.460
the get go and either were these guys either.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.800
But we were, we had the pleasure to join the
show and actually kinda take it and develop

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.750
it and run with it and make it our own after
the original cast had left.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.950
&gt;&gt;commentator: So when the original cast left
was it, did it slowly happen over time or

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.760
did it like character by character --

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.390
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah people, I mean --

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.390
&gt;&gt;commentator: What happened?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.760
&gt;&gt;John: [sighs] People-people come and go
in on Broadway really quickly. Most people,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.250
most principals sign a year contract and do
that for a year and then either stay with

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.250
the show or-or move on.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.270
And I guess you guys both came in after the
year was up, right? For everybody?

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.960
&gt;&gt;Shina: Almost. I came in August; they opened
in March and I came in August.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960
&gt;&gt;John: Uh-hum.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.880
&gt;&gt;Mikey : And I came in December and I have
a hand-held mic.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.880
[all on stage laughing]

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880
&gt;&gt;commentator: I'm sorry. I know.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.880
&gt;&gt;Mikey : No worries. I like it.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.149
&gt;&gt;commentator: Time, time is tough in [unintelligible]

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.069
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah, I think when I came in December
there was, there was a big cast changeover

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.540
there was about five or six people, Tony,
Chino,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.800
&gt;&gt;John: Action --

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.689
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Action, myself, playing Big Deal,
all changing over.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.180
So there, that was kind of like a big shift
in the cast and there was some more, they

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.265
redid the, what we'd do, the table reads with
Arthur and like kinda like reworked the show

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:36.939
a little bit and gave it a little bit of new
energy.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
&gt;&gt;John: So Arthur Laurents is a 93 year old
man who ?

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:40.959
&gt;&gt;commentator: And he's your --

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.529
&gt;&gt;John: He's our director.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.529
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.529
&gt;&gt;John: He wrote --

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.529
&gt;&gt;commentator: What's that like?

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:46.529
&gt;&gt;John: He wrote [laughs]

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.529
&gt;&gt;commentator: Lot of bathroom breaks?

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:48.529
&gt;&gt;John: He wrote [laughs] no actually not.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.529
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs]

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.529
[laughter]

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:51.529
Excuse me I'm gonna --

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.439
&gt;&gt;John: He's, he actually wrote the book of
West Side Story. As Lee pointed out it was

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.030
originally called East Side Story.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.689
&gt;&gt;commentator: Do you know why?

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.120
&gt;&gt;John: 'Cause it was set on the East Side.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120
&gt;&gt;commentator: Do you know why?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120
&gt;&gt;John: Shina probably knows better.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
&gt;&gt;Shina: And it was, and it wasn't, and it
wasn't the Puerto Ricans and --

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120
&gt;&gt;John: Polish.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.159
&gt;&gt;Shina: the Polish, it was --

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.959
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Jews and Catholics, I think.

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:08.959
&gt;&gt;Shina: No. Yeah.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.480
&gt;&gt;John: Catholics and Jews. Um-hum.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.189
And then do you think that was adapted when
they, so that was, that was changed before

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.440
the book was released or before the original
Broadway production was --

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.260
&gt;&gt;Shina: Before, when they were still in works
for it.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.260
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.260
&gt;&gt;Shina: I was actually reading an article
on it the other day somewhere and they were

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.779
talking about right around the time they were
writing the show, then there were like news

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:35.510
articles in real life of the fights happening
in New York between the gangs 'cause it was

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.059
supposed to be set in Califo--, I think Los
Angeles between the Jews and the what did

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.059
you say?

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.059
&gt;&gt;Mikey : The Jews and Catholics.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.059
&gt;&gt;Shina: And Catholics. And then they were
like well there's all these gang fights happening

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.059
in New York where the Puerto Ricans and the
Poles, let's try to make this happen and then

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.059
that's when they changed it.

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.499
&gt;&gt;commentator: I see.

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.359
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yes.

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.480
&gt;&gt;John: But he's, it's been a really incredible
process 'cause I mean this is a man who was

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.579
one of the most brilliant librettists on Broadway
period, ever.

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.919
He's had, he's had what five hit Broadway
shows --

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:04.919
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yes.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:05.919
&gt;&gt;John: if not --

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:06.919
&gt;&gt;Shina: Gypsy --

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.919
&gt;&gt;John: more.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.919
&gt;&gt;Shina: plays and musicals.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:09.919
&gt;&gt;John: Plays, musicals, everything. He's
brilliant.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.919
&gt;&gt;Mikey : And movies.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.919
&gt;&gt;John: Movies.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:12.919
&gt;&gt;Mikey : The Way They Were.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.919
&gt;&gt;John: And-and we've had the opportunity
to work with him --

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.919
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.750
&gt;&gt;John: and being, I mean for me being-being
a-a pretty young guy coming into the Broadway

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.810
scene and this being my Broadway debut, to
work with somebody like that was incredible.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.690
We and we, our producers are really great.
We have, we have, our two main producers are

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.690
 --

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.690
&gt;&gt;Shina: Jeffrey --

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.690
&gt;&gt;John: Jeffrey Sel --

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.690
&gt;&gt;Shina: Seller.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.690
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Jeffrey Seller.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.240
&gt;&gt;John: and Kevin McCullum. And they're phenomenal;
they produce a lot of Broadway shows and I

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.940
believe that they came to Arthur like 10 years
ago or something like that and said, "We want

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.810
you to do West Side Story on Broadway again."

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.810
&gt;&gt;commentator: Um-hum.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.870
&gt;&gt;John: And he was like, "The time's not right."
It's like it's not right for the time.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:05:00.040
So then I think the way the Spanish was adapted
into the show, Arthur's lover saw the show

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.950
in South America somewhere and saw the Puerto
Ricans speaking in Spanish.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.970
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.260
&gt;&gt;John: Which kind of made them the antagonists
rather than the protagonists;

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.380
&gt;&gt;commentator: Hum.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.170
&gt;&gt;John: I mean which made them the protagonists
rather than the antagonists. Instead making

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.850
the Jets being like the focal point at the
end, the Sharks became the stronger of the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.350
two because they were speaking in their native
tongue.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.350
&gt;&gt;commentator: Right.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.180
And the audience is different too.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.180
&gt;&gt;John: Absolutely.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.180
&gt;&gt;commentator: Right.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.040
&gt;&gt;John: So I mean the feel of that, but he
wrote it out and Arthur found it in his original

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.380
manuscript after he died and-and decided to
bring that back to Broadway.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.090
And so our show has quite a lot of Spanish
in it and Shina is one of the Shark girls

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.090
 --

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.090
&gt;&gt;Shina: One of the Sharks.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.090
&gt;&gt;Mikey : [laughs]

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.090
&gt;&gt;commentator: And then what role are you,
what's your character?

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.740
&gt;&gt;Shina: Consquelo, she's the Shark that dies
her hair blond. She's one of the, one of the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.740
girls.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.490
&gt;&gt;commentator: So you have a wig you have
to put on every night?

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.490
&gt;&gt;Shina: I do.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.490
Blond with black roots.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.490
[laughter]

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.490
&gt;&gt;commentator: That's cool.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.390
So yeah tell me about just what you, I guess
some people go to school, some people go to

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.250
grad school, some people make a career of
going to school studying acting, some people

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.000
just go out and do it, like what, and everyone's
path is unique. Just tell me about what brought

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you to, and how you landed in these roles.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.390
&gt;&gt;John: Um.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.210
I love your questions 'cause they're just
like tell me everything.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.210
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.210
[laughter]

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.210
I'm working on this, I'm working on it.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.210
&gt;&gt;John: That's cool. Well get it --

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.210
&gt;&gt;commentator: Getting better.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.210
&gt;&gt;John: We'll get it.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.940
&gt;&gt;commentator: I have a supportive audience.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.820
&gt;&gt;John: Absolutely. Hi guys. Hi, everybody.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.222
&gt;&gt;John: No, I came into the business when
I was eight years old and I was living in

00:06:39.222 --> 00:06:47.250
Greenwich, Connecticut at the time and then
slowly I began to fall in love with-with singing

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.900
and-and acting and being on stage and I thought
it was a lot of fun to do and it took me out

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.090
of my own world and my crazy family life [laughs]
 --

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.990
to tell you the truth. And it gave me something
to do. That was an outlet and it allowed me

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.860
to be somebody else for a minute.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.800
And so as time went on we did a lot of shows
in North Carolina together and then I moved

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.401
to New York. I went on the European tour of
West Side Story. I was there for two and a

00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:19.670
half, almost three years. And then came to
Broadway and was blessed to be cast in West

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.190
Side Story on Broadway.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.290
So I've been doin' West Side Story for a while.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.410
&gt;&gt;commentator: Are you sick of it yet?

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.410
&gt;&gt;John: No.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.410
&gt;&gt;in unison: [laugh]

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.410
&gt;&gt;John: Not at all. Love it.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.410
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs]

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.890
&gt;&gt;John: No it's some, I mean it weighs on
you definitely, but it's a really great show

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.890
to do.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.960
[pause]

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.410
It changed my life. And it, and it actually
allowed, it opened my eyes to a lot of different

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.460
things about myself.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.880
I mean I play, I play a guy who's racist and
who hates everybody.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.180
&gt;&gt;commentator: Right.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.860
&gt;&gt;John: And playing that eight times a week
can really open your eyes [chuckles] to see

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.860
who you really are.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.960
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs] What did you find
out?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.281
&gt;&gt;John: No, no just like things that I don't
like that to feel you know what I mean?

00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:01.281
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.350
&gt;&gt;John: different feelings and like --

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.350
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.530
&gt;&gt;John: things to definitely stay away from
within myself and I mean not like I didn't

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.050
find out that like I'm some guy who hates
everybody you know what I mean, but --

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.070
&gt;&gt;commentator: That's nice. That's nice to
know.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.280
But I mean I guess some people have their
like their prejudices and --

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.280
&gt;&gt;John: Absolutely.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.800
&gt;&gt;commentator: they know them or not. Some
of 'em --

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.900
&gt;&gt;John: It was good for me because I found
out a little bit who I was. A little bit more

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.960
of who I was; and-and could discover that.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.530
But the audition process for me was actually
a lot different than the regular audition

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.530
process.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.510
The guy who was playing the role that I'm
playing now got hurt in the rehearsal process

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.200
before they went to D.C. for the out-of-town
tryouts and I got a phone call two days before

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.000
they left for D.C. And, have you heard this
story?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.310
&gt;&gt;Shina: Huh-uh. Have you? Do we have to?

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.730
&gt;&gt;John: I got a phone call two days before
they left for D.C. at 10:30 in the morning

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.750
and I was unemployed. And Joey McKneely who
as the, he reset Jerome Robbins' choreography.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.149
Jerome Robbins was the original choreographer
of West Side Story.

00:08:56.149 --> 00:09:01.230
And Joey McKneely, who directed and choreographed
the European tour gave me a call and he's

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.490
resetting the Broadway choreography, anyway,
he called me at 10:30 and goes, "What are

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.080
you doing today at 12?" And I go, "Let me
check my calendar."

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080
[laughter]

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.761
And I go, "Nothing. I'm not doing anything."
And he goes, "Okay, well you're coming in

00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:15.890
to audition for Arthur Laurents."

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:23.170
Now at this time, my girlfriend was in the
show as the dance captain and-and so I knew

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.950
what was going on and I was really kind of
sitting at home bummed out that I didn't get

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.950
the job.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.490
So I went in to the audition and he said,
"I have no quarrel with you, you're hired."

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.700
&gt;&gt;Shina: Hm.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700
&gt;&gt;commentator: That fast?

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.830
&gt;&gt;John: On the spot.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.110
And so the stage manager asked me to wait
outside. I wait outside. And he comes out

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:47.170
and he goes, "Ah. He actually can't do that."
And I'm like, "Don't ruin my high, man"

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.490
I was like, "I just got-got cast in my first
Broadway show."

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.050
&gt;&gt;commentator: Here's everything. Now take
it away.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:58.720
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah. And he goes, "Well it's actually
up to the producers as well. They have the

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720
final say."

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720
&gt;&gt;John: And I'm like, "Ahhh." Seriously about
to slit my wrists at this point.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.820
&gt;&gt;John: This sucks! I'm done. [claps]

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.080
But then he goes, "But what Arthur wants he
usually gets."

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.339
It's like, "Okay, that gives me --

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:12.300
&gt;&gt;commentator: That gives you a little dose
of reality.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.300
John: Absolutely. But then they--, I'm --

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.980
still have to get to D.C. and it was, it was
an amazing opportunity. And I got the chance

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.450
to go on for two months before I took over
the role in August.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.640
So I was on for, from May, June, and July;
the end of May to July. I took over August

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.820
4th and it was, it's been a blessing every
since; I've-I've been loving it.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.170
Workin' with these guys; they're great.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:46.600
&gt;&gt;commentator: So Shina, you wanna tell us
your story? How you landed in this role.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:58.660
&gt;&gt;Shina: Um, I grew up in Wichita, Kansas
and did theater there. We have a summer stock

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.880
music theater in Wichita and I grew up doing
shows there; ended up going to University

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.330
of Michigan for musical theater, which is
my favorite place in the world.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.330
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:16.530
&gt;&gt;Shina: The best place in the world besides
New York.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.530
[laughter]

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.630
And then I graduated in 2008 and then moved
here.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:28.440
And actually when I graduated in May, they
started having, May 2008, they started having

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:39.970
auditions for West Side Story. And I was like,
"I have to, I have to be in this show. I have

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.600
to be in the show."

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:55.200
I went in eight different times from May 2008
until I got hired July 31, 2009.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:11.149
And I was like, "I am going to get this if
it kills me." Like, "I am going to be in this

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:12.149
show."

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:27.330
'Cause the last time I went in what, it was
down to four of us and we were at a studio

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.330
just across the street from the theater and
we were waiting for Arthur to get there so

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.330
we could audition for him, and he was actually
running rehearsal at the stage and didn't

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.330
know, he said they forgot to tell him that
they had this audition.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.330
So we walked in our audition clothes across
the street to the theater while their rehearsing.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.330
They're like in rehearsal on stage. They're
like, "If you guys could just wait in the

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.330
audience for a second we should be with you.
Arthur has to finish this rehearsal because

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.330
he won't be focused on your audition if he's
not finishing the rehearsal."

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.330
So we're like, the real cast is on stage,
I'm in the theater,--

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.330
I'm stretching still trying to focus on what
I'm doing, and then two hours later they're

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.330
like, "Its cold in here. Can you guys wait
out in the alley ?

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.330
Commentator: What?

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.330
&gt;&gt;Shina: behind our theater that actually
looks like the scene for America&gt;"

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.330
[laughter]

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.330
And so we were like, "Okay. It's 90 degrees
outside; it's like 20 degrees in the theater.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.330
I'll wait outside." Just practicing. And then
finally they're like, "Alright. Arthur's done,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.330
but he's got like 20 minutes. We're gonna
bring you on stage. We're just gonna dance

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.330
you and then sing and read and go."

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.330
And we're like, "Oh, gosh."

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.330
So we danced on the Palace stage, the four
of us. Then one by one he was like, "Okay,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.330
sing."

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.330
We all sang and we all read and as he's sitting
like in the third row from the stage so you

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.330
can hear him, but I don't think he knows how
to whisper anymore.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.330
[laughter]

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.330
So literally on stage reading-reading the
sides I hear him what I think was, "Oh, she

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.330
didn't get it." Loud. And I was like, "Okay."

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.330
&gt;&gt;commentator: Oh, no.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.330
&gt;&gt;Shina: Still reading, still reading, finish.
Then they bring me back and the stage manager

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.530
gives me another thing to read that has more
Spanish 'cause at the time when I joined most

00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.100
of the Sharks' lines were still in Spanish.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.890
And so then I'm leaving; I'm on my way to
work like running out the door like two hours

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.399
late for work, and one of the casting directors
pulls me aside and he's like, "Um, I might

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:12.890
be calling you tomorrow." So find out and
I get the call the next day. He didn't say,

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.722
"She didn't get it," she said, "Oh, well she
got it."

00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:15.730
Like right there in front of me, but I thought
he said, "Oh, she didn't get it."

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:21.851
Meaning like, I'm terrible at the Spanish,
I didn't get it. And I was like, "Oh, so I

00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:28.450
got the," after eight months of auditioning
I finally got to be in West Side Story.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.450
[applause and cheering]

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.450
&gt;&gt;John: That's when I met you though, was
in the alleyway, huh?

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.450
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yeah.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.450
They were smoking in --

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.930
&gt;&gt;John: Of course me in the alleyway just
like, "Oh God, here I go again?"

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.950
&gt;&gt;Shina: "You guys auditioning?" "Yeah."

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.170
&gt;&gt;John: What are you doin' over here?

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.170
[laughter]

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.610
&gt;&gt;commentator: So Mikey, [unintelligible]
yours.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:47.000
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Uh, I got into musical theater from
the dance perspective. I was a dancer growin'

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.680
up; soccer and dance; and then dance kinda
took precedent and controlled my life for

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.680
a long time.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.760
But it's great.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.339
I went to college at Western Michigan University,
the kid brother of --

00:13:57.339 --> 00:13:58.339
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yeah.

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:03.990
&gt;&gt;Mikey : U of M; another great place though
to be. And I graduated in 2009 and came out

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.990
here.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.800
I had, when they started rehearsing originally
I was doing a production of West Side at the

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.110
Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera actually with
Shina.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:18.290
And ever since then I did a production directly
after that at school and then I did a production

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.950
at NCT of West Side. So basically I had my
own strange rehearsal process to get into

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.950
this show.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:29.280
But after, after I got back from North Carolina
my agent called me and he said, "Hey, they

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.350
wanna see you back in for West Side." It would
be my second time going back in. I said, "Alright,

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.230
this is it. I'm gonna get this."

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.670
Went in. I just was like ate everybody alive
in the studio and just they said, "Alright

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.170
you're gonna come back on Tuesday. Be ready
to meet Arthur." And I'm like ?

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.170
&gt;&gt;Shina: Oh my God.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.170
&gt;&gt;Mike Winslow: "Oh my God."

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.680
"This guy's a legend in my mind."

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.870
It's my favorite show and he wrote it and
this is a big deal for me.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:58.209
So I go to my call back; it's Tuesday and
they told me to just know all the Jet lines,

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:02.600
just they don't know what I'm gonna read,
they just-- be ready to be anybody.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600
[laughter]

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.839
Great, great, great.

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:10.149
So I go in and I don't have to dance, I just
I sing my song and then I read, I read for

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:13.920
Baby John, which is a character that I've
played twice before this.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.151
Now the guy reading with me, whew, he was
a --

00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:18.680
&gt;&gt;Shina: Who was it?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.769
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I don't know who it was, but he
must have been from a soap opera or somethin'

00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:23.769
 --

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:24.769
[laughter]

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:27.230
So this, so the scene is these two little
kids and it's the beginning of Act 2, the

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.070
leaders have died, and they're all scared,
and Baby John is like, "Oh my God, did they,

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.580
where-where's everybody." And this guys like,
"They take you yet?"

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
[laughter]

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.580
I'm like, "No, you?"

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.580
He's like, "No."

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.580
&gt;&gt;Shina: Oh my word.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.580
[laughter]

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.769
&gt;&gt;Mikey: It's just like, "What is this guy
doing?"

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:49.350
And so we did it and it went alright and Arthur-Arthur
walks up to me and he says, "I can tell you

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.330
get it. You're doin' great. I can tell you
love this show. I just wanna give you a note

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.420
or two." And he gives me notes.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.830
We do the scene again; feel a little bit better
about it. And he comes up and he says, "Alright.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.750
Mikey we're gonna have you read for action."
Action's like the angry gang member; he kind

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.440
of takes over after Riff dies.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.769
He says, "Mikey you're not right for Action.
I just wanna see what you do with it."

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:11.100
And so we go into this scene where Action
and Riff are arguing about Tony who hasn't

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.392
been around in a while. And so I'm like, "Alright."

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:14.392
"I am just gonna eat, I'm gonna get this guy.
I'm gonna like just put him in his place."

00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:19.920
And I just get in his face, well his face
is like three feet taller than mine, but I

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.190
like gettin' in his face and we finish the
scene and it felt good and I look over to

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:31.160
the table and-and Arthur just, "Yeah. You're
in."

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
[laughter]

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.100
What? I'm standing there and the table, I'm
just like kinda floating in like space and

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.540
like, "What's going on?" And the music director
like hands me my book and the-the casting

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.681
director like ushers me out and my knees --
are, huhh, what's. I was so, I didn't know

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:51.269
what was happening. But we got out of the
room and the casting director said, "Alright.

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:54.470
You got it." And I said, "I'm gonna be playin'
a, I'm gonna be a swing in the show." 'Cause

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.960
I thought there was a swing track open. And
he's like, "Oh no, no, no. You'll be playing

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.510
Big Deal starting in three weeks."

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.510
I was on the ground.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.510
[laughter]

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:06.890
I couldn't believe it. And that night I was
at the theater watching the show and I swung

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.420
the show for three weeks and then I jumped
in.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.470
And ever since then it's-it's been what it's
been.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.839
&gt;&gt;commentator: It's amazing.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.120
&gt;&gt;John: But you don't understand.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120
Like ?

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.550
people don't cast on the spot like that anymore.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.550
&gt;&gt;Mikey : No.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.550
&gt;&gt;John: Like that-that's old school.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.550
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yeah.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.970
&gt;&gt;John: Like that doesn't ha, like they-they
look at you and they audition you for months

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.951
and months and months and months and months
and months.

00:17:28.951 --> 00:17:33.370
And then three weeks later you go home and
you're-you're down in the dumps 'cause you're

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.500
like, "I don't have a job."

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.580
And then they- they call you and they're like,
"Oh yeah. So remember that audition you did

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.580
for us like three months ago?"

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.580
&gt;&gt;Shina: Right.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.831
&gt;&gt;John: "We want you to do it."

00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:43.431
You're like, "Really?"

00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:47.260
Like after all this time you're gonna sit
here and finally, it's-it's just like hurry

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.830
up and wait, you know.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.630
So it's-it's really interesting to have that
instant gratification. It's really nice to

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.820
be able to have --

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.840
commentator: So like once-once you hit a Broad,
a major Broadway show and you feel like, "I

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.630
made it. I'm here. I'm gonna have a steady
job for a while." And then what happens?

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.130
What are the things that can happen?

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.790
&gt;&gt;John: I mean there're no guarantees in this
business. That's the, that's I mean I think

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.300
that's kind of the reason why I got into it.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.460
Is because there's, I mean, I know it sounds,
it sounds weird but in the, at the end of

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.200
the day I gotta, I gotta do what I love to
do and it's fulfilling to me. I gotta go on

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.740
stage and bare my soul and do my thing and-and
try to help people in some way, shape, or

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.260
form, but at the end of the day I can do something
else.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.260
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.260
&gt;&gt;John: You know what I mean? And --

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.260
&gt;&gt;commentator: So it's worth the risk?

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.260
&gt;&gt;John: I-, yeah

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.540
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs] I guess time will
tell. What do you think?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.700
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I mean it's, there's been plenty
of people who say or who I've heard say, "To

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.750
be a Broadway performer like those are the
luckiest people in the world." Because honestly

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.480
we do love what we do and we get to do what
we love and get paid for it.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.590
And that's, I mean I feel very blessed to
be able to do that and I think the other side

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.650
of it is that they can pull the rug at any
moment and say, "Well, that was great and

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.650
all, but --

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:54.650
&gt;&gt;Shina: January 2.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.650
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah, January 2, pull the plug.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.650
&gt;&gt;John: Oh yeah, and by the way,

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.650
&gt;&gt;commentator: So it's closing right?

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.650
&gt;&gt;John: we're closing, we're closing January
2nd.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.650
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Oh yeah, that's right.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.080
Yes, it has been announced. I'm not breaking
any rules here.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.340
&gt;&gt;commentator: Two weeks ago, right? So it's
gonna --

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.090
So the last performance is January 2nd?

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:08.090
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah, January 2nd.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.090
&gt;&gt;commentator: Interesting day to choose.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.090
&gt;&gt;Shina: It's a Sunday.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.090
&gt;&gt;commentator: It's a Sunday.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.090
&gt;&gt;John: Well, --

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.090
&gt;&gt;Mikey : The old one-two punch.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.641
&gt;&gt;John: December 20th marks the longest running
West Side Story in New York City.

00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.510
&gt;&gt;commentator: As a show from when it was
opened or-- ?

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.510
&gt;&gt;Shina: Any ?

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.510
&gt;&gt;commentator: just this revival?

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.510
&gt;&gt;Shina: Broadway productions of --

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.510
&gt;&gt;John: Any Broadway production of West Side
Story.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.510
&gt;&gt;commentator: Oh, wow.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.510
&gt;&gt;Shina: We will be the longest.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.510
&gt;&gt;John: We will be the longest running West
Side Story.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.510
&gt;&gt;Shina: And they shut it.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.510
&gt;&gt;commentator: And what was --

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.510
[laughter]

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.510
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Like Dude, you got it, okay, bam!

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.510
&gt;Shina: Bam!

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.510
[laughter]

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.510
&gt;&gt;John: They just hit their-their point and
they're like, "Nope. Bye."

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.510
&gt;&gt;Shina: [laughs]

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.510
&gt;&gt;commentator: So do you think the seasons
are mainly based because of the business,

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.360
because of the money? I know like Broadway's
changed a lot in the past couple years; a

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.590
lot of shows have closed.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.590
&gt;&gt;Shina: It's up to the producers when it
comes down to it.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.590
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.590
&gt;&gt;Shina: It, what do you think?

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:46.740
&gt;&gt;commentator: I mean do you see like a trend
changing in like production value. I know

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.420
like a lot more money is spent --

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.420
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yeah.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.030
&gt;&gt;commentator: I mean there's always the union
discussion there's --

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.640
&gt;&gt;Shina: Legally Blonde ran longer than us.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.250
That's all I'm gonna say about that.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.250
[laughter]

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.250
&gt;&gt;John: I-I think --

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.250
[laughter]

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.679
&gt;&gt;John: I think, I think it, I think it depends
on a lot of different things. I think the

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:09.110
world in general is changing. And I-I think
that-that that just allows everything to change.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.510
Whether or not it's for the better or for
the worse, who knows? I mean that's-that's

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.580
something that time will tell.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:21.021
When you lose, when you lose your history,
and the classics you know what I mean?

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.730
&gt;&gt;commentator: Um-hum.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:28.820
&gt;&gt;John: I feel like that's-that's a little
detrimental to-to society as a whole. I mean

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.160
that's just me. I'm not saying that I'm mad
that we're closing. I mean it's upsetting,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.160
definitely.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.160
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.340
&gt;&gt;John: But I mean I think that it-it's leaving
the window open for new things to happen and

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.650
new dreams to come true.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.400
But I mean it's always --

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.410
&gt;&gt;commentator: I have feeling West Side Story's
gonna be, come back again. Do think so or

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.910
do you think once?

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.130
&gt;&gt;Shina: It'll take a while, I think.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.570
&gt;&gt;John: It'll take a long time. I mean if
it comes back --

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.570
&gt;&gt;Shina: [unintelligible] it won't be a --

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.570
&gt;&gt;John: 10 to 15 years.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.570
&gt;&gt;Shina: At least.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.570
&gt;&gt;commentator: It's been around for what,
60 year, almost 60 years.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.570
&gt;&gt;John: Almost 60 years.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.049
&gt;&gt;Mikey : It's always gonna have some social
relevance, sorry, relevance whenever it does

00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:03.049
happen.

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:04.049
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:06.799
&gt;&gt;Mikey : And the tour just started what,
they opened on Thursday?

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.310
&gt;&gt;John: They open on Wednesday night.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.110
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Wednesday night. And they immediately
 --

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.370
announced that they were extending it for
88 weeks, it's a full year ?

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:21.010
and a half run now. So there's-there's definitely
desire to see the show and people are gonna

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.260
be buying tickets and it's gonna be around.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.260
&gt;&gt;commentator: That's cool.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.560
Anyone wanna open up to questions? Does anyone
have any questions for these guys? We have

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560
some microphones up here. I was hoping -- oh
yeah, what's up?

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560
&gt;&gt;male #1: I've always heard that Arthur Laurents
was a real hard ass.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560
[laughter]

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.560
Is that, is that true?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:39.840
&gt;&gt;commentator: The question is is Arthur Laurents
a hard ass?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.970
&gt;&gt;Shina: Well, he's-he's so old school. I
think honestly, in my opinion, that I did

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:51.600
not get to do the entire process with him,
and since I'm not one of like his main focuses

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.169
in the show I don't get to work with him a
lot.

00:21:54.169 --> 00:22:06.040
But growing up, how I grew up and the training
I got, he is what I, how I've always known,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.570
maybe not in the way he goes about, he is
so good with his words that he has such a

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.360
way of explaining things to people to get
his point across that it might not be the

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:22.040
best way to say it or the best time, the best
circumstance, but he --

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:30.152
so he has been a real hard ass and I've seen
 --

00:22:30.152 --> 00:22:31.152
[laughter]

00:22:31.152 --> 00:22:32.152
and I've seen really good things and really
bad things. But --

00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:33.152
&gt;&gt;John: I've-I've been in the process for
quite a long time. I love Arthur Laurents

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:37.600
to death. I think he's brilliant. I think
the way that he approaches people is on a

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.740
very personal level.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:44.660
I think that sometimes he can take it to a
level; he believes in this show so much and

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:51.679
believes in his work so much that if you don't
wanna be here, get the fuck out.

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:54.790
You know what I mean? Don't waste my time.
Go.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.710
And that's just kind of how he is. It's real
cut and dried.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:07.080
You know what I mean? And he feels, I-I think
he feels sometimes personally attacked or

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:15.299
personally offended if somebody moves on with
their life to do another show or not complete

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:17.309
their contract or so on and so forth.

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:26.559
I mean I've seen, I've seen the stages of
going from the love to the hate to the mending

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:30.070
to everything. You know what I mean? And it-it
comes in cycles.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.930
And I really feel like he's been doing this
for so long and he has so many different productions

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.691
of it going right now, I mean a tour and a
Broadway show for a 90, almost 94 coming in

00:23:39.691 --> 00:23:42.580
December, year old man is a lot to remember.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.110
I mean you can only have so many personal
assistants [laughs] that can remember every

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.490
single note that you take. But in the end
they're not gonna argue with you 'cause you're

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.620
Arthur Laurents.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:58.360
But I just, I feel that sometimes he gets
them confused and gives notes based on another

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.970
production or-or what he saw three shows ago.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.669
So I mean the brilliance is always gonna be
there. And yes, he's a hard ass, to answer

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:06.669
your question.

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:08.590
&gt;&gt;commentator: I mean it's-it's kinda his
legacy. It's I mean --

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.700
&gt;&gt;John: This, yeah.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.539
&gt;&gt;commentator: So when you talk about like
the culture adaptations I mean it was adapted

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:22.559
from I guess Romeo and Juliet and then it
was originally adapted again in the '50s and

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:29.070
then again now, like what-what do you think,
how do you think it applies to our society

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.070
today?

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.960
&gt;&gt;commentator: Who wants to start with that
one?

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:40.950
&gt;&gt;John: I mean I think that there will always
be hate in the world. I think there will always

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.290
be love; that's how it was in the beginning;
that's how it will be in the end. You know

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.290
what I mean?

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.290
&gt;&gt;commentator: Um-hum.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.070
&gt;&gt;John: I feel like the common emotions that
people feel stick around and stick with you.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.360
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah, but that has nothing
to do with like who you're hating.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.630
&gt;&gt;John: No. I'm not talkin' about who. I'm
not even, I'm not even playing into the race,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.960
racial scenario of the show at all, I'm just
talkin' about period.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.960
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.760
&gt;&gt;John: Love/hate common emotion. But when--
when it boils down to it the relevance of

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:13.830
the racism aspect, with the racial innuendos
or whatever you wanna call it, I believe that

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.440
still to this day it's very --

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.679
very revelant. I mean we, we have an African-American
President now, Obama, rock 'n roll, blah,

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:24.140
blah, blah. It's great, but at the same time
you still got people hating. You know what

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.300
I mean? And, I mean I think the revelance
is always gonna be there for West Side Story

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:35.910
just because I feel it, I feel like it is.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:42.020
And there will always be something trying
to overcome love. There will always be a force

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:50.110
of nature that's always in like direct conflict
with just somebody trying to be simply be,

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.120
live whatever.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.130
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:26:01.010
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I think also, I mean racism in the
country today I'm not super informed on the

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:06.320
subject, I-I do watch Gangland on the History
Channel a far amount and I-I find that sort

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.809
thing interesting especially with the production
and taking that in and trying to use in the

00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:14.840
production and I don't think that it's such
a cut and dried thing like, "Oh we hate Puerto

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.220
Ricans, oh we hate whites, oh we hate blacks."

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:21.580
I think that there's a lot less specificity
maybe in it, but there's still, like John's

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.420
saying, there is hate all over the place.
You find it everywhere; you find it when you

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.059
when you're walkin' on the street; somebody
is just in a hurry and they bump and all of

00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:32.900
a, you have this response, it's like, and
where is that even comin' from?

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.760
So I think that the hate and the love, that
balance, is important because although in

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.791
the show it is cut and dried, it's Americans
versus the Puerto Ricans, it's-it's a chance

00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:49.510
to show any audience, "Here's a solid explanation,
here's a solid story about two people hating

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.360
each other for whatever reason and what happens
because of that hate."

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.450
And so I think that it, when you see that
and when you see the consequences and when

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:01.340
you see how some characters change and some
characters don't, and you project where will

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.250
these characters within the story, what's
their, what's gonna happen to them, where

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.250
are they gonna go?

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:10.220
I think that opens up people's minds, young
people's minds. We have a lot of student groups

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:16.590
that come in and when they see it I-I hope
that they can have a realization about just

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.679
what's really important in life. Hate, love;
find your place and find, find something to

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:26.630
love rather than find something to hate. I
think you can get that outta the show no matter

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:27.630
what.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.630
&gt;&gt;commentator: I agree. I agree, definitely.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.690
&gt;&gt;female #1: So I was wondering like did he
ever get to do the whole show with the cast,

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.100
that's like or do you ever get to go out and
say, "Okay we're havin' a rehearsal for-for

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.299
this guy or-or do you just go in and that's
the first time you've ever done it?

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:44.150
&gt;&gt;John: Well-well, Billy Elliot's different.
They rehearse the Billy Elliot kids constantly.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:49.500
There are five different, there are four different
Billy's and the rest of the cast. You know

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.370
what I mean like they're-they're rehearsing
constantly. We rehearse, we have two section

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.750
days out of the week to rehearse, Thursdays
and Fridays.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:02.160
There are other rehearsals that happen for
understudies or new members of the cast to

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.010
go in and we have what is called a put-in
for them where we all show up like twelve

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.120
o'clock in the afternoon or two hours before
the show, and we run through everything that

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.150
they do; all the scenes and dances that they
do so that they're comfortable and so nobody

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.039
runs into you and they know where they're
going and they can basically kind of get a

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:24.250
feel for where everybody else in the cast
is. I never got that.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.250
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs]

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.250
&gt;&gt;John: I-I was --

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:31.240
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I think there's been a fair amount
of slashings to the put-ins actually they're

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.610
kind of shady about how that all happens,
but there's always some sort of rehearsal

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.180
process to get you slightly accustomed to
it.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.630
&gt;&gt;female #1: So like the first time you do
the whole thing that's pretty much the audience

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:44.630
time.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:45.630
&gt;&gt;John: Oh, yeah.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.200
&gt;&gt;Shina: 'Cause you never get to do it all
with every aspect before you're actually on

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.919
stage like doing it in performance. 'Cause
if you have a put-in you're not in costume

00:28:50.919 --> 00:28:54.809
or no one else is in costume so for you sometimes
you're not. I was the only one in costume

00:28:54.809 --> 00:28:59.059
but I didn't have lights, you don't have like
the blinding and all the sets, you don't get

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:00.059
that until --

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:03.679
&gt;&gt;John: Well I was, I was thrown on in the
middle of a show and I had never even done

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:06.120
a rehearsal with those guys that were on stage.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.120
That was fun.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.590
[laughter]

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.548
I mean so it's-it's really you-you just have
to be on top of your game as an understudy

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:16.780
or a stand-by or swing or anything on Broadway
I mean like those guys work really, really

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:21.370
hard. And everybody's like, "Oh well you're
a swing." Yeah, but I know three roles, four

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:26.490
roles, five roles, seven roles, fourteen roles,
and I have to know every single track and

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.880
no all my blocking and know all this and know
all the choreography, know all the different

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.289
notes, know all of this, blah, blah." It's
a lot of information.

00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:38.909
And you know you go on from one role and then
like you actually fall into another role,

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:41.490
you know what I mean? Like it's so easy to
do.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:46.980
&gt;&gt;Mikey : It's especially tricky with this
show because there's the blocking is very

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:52.073
minimal and there's a lot of kind of leeway
in what we do on stage and there's a lot of

00:29:52.073 --> 00:29:53.711
adlibs and there's a lot and you don't really
get any of that --

00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:58.330
when you are getting your initial put-in you
just get used to it. "Okay, I'm standing here

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.701
and then I cross over here and then something
happens the next minute or so and then all

00:30:02.701 --> 00:30:04.400
of a sudden we're singing."

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:10.900
And for the swings especially it's-it's constant
work because they have to be watching pretty

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.240
much every show and see what are they doing
differently; what do I need to make sure that

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.110
when I go on for that character, what do I
need to make sure that I 'm doing for these

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:23.280
other characters that isn't necessarily in
the blocking book or isn't in the choreography.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:29.440
They have to keep up with where the show is
kind of morphing. 'Cause it's like a living

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.440
organism, the show is. So it's-it's a tough
job, they, and they do a really good job of

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
it so.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:42.940
&gt;&gt;commenator: In all fairness I think she
was second to-to ask, and then we'll come

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.940
to you sir.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.679
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hello. If you were not in West
Side Story right now what character would

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.409
you wanna play on Broadway?

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:51.150
&gt;&gt;John: That's a good question.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.150
&gt;&gt;commentator: Shina.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:59.039
&gt;&gt;Shina: I actually, I would really wanna
be in How to Succeed in Business Without Really

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:02.159
Trying. It's coming in March or April.

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:10.210
That's the show I wanna be in right now or
there's like I really wanna be in Lion King

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.210
or --

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.210
&gt;&gt;John: [singing]

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.210
&gt;&gt;Shina: Memphis.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.210
&gt;&gt;John: [singing]

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.210
&gt;&gt;Shina: You could be in it too.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.210
[laughter]

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.210
&gt;&gt;John: No.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.210
&gt;&gt;Shina: You can only play--

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.210
&gt;&gt;John: Actually, no.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.210
&gt;&gt;Shina: Only play--

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.660
But yeah, those are the ones I'd be in; want
to be in.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.210
&gt;&gt;commentator: Mikey.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:31.850
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Oh, you know I-- it's kinda always
changing I just saw American Idiot on Sunday.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:38.419
And the Billy Joe Armstrong, the lead singer
of Green Day, he, it's his whole concept and

00:31:38.419 --> 00:31:42.640
he was in it all last week and so right now
I'd say American Idiot --

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:48.610
'cause it was just the coolest thing I've
ever seen. But I don't know just anything

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:53.820
really. Just, I think coming out of West Side
where it's not really the traditional ensemble

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:59.960
in a musical, I would love to just do something
classic, somethin' just be in the back and

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:05.919
dance and sing at the same time. And just
anything to progress the trade of learning

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:10.919
classical musical theater further than I already
have. I think that's.

00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:11.919
&gt;&gt;commentator: John.

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:13.210
He's been agonizing --

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:18.260
&gt;&gt;John: I mean, I mean this is a hard ques,
somebody asked me this the other too. I-I

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.779
did the same thing.

00:32:19.779 --> 00:32:26.500
I mean the, my thing is is what I want, the
next thing that I wanna do is originate a

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.610
role. I wanna start from the ground, from
the beginning of the process and work a role

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:39.480
until I put it on Broadway. And just develop
it and be able to create it with the creative

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:45.549
team, with the writers, with the directors,
with the producers, and just be able to find

00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:56.280
this guy who, I mean whatever show it is,
I don't know. It hasn't come yet.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280
&gt;&gt;Shina: [laughs]

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.280
&gt;&gt;John: It wil at some point.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.280
&gt;&gt;commentator: Are you gonna write this show?

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280
&gt;&gt;John: No, no, no, no, no.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.280
&gt;&gt;commentator: [laughs]

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280
&gt;&gt;John: No. But I mean tthat's like, that's
part of the process that happens. They-they

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.450
do the workshops and the readings and all
that stuff and I just, I wanna be a part of

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:14.029
a show that starts at ground zero and works
its way up to the top. At least --

00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:18.799
&gt;&gt;female #2: That sounds like a cop out.

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:19.799
[laughter]

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:21.270
&gt;&gt;John: Stacey Jackson, Rock of Ages.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.270
[laughter]

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.270
&gt;&gt;commentator: Oh you would be so funny.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:33.779
&gt;&gt;John: I
actually wanna be Billy in Billy Elliot but

00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:34.870
it's --
too old.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:35.950
&gt;&gt;commentator: Too old.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.289
&gt;&gt;John: So I guess not.

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:44.659
&gt;&gt;male #2: So I was amused by your story so
I-I think for a lot of engineers coming to

00:33:44.659 --> 00:33:50.860
Google is like the-the Broadway experience
like it's what you shoot for, it's and-and

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:56.039
the funny thing is the interviewing process
takes forever.

00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:57.320
[laughter]

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320
And --

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320
&gt;&gt;John: I'll bet.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.779
&gt;&gt;male #2: you go home and then once you get
to the point where you're told that you probably

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:08.000
have the job they, there's this little codicil
where they say, "But Larry Page has to make

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.080
a decision." And you're like --

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.359
&gt;&gt;commentator: He's old school, right?

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:12.359
[laughter]

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:13.940
I'm gonna look at everybody that comes through
here.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.790
&gt;&gt;male #2: Right. And then you're like, "Wait,
I'm a computer janitor and the co-founder

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:25.440
of the company has to make a decision so,
I thought that was really funny.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:32.040
But I do have a question which is that I-I
saw the show in previews and then there was

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:38.339
a lot more Spanish and from what I read, I
haven't seen it, I've seen it once since,

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:41.830
but I haven't seen it like several times since,
but what I heard is that-that at several different

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.119
points they pulled back on the amount of-of
Spanish.

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:50.230
And I thought it was just brilliant the first
time, although my-my Spanish is at the "'Me

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.310
llamo" how do I finish this sentence stage.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.310
&gt;&gt;Shina: [laughs]

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.680
&gt;&gt;male #1: Spanish, but even so I thought
it was brilliant. I mean you knew just from

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.990
body language what was going on. Do you think
that the show's been watered down for-for

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.190
a mass audience.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:11.060
&gt;&gt;John: I think what's happened is the Euro,
I mean the national tour has gone out and

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.910
I mean when you're playing Podunk, Iowa, I
mean if anybody's from Iowa I'm not knocking

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:21.290
it I'm just saying, you know what I mean like
I feel like, I feel like they kind of watered

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:27.390
it down for that. I feel like they-they took
some of the Spanish out because it would be

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.250
more acceptable to a touring audience.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:36.599
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I-I've actually put a fair amount
of thought into this and I think that when

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:40.000
the show first opened they have to find a
reason, they have to find a reason for the

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.119
revival: what's gonna be different about this
show.

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:45.820
And the Spanish was a great idea and it affects
the audience; half the audience or however

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:52.080
many people in the audience don't speak Spanish
or don't speak Spanish well enough to understand;

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.580
it separates them and it puts this weird,
this not understanding and I think there's

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.790
a lot of frustration with that in the audience
and when you're talking about a Broadway musical

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.510
and entertainment, piece of entertainment
that's on, in Times Square right there in

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:12.760
the heart of it all, there has to be a push
towards making the masses not say happy because

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.170
it's not a happy story, but entertaining them.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.450
And so I think when they first started having
all the Spanish it was a great way to have

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.960
the revival and a great way to send this message
of, "Oh, even if you don't get it, that's

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.960
what we're trying to say is that these people
don't understand each other." And that's where

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.740
this comes from and you have to look past
that.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.050
But then once you get past Tony season and
you just started into the run now and it's

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:38.240
just about getting ticket sales and getting
people in, I think they had to make some adjustments

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:45.020
so that they could keep selling it because-
because no matter how well people look at

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.040
why the Spanish is there, they're gonna be
like, "I don't understand. I don't know the

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.160
lyrics." And this is, "I loved that song but
I missed the lyrics." And so I think they

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160
had to --

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.650
&gt;&gt;male #2: Well sure but, musical theater
isn't opera, but they, why not supertitle

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.020
so if people go to the Met.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:07.280
&gt;&gt;John: Super-- we did, we did subtitles in
D.C. and they were absolutely horrendous.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.200
They were horrible. When I mean they were
 --

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.360
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yeah. It sounds like a bad idea.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360
&gt;&gt;John: It didn't work.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.089
&gt;&gt;male #2: Just because of the timing it doesn't
work?

00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:20.590
&gt;&gt;John: It just didn't work. And we tried
it up top, we tried it down low,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.050
we tried it on the sides, we tried it everywhere.
It just didn't work.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.050
&gt;&gt;commentator: What about like the seat in
front of you like --

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.880
&gt;&gt;John: Well I mean that's in an opera house
in Paris. They, you don't do that you know

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.880
what I mean like, I mean --

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.080
&gt;&gt;John: It would have been perfect if it was
on the back of the seat, but then you're lookin'

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.080
at the back of the seat rather than on stage.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.640
You know what I mean in opera it's a lot easier
to-to read what you're, what they're singing

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.570
because they're usually standing still and
singing. I mean --

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:48.109
&gt;&gt;Mikey : It's more about listening to it
and understanding it and not watching it all.

00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:52.630
&gt;&gt;John: And letting-letting it just like wash
over you, you know what I mean? And kind of

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.230
just engulf you into the music.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:38:00.340
&gt;&gt;commentator: And I kinda like what you said
about kind of creating and dividing the audience.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.320
And you were talking about some of the like
the early processes of creating a divide on

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.320
stage on well.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.320
&gt;&gt;John: Right.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.320
&gt;&gt;commentator: Like actually you said they
rehearsed the-the Jets and the Sharks separately

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.839
so they wouldn't even bond with each other
or feel like they were part of one cast.

00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:16.361
&gt;&gt;John: Jerome Robbins rehearsed the Sharks
and the Jets separately for Jerome Robbins'

00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:17.361
Broadway.

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:18.361
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I believe originally.

00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:19.361
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yeah.

00:38:19.361 --> 00:38:20.361
&gt;&gt;John: Origi-, was it originally?

00:38:20.361 --> 00:38:21.361
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Um-hum.

00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:24.650
&gt;&gt;John: But I-I know, I know this story because
I know the Sharks let Jerome Robbins back

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:29.640
off the stage and fall 20 feet into the orchestra
pit because they hated him that much.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640
[laughter]

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.640
I'm not kidding.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.820
&gt;&gt;Mikey : He didn't know he was leaving notes
and he just backed up and no one said anything.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.820
&gt;&gt;John: He was givin' notes and they just
looked at him --

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.820
[makes falling noise]

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.660
&gt;&gt;commentator: And he's out of the show probably.
It's like take that, Jerome.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.960
&gt;&gt;John: And he was the choreographer.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960
[laughter]

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.140
And the director and he was just dead.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.440
&gt;&gt;commentator: Oh, oh, oh.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.010
&gt;&gt;Shina: That's not how he died.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.660
&gt;&gt;John: No, he-he, that's not how he died,
sorry.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.660
[laughter]

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.660
False advertisement, ah.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.270
But yeah so I mean we didn't do that, but
 --

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:06.120
that-that was just the style that he did to-
try to really get-get his message across.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120
&gt;&gt;commentator: Right.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.380
&gt;&gt;John: But he-he would talk down to them
very badly. I mean I-I, we've, I-I don't know

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:16.730
if you guys have heard the stories, but I've
heard some stories about them, him really,

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:22.650
really, really kinda of just gettin' in there
and saying, "Take that." You know what I mean?

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:23.650
&gt;&gt;commentator: Sure.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:24.650
&gt;&gt;John: [whistles]

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.110
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah, you think Arthur Laurents
is a hard ass; Jerome Robbins is a hard ass.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.110
&gt;&gt;Shina: Um.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:36.010
&gt;&gt;John: I mean he would look at you and just
call you names. Just to make you think that

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:40.349
you're family was horrible and that you were
the worst thing on the world, in the world

00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:41.349
and --

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:42.349
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah, I can imagine that's
tough to take.

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:45.050
&gt;&gt;John: He would just, he would rip it out
of you. 'Cause if-if-if 'cause he was workin'

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.390
with all dancers you know what I mean at the
time they were like all just dancers that

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:52.020
were doing the show because he was, Jerome
Robbins is a choreographer. Like that is,

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.480
that is his job and he was, he was, he's choreographed
for-for the ballets, the New York City Ballet,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480
right?

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480
&gt;&gt;Shina: Um-hum.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.770
&gt;&gt;John: So he's done, he's done everything.
But that, he just want, he wanted to get that

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.770
point across.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.770
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:07.770
&gt;&gt;John: Maybe he got this from Arthur.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:12.430
&gt;&gt;female #3: Sure. I have question. So this
is not necessarily West Side Story specific,

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.040
but can you tell us about an oops moment you've
had in your theater history --

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.010
sort of in your career that's just something
that was either really embarrassing or just

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:24.040
funny or just something that didn't go according
to plan during a show?

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.480
&gt;&gt;commentator: Mikey, you wanna start?

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.000
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Oh no, I gotta think of one.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.510
&gt;&gt;John: I had an oops moment three weeks ago.
I'm-I'm, tonight is my first night back in

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.510
the show --

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.510
&gt;&gt;Shina: [clapping]

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.260
&gt;&gt;John: Thanks guys.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.690
&gt;&gt;Shina: [laughs]

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.101
&gt;&gt;commentator: Why were you out of the show?

00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:44.960
&gt;&gt;John: The first time I've ever fallen on
stage --

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.910
like ever; like really fallen on stage. I
mean I've slipped up, every --

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:50.910
&gt;&gt;Shina: Ah, okay.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.840
&gt;&gt;John: now and then, but like this is the
first time I went up and just [makes sound

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.839
effect of falling] on my ass.

00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:57.839
&gt;&gt;Mikey : It was pretty big.

00:40:57.839 --> 00:41:01.650
&gt;&gt;John: In the middle, oh I was in the middle
of the stage as well, in the front, by the

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.650
way. Just to let everybody know.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.650
&gt;&gt;commentator: Did you injure yourself?

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:04.650
&gt;&gt;John: I sprained my ankle.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.470
&gt;&gt;commentator: Did you have to get carried
off stage or did you --

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.400
&gt;&gt;John: I did not. I finished, I finished
the dance.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.400
&gt;&gt;commentator: Okay.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.500
&gt;&gt;John: I finished my variation which I don't
know how much adrenaline I had but I did it.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.730
I was probably screaming through that.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.730
&gt;&gt;Shina; Yeah.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:20.160
&gt;&gt;John: But then I slid, I slid from I slid
from the curtain all the way to the side of

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.900
the stage. I mean to the wall at the end of
the stage after-after the number. And yeah,

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.130
I was not a happy camper.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.130
&gt;&gt;commentator: Shina.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:30.900
&gt;&gt;John: That was a, that was a whoops moment
for me.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.310
&gt;&gt;female #3: Did you have ropes or how did
you --

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:38.180
&gt;&gt;John: Oh no-no. My foot came out of my shoe;
my shoe was too big. They were my backup pair

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.250
of shoes 'cause my other ones were getting
fixed and I went up for the jump and my foot

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.510
slipped out of the shoe so I couldn't, I couldn't
touch the floor at all and rolled over my

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:48.579
ankle and popped it that way and then sat
back on it and popped it again.

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:52.570
It was a really, it was really good. It made
me feel good. So, and everybody else is on

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:58.359
the other side of the stage 'cause it's-it's
like an across the floor move, so everybody

00:41:58.359 --> 00:42:01.040
goes and I'm sittin' there on my knees just
goin' "Come back."

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.040
[laughter]

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.520
"Come back." It was, it was rough.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:13.190
&gt;&gt;Shina: I in-in our show the-the Shark girls
have really big skirts with petticoats underneath

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:19.850
and they, every single girl has had their
heel get caught in their skirts, because the

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:23.480
heel goes up and you get, there's like layers
and layers.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:31.040
I, it wasn't, it wasn't one of my first weeks,
but we were doing the dance right in the front

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.280
row, like ready to do the big dance break
and my heel gets caught right as I'm pushing

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.120
to go down. I ended up on my side somehow
and I was like, "Well while I'm down here

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.310
and I can't get up right away 'cause it's
still caught in my heel, I'm gonna do a spin."

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.310
[laughter]

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.990
So I tried to spin but my heel was still caught
in my skirt so I ended up like a turtle on

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.990
my back, just like --

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.990
[laughter]

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.670
I'm spinning and I see the girls coming towards
me with the choreography and I was like, "I

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.330
have to get up right now." And I'm like eye
level with the first row which is the worst

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:53.330
feeling 'cause you're like --

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.330
[laughter]

00:42:54.330 --> 00:43:04.830
Get up real fast so I spun, I turned to spin,
got up right in time before she crashed into

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.201
me and then we did the dip. But then the rest
of time you're like, "Ooh, I'm the girl that

00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:08.201
fell on the ground --

00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:09.201
[laughter]

00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:10.201
I'm lookin' at you, awesome."

00:43:10.201 --> 00:43:11.201
[laughter]

00:43:11.201 --> 00:43:13.680
It was awful.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.150
&gt;&gt;commentator: That's two; that's two for
wardrobe. Alright.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.150
&gt;&gt;Shina: Right.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.089
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Mine was definitely all on my own
 --

00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:21.089
[laughter]

00:43:21.089 --> 00:43:26.790
I'll say that. There in the number Cool, the-the
Jets dance there's this moment called the

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:31.930
pow circles and there's three circles, three
guys, four guys, three guys and we're all

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:34.570
moving around really fast doing this little
chasse ball change.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:41.410
And sporadically throughout the three or four
sets of eight that we do this there is these

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.840
accents. And everybody has their own pow,
you know POW! You batman and you say, Pow

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.450
as loud as you can. It's just like an explosion
of energy, just like gettin' it out.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:57.210
And one day I, the guy who powed before me,
in my brain it sounded weak and so I was like,

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:01.000
"I'm going to POW like I have never powed
before.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.050
[laughter]

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.620
And now you have to understand it's like dim
lighting and they kind of like accent you

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.710
when this happens; really quick; but you're
at the front of the stage and there's everyone

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.839
is else below and all of a sudden you just
pop up and I kicked so hard that I just flew

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.080
right up in the air --

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.080
&gt;&gt;Shina: Score.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.080
&gt;&gt;Mikey : totally horizontal --

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080
[laughter]

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.010
down at the very edge of the stage. I hit
the ground --

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.010
[laughter]

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:25.300
and Action, the angry guy right, he's comin'
up right behind me like a locomotive train.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.491
I'm like, "He's." I hit the ground and bounced
back up and just [yeew] got back into it.

00:44:30.491 --> 00:44:31.491
[laughter]

00:44:31.491 --> 00:44:35.640
Oh man. So it's like POW, down, up, here,
kick, and run like -- oh man.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640
[laughter]

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.760
I swear I thought I got hit by a bus.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.760
[laughter]

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.190
You know you go on and-and you laugh about
it now so, yeah.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.190
&gt;&gt;commentator: That's funny.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.190
Anybody else?

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.190
Questions?

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:47.190
&gt;&gt;female #4: So now that you know that the
curtain is going down --

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:48.190
&gt;&gt;John: Projection.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:49.190
&gt;&gt;female #4: lights are going off forever,
what's the process of your next show like

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:56.550
getting it? Are you auditioning now, are you
networking? How do you pull out going from

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:07.060
one to the other with not enough like [unintelligible]
down time [unintelligible].

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:12.510
&gt;&gt;John: It's-it's hard in this business to
go from one job to another. I mean it really

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.089
is. There-there are few, there are a few people
that do it.

00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:16.210
&gt;&gt;Shina: They're lucky.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:20.990
&gt;&gt;John: I'll tell ya I've been at the theater
like three times this week and I swear to

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.470
God if I hear one more word about another
audition I'm gonna shoot my brains out.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.260
&gt;&gt;Shina: And I'll say it right out. I had
four this week.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.260
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.470
&gt;&gt;Shina: So in between doing shows and now
that we know we're closing our agents are

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:36.260
all working to get us the next job so we're
gonna be auditioning so it's hard to balance

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:40.810
between being so sore I can't move, and still
doing the show and auditioning and giving

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:44.570
like a hundred percent 'cause this is what,
now I need this job.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:48.790
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah, it's strange too 'cause you
go, you go to an audition in the morning and

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:51.670
it will go well and maybe you get the call
back and you're like all excited and it's

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.250
a totally different thing; you're tap dancing
and you're smiling and-and then all of a sudden

00:45:55.250 --> 00:46:00.330
you're like, "Oh wait. No. Now I gotta go
be a gang member --

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.400
again and here we go.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.200
Yeah, it is kind of interesting to balance
it 'cause a lot of times there'll-there'll

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:09.200
be call backs at noon or one or whatever and
you've got a show at 2:30 and you're like,

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.150
"I gotta do this really fast, but I gotta
calm down because I gotta be cool." It's a

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:18.000
little tricky but right now there's a lot
of auditionings happening which is nice.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yep.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.530
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Comforting for the moment.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:33.090
&gt;&gt;commentator: I think we have time for one
more question. Okay.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.140
&gt;&gt;male #4: You all, all of you seem supremely
confident physically; like the way you carry

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.140
yourselves and all that. Like you really seem
like performers. Is this something you-you've

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.980
had your whole life or did you learn how to
get this. It's just interesting to see especially

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.740
because working with programmers they can
be such "julubs".

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.740
[laughter]

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.740
&gt;&gt;male #4: I'm kidding.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.280
&gt;&gt;commentator: All see is parallels is drawing
here. This is good.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:53.839
&gt;&gt;Shina: I think we've all just don't wanna
speak for everyone, I think we've all had

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:59.290
it. That's what like part of the reason I
wanted to be in it; 'cause I've always been

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:07.310
a loud, not attention grabber, but like just
always wanted to, I don't know, do stuff.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.310
[laughter]

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.310
&gt;&gt;commentator: Change the world.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.520
&gt;&gt;Shina: [laughs]

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:16.390
&gt;&gt;Mikey : I gotta say that I don't think I
was always that way, but especially doing

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:21.700
this and being on stage every day, sometimes
twice a day, eight times a week, does give

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:28.740
you just this, "Well I'm in front of people
again." You kinda like lose track of all the

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.040
wishy washiness and you just, you learn to
be yourself really well I think when you're

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.599
constantly performing and constantly on, on
the stage I guess. That's how it's been for

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:39.599
me.

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:45.251
&gt;&gt;John: I was just larger than life. I had
so much energy; so much energy.

00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:47.140
&gt;&gt;commentator: Yeah, so I was the stage manager
before.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.690
This is kinda interesting the question as
well. So there's a theater, North Carolina

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:54.750
theater had a theater camp so when we would
do our four prod, main stage productions in

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.640
the summer to keep us employed, we'd do this
theater camp for the kids and like all the

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.580
stage moms and like, "Well my kid is the best
little kid and is gonna be famous, " and all

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.580
this stuff. "

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:08.540
So like this is one of the kids that shows
up; and was the problem kid, of course.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.800
But like, I mean programs like that I think
help people kind of discover themselves and-and

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.180
kind of start them, I don't know. --

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.200
&gt;&gt;John: I mean --

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.240
&gt;&gt;commentator: vocalist or good dancer, they're--

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.850
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah, I mean it's-it's, over time
it develops. You grow up; you mature; you

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:27.099
find out what your strengths and weaknesses
are and if you just go with what your strengths

00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:30.740
and weaknesses are and you know what they
are, you know what I mean? If you really,

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:36.980
really, really know what makes you tick and
what makes you happy, you can do a lot.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:42.300
It's all about giving something so I can take
somebody out of their world for five seconds

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:47.600
and make them feel something different; make
them feel alive or make them go back to a

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.640
time and a place when I sing a song so they
have a memory of their father or their mother,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.230
that maybe wasn't the best memory but all
of a sudden it's good.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:49:00.910
Like things like that; it's the magic of-of
theater. And it's the fact that it's live

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.600
and you can see and there's an interaction
and there's-there's a realism that's there

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600
 --

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.560
&gt;&gt;commentator: And you feel that, you feel
that emotion.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560
&gt;&gt;John: and a passion and there's a passion
that you can feel.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:13.300
And I'm all about feeling emotions. If I don't
feel it, I don't want it.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.910
So I mean that's why I do it. And I think
that's where my confidence comes from.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:22.170
&gt;&gt;commentator: So Shina any last comments
before we wrap it up? Mikey --

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.170
&gt;&gt;John: Besides you just being loud.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.839
&gt;&gt;Shina: I've just always been like a loud
person.

00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:26.290
&gt;&gt;John: [laughs]

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:32.369
&gt;&gt;Shina: I don't know. I, sometimes I forget
I'm not on stage too. And I'll like be having

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:35.980
a conversation with someone and me, my best
friends are exactly like me too, like really

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.230
loud and animated. So I've just always been
like that.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:43.430
&gt;&gt;Mikey : Yeah, I think once you get into
this business especially like this far in,

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:48.930
you're surrounded with theatrical people so
much that it just never really is over.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:49.930
&gt;&gt;Shina: [laughs]

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.410
&gt;&gt;Mikey : The curtain comes down, but not
really.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:52.410
[laughter]

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:53.770
We're still on stage. Let's be serious.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.770
&gt;&gt;Shina: Yeah.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:55.770
[laughter]

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.200
&gt;&gt;Mikey : We don't mind. We like to be fun,
big, and goofy.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200
Spazzy you know.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.900
&gt;&gt;commentator: Everybody give 'em a big round
of applause and thank them for coming to Google.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.900
[applause]

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.900
&gt;&gt;John: You're welcome.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:06.900
[applause]

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.420
&gt;&gt;commentator: And I'm sure we'll come and
see you see. We have discounts so --

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.420
&gt;&gt;John: You're the man.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.420
&gt;&gt;commentator: you'll see some Googlers.

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:10.423
Thanks again guys.
