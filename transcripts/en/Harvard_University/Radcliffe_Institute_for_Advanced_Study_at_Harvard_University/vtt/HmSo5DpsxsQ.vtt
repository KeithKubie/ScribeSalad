00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.928
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:04.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.490
- Wow.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.720
As anybody who's attended
these talks already knows,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.870
Meredith's introductions are so
uplifting that it's basically

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.800
all downhill from the
time you open your mouth,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.850
and I want to just offer
a few thanks of my own.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.070
I want to thank
Meredith, of course,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.529
but also her predecessor, Judith
Vichniac, who was actually

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.070
the director of
social studies when I

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.650
was writing that senior thesis.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.250
And I also want to just
thank the amazing group here

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.760
at the Radcliffe Institute,
including Rebecca, Sharon,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.480
Jess, Alex, my two amazing
research partners, Mina

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.040
and Hamza.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.660
And I want to thank Perrin
Grayson and Dean Nagin

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.200
for this amazing
fellowship semester.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.720
Now, this is a
bittersweet moment for me,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.260
because I'm finishing my
fellowship, essentially,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.400
with this talk.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.530
Though I get a
chance to spend time

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.819
at the holiday party with
the Fellows afterward,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.330
and thankfully, I
will hear them sing.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.500
They will not have to hear me.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.330
But I'm really glad
that I was able to give

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.550
this talk at this time
in the fellowship,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.790
because the talk is really the
culmination of the work I've

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.930
been doing over this last
amazingly productive five

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.930
to six months.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.430
And I want to keep my
thanks relatively short,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.360
even though they've gone on so
far pretty long, because I want

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.290
to make sure that we
have time to discuss

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.630
these important developments
that I'll be talking about,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.610
ones that I think
touch all of us

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.180
and about which we
are all concerned.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.410
The fact is, whenever
I'm in this situation,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.650
where I am only speaking for
what seems to me a limited

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.280
period of time, I'm
reminded of an evaluation

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.537
that I received when I was a
new assistant professor at Yale,

00:01:57.537 --> 00:01:58.870
and it began with great promise.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.490
It said, professor Hacker, if
I had just 15 minutes to live,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.910
I'd want to spend
it in your class,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.979
because that way it
would seem like an hour.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.710
So I really hope the next 15
minutes seems pretty close--

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.960
or the next 45, in
this case, seems pretty

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.180
close to the actual time.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.210
One more thing, my co-author
Paul Pierson was mentioned,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.410
and without him, none of what
I've done over the past decade

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.400
or so would be possible, and I
just want to thank him deeply.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.160
He was actually a professor
at Harvard when we first met.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.080
I only learned later
that we had both

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.020
grown up in the same college
town, Eugene, Oregon,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.880
though we'd never met then.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.330
So Paul and I have
written, as Meredith

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.100
said, two books that
have really centered

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.524
on the way in which inequality
has been shaped and constructed

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.440
by government and the
ways in which government

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.480
is central to our prosperity.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.220
Yet, that's not, of
course, often recognized.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.310
We're now working
on another book,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.080
I guess a third in our
trilogy, and we don't actually

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.520
know what exactly it's about.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.370
And that's why I'm so excited to
be able to talk with you today,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.630
because in fact, I want
not just to share with you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.410
what I've been thinking but
also get your feedback on it.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.080
And the place to
start, I think--

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.350
and it's the place that I think
you have all gone in your mind

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.930
as you think about
right-wing populism--

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.570
is the fact that over the last--

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.840
oh, I don't know--

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.640
five years or so, we have
become obsessed with the idea

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.180
that there's been this huge
right-wing populist turn

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.050
in the world.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.540
And in the United States,
an ethnonationalist,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.190
xenophobic, anti-immigrant,
racially-resentful

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.690
white, mostly male populism
that's roiling our politics

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.830
and the politics
of many countries.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.400
And there's certainly a huge
amount of truth to that,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.560
but as the title of
my talk suggests,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.080
there's something
very strange about

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.150
American, right-wing populism.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.360
And I think the way to
get at that, as Meredith

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.072
was suggesting, is to step
back from the rhetoric

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:14.280
and just think about what
our government has actually

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.267
been doing over the
past couple of years.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:19.350
So well, what's the biggest
thing it's been doing?

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.240
Of course, it's the
big tax cuts that

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.120
were passed at the
end of 2017, and these

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.180
were, without question, the
biggest legislative achievement

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.760
of the unified
Republican government

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.870
that began with Donald Trump.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.500
And as you can see,
right, they had one very

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.060
defining characteristic.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.600
Most of the gains went
to the very affluent.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240
And by the way, there's
a lot of research now

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.990
that's come out in the
wake of the tax cuts

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.860
suggesting that not only
was a direct impact very

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.380
skewed toward the top, but
most of the indirect effects

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.260
have not been that
favorable towards middle

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.530
and working class Americans.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.830
Things like stock buybacks or
moving money between countries

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.120
have not really raised the
wages of most Americans,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.450
and this is a pretty
stark picture.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.890
When George W. Bush
passed his tax cuts,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.920
there was a lot of criticism
that 40% of the benefits

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.960
went to the richest 1%.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.700
Well, the figure
for these tax cuts

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.760
is 83% of the benefits
went to the top 1%.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.410
OK, so that's the
big thing they did.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.390
What is the big
thing they didn't do?

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.560
Well strikingly, right, they
tried to, quote unquote,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.920
repeal and replace the
Affordable Care Act.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.630
Now, what's really striking
about this, as you can see,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.080
is that despite promises on
the campaign trail by President

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.410
Trump that everyone would get
better health care, in fact,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.349
the bill would have resulted
in a significant decline

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.140
in the share of Americans
without coverage.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.780
Even more striking is
that a lot of those

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.470
who would lose coverage would be
Donald Trump's own supporters,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.710
people living outside
of urban areas who

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.710
have become highly dependent
on Medicaid, especially

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.670
in the wake of
the opioid crisis.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.090
So these are two big policy
moves, one of which succeeded,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.390
one of which barely
failed, thanks in part

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.135
to the courageous vote
of the late John McCain.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.950
You might think, well, these
are things I don't like,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.870
or many Americans
don't like, but they're

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.600
popular among Republicans.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.730
Well, the truth is that
they're not that popular.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.370
In fact, Chris Warshaw has done
a really great service to us

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.485
by looking at all of
the recent legislation

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.740
and has found that the
tax cuts and the health

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.140
care bills are the two
most unpopular major pieces

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.737
of legislation in the
last quarter century.

00:06:50.737 --> 00:06:53.070
And you can just see, the
numbers are really remarkable.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.300
They're less popular than the
so-called TARP bailout of 2008.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.800
So they're not popular.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.352
They're skewed towards the top.

00:07:04.352 --> 00:07:08.510
This is the most obvious way
in which the policymaking

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.880
in Washington has tilted.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.390
But keep in mind that these
tax cuts were not paid for.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.430
So there's one more big
thing to look at-- namely,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.700
the fact that we are the only
rich democracy, basically,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.050
that's running large deficits.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.590
We're running large
deficits even as our economy

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.610
is fairly healthy.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.450
So that is going to
have a lot of effects.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.740
It's already had some.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.630
One of them that I
think is quite relevant

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.950
is when Republicans and
Democrats came together

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.080
to pass a big opioid
bill, they actually

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.700
could only agree because
of Republicans' insistence

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.610
that the bill would
be revenue-neutral.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.810
That is, there is no net
spending in this bill.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.450
And this is striking
for a number of reasons.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.050
One is that 72,000 people died
in 2017, up from about 20,000

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.640
in 1999.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.970
But it's also striking
because, as a recent Journal

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.900
of American Medical
Association piece pointed out,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.729
a lot of the problem is in
so-called Trump counties.

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:20.270
And there's a pretty
high correlation

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.880
between opioid overdose
deaths and abuse and support

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.610
for President Trump.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.940
So the policies are
tilted towards the top.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.020
They're not very popular.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.090
They're not doing much for--

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.740
and indeed, in some cases
are actually detrimental to--

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.330
many of those who support
Republican officeholders.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.500
And what do Republicans say?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.460
Well, here's one.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.410
Mitch McConnell very
quickly came out

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.320
after the budget deficit
figures became clear

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.500
and suggested that perhaps
it was time to look

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.040
at the so-called entitlements.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.650
Needless to say, there was not
a big rush among Republicans

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.579
to talk about this issue.

00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:11.120
And that may be a quote that
you heard, but here are a couple

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.990
that you may not
have seen from Mitch.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.690
And why would McConnell believe
that they were the winners who

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.640
got to make policy?

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.740
And why was 2017
such a good year?

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.840
And I think it's pretty obvious.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.490
It's a good year because they
were able to pass the tax cuts.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.730
They massively
deregulated energy,

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.900
pulling out of the Paris
Accord, for example.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.020
And they've gotten lots and
lots of conservative justices

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.560
and judges on the bench.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.090
So this is not Donald
Trump's agenda.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.620
It's not actually the agenda
of right-wing populists

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.880
anywhere else.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.470
There's a superficial
similarity.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.770
Let's look over at what's
happening in Italy.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.514
The EU and the Italian coalition
government is tussling,

00:10:04.514 --> 00:10:05.930
and one partner
in that government

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.760
is a right-wing populist party.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.680
It's superficially similar.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.360
They want to run up deficits.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.885
EU says no, you can't.

00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:14.510
So why do they want
to run up deficits?

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.940
Well, read the list here.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.770
They're doing what right-wing
populists in most countries do,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.190
which is they try
to deliver benefits

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:28.400
to white Europeans or white
Canadians or white citizens.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.700
And that kind of
welfare chauvinism

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.190
is sort of the themes
that Donald Trump ran on.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.320
They're not the
themes that have been

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.560
at the heart of policymaking
in recent years.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.670
So this is an
alliance, if you will,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.900
a coalition, an uneasy
moment, in which we have

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.630
a kind of plutocratic populism.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.100
I sum it up with this--

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.890
redistribution for the rich
and resentment for the rest.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:02.130
But the basic elements of it
are essentially a responsiveness

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.420
of the organized
establishment Republican Party

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.420
to the demands of corporations
and the very affluent,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.870
on the one hand, and
an increasing turn

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.590
to ethnonationalists and other
appeals that have very little

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.110
or nothing to do
with economic issues

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.300
to maintain the Republican base.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.120
We've thought about different
ways to summarize this.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.670
I came up with
this, and I wanted

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.960
it to be the name of our book.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.030
But Paul has disagreed.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.500
And there's a reason I think he
disagreed, because this book is

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.332
not going to be just about Trump
or even primarily about Trump.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.290
Trump is in many ways,
as I'll try to show you,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.720
a product of a
transformation that's

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.430
taken place within the GOP
at least since the 1990s.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.880
And if we want to understand
why right-wing populism is

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.060
distinctive in the US,
the easy place to begin--

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.730
and I want to begin here
but then move beyond it--

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.960
is with our distinctive
political institutions.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.570
Because of the fact that we
have a presidential system

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.420
with these
single-member districts,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.610
Trump was able to pursue a
strategy that might be called

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.650
the half of the half strategy.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.290
He was able to outflank his
Republican opponents by taking

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.910
a more populist stance.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.800
They split the other vote.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.230
And then he was
able, through reasons

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.340
I'll explore in a moment,
to win the general election.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.650
But that meant, of
course, a very narrow base

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.010
of support for Trump and
his politics himself.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.250
But there's just not as much
scope for that kind of victory

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.650
in a parliamentary system,
where parties basically

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.010
get the proportion of the seats
as the proportion of the votes

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.120
they get.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.390
However, once Trump's in
office, he's got a problem,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.630
or at least he has to deal
with another set of conditions.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.730
And that is that in our system,
there is a separate governing

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.550
branch-- namely Congress,
the House and the Senate.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.790
And Congress has
been the stronghold

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:07.120
of the plutocratic agenda
of the Republican Party.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.550
And this, I think, is
really at the heart

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.010
of many of the tensions
that have played out

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.056
within the party.

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:16.930
One way to think about
this is to think of it

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.330
in terms of polarization,
that the two

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.800
parties have been moving apart.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.380
But as I've argued in
some of my previous work,

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.630
this polarization is
highly asymmetric.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.490
The Republican Party
has moved very far

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.520
to the right over
the last generation,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.790
while the Democratic
Party has moved modestly

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.610
to the left, mostly because
of the replacement of Southern

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.945
Democrats with
Southern Republicans.

00:13:38.945 --> 00:13:40.570
And you can see this
with these scores.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.700
These are based on
roll call votes,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.210
and they're basically designed
to divide members of Congress

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.640
based on a right-left dimension.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.660
It turns out you can explain
90% to 95% of roll call votes

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.900
with this simple
left-right dimension, which

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.550
is the familiar bigger versus
smaller government or more

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:06.850
redistribution versus less
redistribution or Democratic

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.320
versus Republican.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.690
And this divide is growing.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.500
But it's growing mostly because
more and more Republicans

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.530
are at the extreme of
the ideological spectrum.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.250
There's nothing built into
this model to produce that.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.280
It's because while the
parties are moving apart,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.960
Republicans are much
more likely to be

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.440
located in this edge of
the ideological spectrum.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.730
Now this is, in turn, I think
why many Republicans reconciled

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.950
themselves relatively
quickly to Trump.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.530
In some ways, the
script had been laid out

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.020
by Grover Norquist,
the head of Americans

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.270
for Tax Reform, the
anti-tax organization so

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.240
famous for the Taxpayer
Protection Pledge

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.910
that essentially all
Republican officeholders are

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.410
pressed to sign.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.200
He said basically--
and this is in 2012--

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.240
it really doesn't matter.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:06.040
As long as you've got Paul Ryan
in the House and the president

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.960
has a working hand--
and apparently,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.650
Trump's hands may be small, but
the fingers appear to work--

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.870
we'll be able to
get what we want.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.570
And Ryan recognized this.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.180
People don't know
this, but Paul Ryan

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.150
had two speeches prepared
for election night.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.160
One was going to
repudiate Donald Trump

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.930
and call to the higher
traditions of the Republican

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.350
Party embodied in the life
of his mentor Jack Kemp.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.360
He threw that speech
out the window.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.340
And he gave another
speech, a speech

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.170
that basically
said he would work

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.940
with Trump in a so-called
coalition government.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.630
Ryan's aides actually
called this Paul's deal

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.700
with the devil,
which is suggestive

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.850
of rather a bit of skepticism
about the intentions of Donald

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.970
Trump.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.010
So this is the proximate
story of what happened.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.780
Trump and Ryan,
McConnell and Trump,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.660
form this uneasy
alliance to govern.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.450
However, I think we have
to push the question back.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.310
It goes even deeper.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.250
It's really what's happened
to the Republican Party.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.580
My co-author, Paul, saw a
bumper sticker in Berkeley

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.980
that summed up the
question we're asking.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.160
I could put it a little
bit more eloquently.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.410
There really are
three questions.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.430
The first question
is, basically,

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.860
why is this populism
so plutocratic?

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.440
The second, and I
think more difficult,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.110
question is why have the
plutocrats not only not had

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.740
to compromise with the
populists on economic policy,

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.810
but so far-- and I recognize
there are some areas

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.010
of tension--

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.270
they've basically been
able to get what they want

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.650
and sometimes more than they
could have ever hoped for?

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.020
And the third question is--

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.540
and the obvious
question-- is, is this

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.850
a stable outcome, equilibrium?

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.820
Is this going to continue?

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.010
Are we passing by a
certain Republican Party,

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.589
or is this party bedding down?

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.069
And I think the way to think
about this is basically

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.460
to think about to what extent
can the party, with minority

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.760
support, actually embed a
lot of the policies it wants?

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.579
So in a way, I want
to end our discussion

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.910
by thinking about what I would
call the countermajoritarian

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.660
character of this coalition, the
extent to which it increasingly

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.570
recognizes it's in a race
against time in terms

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.610
of its popular
majorities and wants

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.910
to either maximize the
influence of its voters,

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.660
minimize the influence
of its opponents' voters,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.670
change the rules of
the game, or lock

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.320
in policies for the long
term, or institutions

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.360
for the long term.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.730
That's a lot to cover,
but I promise that I

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.650
will move quickly through it.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.500
When Paul and I were
doing this research,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.550
we came to this not through
contemporary American politics,

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.270
but by reading a profound
book by a Harvard scholar

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.000
about the history of
conservative parties.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
If you haven't read Daniel
Ziblatt's award-winning book,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.120
you must.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.030
And basically Ziblatt is
discussing a basic struggle

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.460
that conservative parties face.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.880
For conservative parties, he
says, they've got this problem.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.680
They're tied to economic elites.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.850
But in the early 20th century,
the franchise is expanding.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.260
So all these non-elites--
white men, of course,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.910
but non-elites-- are
moving into the electorate.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.590
So how do they manage that?

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.860
How do they maintain
electoral support

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.710
while holding on
to their commitment

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.690
to protecting the privileges
of those at the top?

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.960
And remember, these are
extremely unequal societies,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.380
societies at a
level of inequality

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.330
we had not seen, at
least until recently,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.720
in advanced industrial
democracies.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.720
And his answer is,
basically, they've

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.000
got to figure out
another issue to run on.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.960
Protecting the rich is not a
winning electoral strategy.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.720
They've got to find
something else.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.600
And he shows how some parties,
like the British Tories,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.080
figure out something else
that is at least conducive

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.450
to British democracy-- in
that case, nationalism,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.610
colonialism--

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.010
and other parties, like
the German conservatives,

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.570
find an alternative cleavage.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.780
But it turns out not to be
very conducive to democracy.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.120
So what we realized is that
what's happening in the United

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.670
States today is a lot
like what happened

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.730
in the early 20th century,
in that inequality has been

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.550
so dramatically increasing
in the United States,

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.050
so that the top 1% has seen
its share of income doubled,

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.500
and the bottom half, its
share of income fall.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.200
This is very similar,
then, to the transformation

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.170
that was taking place because of
the expansion of the suffrage.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.326
And the result of this
is that conservatives,

00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:55.200
the conservative party,
the Republican Party,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.420
is once again torn.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.590
And as I'll argue, I think
it makes a fateful choice

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.930
to embrace plutocracy
in the 1990s.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.430
And it's important to note that
conservative parties do not

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.620
have to stick with the rich.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.420
They can moderate their stances.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.630
But to do so, of course, is to
go against some very powerful

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.100
forces within the party.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.650
So why is American right-wing
populism distinctive?

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.620
Well, another reason might
be that American inequality

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.700
is distinctive.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.040
If you look at Western
Europe, the story

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.990
is actually quite different.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:32.870
There has yet to be this
stark rise in inequality.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.080
And if you look
at US inequality,

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.300
it's really the rise
of the very, very top

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.650
that drives the trend.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.350
So the Republican Party,
as a conservative party,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.700
is faced with this trade-off.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.783
And I think the way that
most political scientists

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:53.290
would think about
this is it's basically

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.360
a question about
electoral strategy,

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.360
about vote maximizing.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.940
And if you're thinking
about vote maximizing,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.860
the way to think about this,
I think, is pretty simple.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.300
And this is actually based
on the 2016 election.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.910
So first, we have an
economic dimension.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.500
And here we have what Drutman
nicely calls a social identity

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.090
dimension, which
I would probably

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.090
call the ethnonationalist
racist dimension.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.300
But in any case, we have
these two dimensions.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.850
And Democrats are
the most consistently

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:31.840
in the economically progressive
and progressive with regard

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.550
to social issues.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.310
And Republicans are
most consistently

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.840
in the top quadrant,
which is the opposite.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.590
So that's one dimension.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.750
You're thinking about
this as basically

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.230
the economic dimension as
being the crucial divider.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.900
And there is something
you might notice.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.759
There are a lot more Democrats.

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:53.050
There are a lot more Democrats.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.260
In fact-- I'll give you
the exact numbers here--

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:03.250
that liberal, progressive group
there is 45% of the electorate,

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.580
and the top right
is about half that.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.010
So it's 22.7%.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.590
So that's a problem.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.360
Now, you might think,
well, what the Republicans

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.720
could do is get all those
libertarians onboard.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.460
They're economically
conservative,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.170
but they're socially liberal.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:23.840
And guess what?

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.520
There aren't any of them.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.590
There are not very many.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.430
I think there's 10%, according
to Drutman's calculations.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.690
No, 3.8%.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.060
So that's not a
winning strategy.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.300
Bloomberg, are you listening?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.220
So there's this last group.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.980
And this is the
crucial swing group.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.590
So these are folks
that Trump brought in

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.950
because he was able
to adopt relatively

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.680
progressive positions
for the Republican Party

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.940
on economic issues.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.670
But of course, he was very
hard-core conservative

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.360
on the identity, social
issues dimension.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.920
So that is the standard
way of thinking about it.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.440
And it raises this
fundamental question--

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.850
well, why didn't
they do that before?

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.090
Why did Trump have to
innovate in this way?

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.425
And again, most of the
people who voted for Trump

00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:13.300
had voted for Romney.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.290
Most of those who'd voted
for Clinton voted for Obama.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.060
But those Obama voters
who voted for Trump,

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.710
they're up in that group.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.290
So why didn't people
think of this?

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.070
Or why didn't Republicans
think of this before?

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.570
And the answer is that
this is a strategy that's

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.510
pretty much at odds
with an important part

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.250
of the Republican coalition.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.500
As I said, the
party has committed

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.410
itself very much to defending
the interests of those

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.300
at the top.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.320
And so the important thing
I want to emphasize here,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.270
following the recent
work on parties

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.920
by people like David
Carroll and John Zaller,

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.010
is to emphasize that the
parties here are not just

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.210
collections of voters,
but they're also

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.170
as coalitions of groups.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.250
And what those groups
want is policy.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.560
In many cases, what
they want is policy.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.090
And so the trade-off
for a party is

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.520
to figure out how to
maximize votes while pleasing

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.140
your organized supporters.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:16.360
Now, I mention this because,
for the Republican Party,

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.860
this quadrant is fine,
to some extent, if it's

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.900
about divisive social issues.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.110
It's not so fine if it's about
progressive economic policies.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:30.610
That's not agreeable to the
intense organized interests

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.260
within the Republican Party.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.570
And so the party
basically has to adopt

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:39.580
a strategy of stoking outrage
without necessarily responding

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.180
to the interests of those
whose outrage it's stoking.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:48.170
This is what Paul and I call
opening the Pandora's box,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.380
if you will, that
Ziblatt identifies

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.020
and that conservative
parties can open.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.980
And Ziblatt talks about three
things that are in this box.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.750
If a party goes down the road of
stoking outrage, for one thing,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.700
it's, of course,
creating social division.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.840
But it's also, in many cases,
as Ziblatt argues, reliant

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.180
on outside groups
to basically do

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.770
the dirty work of campaigning.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.506
It both needs their
money to protect--

00:25:14.506 --> 00:25:15.880
and that often
comes from what we

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.230
call here first-dimension
extremists, the Koch brothers,

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.230
the Chamber of Commerce, the
establishment groups that

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.060
have a lot of resources.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.710
But it also has to come--

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.540
especially electioneering
has to come

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.000
from these second-dimension
extremists.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.550
These are the extremists
on that identity dimension

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.850
that I discussed.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.516
These are groups like
the National Rifle

00:25:36.516 --> 00:25:40.480
Association, the Christian
conservative movement, and--

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.460
though it doesn't
fit perfectly--

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.320
the right-wing media, all of
which I'll talk about briefly.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.530
So I want to take
these in reverse order,

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.570
starting basically with--

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.720
oh, wait, there's one more.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.500
Sorry.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.420
So the last thing that
these parties do--

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.810
because even this
may not be enough--

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.800
is they tend to try to maximize
the influence of their voters.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.290
They can do this
through subtle means.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.660
But increasingly, they
get attracted, according

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.080
to Ziblatt, to various forms
of vote-rigging or worse,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.240
as we were already
starting to discuss.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.790
So I'll come back to that.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.642
So let's start with
the vote-rigging side.

00:26:18.642 --> 00:26:20.100
This is the side
with which I think

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.260
you're probably most familiar.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.020
I'm from Portland, Oregon.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.430
I grew up in Eugene, as I said.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.790
But I went to high
school in Portland.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.730
My parents were able to watch--

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.419
this is the path of the eclipse.

00:26:34.419 --> 00:26:34.960
I don't know.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.740
How many saw the eclipse?

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.460
I didn't.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.520
I didn't because I was
hiking in New Hampshire when

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.610
it was going through from my
parents' house down to where

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.434
my brother-in-law lives
in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:26:46.434 --> 00:26:48.350
You already can see where
I'm going with this.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.020
This is the path of the
eclipse, and it's mostly red.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.310
Why is it mostly red?

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.940
Because most of the counties
over which the total eclipse

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.610
passed are Republican counties.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.070
Now, what does this mean,
besides that the Republican

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.780
Party may be the
party of darkness?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.650
OK, that was unfair.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:06.900
But what does it mean?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.742
It means if you draw any
line from coast to coast,

00:27:09.742 --> 00:27:10.950
it's going to look like that.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.330
In fact, here's a better picture
to give you a sense of this.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.850
Urban America is
increasingly Democratic.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.475
Rural and exurban America
is increasing Republican.

00:27:20.475 --> 00:27:21.350
Come up with a line--

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.980
I think you'd probably want to
run it from New York to LA--

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.760
but you're going to go through
a lot of Republican country.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.610
Now, you can see there's a lot
more votes in the urban areas.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.270
But now we come to the
vote-rigging problem.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.030
Well, there's first the
fact that our Senate is not

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.050
based on population, of course.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.610
It's based on territory.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.960
So this is not something
that Republicans engineered.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.910
But it is something
that they benefit from.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:53.030
Here are the top five
states that, in terms

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:57.250
of the ratio of
voters to senators,

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.254
they have the most
favorable ranking.

00:28:01.254 --> 00:28:03.170
And here you have
California, just to give you

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.497
a sense of how skewed that is.

00:28:05.497 --> 00:28:07.580
And it does turn out that
if you come from a state

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.100
without a lot of people,
each of those people

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.810
get a lot more money from
the federal government.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.200
But the point here is not so
much about the distribution

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.100
of federal funds.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.530
It's about the fact that this
means Republicans basically

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.170
have a built-in
edge in the Senate.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.380
It's not historically been
a very big partisan shift,

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.820
but it increasingly
has been one.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.460
And we saw this with the
Kavanaugh nomination.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.840
This was a president who had a
minority of the popular vote,

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.780
who nominated a justice
who got a Senate vote where

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.140
the senators representing a
minority of the population

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.777
put the justice into office.

00:28:43.777 --> 00:28:45.860
It turns out that's not
actually that exceptional.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.290
These are all the votes
in recent years in which--

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.570
this is the average
difference, basically,

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.856
between the percent
of senators voting yes

00:28:55.856 --> 00:28:57.230
and the percent
of the population

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.370
those senators represent.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.260
And you can see,
we're approaching

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.020
about negative-6 points.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:09.530
So basically, there
are more and more

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.380
population minority
victories in the Senate.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.390
Now, the Senate is
part of the story.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.790
The other part of it,
of course, is the House.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.070
And Moon Duchin, who
unfortunately couldn't be here

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.470
today, has done
us a great service

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.910
by trying to fix this problem.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.150
Now, here is
Pennsylvania, where she

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.900
was enlisted to help
draw better maps.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.010
And Moon is, of course, one of
my fellow Radcliffe Fellows.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.090
And she did a great job.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.190
Look at this.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.600
They went from
54% of House votes

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.330
for Republicans
to 13 of 18 seats.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.780
And they got 45% of votes,
Republic-- and they got-- what?

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.490
9 of 18 seats.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:53.150
So it's actually not so great.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.650
And the reason
it's not so great,

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.150
as you've probably
have figured out,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.440
is these blue regions are so
overwhelmingly Democratic,

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.540
based on that figure
I showed you earlier,

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.110
that it's so easy to draw
districts that basically waste

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.600
Democratic votes, where
everything above 50%

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.780
is just being thrown away.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.320
And so even when you
draw maps in a way that

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.470
is as fair as possible,
as Moon has done,

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.582
it's going to have a bit of a
bias in favor of Republicans.

00:30:21.582 --> 00:30:23.790
But of course, Republicans,
as we'll see in a moment,

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.360
have done a really good job
of exploiting that bias.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.420
And in fact, in
the 2016 election,

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.400
we saw the largest
gap, basically,

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.160
between the median Senate
and House district,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.189
its partisanship,
and the partisanship

00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:37.230
of the nation as a whole.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.340
So the way to think about
this is that the median Senate

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.910
and House seat was about
6 points more Republican

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.280
than the nation as
a whole in 2016.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.230
And by the way,
that's come down.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.340
But it's not at zero.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:56.360
This carries over, of course,
to the electoral college.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.780
Why did Trump win,
besides the fact

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.780
that there were all those
illegal votes in California?

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.330
Well, he won because he
was able to put together

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.620
an electoral college
map that gave him

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.000
the majority of electors.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.540
Why is that possible?

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.390
Because the electoral
college gives you

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.630
the number of senators plus
the number of representatives.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.130
And so for a state
like Wyoming that

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.890
has one representative
plus two senators,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.080
it still gets three
electoral college votes.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.900
By the way, Wyoming
has the same number

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.950
of senators as it
has escalators.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.710
I'm not making that up, although
there was a dispute about this,

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.940
because apparently there
are two escalators that go--

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.090
there are two escalators, pairs.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.660
Is an escalator just
the part going up

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.791
and the part going down,
or is it the part going up

00:31:44.791 --> 00:31:45.790
and the part going down?

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.831
I would argue the latter.

00:31:46.831 --> 00:31:51.820
But needless to say, this
has not been resolved.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.230
So that's the vote side.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.380
We know that story.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.770
Let me tell you another
story that we know less well.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.070
And that's basically the
story about the organized

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.670
intense policy demanders
within the Republican Party.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.580
So money is much more
important than it ever

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.250
has been in American politics,
and more of that money

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.120
comes from the top.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.750
Indeed, in 1980, about 10%
of campaign contributions

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:19.210
came from the top
0.01% of donors.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.140
In 2016, that number was 40%.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.840
And you might say,
well, there are

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.970
rich people on both sides
of the aisle, and it's true.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.150
But the research is
pretty clear on this.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.380
It's not shocking news.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.440
Rich people tend to be
a bit more conservative.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.510
This was a study
done by Benjamin Page

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.250
and his colleagues in
the area around Chicago,

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.560
where they actually surveyed
a set of rich people.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.150
They were able to follow up
with them, get like a 30% to 40%

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.200
response rate.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.620
The average income in this
group was over $1 million.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.867
Average wealth was
around $14 million.

00:32:52.867 --> 00:32:54.700
And lo and behold,
they're more likely to be

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.830
Republican and conservative.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.330
If you go even
higher up the ladder,

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:02.110
as Ben Page has done with
his co-authors in a book

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.100
that's just coming out,
most of the big dollars--

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.620
this is the 100 richest
people on the Forbes 400 list.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.217
By the way, Donald
Trump is number 134,

00:33:14.217 --> 00:33:15.550
so he doesn't get in this group.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.840
I'm sure he's calling up right
now to try to change that.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.930
In any case, his point
is basically yes,

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:28.450
there are Democratic
liberals on this list.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.950
But they are much less
likely to be active,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.620
although they are much more
likely to speak out publicly,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.629
shaping our view of
who these people are.

00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:40.420
And it's worth noting
that there's not just

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.240
more money on the
Republican side.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.350
It's a lot more focused.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.000
I think the biggest
example of this

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.070
is lobbying, because
lobbying is really

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:52.420
about getting very specific
things from government.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.580
And lo and behold,
many of those things

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.280
involve not regulating
corporations

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.130
so that they don't spew
out pollution or impose

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.560
systemic financial
risk on us, or getting

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.750
goodies for corporations.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.440
And so the lobbying that
takes place often has,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.870
I think, a very
conservative cast,

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.889
because if corporations care
intensely about a few things,

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.650
they may be very concerned
about other things.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.290
They may be
concerned about, say,

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.770
the deterioration in
infrastructure or the ways

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.870
in which our civic
discourse is degrading.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.570
But if you're Tim Cook at Apple,
what you're really concerned

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.820
about is whether you can get
those billions of dollars

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.690
back to be able to
give the stock buybacks

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.120
to your large shareholders.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.940
And the one thing to
say about lobbying

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.280
is that it isn't independent
of contributions.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.560
Mick Mulvaney gave
us a picture of that.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.925
He was once in Congress,
and he actually said this

00:34:48.925 --> 00:34:50.050
at a congressional hearing.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.940
This falls into the
standard definition

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.930
of a political gaffe, when a
politician tells the truth.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.982
So this is a big,
important thing

00:35:01.982 --> 00:35:03.940
that people don't know
about, is that lobbyists

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.060
run a lot of fundraisers for
politicians, which further

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.160
intensifies the
ability of lobbyists

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.210
to get what they want.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.060
Last point on money.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.900
It's not just that it's
larger and more focused.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.340
It's also much better organized.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.580
And so this brings
us to this man.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.467
Does anybody know who this is?

00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:26.050
That's what I find
really fascinating,

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.535
because I wouldn't have
known who it was until I

00:35:27.535 --> 00:35:29.140
had written American Amnesia.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.640
This is Tom Donohue.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.440
He's the head of the
Chamber of Commerce.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.330
He's probably, until
recently at least,

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.320
was the most powerful
man in Washington.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.270
He has a plaque on his desk that
sums up his philosophy of life.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:44.959
And Donohue basically has
yoked the Chamber of Commerce

00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:46.000
and the Republican Party.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.100
In 2016, they shoveled
100% of their money

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.540
to Republican candidates.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.570
In the most recent election,
they shifted dramatically

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.720
and gave 3% or so of their
money to Democratic candidates.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:06.040
So this is an institution
or organization

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.340
that has become this
fearsome Washington predator,

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.760
and it's very closely
tied to the GOP.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.760
There is another institution
that is on the right.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.750
It's the Koch network.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.940
And I know this
sounds conspiratorial,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.280
but you just can't
ignore this organization.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.120
It spent more in 2016 than
the Republican Party itself.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.820
It has a whole
series of chapters,

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.640
Americans for Prosperity,
across the country.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.960
And while it is certainly
not that into parts

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.260
of Donald Trump's agenda,
it is really, really

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.810
strongly behind the
Republican Party.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.930
One thing to note
is that there is

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.600
money-- the money
on the other side

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.490
is just not as well organized.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.080
So I have one
illustration of that.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.895
This is from the work of
Theda Skocpol like this slide,

00:36:52.895 --> 00:36:54.520
and it just came out
in a recent paper.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.840
I think it's fascinating.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.210
So the Democracy Alliance
is this progressive group

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.940
that organizes funding
for candidates.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.700
And here's just to give you
a sense of the Democracy

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.710
Alliance's relative capacity
to raise money compared

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.440
with the Koch seminars.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.865
There just is no contest.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:21.540
Let me move on from the topic
of first-dimension extremist

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.600
groups on the economic dimension
to talk just a little bit

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.480
about what I have called
second-dimension extremist

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.260
groups.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.150
So I said that we
really do have to take

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.430
the right-wing media seriously.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.210
And the reason is because,
just like the partisan divide,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.540
the media divide
is not symmetric.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.870
Conservative sources
are in their own world.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.020
There is a great deal of
overlap in the center.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.920
And this plays out
in a lot of ways.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.760
Probably the most
obvious way is you

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.560
can see conspiracy
stories emerge

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.180
on both the left and the right.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.110
But on the left they get quashed
almost immediately because they

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.170
run through the center of
mainstream media sources

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.030
that basically say
this isn't true.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.592
That doesn't happen on the
other side of the spectrum.

00:38:05.592 --> 00:38:07.050
So what does a
right-wing media do?

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.440
What does Trump's
number one adviser

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:17.850
do to shape the way in which
the conservative world operates?

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.620
I think there's
basically two things.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.310
One is that they de-legitimated
all other sources

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.110
of information.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.160
It is only the conservative
media, particularly Fox News,

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.810
that you can trust.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.300
The lame-stream
media is fake news.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.910
The other thing is
they were pioneers,

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:44.970
starting with talk radio, in
using racialized themes that

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.920
had been seen as
basically beyond

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.130
the pale in national politics
in the wake of the civil rights

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.330
revolution of the 1960s.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:57.810
Now, I don't want to say
that Fox News is fully

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.990
with the white
nationalist sites.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.780
But you cannot look at
Breitbart, which outfoxed--

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:09.090
no pun intended-- Fox News in
2016, pulling Fox closer to it,

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.210
you cannot look at Breitbart
without recognizing that this

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:19.550
is a totally new kind of media
environment on the right.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:23.470
And this environment, I think,
has a number of effects.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.530
But I think the most important
effect is to insulate--

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.510
to not only intensify
the outrage stoking,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.460
but to insulate those
whose outrage is

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.650
stoked from contrary messages.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.630
And so the kind of
geographic insulation

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.460
we've already talked
about comes together

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.350
with the kind of
media insulation

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.100
to create what some have called
epistemic closure, a kind

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:49.950
of world where you don't have
to deal with inconvenient facts

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:53.140
that are offered by others.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.140
There is another right-wing
group that I will only mention,

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.710
but I think it's
really important.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.250
And it's the National
Rifle Association.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.940
This is a series of covers
that Nick Kristof unearthed.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.280
And they really show
the transformation--

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.870
some might say descent--

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:11.800
of the NRA from basically
a sportsman club

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.780
into a fierce conservative,
and often highly racially

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.110
conservative, publication.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:24.502
The NRA has an
enormous influence

00:40:24.502 --> 00:40:30.680
on a core group of voters who
fit within this populist group.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.500
And again, they have a lot
of resources on the ground.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.390
Now, I want to say one
thing before I sum up.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.580
One is that this is
not an unalloyed good

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.390
for the Republican Party.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.770
There's a kind of Frankenstein
monster problem to it.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.190
You have to keep working these
voters into ever higher fits

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.240
of outrage.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.880
But at the same time, you're
losing control, in many ways,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.500
of the agenda.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.550
Notably, even Fox News
refused to run the ad

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.530
that Donald Trump
wanted to put out

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.450
in the close of the campaign.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.930
But never mind, a huge amount
of the Republican Party

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.390
has become
increasingly Trumpian.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:12.730
So what defines a
never-Trumper today?

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.730
It's that he or she--
but usually he--

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:19.930
is either not in office or
will soon be out of office.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.540
If you're not a never-Trumper,
you're running ads like--

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.402
- 14,000 illegal immigrants
is marching on America.

00:41:26.402 --> 00:41:28.234
From Phil Bredesen--

00:41:28.234 --> 00:41:30.690
- A few thousand very poor
people who are not a threat--

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.620
- --to gang members,
known criminals,

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.050
people from the Middle East,
possibly even terrorists.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.110
To Phil Bredesen--

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.810
- Not a threat to our--

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.590
it's not a threat
to our security.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:44.450
- Phil Bredesen, dangerously
wrong for Tennessee.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.030
Marsha Blackburn is
[INAUDIBLE] to build the wall

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.490
to stop [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.970
- I'm Marsha Blackburn,
and I approve this message.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.710
- We all really wanted to
relive that election, didn't we?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.100
So it didn't work.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.230
And we had an early
sign that it wouldn't

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:11.390
work from Paul Ryan, who stepped
out of the fray in the runup

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.230
to the 2016 election.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:21.200
But I think that we can see in
the rise and fall, in my view,

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.170
of Paul Ryan a story
about what's happened

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.210
to the Republican Party.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.290
I'm reminded, actually, of a
story that is much, much older.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:34.040
It's the story of the
unification of France.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.340
So King Henry IV
essentially unifies

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.010
France under Catholicism.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.650
And he famously said-- though
he probably didn't say--

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:46.010
that Paris is worth a Mass.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.600
It's worth it.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.630
If I get Paris, I'll go to Mass.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.030
And I feel like the epitaph
for Paul Ryan's career--

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.740
and let's hope it
is the epitaph--

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.890
is that tax cuts are
worth a Charlottesville.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.060
Ouch.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.230
But it didn't work.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.750
And I will say that this
was quite an election.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.350
Keeping on our Christian
theme, a lot of elections

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:09.692
are like Christmas.

00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:11.650
You wake up the next day,
and there are a bunch

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.060
of presents under the tree.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.870
This wasn't like that.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.700
I'm going to say--

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.790
I'm coining this-- it was
the Hanukkah election.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.610
The gifts just kept on coming.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:25.900
And the Republican
Party lost on the order

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.720
of 40 seats, which is the
largest Democratic gain

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.820
since the Watergate elections.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.130
And they did, I think,
because of the fact

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.920
that while the Republicans
intensified their base,

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.900
essentially their
unpopular agenda caught up

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:43.300
with them in many other
parts of the electorate.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:49.090
That said, the blue wave came up
against the Republican red wall

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.180
and in many places crested it,
but the wall held in others.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.460
Look at North
Carolina, for example.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.870
It actually was an even
more effective gerrymander,

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:03.940
given the numbers in 2018 than
it had been in previous years.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.870
Well, fortunately
the party is going

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.200
through a searing
soul-searching process.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.650
Just remember, 2012
with the autopsy,

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.630
we need to actually
diversify the party,

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.510
reach out to young
people and Hispanics.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.300
And we have all read, of
course, the 2018 autopsy.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.170
Yes.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:24.891
It was good.

00:44:24.891 --> 00:44:25.390
Yeah.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.056
So there hasn't been
any soul-searching.

00:44:27.056 --> 00:44:27.790
Why?

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.810
Because the party is
caught, if you will,

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:34.540
between a Trumpian rock and
a plutocratic hard place.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.260
And so to me, that's the
kind of scary culmination

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.780
of these trends,
because it leads us

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.500
to places like
Wisconsin and Michigan.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.580
So if you're not able to win--

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.040
if you lose the game, change
the rules of the game.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.730
And we all know what's
happening there,

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.550
but maybe you haven't
seen this quote,

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.060
which I find quite remarkable.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.560
If there weren't these
votes from the cities,

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.400
then we would've won.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.365
And I hadn't realized
this, but David Leonard

00:45:05.365 --> 00:45:07.240
had a great column the
other day pointing out

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.850
that there's a lot of
business backers of Wisconsin

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:13.000
Republicans who have
not tried to temper

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.440
their enthusiasm for minimizing
the power of the governor

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.060
and locking in place
a lot of policies,

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.540
including voter
ID policies, that

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.800
make it hard for especially
Democratic voters to vote.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.830
Walgreens is probably
the chief of them,

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.440
according to Leonard,
because of some strange tax

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.180
provision that Republicans have
vowed to preserve in Wisconsin.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.580
When I think of
this, I guess I have

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.710
to say I go back to
the great theorists.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:48.160
I go back to people like
Hobbes of Calvin and Hobbes.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.280
The Republicans-- there's a name
for the game they're playing.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.870
It's Calvinball.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.590
They're playing Calvinball.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.940
After they discovered that
they can't win this way,

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.620
they want to play
it a different way.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.750
Now, this is minor
in some cases.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.180
It's very major in others.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.151
And the one major
area that I think

00:46:07.151 --> 00:46:09.400
we should keep in mind,
because it has such a long lag

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.940
and such enduring effects,
is in the judiciary.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.670
And I think that the
thing to remember

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:21.430
is that the judiciary is now
the locus of policymaking

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.520
in many cases.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.080
Why?

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.810
Because the other branches
are not working very well.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.840
And the judiciary is,
meanwhile, also adopting

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.430
a much more aggressive stance
with regard to executive branch

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.674
regulation of the domestic
economy, something

00:46:35.674 --> 00:46:37.840
that I think has gotten a
lot less attention than it

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.560
deserves.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.110
There is a chamber agenda
as well as a Christian right

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.830
agenda.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.950
And indeed, if you
look at the justices

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:47.890
who go onto the Supreme Court--

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.790
by the way, four of
them got onto the court

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.180
with senators representing a
minority of the popular vote,

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.420
two with a president with a
minority of the popular vote

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.970
and senators representing a
minority of the popular vote.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:02.344
If you look at
that, you're going

00:47:02.344 --> 00:47:04.900
to see that in a lot of ways,
the plutocratic agenda is

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.190
getting baked into
our judicial system.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.080
That's a dark place to end.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.170
And so I want to try to offer
something a bit more uplifting.

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:16.950
The first is that I am really
excited that political reform

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.050
has become a major
issue in its own right.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.512
So many people said, oh,
no one cares about it.

00:47:22.512 --> 00:47:24.720
But as you probably know,
there were scores of ballot

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.460
initiatives-- some 30 by my
count, most of which passed--

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.630
that were trying to
broaden voting rights, that

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.210
were trying to bring ethics into
government, that were trying

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.120
to put campaign finance reform
on the table, that were trying

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.224
to reform redistricting.

00:47:37.224 --> 00:47:38.890
I think this is a
very encouraging sign.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.570
And it's worth noting that the
first bill that the House will

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:47.190
introduce, HR1, is a
political reform bill.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.050
The second thing that
I want to mention

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:53.700
is that I think there is a
real scope for addressing

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.240
the real challenges that many
white working-class voters are

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.050
facing.

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:01.170
And to me, that's
an essential part

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.110
of dealing with the
transformation of our politics.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:09.330
To be sure, we have to have a
multiracial, tolerant, diverse

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.260
society.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.480
But we also have
to have one where

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.730
people from all walks
of life feel that they

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:16.870
can achieve the American dream.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.170
I have been talking about
this for a long time

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.940
without a whole lot of success.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:27.060
But I think there's an
approach that has real promise,

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.810
and I've termed it
predistribution.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.350
And the idea is basically--
and this comes out

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:37.830
of my work with Paul-- that most
of the ways in which government

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:42.094
shapes income inequality is
not through taxes and benefits,

00:48:42.094 --> 00:48:44.010
but it's through shaping
the way markets work.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.301
It's through supporting unions.

00:48:45.301 --> 00:48:48.660
It's through minimum wages,
through financial regulation.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.740
It's through shaping
corporate governance.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.960
And I think we're waking
up to that reality.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.280
And I think it's actually a
real chance to unite people

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.280
across the political spectrum.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.410
I mean here, voters across
the political spectrum.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.620
Now, it is actually
sometimes a divisive issue,

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.420
as was true in Britain,
when the short-lived Labor

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.230
aspirant for the prime
minister's office, Ed Miliband,

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:15.690
endorsed the idea
of predistribution.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:20.190
We have only a few minutes left.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.715
But I just cannot help but
show you what happened.

00:49:22.715 --> 00:49:26.400
- Now normally, Mr. Speaker, at
this stage in the proceedings,

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.800
I say that the party opposite
hasn't got any plans.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.620
But on this occasion, I
can reassure the House

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.400
they have got some plans.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.680
They've got a new plan.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.100
It's called predistribution.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.970
I think what that means is that
you spend the money before you

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:43.724
actually get it.

00:49:43.724 --> 00:49:45.390
And I think you'll
find that's why we're

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.112
in the mess we're in right now.

00:49:47.112 --> 00:49:50.500
[CHEERS]

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.404
- Dear Mr. Speaker.

00:49:53.404 --> 00:49:55.350
Mr. Speaker.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.000
- That's Ed Miliband.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.590
- I'll tell him what it's about.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:49:59.890
It's an economy.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.580
It's an economy that doesn't
just work for a few at the top

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.420
but works for everyone else.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.360
And it's not about
a prime minister

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.588
who cuts taxes for millionaires
while raising taxes

00:50:12.588 --> 00:50:14.460
for everyone else.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.000
And perhaps when he
gets up to reply,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.660
he can answer the question
which he so far hasn't answered.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.660
Is he going to be a
beneficiary of the 50p tax cut?

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.780
- This is an economy
that's generated

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.550
a million new
private sector jobs.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:34.040
Now, I know he doesn't want to--

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.550
I know he doesn't want to
talk about predistribution.

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.920
But I've done a little
work, Mr. Speaker.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.040
I can tell him
about his new guru.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.422
His new guru is called--

00:50:44.422 --> 00:50:45.380
I'm not making this up.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:49.039
The man who invented
predistribution, he's called,

00:50:49.039 --> 00:50:49.580
he's called--

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.530
I'm not making this up.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:53.210
They don't want to hear.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.320
- Order.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.174
The House-- order.

00:50:56.174 --> 00:50:57.840
Members on both sides
need to calm down.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.860
Let's hear the prime
minister's answer.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.990
- I'm surprised they don't want
to hear from their new guru.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.360
He's called Mr. J. Hacker.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.140
And Mr. J. Hacker's
recommendation

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.830
is that we spend an
extra $200 billion

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.280
and borrow an extra $200
billion in this Parliament.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.480
That is his recommendation.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.630
But in the work I've done,
I've discovered his new book.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.170
It is published by
Princeton University Press,

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:26.420
and it's called The
Road to Nowhere.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.800
He doesn't need to read it.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.227
He's there already.

00:51:29.227 --> 00:51:33.203
[CHEERS]

00:51:33.203 --> 00:51:36.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.852
- So why is that so funny?

00:51:43.852 --> 00:51:45.810
It's not because they
know who Jacob Hacker is.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:49.800
It's because James Hacker is
the hapless member of Parliament

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.550
in Yes, Prime Minister, the
long-running British show.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.400
And the other thing
I would say is

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:00.017
that, as Meredith pointed
out, this was my first book.

00:52:00.017 --> 00:52:02.100
And I really wish that
David Cameron had mentioned

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.260
something more recent.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.960
But let me just say in
closing that I think

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.420
that we have to understand
that the root of this problem

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.884
is the kind of
extreme inequality

00:52:10.884 --> 00:52:12.300
that we have in
the United States.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.240
And unless we address
that problem, whatever

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.120
happens to Trump,
we're sadly going

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.200
to be back struggling with these
questions in the near future.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:20.954
Thank you.

00:52:20.954 --> 00:52:23.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:23.424 --> 00:52:28.910
Oh, and help me with
that book title, OK?
