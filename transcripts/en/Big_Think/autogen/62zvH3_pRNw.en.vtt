I think that all young people graduating

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
I think that all young people graduating
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.509
I think that all young people graduating
from say high school certainly need to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
from say high school certainly need to
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.970
from say high school certainly need to
understand the basic elements of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
understand the basic elements of
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090
understand the basic elements of
mathematics certainly through algebra

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
mathematics certainly through algebra
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.080
mathematics certainly through algebra
hopefully a bit beyond that understand

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
hopefully a bit beyond that understand
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.540
hopefully a bit beyond that understand
to some extent how it can be used to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
to some extent how it can be used to
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.509
to some extent how it can be used to
model the real world they need to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
model the real world they need to
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.519
model the real world they need to
understand and this is a critical issue

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
understand and this is a critical issue
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.120
understand and this is a critical issue
today they need to understand what

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130
today they need to understand what
 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.700
today they need to understand what
science is that it is a way of drawing

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
science is that it is a way of drawing
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.209
science is that it is a way of drawing
on hundreds of years of human

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
on hundreds of years of human
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.900

things to understanding what objective

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
things to understanding what objective
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.119
things to understanding what objective
data are and to take facts and put them

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
data are and to take facts and put them
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.170
data are and to take facts and put them
together and build them into theories

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
together and build them into theories
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.389
together and build them into theories
into understanding of how things work

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
into understanding of how things work
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969
into understanding of how things work
and then how that can be taken through

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
and then how that can be taken through
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550
and then how that can be taken through
the field of engineering to designing

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
the field of engineering to designing
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.160
the field of engineering to designing
and building things that extend their

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
and building things that extend their
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530
and building things that extend their
capabilities and enable us to do our

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
capabilities and enable us to do our
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510
capabilities and enable us to do our
jobs so they need to be able to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
jobs so they need to be able to
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820
jobs so they need to be able to
quantitatively reason they need to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
quantitatively reason they need to
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.580
quantitatively reason they need to
understand what science is and what the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
understand what science is and what the
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100
understand what science is and what the
scientific method is they need to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
scientific method is they need to
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.570
scientific method is they need to
understand that without without that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
understand that without without that
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850

go to China and Singapore and parts of
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.560
go to China and Singapore and parts of
India and so forth you'll find a lot of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
India and so forth you'll find a lot of
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.700

kids going very quickly fire in the
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.940
kids going very quickly fire in the
belly in these fields and ultimately

them do that we have to both compete and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
them do that we have to both compete and
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.810
them do that we have to both compete and
cooperate but our young people need to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
cooperate but our young people need to
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.179
cooperate but our young people need to
have the opportunities that the new age

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
have the opportunities that the new age
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.960
have the opportunities that the new age
is going to provide them

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970
is going to provide them
