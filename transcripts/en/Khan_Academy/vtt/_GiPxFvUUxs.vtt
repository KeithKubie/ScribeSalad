00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:01.847
- [Voiceover] Hello
Grammarians, hello Paige.

00:00:01.847 --> 00:00:02.680
- [Paige] Hi David.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.745
- [David] We're talking about possession

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:08.200
for names or words ending in the letter S.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.896
There's some confusion, I think,

00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:13.191
about what to do if you've got to make

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:16.809
someone's name possessive
if their name ends in an S,

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:19.142
for example, my friend Jess.

00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:21.048
If we're talking about Jess,

00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:23.015
and we're talking about
something that belongs to her,

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:24.348
like Jess's hat.

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.153
We know that there should
be an apostrophe in there,

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.703
but should there also be an S?

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.351
The answer is, yes.

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.111
There had been some debate
over this for some time,

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:37.639
but now, let me tell you, the
answer is yes, Jess's hat.

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.482
- [Paige] Right, it seems
like a lot of Esses in a row,

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:42.506
but it's important for understanding

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:43.652
what someone's trying to say.

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:47.796
- [David] Mm-hm, the same
thing happens regardless,

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:50.795
it can be for words ending in S,

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:52.204
like bus.

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:56.827
So if we said, "The air
conditioning on this bus is broken,"

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:59.864
We could say instead to make
it a little bit shorter,

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.650
"The bus's air conditioning is broken."

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.589
Again, we're just taking all
of that information about

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:09.966
the air conditioning
that belongs to the bus,

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.622
all of that is just sort of
being bundled up into this

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.334
apostrophe S.

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:17.999
It doesn't matter that bus
already ends with an S,

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.287
this works the same as any other word,

00:01:20.287 --> 00:01:21.990
we're just gonna say, "bus's."

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.816
If we wanted to talk
about the chili culture

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.199
of the state of Texas, for example,

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:29.798
we would say, "Texas's chili culture."

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.672
- [Paige] Yeah, so it's
exactly the same as any other

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:33.992
singular word even though it ends in S,

00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:36.487
you still need another S.

00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:39.654
- [David] So just add an apostrophe S,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.328
and if you didn't know, now you know.

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:44.783
That's how you form the possessive for

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:47.167
names or words ending in S.

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.110
You can learn anything, David out,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.943
- [Paige] Paige out.
