00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.580
We're asked, at which points
on the graph is f of x times

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.200
f prime of x equal to 0?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.130
So if I have the product of
two things and it's equal to 0,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.430
that tells us that at least
one of these two things

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.240
need to be equal to 0.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.210
So first of all, let's see are
there any points when f of x

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.520
is equal to 0?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.900
So we're plotting f of
x on the vertical axis.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.950
We could call this
graph right over here,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.780
we could say this is
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.440
So at any point, does the y
value of this curve equal 0?

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.360
So it's positive, positive,
positive, positive, positive,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.320
positive.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.995
But it is decreasing
right over here.

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:40.120
Well, it's decreasing here.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.040
Then it's increasing.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.220
Then it's decreasing.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.740
And it does get to
0 right over here,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.457
but that's not one of
the labeled points.

00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:49.540
And they want us to pick
one of the labeled points

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.070
or maybe even more than one
of these labeled points.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.480
So we're going to focus on where
f prime of x is equal to 0.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.070
And we just have
to remind ourselves

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.650
what f prime of x
even represents.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.360
f prime of x represents the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.590
at that value of x.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.810
So for example, f
prime of 0-- which

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.340
is the x value for this
point right over here--

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.310
is going to be some
negative value.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.360
It's the slope of
the tangent line.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.900
Similarly, f prime
of x, when x is

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289
equal to 4-- that's what's
going on right over here--

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.330
that's going to be the
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.469
That's going to be
a positive value.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.010
So if you look at
all of these, where

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.510
is the slope of
the tangent line 0?

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.050
And what does a 0
slope look like?

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.230
Well, it looks like
a horizontal line.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.875
So where is the slope of the
tangent line here horizontal?

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.500
Well, the only one
that jumps out at me

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.400
is point B right over here.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.630
It looks like the slope
of the tangent line

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.280
would indeed be horizontal
right over here.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.980
Or another way you could think
of it is the instantaneous rate

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.120
of change of the function,
right at x equals 2,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.790
looks like it's pretty
close to-- if this

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.010
is x equals 2-- looks like
it's pretty close to 0.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.690
So out of all of
the choices here,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.280
I would say only B looks like
the derivative at x equals 2.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.770
Or the slope of the tangent
line at B, it looks like it's 0.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.950
So I'll say B right over here.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.850
And then they had this kind of
crazy, wacky expression here. f

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.270
of x minus 6 over x.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.861
What is that greatest in value?

00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:28.110
And we have to interpret this.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.830
We have to think about what does
f of x minus 6 over x actually

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.770
mean?

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.780
Whenever I see
expressions like this,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.700
especially if I'm taking a
differential calculus class,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.660
I would say well,
this looks kind of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.890
like finding the slope
of a secant line.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.260
In fact, all of what we
know about derivatives

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.460
is finding the limiting value
of the slope of a secant line.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.940
And this looks
kind of like that,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.610
especially if at some point,
my y value is a 6 here.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.240
And this could be the
change in y value.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.350
And if the corresponding
x value is 0,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.680
then this would be f of
x minus 6 over x minus 0.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.390
So do I have 0, 6
on this curve here?

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.070
Well, sure.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:15.230
When x is equal to 0, we see
that f of x is equal to 6.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.590
So what this is right over
here-- let me rewrite this.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:33.615
This we could rewrite as f
of x minus 6 over x minus 0.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.270
So what is this?

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.380
What does this represent?

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.982
Well, this is equal
to the slope--

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:43.440
let me do some of
that color-- this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:57.760
is equal to the slope of the
secant line between the points,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.770
x, f of x, x, and whatever
the corresponding f of x is.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:11.130
And we could write it as 0,
f of 0 because we see f of 0

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.260
is equal to 6.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.000
This right over here is f of 0.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.149
In fact, let me just
write that as 6.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.500
And the point, 0, 6.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.439
So let's go through
each of these points

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.480
and think about what the
slope of the secant line

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.760
between those points are and
point A. This is essentially

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.095
the slope of the secant
line between some point x, f

00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:35.190
of x, and essentially point
A. So let's draw this out.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.030
So between A and B you have
a fairly negative slope.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.530
Remember we want to
find the largest slope.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.390
So here it's fairly negative.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.440
Between A and C,
it's less negative.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.780
Between A and D, it's
even less negative.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.840
It's still negative,
but it's less negative.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.040
And then between A and E, it
becomes more negative now.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.710
And then between A and F, it
becomes even more negative.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.810
So when is the slope of
the secant line between one

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.219
of these points
and A the greatest?

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.010
Or I guess we could
say the least negative?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.080
Because it seems like
they're always negative.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.530
It would be between
point D and A.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.790
So when is this
greatest in value?

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.070
Well, when we're
looking at point D.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.830
At point D, x is
equal to 6 and it

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.620
looks like f of x is like
5 and 1/2 or something.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.500
So this will turn into f of
6, which is 5 and 1/2 or maybe

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.470
it's even less than
that-- 5 and 1/3

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.360
or something, minus
6 over 6 minus 0.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.550
That's how we'll
maximize this value.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.343
This is the least negative
slope of the secant line.
