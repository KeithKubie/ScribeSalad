00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:02.891
TED-Ed team here.

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:03.999
As you know, we usually post

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.693
animated educator lessons,

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.788
but today we wanted to try something a little different,

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:10.315
and we need your help to figure out next steps.

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.059
We've recently learned that a large number

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.286
of students that use TED-Ed

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:15.480
want to know more about career options,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.311
and that they and the teachers and guidance counselors

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:18.652
that work with them need better tools

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.042
to make that happen.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.279
We've been busy trying to design

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.691
an interactive series to meet those needs,

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.085
and today we want to share three videos

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.707
that demo how the series could work.

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.473
Each video features four people

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:30.730
with four different careers

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.501
reading questions submitted by students.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.828
The answers to those questions

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:36.943
and follow-up questions can be explored

00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:40.336
choose-your-own-adventure style through annotations.

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:41.707
For the purposes of the demo,

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.646
we sourced a few questions from students

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:45.039
and recruited a few TED speakers

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.240
and other professionals to answer the questions,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.125
but those two things were done independently

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:50.050
of one another.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.311
The idea for the actual series

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:52.783
is that the next set of videos

00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:54.979
would only feature questions and people

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.645
suggested and voted up by you, the viewers.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:58.927
So, if you tell us that the next video

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.145
should undoubtedly feature an arachnologist,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:02.478
an album art creator,

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:03.657
a particle physicist,

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:04.480
and an engineer,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.059
all giving away their trade secrets for your benefit,

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:09.525
we'll try our best to make that happen.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.332
We think this could be a pretty fun series,

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:13.505
and we look forward to your feedback.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:14.864
Enjoy the demo!

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.479
Now for the story of you,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.694
the TED-Ed community,

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:22.554
your questions about potential careers,

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:24.838
and the TED speakers and working professionals

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.553
that you nominate to answer those questions.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.398
It's an interactive show.

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:32.327
Welcome to "Click Your Fortune."

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:37.711
"My name is Jennifer Indovina.

00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.873
I am a TED Fellow,

00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:40.887
but I'm also the CEO of my own company.

00:01:40.887 --> 00:01:42.442
It's called Ten Rate Technologies."

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:44.014
"My name is Daniel Suarez.

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.631
I'm currently a sci-fi thriller author.

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:48.492
Before that, I spent nearly 20 years

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:50.043
as a Senior Systems Analyst,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.143
building big systems for global companies."

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:54.368
"Francis de los Reyes.

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:56.468
I am a professor of environmental engineering

00:01:56.468 --> 00:01:58.370
at North Carolina State University.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.514
I do research on leading-edge technologies

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:02.874
for waste water treatment

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:05.800
as well as MOLO class technologies

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.374
for sanitation in the developing world."

00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:11.322
"I'm Deena Gornick, and I'm an executive coach.

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:13.058
And what that means is that I work

00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:16.271
with women and men in business,

00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:19.101
and I help them get out of their own way

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.689
to get what they want out of their careers

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.875
and out of their lives."

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:25.693
Each professional will now draw one of your questions

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.873
from the fortune cookie jar.

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:30.200
You can choose your own path from there.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.932

00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:36.643
other professionals,

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:37.882
and other professions

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:40.478
to be featured in future videos.

00:02:40.478 --> 00:02:41.695
Let's see what fortunes await

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.960
this batch of volunteers.

00:02:44.637 --> 00:02:46.883
"What's the worst job you've ever had?"

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:50.532
"How did you find the job that you currently have?"

00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:51.974
"What was a moment in time

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:54.768
that you felt most inspired?"

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:59.793
"How has the world changed since you started work?"

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:05.418
You may now click any fortune

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.594
to see the question

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:08.379
and a handful of follow-up questions

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.255
explored by each speaker.
