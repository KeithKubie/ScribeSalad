WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.940
With all this complexity, you might ask, why

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.200
don't I just set the viewport width to 760

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.160
pixels? The width of that column of text I showed you in the dev tools, and call

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.100
it a day. Is it because that would be too easy? Or because, then my site would

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.260
scale the same layout across all devices? Or

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.160
because the fonts would be wrong in some way?
