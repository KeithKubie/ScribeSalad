[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.240
PETER DIAMANDIS: Thank you,
Jack, a force of nature here.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.570
So, a pleasure to be here.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.150
I want to just actually tee up
a bunch of quick conversations

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.690
that we can carry to our
fireside chat and conversation

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.050
with you.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.380
So first of all,
I'm clear that we're

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.300
alive during the most
extraordinary time

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.980
ever in human history.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.250
There's never been a better time
to be alive, other than perhaps

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.530
tomorrow.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.400
We're in a time
where each of us have

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.500
more power than nation-states
had, heads of industries had,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.320
just decades or a century ago.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.290
We forget how
amazing the world is.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.660
We forget that 100 years ago,
in 1918, in that one year

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.640
alone, 50 million people
died from the Spanish flu.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.146
20-odd million people died
from World War I. Scale that

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.770
to today's population,
you'd be talking

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.228
about a quarter of
a billion people

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:06.980
that would have
passed away this year.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.030
So we forget, despite all
of the negative news--

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.350
what I call the Crisis
News Network and so forth--

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.310
we're still living
in an amazing time.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.140
It's also true that
I think none of us

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.870
really understand how fast
the world is changing.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.210
We're living in a world where
technologies across the board

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.890
are growing exponentially.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.830
Computation, sensors, networks,
AI, robotics, 3D printing,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.560
synthetic biology, AR, VR, block
chain-- all those technologies

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.450
are themselves accelerating.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.700
But it's the combination
of two, three, or four

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.450
of those together that
are accelerating things.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.820
Add to that the notion
that in the next six years,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.340
we're going from 3.8 billion
people connected on planet

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.030
Earth last year at the end
of 2017 to 8 billion people

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.660
connected.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.200
We're adding 4 billion new minds
into the global conversation

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.910
that have never
been there before.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.912
And that's a massive
empowerment for acceleration.

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:01.370
Add to that the
fact that we've got

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.270
more capital available,
flowing, than ever before.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.009
We hit all-time highs in
venture fund, seed funding,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.580
crowdfunding, ICOs,
sovereign investments.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.980
So more capital flowing
at the same time

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.560
that all the technology that
we're using to make stuff

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.010
happen is demonetizing
faster than ever before.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.000
The human genome was sequenced
for $100 million in 2001.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.480
Today it's circa $500.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.240
Illumina is projecting
$100 in one hour,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.310
as is the Beijing
Genome Institute.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.230
So there's more money.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.000
Everything we need
to do is cheaper.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.810
Look at Google Cloud and
computational capabilities.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.110
And so more people, more
money, cheaper stuff,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.890
more experimentation.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800
And what it means
is we're entering

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.130
a period of hyper-acceleration.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.160
As I think about how
fast the world is going,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.580
it's not slowing down.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030
And in fact, it's
an acceleration

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.160
of the acceleration
that we're hitting.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.170
So that makes for an
amazing, amazing future.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.400
And one of the things that I
focus on a lot is the notion

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.490
that there is no
problem we cannot solve.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.570
And I'm clear that the right
combination of technology,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.490
talent, and treasure
can take on any problem.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.600
And my message to a lot
of people around the world

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.880
is you're now empowered.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.830
If you are sick and
tired about a problem

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.120
or you're inspired to
solve something, you can.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.190
It's a matter of do
you give yourself

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.320
permission to be that
audacious and go do it?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.580
100 years ago, the only people
could actually solve a problem

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.110
at any scale were
the nation-states

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.050
or were the robber barons,
the industrialists.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.680
And even all they could do
was unleash monetary policies

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.140
or troops or so forth.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.170
Today, I just want you
to feel and understand

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.900
how empowered you are to find
a problem and solve a problem.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.490
That's what gives me hope, that
entrepreneurs by definition

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.211
are individuals who find
problems and solve problems.

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.960
And there are more and
more entrepreneurs,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.334
with more and more data, with
more and more computational

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:10.790
power, with more and
more access to capital,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.910
solving more and more problems.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.800
So I want to give you that
perspective for a moment.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.876
Another area I'm
excited about, I

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:21.500
serve as founder and
executive chairman

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.510
of the XPRIZE Foundation.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.050
Jack is-- for a while now,
since the earliest days--

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.620
one of my trustees.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.985
And so we focus on what are the
world's biggest problems that

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:35.650
are not being solved?

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.870
And how do we set a
very clear objective

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.795
and say, I don't
care who you are

00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:41.920
or where you went to school,
what you've ever done,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.390
if you solve this problem and
hit these metrics, you win.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.410
And to the very first XPRIZE
was for my 9-year-old childhood

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.370
passion of spaceflight.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.500
I gave up on NASA being the
way I was going to go to space.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.950
I did the math, and your
chance are-- right, Mark?--

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.310
one in 1,000 of being
a NASA astronaut.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.680
I had a better chance of
becoming an NBA all-star at 5'

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.200
5" than I did a NASA astronaut.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.410
And so when I read
that Lindbergh in 1927

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.170
crossed the Atlantic
to win a $25,000 prize

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.020
and looked at the
numbers, nine teams

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.920
spent $400,000 trying to
win this $25,000 prize.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.880
And Raymond Orteig spent
nothing on the losers, only paid

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.750
the winner.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.150
And Lindbergh was the most
unlikely guy to do it.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.740
So I said, OK, I'm going to
create a prize for spaceflight.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.440
It's going to be a
$10 million prize.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.740
$10 million was enough money
to inspire the entrepreneurs,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.810
but not the Airbus, the
Boeing, the Lockheed.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.600
I didn't want the large
players just buying the prize.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.030
I wanted true innovation.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.152
That $10 million prize
inspired 26 teams

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:44.860
around the world, who
spent $100 million.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.840
They're all optimists.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.790
And Burt Rutan, backed by
Paul Allen, who we just lost,

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.080
funded that prize development
and won it with SpaceShip One.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.510
Richard Branson came in
and bought the rights

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.550
to create Virgin Galactic.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.330
Richard has publicly announced
he expects a flight to space

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.100
approximately this month.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.980
So fingers crossed
we'll see something.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.980
There's-- what?-- three
weeks left in the month,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.320
or thereabouts.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.720
And then we, on the heels of
that, created an amazing board.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.320
Very proud that we've had as
board members and benefactors

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.440
Larry and Sergey
and Eric and Ann

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.340
and a multitude of Googlers
in the earliest days.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.490
And folks like Elon Musk and
Jim Cameron and Ratan Tata.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.582
And so we've launched
a bunch of prizes.

00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:37.790
I'm going to give you a few
that are active right now

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.690
just for fun.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.760
Elon funded a Global
Learning XPRIZE.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.070
And we asked teams,
can you build

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.910
a piece of Android
software that could

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.280
take a child in the
middle of no place

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.800
from illiteracy to reading,
writing, and numeracy

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.120
in under 18 months?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.700
And so Sundar very kindly
gave us 5,000 Android tablets.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.060
With the World Food Programme,
we went into Tanzania,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.210
where we are right now.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.780
We interviewed
hundreds of villages.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.550
And we found 2,500 kids who
knew no Swahili and no English

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.250
and put the tablets
in their hands.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.030
We had 800 teams
enter the competition.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.590
141-ish delivered software.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.180
We narrowed that
to five finalists.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.581
Those five finalists are in 500
tablets each in the villages

00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:26.080
right now.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.780
We're measuring the impact
on the child, the family,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.220
and the village.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.760
And then we're going to open
source the winning software.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.420
The goal would be that this
becomes part of Android kernel,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.270
for example, and the notion that
every time an Android device

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.740
is built, it's a teacher.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.995
We're building a
billion teachers a year.

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:48.320
We had to go in those villages
and set up power there.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.980
So that's one
XPRIZE we're doing.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.340
One that we just awarded is
called the Water Abundance

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.260
XPRIZE.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.140
Half the disease
burden on planet Earth

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.830
is due to unclean
drinking water.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:05.014
And so we asked the team,
could you pull water out

00:08:05.014 --> 00:08:07.180
of the atmosphere-- there
are quadrillions of liters

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.250
of water in the atmosphere.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.090
When it condenses on
particles, we call it rain.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.090
And could you pull the water
out of the atmosphere, 2,000

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.880
liters, for under
$0.02 per liter

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.960
from all renewable energy?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.880
And we just awarded the
winner of that competition

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.040
about a month ago.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.990
I just came back from Greece.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.856
And we have an XPRIZE
going on right now

00:08:33.856 --> 00:08:35.679
on mapping the ocean floor.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.659
We've mapped less than
5% of the ocean floor.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.909
The physics of saltwater
makes it very difficult.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.690
And so we said, to
win this prize--

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.960
it's $7 million put up
by Shell and by NOAA--

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.330
you've got to build an
autonomous vehicle that

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.650
can launch from land, go
out some distance, tens

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.000
of kilometers, into
the ocean, then go down

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.660
4,000 meters and map 250
square kilometers in 24

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.230
hours on its own, return,
and provide the data.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.860
So fully autonomous,
large-scale mapping.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.340
We're down to five finalists
that are in Greece right now,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.010
off the coast of the mainland.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.440
And I met two of the five teams.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.520
One team is a group
of 13 academics

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.174
and grad students from Germany.

00:09:23.174 --> 00:09:25.090
Another team is two
people out of Switzerland.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.530
Another team is out of Japan.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.030
And it's amazing
what they're doing.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.332
It's transforming what's
possible in the ocean.

00:09:31.332 --> 00:09:33.040
One of my favorite
XPRIZEs going on right

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.170
now is called the Avatar XPRIZE.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.380
And we asked teams to
build a robotic avatar.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.900
So a robot-- so
imagine I'm not here.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.960
I'm back in Santa
Monica, where I live.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.060
And at home, I've
got on a pair of VR

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.950
goggles and a haptic suit.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.280
And as I'm moving around,
the robot's moving around.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.363
As I'm looking at you, the
robot's looking at you.

00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:58.420
So it's basically a
remote avatar telepresence

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.290
to allow you to go
and solve a problem,

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.220
do a medical diagnostic, go into
a disaster zone, and so forth.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.380
We've had over 400 teams
entering that competition.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.660
So a lot of XPRIZEs going on.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.750
We can dive into more
when Jack and I talk

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.310
or you have your questions.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.340
Another area I'm passionate
about is human longevity.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.030
I'm clear we're going to be able
to add 10, 20, potentially 30

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.820
healthy years in
everyone's life.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.880
Google's got a massive
investment in Calico.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.430
Besides Calico,
there is a multitude

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.785
of different companies
going on right now.

00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:36.070
A company down in
San Diego, Samumed,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.590
that's manipulating
Wnt pathways, which

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.540
is a communication pathway.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.300
That's a $13 billion
private company

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.130
because their results
are extraordinary.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.110
They're in phase
2 clinical trials

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.650
on a multitude of
different anti-cancer,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.640
hair growth, anti-wrinkles,
osteogenesis.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.130
I mean, it's incredible
what they're doing.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.860
You see companies like
Unity Biosciences, which

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.600
are working on
senolytic medicines

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.700
to kill senile cells, cells
that have grown to the Hayflick

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.830
limit and have
stopped replicating

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.020
and then are becoming
inflammatory agents.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.290
If you can kill those cells
and make room for new cells

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.810
to generate from
endogenous stem cells,

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:23.050
the organism regenerates and
you get an extended lifespan.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.710
Another-- I have two companies
in the longevity business.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.580
One is in the stem cell
business, called Celularity.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.800
We have the world's
largest bank of placentas.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.710
Turns out you can think of
the placenta as the 3D printer

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.570
that manufactures the baby.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.990
And that placenta is the
richest source of stem cells.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.600
And so those stem
cells, delivered back

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.070
to an aging organism, can
extend life 30-plus percent.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.550
As we age, our stem cells in our
bodies in all the compartments

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.130
fall off very rapidly over time.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.870
And so one of the
reasons for aging

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.270
is we lose the ability
to regenerate ourselves,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.590
to repair ourselves.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.550
Or the stem cells in our body,
they will drop 100x to 1,000x

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.780
in population.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.510
But they undergo epigenetic
changes, mutations,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.480
and so forth, and they're not
capable as they were before.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.340
So stem cell replenishment
is another area.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:24.100
One fun one that I co-founded
called Human Longevity,

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.840
we're down in San Diego.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.420
We'll be opening
around the country.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.980
And what Human Longevity does
is you come in for three hours,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.840
we sequence your genome--
all 3.2 billion letters.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.490
We do a 30x sequencing on you.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.250
We sequence your microbiome.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.880
We look at your metabolome,
basically the top

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.590
100-plus proteins and
chemicals and small molecules

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.700
in your bloodstream.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.880
We do a full body MRI,
head to toe, a brain MRI,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.300
brain vasculature,
coronary CT, lung CT.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.790
And then we feed about
150 gigabytes of data

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.040
into our system to
determine two things.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.460
Number one, is there anything
going on inside your body

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.680
right now that you
should know about?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.290
And number two, based
upon your genetics,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.590
what are you likely to die from,
and how do you find it before?

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.350
So the numbers are
pretty telling.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.445
The price point
initially for HLI--

00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:18.820
what's called the
health nucleus,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.921
the facility-- was $25,000.

00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:21.670
So it's not cheap.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.540
All these people who came
were very well-to-do patients,

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.420
so to speak.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.120
The price has dropped
down to $5,000 and $3,000

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.140
for subsequent visits.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.950
But still, in 2%--

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.380
so we're in a room
of roughly 100.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.470
Two of you have a brain
or aortic aneurysm

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.660
you don't know about,
which is kind of shocking.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.470
2%-- and this is for populations
older than you are here, for 50

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.606
and older--

00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:52.420
have a high-grade cancer tumor.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.100
3.4% have a significant cardiac
condition-- atrial fibrillation

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.360
or a bundle branch
block or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.070
And we find 14% of the
people who come through

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.410
have significant findings they
take action on immediately.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.830
So the fact of the matter
is we're all optimists.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.200
We think everything's
fine in our body.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.540
And then, until you go to
the hospital, at which point

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.580
you're like, oh shit.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.050
I didn't know that.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.079
But I'm a pilot.

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:19.120
I fly a couple of planes.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.120
Before I take off, make sure
everything's in the green.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.770
But for most of us,
we don't know that.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.270
Eventually we'll
all have wearables.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.820
We were talking about, I
have my Oura ring here,

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.180
with about 14, 15
different sensors that

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.060
measure my pulse wave form, my
temperature, my acceleration,

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.640
and give me sleep data.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.230
I've got my Apple Watch.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:43.150
I've got a small little RFID
chip implanted over here.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.150
It's got my business card on it.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.920
Completely useless,
but eventually it'll

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.570
be something useful.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.670
But we'll all have
this data uploaded

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.494
to give us minute by
minute how are we doing.

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:55.910
And the goal--
people say, I don't

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.040
want to know if
anything's wrong with me.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.539
Bullshit.

00:14:57.539 --> 00:14:58.950
Of course you want to know.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.080
And you want to solve it right
then at the very beginning,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.684
when it's most solvable.

00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:06.100
So it's going from sick care,
which is what is right now--

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.050
we take care of you
after you're sick--

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.620
to health care, to find
anything at stage zero.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.660
So I'll close.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.470
Singularity University,
Ray and I, 10 years ago--

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.760
what month are we in?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.450
10 years ago, two
months ago, we announced

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.160
Singularity University.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.680
I was reading Ray's book,
"The Singularity Is Near,"

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.520
and I said, there's no place
in the world you can go--

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.645
not Harvard, not MIT, not
Stanford, not [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:32.560
or whatever it might
be-- that you can go

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.420
and actually get
an overview of all

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.130
the exponential technologies
and understand what they're

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.540
able to do in convergence.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.840
So we created a
graduate program.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.010
It's now called the
Global Startup Program.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.670
Our goal is 1,000
start-ups a year.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.020
And then we started executive
programs, six-day programs

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.420
where executives come
in and we give them

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.270
an overview of what's going
on and all the technologies

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.130
and how they're converging.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:05.120
And it's really about
awareness and education.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.830
But we're growing a good clip
of 30% to 50% year on year.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.750
So I'll pause there and
bring in the maestro.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.061
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:19.910
JACK HIDARY: Thanks, Peter.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.702
Great opening talk.

00:16:20.702 --> 00:16:21.826
PETER DIAMANDIS: Thank you.

00:16:21.826 --> 00:16:23.720
JACK HIDARY: Let's
start with connectivity.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.760
1969, ARPANET.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.300
It's taken 50 years since
then to get 3 billion,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.890
just about 40%, of
the world connected.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.330
4 billion people not yet
connected to the internet,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.860
to everything that in this
room we work on, we build on,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.240
we engage in, and other
companies up and down

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.770
Silicon Valley and
around the world.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.390
Talk to us about a world--

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.010
the numbers
indicate, not from us

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.030
but from third-party sources,
that, well, it took 50 years

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.230
to get to 3 billion.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.776
We might get the
next 3 billion--

00:16:52.776 --> 00:16:54.650
that is, the doubling
of the number of people

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.030
on the internet-- in about
within six, maybe seven years.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.660
So very, very soon.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.700
Paint us a picture of
that world, a world

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.619
where suddenly, huge swaths
of countries and others

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.359
that are not online
today suddenly become

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.740
part of not just the
information flow,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.940
but also the global economy--
buying, selling, putting stuff

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.569
into markets.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.068
Talk to us about
that kind of world.

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:17.910
PETER DIAMANDIS: Great question.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.510
So first of all, the
layers of connectivity

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.680
that are coming online.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.300
And 5G is probably one of the
biggest, incredible explosions

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.829
coming online.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.470
We'll see test
deployments in 2019

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.620
and really full deployments
in 2020 and onward.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.392
And 10 gigabit
connection speeds means

00:17:36.392 --> 00:17:38.600
you're downloading a movie
in a fraction of a second.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.390
You take your new LG TV
set, you put it on the wall,

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.350
you plug in the
power, and it's got

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.130
500 channels all of a sudden.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.050
So 5G is going to spread
like kudzu on the planet.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.200
But on top of that,
obviously, Loon

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.780
has now been spun out
as its own company.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.980
You've got $1.2 billion
of money from Masa Son

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.800
at SoftBank backing OneWeb.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.200
Then you've got Elon, who
has gotten FCC permission

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.110
for 11,000 satellites,
a 4,000-satellite layer

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.760
and a 7,000-satellite layer
called Spacelink, right?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.020
Starlink.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.620
Which is incredible.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.360
And then you've got
terabit Boeing satellites

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.440
in a MEO orbit.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.199
So we're basically covering the
entire planet with bandwidth.

00:18:29.199 --> 00:18:30.740
And then, on top of
that, we're going

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.080
to all have all of
these microcells

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.240
on non-licensed bands.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.640
I think eventually we're all
going to be dribbling bits

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.630
all the time.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.010
And our AI is going to
be negotiating prices

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.650
on different mechanisms.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.020
JACK HIDARY: Now that sounds
like a great feature, dribbling

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.410
bits.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:45.960
PETER DIAMANDIS: Dribbling bits.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.820
We're all dribbling bits.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.500
We're all going to
be dribbling bits.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.833
I think we're all going to
have our own personal version

00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:52.550
of JARVIS eventually.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.360
Google Now and Echo and
Siri are all versions

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.450
of that, which you
give permission

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.350
to have access to everything--
your email, your conversations,

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.190
your microbiome,
your bloodstream.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.020
And it's transacting constantly.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.860
But so 8 billion
people potentially

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.720
connected in the next six
years as the price comes down.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.050
Now the question is can
they afford these devices?

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.920
So can the poorest people in
the world afford those devices?

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.740
So I've seen, years ago,
engineering drawings

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.590
for a $20 cell phone
or a $20 tablet.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.740
There is a price point at
which the price of the device

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.460
gets so cheap that Google
is going to give them away

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.180
and Amazon is going to give
them away to get the traffic,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.490
to get the data, to
get the transactions.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.940
So I think we are
heading very quickly

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.590
towards a world of
8 billion people

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.970
that are digitally connected.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.830
And if you do the math, I
mean, I'm screaming this

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.480
from the rooftops,
and no one's talking

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.970
about this, which drives
me nuts, because four

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.510
billion new people connected.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.640
And if they're just transacting,
on the average, $10 a day,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.760
that's tens of
trillions of dollars

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.810
flowing into the global economy
that no one is talking about.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:18.020
And the markets-- all of these
4 billion digital newbies

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.740
are all going to want insurance
and banking and education

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.760
and health care.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.350
JACK HIDARY: They're also going
to be creating content, right?

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.110
PETER DIAMANDIS: They're
going to be creating content.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.526
JACK HIDARY: So
right now, there's

00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:28.575
a certain number of
dominant players creating

00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:29.450
a lot of the content.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.116
And also, of course,
there's distributed

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:32.720
content and
crowd-sourced content.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.235
But 4 billion people are not
yet part of that conversation.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.610
PETER DIAMANDIS:
And what's going

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.370
to happen is they'll
generate content,

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.850
they'll generate revenue.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.020
But they're also going
to demand these services

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.340
at de minimis, freemium prices.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.620
And I talk to insurance
companies and banks,

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.735
and I say, listen,
this is coming.

00:20:53.735 --> 00:20:55.640
They say, but that's
not my marketplace.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.410
So fine, it's not your
marketplace today.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.580
But some entrepreneur within
50 kilometers of ground zero

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.070
here is working on
delivering value

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.410
to those individuals with
a new business model.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.150
And then when it
starts working, they'll

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.520
bring it back to
New York and Chicago

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.649
and eat your lunch there.

00:21:11.649 --> 00:21:12.440
JACK HIDARY: Great.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.660
Let's switch gears, because
we have a limited time.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.090
Let's go-- you
opened with genomics.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.230
The first genome sequence,
Craig Venter's, as you know,

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.980
was about $3 billion, went
down to $100 million, hit

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.691
$1,000, now about $500.

00:21:24.691 --> 00:21:26.190
And as you mentioned,
probably we're

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.430
on the way to $100 or even less.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.020
And of course, the
analysis with that

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.910
is as important as
the sequencing itself.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.840
And that's starting to ramp up
the bioinformatics around it.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.030
Estimates are that
right now, in total--

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.010
putting aside smaller
genomic tests,

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.110
but in terms of whole
genome sequencing--

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.020
there maybe are a
few hundred thousand,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.920
maximum a million
people, who maybe have--

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.900
out of 7-plus billion people.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.030
When do we get to a
critical mass that

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.720
helps us understand the
significance of billions

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.600
of those base pairs that
we don't understand yet

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.890
the sequence significance of?

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.270
In other words, we have a lot of
good sense about the usual 500

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.790
that are cancer drivers,
that are oncogenes.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.910
We don't have a good sense
of literally billions-plus

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.820
of some of those base
pairs in sequence.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.530
Tell us about the
critical mass we

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.870
need to start to
understand the sample size

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.670
that we need to really
draw conclusions.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.250
PETER DIAMANDIS: So we're
getting amazing results

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.860
with tens of thousands
right now at HLI.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.695
I can't state this stuff
until it's published.

00:22:27.695 --> 00:22:32.040
But traditionally we
talk about the exome,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.340
the part of the genome
that codes for proteins.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.290
And yes, it has been
euphemistically called

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.700
junk DNA.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.080
But it's not junk DNA.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.340
None of it's junk DNA.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.180
It's all, in some way,
structural or coding or control

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:45.720
segments.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.090
And it's interesting
that as you look

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.920
at a large-enough
population, you

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.570
start to say, listen, these
segments of DNA are protective.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.080
Any mutation here is
lethal to the person.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.990
So we start to
discover by elimination

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.500
and by subtraction fascinating
parts of the genome that

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.790
are worth looking at.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.880
And the other thing I might just
say is it's the correlation.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.860
What was real exciting
is the correlation

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.790
between genome and then rich
phenotypic data, when we've

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.030
got your genome and then
we have full-body MRI

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.090
and coronary and heart CT
and metabolome and so forth.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.820
Then you start to
really correlate, aha,

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.829
that's what this does.

00:23:24.829 --> 00:23:25.620
JACK HIDARY: Right.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.060
And I was going to
get to methylation.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.770
Right now, genome
sequence is coming down.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.360
But the ability to
get to epigenetics,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.332
in terms of methyl
groups, things like that,

00:23:32.332 --> 00:23:34.290
talk to us about all the
other rich information

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.430
that's necessary to really
draw those conclusions.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.480
PETER DIAMANDIS: So I think
one of the things that is true

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.940
is this next decade
is going to be

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.220
just discovery after discovery.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.239
And I think AI is going
to play the most--

00:23:47.239 --> 00:23:49.530
is the only way we're going
to make sense of all of it,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.800
the amount of data
that's coming out.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.340
And I remember when I was
in medical school, what

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.080
got me on this path of--

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.510
one of my massively
transformative purposes

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.520
is making 100 years
old when you're 60.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.400
How do we have at 100 the
cognition, the aesthetics,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.260
mobility that we had at 60?

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.050
I remember watching a TV
show on long-lived sea life,

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:14.430
that some whales could
live hundreds of years.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.290
Sharks could live
400 or 500 years.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.060
Turtles could 600, 700 years.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.030
And I was like, if
they can, why can't we?

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.359
It's either a software
problem or a hardware problem.

00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:24.900
JACK HIDARY: Or we
need to swim more.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.941
PETER DIAMANDIS: We have
to be in the water more,

00:24:26.941 --> 00:24:28.817
cool our body temperatures down.

00:24:28.817 --> 00:24:30.900
But I really think we're
going to start to unravel

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.100
that and understand it.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.308
JACK HIDARY: And let's jump
to another area of health

00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:35.400
care, which is our brains.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.316
You mentioned that we're
going to live longer,

00:24:37.316 --> 00:24:40.090
and it's already happening
in a number of countries.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.810
But that also now is
revealing greater populations

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.140
with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
neurological diseases.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.190
We've had a good handle so
far on cardiac diseases.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.310
Morbidity from cardiac
has actually come down.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.300
Diabetes is on the rise, but
there's some hopes there.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.250
But talk about the
neurological diseases.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.390
PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah, so
we have cardiac conditions

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:04.840
in our 50s and 60s.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.440
We have cancers in
our 60s and 70s.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.290
And we have neurological
disease in our 70s and 80s.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.620
And the fact of the matter
is just for context--

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.286
JACK HIDARY: Now
that's a bright future.

00:25:14.286 --> 00:25:15.180
I like that.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.055
PETER DIAMANDIS: Until
you prevent it, right?

00:25:17.055 --> 00:25:19.200
Life is short until you
extend it, and so forth.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.701
But the human body was never
intended to live past age 30.

00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:26.700
I mean, just to put it
on the table here, right?

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.550
You would go into
puberty at age 13.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.390
You'd have a baby.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.160
And then by the
time you were 26,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.990
your baby was having a baby.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.300
And back then,
100,000 years ago,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.970
before Whole Foods and
McDonald's was around,

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.179
when food was scarce,
the last thing

00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:43.720
you wanted to do
for the selfish gene

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.150
was to take the money out of
your grandchildren's mouths

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.590
and now compete with them.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.173
So you would do the best thing
you could-- give your bits back

00:25:51.173 --> 00:25:52.130
to the environment.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.580
But of course,
that's changed now.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.440
And we're beginning
to extend life.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.040
And as we extend life,
we run into new problems.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.570
There is amazing drugs in phase
2 clinical trials right now.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.300
We're seeing impact from
senolytic medicines.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.390
We're seeing impacts from
Wnt pathway manipulations

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:18.240
on cancers and Alzheimer's.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.480
I think one of the areas that
is super-exciting as well

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.120
is the whole field of
brain computer interface.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.370
My last count, there's
probably $1 billion a year

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.780
going into interfacing your
neocortex with the cloud

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.130
in buildings not far from here.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.070
And so at the end
of the day, we're

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.640
going to learn a lot about how
the brain works and the root

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.645
causes of these diseases, as
we have over and over again.

00:26:41.645 --> 00:26:43.770
But a lot of it's going to
come because our ability

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.130
to sense and gather data
and analyze the data

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:53.574
is billions, trillions of
times better than ever.

00:26:53.574 --> 00:26:56.115
JACK HIDARY: Let's turn to one
of your first passions, space.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.260
Let's talk about
really space travel.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.170
We hear from Branson
that it may be imminent.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.000
Virgin Galactic may be
launching imminently

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.992
with paying customers.

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.700
And there's been a
long line of thousands

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.090
of people putting their bets
in terms of their down payments

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.665
on getting a seat on that ride,
which it's great to see that.

00:27:15.665 --> 00:27:17.790
PETER DIAMANDIS: Any Virgin
Galactic ticket holders

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.670
here in the audience,
out of curiosity?

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.219
I am.

00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:22.510
Lots of customers, potentially.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.384
JACK HIDARY: Exactly.

00:27:23.384 --> 00:27:26.140
PETER DIAMANDIS: I'll
take checks later.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.980
JACK HIDARY: But talk to us
about what you see as the odds

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.990
that we're going to be
a multiplanet species

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.950
within, say, 10 years,
20 years, 50 years.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.300
We obviously have the
potential, the technology.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.450
I don't think there's
doubt that we can actually

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.140
get to another planet now.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.250
But talk to us about the
will and the mobilization

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:45.820
to make that happen.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.550
PETER DIAMANDIS: So probably
the single most important driver

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:57.540
that's making that happen is the
individual, passionate actor,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.310
in this case in the form of Elon
Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.490
Branson and-- just passed--

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.505
Paul Allen.

00:28:06.505 --> 00:28:07.380
And it's interesting.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.244
A lot of these individuals
grew up-- in the case of Jeff,

00:28:10.244 --> 00:28:12.660
who I've known for 35 years,
since the early days of SEDS.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.835
I was a founder of SEDS, and
Jeff ran the Princeton chapter.

00:28:17.835 --> 00:28:20.130
And I remember meeting Jeff
after he started Amazon.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.660
I said, what are you doing
with this Amazon thing?

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.618
He goes, well, I'm going
to make a lot of money

00:28:24.618 --> 00:28:25.900
there and spend it on space.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.400
No shit.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.090
Really.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.510
And Elon's committed-- said
I will spend all his money

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.920
on opening up space.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.860
Both of them are that committed.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.600
And I think a lot
of it was those

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.770
who were born during the Apollo
and shuttle era got enamored

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.244
with this vision, from "Star
Wars" and "Star Trek" and all

00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:44.910
of those things.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.940
And then NASA never implemented.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.760
It never paid off on the deal.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.430
And so now you've got
individuals saying,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.040
we'll do it.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.250
I've known Elon since he
sold PayPal and watched

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.910
what he did with SpaceX,
with the Falcon 1

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.560
and 1e and Falcon 9 and Heavy.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.300
And I would never
bet against him.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.860
He is dead set on
making that happen.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.680
And I think he will.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.000
He set a target at landing in
2024 on the Martian surface.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.120
OK, listen, I'll give
him an extra four years.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.730
But could he get there by 2028?

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.750
I would bet on him over
any government, hands down.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.760
And then Jeff is sort of
the tortoise in the race.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.500
He's committed $1
billion a year.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.860
And he's just--
that is his endgame.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.090
And so I think we're
going to do it.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.980
I think it's going
to be a function of--

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.320
I don't think governments
can take the risks anymore

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.410
that were inherent in the
early Apollo program days.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.750
It's way too-- failure is
not an option for them,

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.870
and therefore risk
is no option either.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.670
But individuals can say,
I'm going to do this.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:06.510
I mean, there is a Tesla
on a Earth asteroid.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.830
That's insane.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.940
I mean, just like, game over.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.690
Proof point.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.427
JACK HIDARY: Yeah.

00:30:12.427 --> 00:30:14.260
You mention a number
of great entrepreneurs,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.176
and we can see how they're
changing the world.

00:30:16.176 --> 00:30:17.907
So let's talk about
entrepreneurship now.

00:30:17.907 --> 00:30:20.490
Here in Silicon Valley, we know
the power of entrepreneurship.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:20.990
We see it.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.592
We feel it.

00:30:21.592 --> 00:30:23.300
There's other key
entrepreneurial centers

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.120
around the world.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.450
But it's not spread
evenly enough yet.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.420
It's not as inclusive as it
needs to be and could be.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.160
And not only is
that the case, we're

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.080
missing out on the
talents of many

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.240
of those people from
diverse backgrounds

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.650
that could be part of
the entrepreneurial lift

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.680
and journey.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.570
What are your thoughts around
how to change that game?

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.480
PETER DIAMANDIS: So
first of all, we're

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:51.110
dematerializing, democratizing,
and demonetizing all the tools

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.090
for entrepreneurship.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.060
So it used to be that
to be an entrepreneur,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.080
you needed to have
computational power.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.430
You needed to have an
ethernet cable or a modem plug

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.290
or whatever.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.940
And you needed to have--

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.090
now, obviously with
Google Cloud and AWS,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.840
you have all the
computational power you want.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.350
The number is by
2023, I believe,

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.560
there'll be $300 billion
available in crowdfunding,

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.070
which means anyone around
the world with a good idea

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.710
can launch a crowdfunding
campaign to get the capital.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.130
So capital becomes
less of a restriction.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.780
Obviously, Google makes the
world's information available.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.210
So what used to be
scarce resources--

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.730
I mean, bandwidth, I
remember back in 2001,

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.370
I had a stealth company
called Blastoff.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.250
My number-one expense
was Akamai on bandwidth

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.310
to send video to people.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.360
It was ridiculous.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.390
And now it's nothing.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.815
So literally everything
you need to be

00:31:51.815 --> 00:31:54.530
to create an
entrepreneurial startup

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:59.630
is becoming available globally
at lower and lower costs.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:04.430
And so it's now, the
number-one scarce resource

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.880
that I see in entrepreneurship
around the world is mindset.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.950
So I was just in Greece
at an SU Athens summit,

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.850
meeting there with heads of the
country and the entrepreneurs.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.700
And they were saying,
what do we need to do

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.530
to become more innovative?

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.990
It's a country of
10 million people.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:28.850
It's like one Google-size
success story dwarfs

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.690
the budget of the country.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:34.940
So it's like you need to create
a mindset of entrepreneurship.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.690
You need to have--

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.350
some venture capital
would be great.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.400
But failure needs
to be an option.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.160
So a lot of Central and
South American countries,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.220
if you fail, it's a
black mark for life.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.140
Here we call it success.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.330
At X, you celebrate
a failure every week

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.307
when someone gives
up their company

00:32:52.307 --> 00:32:53.890
and say we're going
to spend our money

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.520
and our time
someplace else better.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.240
That's amazing.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.077
So it's teaching that
mindset of failure.

00:33:00.077 --> 00:33:01.910
I had this conversation
with Ratan Tata, one

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.490
of our fellow trustees, who--

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.170
in India, it's really hard.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.550
If you fail, you're screwed.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.390
And so you don't take big steps.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.750
And so he wanted to sort
of dismiss that ethos.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.690
And so he was like, we're
going to celebrate failure.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.580
We're going to celebrate
a great idea that

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.100
was worth trying
that failed and give

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.469
this person their next shot.

00:33:23.469 --> 00:33:25.760
JACK HIDARY: So speaking of
that mindset breakthrough--

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.593
and then we'll turn to
one or two questions.

00:33:27.593 --> 00:33:30.597
So if you want to line up at the
mike, if people have questions.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.957
You've now-- [INAUDIBLE]
has now trained,

00:33:34.957 --> 00:33:37.040
I don't know, thousands
of people, it must be now,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.190
in exponential thinking.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.731
And through XPRIZE
and others, you've

00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:41.690
also touched a lot
of people and changed

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.610
a lot of people's mindset
about what is possible.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.780
When you go back
to the news reports

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.477
on polio back in the early
part of the last century,

00:33:50.477 --> 00:33:52.310
it's written in such a
way that people never

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.590
thought it could be overcome.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.750
Today, when people
speak about cancer,

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.640
yes, incremental progress.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.622
But most people,
when you ask them,

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:02.330
they don't believe
that in their lifetime

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.040
we're going to
see the management

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.930
and containment of cancer.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.540
So identify for us
three or four things

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.980
that you think we should apply--

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.199
exponential breakthrough
thinking-- and we're

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.010
not doing today.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.739
And we're going to look back
30, 40 years from now and say,

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.787
we were people like polio,
looking at polio the same way.

00:34:19.787 --> 00:34:21.620
That we should have had
a different mindset.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:21.980
PETER DIAMANDIS: Sure.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.521
So let me talk about
where the places

00:34:23.521 --> 00:34:26.719
we're doing XPRIZEs
as a perfect example.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.560
So first of all, we
are in final steps

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.600
for what I hope will
be a $100 million

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.530
cancer XPRIZE for going beyond
liquid biopsy, but very early

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.870
detection.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.949
Something like a blood test,
or something like a Pap smear,

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:45.199
or something that
is tens of dollars,

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:48.199
very easy to do
type of detection.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:51.590
We're also working on an
Alzheimer's XPRIZE, same order

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.030
of magnitude.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.370
One of my favorite prizes
that I want to do right now

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.460
is a fire detection
and extinction XPRIZE.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.840
The idea that we don't know when
a fire starts is ridiculous.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.380
So this is a simple
XPRIZE for me.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.310
A team is given 500 square
kilometers of forest land.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:15.210
And you have to detect a fire
above a certain lumen level--

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.870
let's say five campfires' worth.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.520
And you have to put it
out within 10 minutes.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.420
And I don't care how
you do it-- with drones,

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.420
with water balloons,
whatever the case might be.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.440
I think if that
technology exists,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.340
insurance makes it
possible and deploys it

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.540
across all forest lands.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.760
We don't have devastating
forest fires again.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.950
So I'd love to do that.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:42.150
Working on a earthquake
prediction XPRIZE, I think,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.280
is a massive data play.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.910
There's no way in the world
that a magnitude 6 earthquake

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.980
doesn't leave digital
trails before it unleashes

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.830
30 Hiroshima bombs of energy.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:01.950
Working on a hurricane
trajectory prediction XPRIZE.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:08.550
So it turns out that all
those wide-area projections

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.100
of a hurricane
cause devastation.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.020
And if you can
measure wind velocity

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.370
at 10 meters above the center
of the eye of a hurricane,

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.580
that's the missing data.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.850
So is there a drone
or a technology

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.220
for doing that accurately?

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.420
There's energy XPRIZE.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.210
We're working on a feeding
the next billion XPRIZE

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.840
for massive protein
food production.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.900
The way that we grow
our protein today--

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.770
this is a planet for
cows, if you didn't know.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.920
One-third of our non-ice
landmass is used--

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:46.590
hey, Peter-- is used for
livestock production.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.860
And that's crazy, with CO2,
water, energy, and so forth.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.600
So we've been working with
a lot of the companies that

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.580
are in the beginning
of cultured meat

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:03.660
to create a large-scale cultured
meat XPRIZE for stem cell

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.840
meat and plant-based
derivative that tastes

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.452
better than what you buy.

00:37:07.452 --> 00:37:08.910
JACK HIDARY: And
I guess finally, I

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.010
know you've been thinking about
housing for a while, in terms

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.230
of the ability to-- not
necessarily from an XPRIZE--

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.240
but in general, could we
provide housing for folks.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.230
So with that, we have
time for two questions.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.020
And we have two questioners.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.520
AUDIENCE: Most of
these XPRIZEs have

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.120
to do with science
and technology.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.030
Or when they
involve humans, they

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.320
treat humans as
individual units.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.630
How would you do an
XPRIZE that involves

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.869
connections between humans
in the social space?

00:37:35.869 --> 00:37:36.660
What would they be?

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.118
JACK HIDARY: Groups
of people, or--

00:37:38.118 --> 00:37:40.260
PETER DIAMANDIS: You
mean behavioral prizes?

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.046
PETER DIAMANDIS: Yeah.

00:37:42.046 --> 00:37:45.900
So to be clear, XPRIZEs
that have been successful

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.830
so far have been for widgets,
devices, transportation modes,

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.720
and things like
that, where people

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.850
can go and have a very
clear, measurable objective

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.560
and can rapidly iterate.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.720
We've talked about
doing competitions

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.610
between regions, like cities
or companies and so forth.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.057
One my favorite XPRIZE ideas--

00:38:04.057 --> 00:38:06.390
and actually, the very first
person to ever mention this

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.590
was Larry Page--

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.650
would be a-- it's
a two-part prize.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.150
One would be a happiness X--
it's called a Happiness XPRIZE.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.930
Could you build a device that
could physiologically measure

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.326
your state of happiness?

00:38:17.326 --> 00:38:19.200
Like if I asked you
right now, are you happy?

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.610
Ah, I'm a 7.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.180
And other times I'd be a
10 or a 2, whatever it is.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.820
But if you could actually
accurately measure,

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.330
then you could create a
policy change at Google

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.120
and then measure did it
make people happy or not.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.460
So I think the ability
to measure something

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.540
first and then create
state changes afterwards

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.500
would be my approach to that.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.190
But we haven't done
it successfully yet.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.523
We keep on banging our heads
against it and continue to.

00:38:46.523 --> 00:38:47.482
But thank you for that.

00:38:47.482 --> 00:38:49.897
AUDIENCE: You talked a lot
about accelerating technologies

00:38:49.897 --> 00:38:51.130
in the near-term future.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.936
And my question had
to do with, do you

00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:55.560
think there's any risk of these
accelerating technologies being

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.169
misused by bad actors in
the short or near term?

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:00.210
I'm thinking of things
like China's social credit

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.877
system, which just
seems kind of like,

00:39:01.877 --> 00:39:03.210
I don't know, a nightmare to me.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.620
But what are your
thoughts on that?

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.250
PETER DIAMANDIS: So the
answer is of course.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.220
And I would just say, listen,
the social credit system--

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.260
first of all, anybody
who went through school

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.440
and got an A, a B, or
a C or had a review,

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.340
we've had that all
through our lives.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.130
It's the negative externalities
that are the issue with that.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.490
But being able to tell
a person how-- there's

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.790
good parts of a social credit
system, if it's for the upside,

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.435
not for the downside.

00:39:28.435 --> 00:39:30.810
Just to be clear, not to defend
what they're doing there,

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.650
to be very clear.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.410
But yeah, I'm clear that
even though the world is

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.220
getting better by
almost every measure--

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.030
the cost of food,
energy, water, health

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.040
care, all these things are
plummeting as life is going up,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.200
as childhood
mortality rates have

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.580
plummeted from 45% percent
of kids dying under age 5

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.200
to now 4%.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.900
All of these metrics are
getting better and better.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.460
And I think they'll continue to.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.960
We're still going
to have terrorism.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.240
We're still going
to have warfare.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.323
We're still going to have
a whole bunch of things.

00:40:05.323 --> 00:40:08.320
The thing that gives
me the greatest hope

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.390
for not being decimated is
that it's harder and harder

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:14.690
to do anything in secret.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.360
It's the flip side
of loss of privacy,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.290
that there are cameras
all the time, everywhere.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.730
A single autonomous
car with a LIDAR

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.690
generating 750 megabytes of data
as it's going down the roads.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.190
So everything is being imaged.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.720
Whatever augmented
reality goggles

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.094
we're all going
to be wearing are

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:34.030
going to have millimeter
cameras looking out.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.660
1.6 million drones flying over
the skies of the United States.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.380
So everything is going
to be visualized.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.270
And so your ability to
do something in secret

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.250
becomes harder and harder.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.390
And that lets me sleep a
little bit better at night.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.120
But ultimately, when
I do my calculus,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.660
the question is are there
more good people in the world

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.600
using these technologies or bad?

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.709
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:40:56.709 --> 00:40:58.375
PETER DIAMANDIS: I'll
leave that to you.

00:40:58.375 --> 00:40:58.780
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.110
Thank you.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:40:59.710
PETER DIAMANDIS: Thank you.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.350
JACK HIDARY: So a final word of
advice to those in this room,

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.630
on livestream, and going
to watch this on YouTube

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.270
around the world,
you're at a company

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.650
like Google or another company.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:12.395
You're managing 5, 10, 20
people, maybe 100 people.

00:41:12.395 --> 00:41:14.020
What is your advice
to somebody as they

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.440
are growing their career, as
they're building products,

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.040
to tap in to the kind
of exponential focus

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.690
that you have and
you live every day?

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:26.590
But in the practical
day-to-day sense,

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.156
what is your advice to folks?

00:41:28.156 --> 00:41:29.530
PETER DIAMANDIS:
So first of all,

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.400
don't do anything you don't
absolutely love doing.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.440
I don't know how to say
it more clearly than that.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.320
To do anything big
and bold in the world

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.080
and make a difference
on the planet is hard.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.910
It's extraordinarily hard.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.610
And if you don't love
doing what you're doing,

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.850
you're going to give up
before you get there.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:53.320
So any of my successes
are overnight successes

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.850
after 11 years of hard work.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.280
And I just did not--

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.490
I refused to give up.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.820
And sometimes there's an
important point to give up.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.630
But I didn't.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:05.530
Because for XPRIZE, like my
Zero G company, which-- anybody

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.880
here flown in zero g?

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.360
Mark has, I know.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.950
It took 11 years to
get FAA permission

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.550
to do this with a 727.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.550
I had a chance to fly
Stephen Hawking in zero g.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.610
It was amazing.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.860
But I just refused to give up.

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.084
I mean, I was battling the FAA.

00:42:21.084 --> 00:42:23.500
And I always think, you're
going to die or retire before I

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.390
give up, was my attitude.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.460
And sometimes-- only because
I cared about it that much.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.820
The other parts is--

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.149
and this is one of
the ethos of Google--

00:42:34.149 --> 00:42:36.190
that the world's biggest
problems are the world's

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.490
biggest business opportunities.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.620
I mean, I tell people
probably the company that's

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.230
made the biggest positive
impact on the planet

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.950
is Google, in terms of-- and
you don't have to be a nonprofit

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:51.310
to create an empirically
better world.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.410
And then, when I
become a billionaire,

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.940
help a billion people.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.130
So it's those kinds
of mindsets, I think,

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:02.030
that are convergent with
the power that you have.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.680
Never underestimate
what you can do.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.620
Each of you are extraordinarily
powerful to solve problems.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.960
You just have to have
that committed, passionate

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.460
human mind.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.251
JACK HIDARY: Great.

00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:12.790
Peter--

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:13.050
PETER DIAMANDIS: Thank you.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.632
JACK HIDARY: Thank
you very much.

00:43:14.632 --> 00:43:15.590
Great to have you here.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.940
