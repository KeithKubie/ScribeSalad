because if I always have a situation if

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
because if I always have a situation if
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.970
because if I always have a situation if
I was having mindset that I'm always

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
I was having mindset that I'm always
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.500
I was having mindset that I'm always
doing the right thing I can't get better

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
doing the right thing I can't get better
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.300
doing the right thing I can't get better
so I'm gonna have to look at something

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
so I'm gonna have to look at something
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800
so I'm gonna have to look at something
and say is there you know a teachable

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
and say is there you know a teachable
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.210
and say is there you know a teachable
moment there is there a way I can learn

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
moment there is there a way I can learn
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.520
moment there is there a way I can learn
from this and is there a way I could do

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
from this and is there a way I could do
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.130
from this and is there a way I could do
something different and no I don't I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140
something different and no I don't I
 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.410
something different and no I don't I
think with that same situation with an

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
think with that same situation with an
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.720
think with that same situation with an
arm going limp with that type of a choke

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
arm going limp with that type of a choke
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.730
arm going limp with that type of a choke
on someone I don't know of a defense

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740
on someone I don't know of a defense
 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.260
on someone I don't know of a defense
that requires the arm you know I mean I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270
that requires the arm you know I mean I
 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.550
that requires the arm you know I mean I
would think the arm should be doing

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
would think the arm should be doing
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.040
would think the arm should be doing
something else I at this time I don't

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
something else I at this time I don't
