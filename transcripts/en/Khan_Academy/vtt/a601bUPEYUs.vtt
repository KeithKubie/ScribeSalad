00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:03.405
- [Voiceover] Part d, given
that f of one is equal to three,

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:08.119
write an expression for f of
x that involves an integral.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.326
It says it involves an integral.

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:11.540
We can assume it's going
to involve f prime.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.408
Thus you can see given us so
much information about f prime

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:15.952
including its graph and the area

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:18.146
under or above the curve
of the different integrals.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:21.951
And it wanted us to find f of
four and f of negative two.

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.320
So let's think about how we can connect

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.847
f prime, an integral and f of x.

00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:32.368
Well, if we have the integral from a to b

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:37.368
of f prime of x, dx.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.670
What is this going to be equal to?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.248
Well, this is going to be
equal to the antiderivative

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:45.812
of f prime of x which is f of x.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:49.492
And we're going to
evaluate that at b and a

00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:50.770
and subtract the difference.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.614
So this is going to be f of b

00:00:53.614 --> 00:00:55.959
minus f of a.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:59.431
This is straight out of the
fundamental theorem of calculus.

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.416
All right, well this is interesting.

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:03.103
Well, what if, instead of having a b,

00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:05.308
what if we had an x there?

00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:07.383
And if we're going to put
an x as one of our bounds

00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:09.318
of integration, well, we'll
use a different variable

00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:10.445
for our integration here.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.011
So let me write it this way.

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:14.786
So find the integral from a to x

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:19.786
of f prime of u, du.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.752
Well, what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:24.310
Well, this is going to
be, by the same logic,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.481
the antiderivative of
this evaluated with x,

00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:31.481
so f of x minus f of a,

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:34.545
minus f of a.

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.625
Or, if we wanted to solve for f of x,

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.430
we could add f of a to bought sides

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.823
and we would get f of x
is equal to the integral

00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:47.587
from a to x of f prime of u, du.

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:48.823
Once again, I wanted the u one.

00:01:48.823 --> 00:01:50.213
This is some letter other than x

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:52.838
since I already used x as one
of my bounds of integration.

00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:54.603
And I'm adding f of a to both sides.

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:56.867
I swapped the sides too.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:00.501
So f of x is going to be
equal to this plus f of a.

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.020
Plus f of a.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.759
So this is a general form
if a is a lower bound

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.628
but they gave us some information.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.802
They said that f of one,

00:02:10.802 --> 00:02:13.582
f of one is equal to three.

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:16.094
So if we choose a to be equal to one,

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.056
if we say this is one right over here.

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:19.217
This is one.

00:02:19.217 --> 00:02:21.704
Then we know that this is
going to be equal to three.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:24.735
So we can write f of x,

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:28.368
f of x is equal to the integral.

00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:31.712
I'm using one as my a since
I know what f of one is.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:36.712
From one to x of f prime of u, du,

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:40.226
plus f of one, they told us what that is.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.196
That is going to be equal to three.

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:44.001
So this is the first part right here.

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:44.814
This is it.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:47.960
That is the first part of the problem.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.163
Now, let's try to find f of
four and f of negative two.

00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:55.333
All right, f of four.

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:57.216
Well, whenever see an x,
we substitute to four.

00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:00.093
There's gonna be integral from one to four

00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:04.604
of f prime of u, du plus three.

00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:06.732
So, what is gonna be the
integral from one to four

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:08.532
of f prime of u, du?

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.482
So let's look up here.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.574
So the integral from

00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:16.260
one to four of f prime,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.373
that's the curve right over here.

00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:22.204
Well, that's going to give this area

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:24.239
but it's going to be
the negative of the area

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.804
because it's the, if you
just take the integrals,

00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:31.124
it's the area that you
could view above the x-axis

00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:32.803
and below where for the intervals of u,

00:03:32.803 --> 00:03:36.216
above the u axis and below the function.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.316
Well, this is the other way around.

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.689
The function is below
the horizontal axis here.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.971
So this area, which they
told us in the problem,

00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:46.907
the area bound by the x-axis
in the graph of f prime

00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:49.498
over the interval one, four is 12.

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:51.855
So this area over here is 12

00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:53.434
but the integral is going to be a negative

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:57.159
because, once again, our
function is below the x-axis.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.646
So this integral, this right over here is

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:03.058
going to be a negative 12.

00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:05.244
This is negative 12.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:09.934
So negative 12 plus
three is negative nine.

00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:13.046
All right, now let's
evaluate f of negative two.

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:16.390
F of negative two is equal to the integral

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.244
from one to negative two of f prime

00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:23.564
of u, du plus three.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:25.294
Well, it's kind of feels a little strange

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:28.475
to have the upper bound to being
lower than the lower bound.

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:29.729
So we could swap the bounds

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.610
and then add a negative about here.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.925
So this is going to be
equal to the negative of,

00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:38.089
if we swap the bounds here.

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:40.934
So from negative two to one,

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:43.685
f prime of u,

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:45.990
du plus three.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.545
So that's the integral
from negative to the one.

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:50.646
Well, they gave us that.

00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:53.574
From negative two to one.

00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:56.325
They told us that this
area over here is nine.

00:04:56.325 --> 00:04:58.752
But once again, because it's
below the horizontal axis

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:02.067
and above the curve, we
would say that the integral

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:04.529
would evaluate to be negative nine.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:05.643
So the area is nine.

00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:09.741
But once again, the curve
is below the x-axis.

00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:13.093
So the integral would
give us negative nine.

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.926
This would evaluate to negative nine.

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:21.150
So take the negative of negative
nine which is positive nine

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.703
plus three which is equal to,

00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:27.512
so nine plus three is equal to 12,

00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:29.023
and we're done.
