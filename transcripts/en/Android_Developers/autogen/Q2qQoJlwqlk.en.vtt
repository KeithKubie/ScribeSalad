documents on and put them up on

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
documents on and put them up on

they actually matter what's the context
of developing on on mobile that makes it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
of developing on on mobile that makes it
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680
of developing on on mobile that makes it
so very difficult and makes these rules

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
so very difficult and makes these rules
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.840
so very difficult and makes these rules
so very important to get a well

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
so very important to get a well
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.990
so very important to get a well
performing and nice user experience

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
performing and nice user experience
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.390
performing and nice user experience
application for your users so let's talk

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
application for your users so let's talk
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.120
application for your users so let's talk
about some of those things so memory

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
about some of those things so memory
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.750
about some of those things so memory
turns out it's limited it's very limited

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
turns out it's limited it's very limited
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.310
turns out it's limited it's very limited
so the phones that you have in your

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
so the phones that you have in your
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880
so the phones that you have in your
pockets are probably I don't know two or

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
pockets are probably I don't know two or
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.850
pockets are probably I don't know two or
three gigs of RAM yeah two to three is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
three gigs of RAM yeah two to three is
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.000
three gigs of RAM yeah two to three is
three three no yes four maybe possibly

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
three three no yes four maybe possibly
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.640
three three no yes four maybe possibly
as low as one in a lot of the world it's

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
as low as one in a lot of the world it's
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.210
as low as one in a lot of the world it's
you know 512 megs is actually quite

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
you know 512 megs is actually quite
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.100
you know 512 megs is actually quite
common and it's not just comment on the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110
common and it's not just comment on the
 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.290
common and it's not just comment on the
older phones it's also common on newer

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300
older phones it's also common on newer
 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.000
older phones it's also common on newer
phones that are being sold into cheaper

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
phones that are being sold into cheaper
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.920
phones that are being sold into cheaper
markets right there's a weird thing

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
markets right there's a weird thing
 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.870
markets right there's a weird thing
about Moore's Law where you assume that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
about Moore's Law where you assume that
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.160
about Moore's Law where you assume that
everything's going to get faster and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
everything's going to get faster and
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.140
everything's going to get faster and
better and in general it does right

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
better and in general it does right
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.060

so we don't have 20 gigabytes of RAM

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820
so we don't have 20 gigabytes of RAM
 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.000
so we don't have 20 gigabytes of RAM

another dynamic that's important about
memory on Android is everybody is

memory on Android is everybody is
 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.850
memory on Android is everybody is
sharing this limited pool right so if

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860
sharing this limited pool right so if
 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.440
sharing this limited pool right so if
you are taking up a lot of space for

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450
you are taking up a lot of space for
 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.290
you are taking up a lot of space for
your activity when it launches the

other things to make it possible for
 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.040
other things to make it possible for
your activity to run and then when you

your activity to run and then when you
 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.480
your activity to run and then when you
go in the background and the user goes

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490
go in the background and the user goes
 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.280
go in the background and the user goes

while because maybe the launcher had to
 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.340
while because maybe the launcher had to
be killed in order to allow your

may also be killed when those other

may also be killed when those other
 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.890
may also be killed when those other
activities looking for a memory because

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900
activities looking for a memory because
 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.510
activities looking for a memory because
if you're taken up a lot of memory

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520
if you're taken up a lot of memory
 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.040
if you're taken up a lot of memory
you're gonna look really juicy to the

you're gonna look really juicy to the
 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.140
you're gonna look really juicy to the
task manager when it needs more memory I

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
task manager when it needs more memory I
 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.510
task manager when it needs more memory I
know and that's very important because I

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520
know and that's very important because I
 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.250
know and that's very important because I
know that your application is the most

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260
know that your application is the most
 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.200
know that your application is the most
important application it is to you you

important application it is to you you
 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.610
important application it is to you you
know my applications on my most

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620
know my applications on my most
 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.830
know my applications on my most
important applications but I've seen

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
important applications but I've seen
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.860
important applications but I've seen
I've seen applications that basically

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870
I've seen applications that basically
 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.750
I've seen applications that basically
try to game the system and when they're

try to game the system and when they're
 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.130
try to game the system and when they're
in the background they try to refresh

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140
in the background they try to refresh
 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.659
in the background they try to refresh
the caches or they do everything they

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669
the caches or they do everything they
 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.820
the caches or they do everything they
can to stay around in memory so that

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830
can to stay around in memory so that
 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.990
can to stay around in memory so that
when the user gets back to the

when the user gets back to the
 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.240
when the user gets back to the
application they won't suffer through a

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
application they won't suffer through a
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.400
application they won't suffer through a

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410
cold startup so the app is still there
 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.470
cold startup so the app is still there
but what they do in the process is they

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480
but what they do in the process is they
 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.450
but what they do in the process is they
kill all the other apps on the phone so

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460
kill all the other apps on the phone so
 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.940
kill all the other apps on the phone so
they make everybody else look bad so you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950
they make everybody else look bad so you
 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.980
they make everybody else look bad so you

be tasks thrashing we were talking about

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160
be tasks thrashing we were talking about
 

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.650
be tasks thrashing we were talking about
this before if you take a lot of memory

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:40.660
this before if you take a lot of memory
 

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.630
this before if you take a lot of memory
someone else has to die to ensure that

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:42.640
someone else has to die to ensure that
 

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.700
someone else has to die to ensure that
you can live and vice versa when you go

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:44.710
you can live and vice versa when you go
 

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.340
you can live and vice versa when you go
in the background allocations are going

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.350
in the background allocations are going
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.540
in the background allocations are going
to take longer because there's simply

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:48.550
to take longer because there's simply
 

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.310
to take longer because there's simply
more information to wade through for the

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320
more information to wade through for the
 

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.050
more information to wade through for the
garbage collector to actually figure out

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.060
garbage collector to actually figure out
 

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.639
garbage collector to actually figure out
where to put that thing we

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:53.649
where to put that thing we
 

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:56.429
where to put that thing we
where the free space is collections are

00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:56.439
where the free space is collections are
 

00:12:56.439 --> 00:13:00.019
where the free space is collections are
slower for the same exact reason and

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:00.029
slower for the same exact reason and
 

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:03.929
slower for the same exact reason and
there's just general more activity for

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:03.939
there's just general more activity for
 

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:05.179
there's just general more activity for
the garbage collector to run through

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:05.189
the garbage collector to run through
 

00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:07.829
the garbage collector to run through
allocating collecting doing hopefully

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839

not but probably full GCS to actually

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:10.389
not but probably full GCS to actually
 

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:12.960
not but probably full GCS to actually
get memory back in the system so we

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:12.970
get memory back in the system so we
 

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.189
get memory back in the system so we
thought it would be useful to sort of

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199
thought it would be useful to sort of
 

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:15.509
thought it would be useful to sort of
walk through some of the ideas around

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519
walk through some of the ideas around
 

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:17.460
walk through some of the ideas around
garbage allocation and collection in

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:17.470
garbage allocation and collection in
 

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.290
garbage allocation and collection in
general so you can understand the

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.300
general so you can understand the
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.359
general so you can understand the
context of why this stuff cost so very

00:13:21.359 --> 00:13:21.369
context of why this stuff cost so very
 

00:13:21.369 --> 00:13:23.160
context of why this stuff cost so very
much so this is how a garbage collector

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.170
much so this is how a garbage collector
 

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.379
much so this is how a garbage collector
works okay any questions okay so if we

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:28.389
works okay any questions okay so if we
 

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:29.819
works okay any questions okay so if we
go into the second goal description the

00:13:29.819 --> 00:13:29.829
go into the second goal description the
 

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:32.489
go into the second goal description the
squiggly is on the left indicates I

00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:32.499
squiggly is on the left indicates I
 

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:34.410
squiggly is on the left indicates I
actually don't I don't really know I

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:34.420
actually don't I don't really know I
 

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.970
actually don't I don't really know I
still I mean yeah I'm disturbed somebody

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:38.980
still I mean yeah I'm disturbed somebody
 

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.189
still I mean yeah I'm disturbed somebody
somebody in the squiggly dimension is

00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199
somebody in the squiggly dimension is
 

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:42.600
somebody in the squiggly dimension is
trying to allocate something and they

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:42.610
trying to allocate something and they
 

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.009
trying to allocate something and they
come up with a blue rectangle I don't

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:44.019
come up with a blue rectangle I don't
 

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:45.179
come up with a blue rectangle I don't
know why it's blue I don't know why it's

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:45.189
know why it's blue I don't know why it's
 

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:46.230
know why it's blue I don't know why it's
a rectangle but they want to allocate

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240
a rectangle but they want to allocate
 

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.269
a rectangle but they want to allocate
space for it so it looks at the garbage

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279
space for it so it looks at the garbage
 

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.400
space for it so it looks at the garbage
at the heap and it says okay I want to

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:50.410
at the heap and it says okay I want to
 

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.169
at the heap and it says okay I want to
allocate this thing we put it in there

00:13:52.169 --> 00:13:52.179
allocate this thing we put it in there
 

00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:53.549
allocate this thing we put it in there
then we enumerate all the things that

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:53.559
then we enumerate all the things that
 

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.290
then we enumerate all the things that
have references in the enumeration phase

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:55.300
have references in the enumeration phase
 

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.749
have references in the enumeration phase
we the mark phase says okay what are the

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759
we the mark phase says okay what are the
 

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:58.889
we the mark phase says okay what are the
things that don't have references

00:13:58.889 --> 00:13:58.899
things that don't have references
 

00:13:58.899 --> 00:13:59.999
things that don't have references
because those are the things that we can

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:00.009
because those are the things that we can
 

00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:01.799
because those are the things that we can
get rid of and then we collect that

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:01.809
get rid of and then we collect that
 

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:03.389
get rid of and then we collect that
right so we free up that little red

00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399
right so we free up that little red
 

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.530
right so we free up that little red
thing in the middle we freed up the

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:04.540
thing in the middle we freed up the
 

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.360
thing in the middle we freed up the
space for that that is now space that

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.370
space for that that is now space that
 

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.189
space for that that is now space that
can be used for a future allocation in

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199
can be used for a future allocation in
 

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:10.410
can be used for a future allocation in
the heap it's important to note that on

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:10.420
the heap it's important to note that on
 

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.989
the heap it's important to note that on
dalvik there's two different pauses that

00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:12.999
dalvik there's two different pauses that
 

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:14.639
dalvik there's two different pauses that
happen during this process there's a

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:14.649
happen during this process there's a
 

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:16.559
happen during this process there's a
pause during enumeration well they

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:16.569
pause during enumeration well they
 

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:18.780
pause during enumeration well they
actually want the heap and see where the

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:18.790
actually want the heap and see where the
 

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.299
actually want the heap and see where the
references are to all these objects and

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:21.309
references are to all these objects and
 

00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:23.309
references are to all these objects and
then there's the mark phase that also

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:23.319
then there's the mark phase that also
 

00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:25.980
then there's the mark phase that also
has a pause part of the mark phases is

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:25.990
has a pause part of the mark phases is
 

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.829
has a pause part of the mark phases is
okay it can do that concurrently with

00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839
okay it can do that concurrently with
 

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:31.110
okay it can do that concurrently with
other threads but part of it it needs to

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120
other threads but part of it it needs to
 

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.480
other threads but part of it it needs to
pause everything else in the system at

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:33.490
pause everything else in the system at
 

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.009
pause everything else in the system at
the end of that mark phase to basically

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:35.019
the end of that mark phase to basically
 

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:37.319
the end of that mark phase to basically
do a post process and say okay are there

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:37.329
do a post process and say okay are there
 

00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:39.239
do a post process and say okay are there
any changes since I ran through the

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:39.249
any changes since I ran through the
 

00:14:39.249 --> 00:14:41.730
any changes since I ran through the
first time and in sponsor to remember

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:41.740
first time and in sponsor to remember
 

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.769
first time and in sponsor to remember
that a pause poses all your threads in

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:43.779
that a pause poses all your threads in
 

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:45.179
that a pause poses all your threads in
your application so it's not just the UI

00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:45.189
your application so it's not just the UI
 

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:47.009
your application so it's not just the UI
thread it's going to be positive and

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:47.019
thread it's going to be positive and
 

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.329
thread it's going to be positive and
oppose your background threads that's

00:14:48.329 --> 00:14:48.339
oppose your background threads that's
 

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:49.889
oppose your background threads that's
also means that the background thread

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:49.899
also means that the background thread
 

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:51.809
also means that the background thread
doing too much to see activity will

00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:51.819
doing too much to see activity will
 

00:14:51.819 --> 00:14:53.850
doing too much to see activity will
impact your UI thread so your animations

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:53.860
impact your UI thread so your animations
 

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.859
impact your UI thread so your animations
or layouts and you can see these in the

00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:55.869
or layouts and you can see these in the
 

00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:59.309
or layouts and you can see these in the

GC operations concurrent G sees there's
 

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.630
GC operations concurrent G sees there's
there's lots of information

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:04.640
there's lots of information
 

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.940
there's lots of information
about GCS in the log you can see some of

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:06.950
about GCS in the log you can see some of
 

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.710
about GCS in the log you can see some of
these things coming out and if you

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720
these things coming out and if you
 

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.170
these things coming out and if you
wonder why they're there this is why so

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:11.180
wonder why they're there this is why so
 

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.660
wonder why they're there this is why so
on art there were improvements huge

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:13.670
on art there were improvements huge
 

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.250
on art there were improvements huge
improvements made to garbage collection

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:15.260
improvements made to garbage collection
 

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.230
improvements made to garbage collection
allocation in general one of the big

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240
allocation in general one of the big
 

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.520
allocation in general one of the big
improvements was there's no longer a

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:18.530
improvements was there's no longer a
 

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.290
improvements was there's no longer a
pause during the enumeration phase and

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:20.300
pause during the enumeration phase and
 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.600
pause during the enumeration phase and
there's a smaller pause during mark but

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:22.610
there's a smaller pause during mark but
 

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.180
there's a smaller pause during mark but
it is still a stop the world pause so at

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.190
it is still a stop the world pause so at
 

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.500
it is still a stop the world pause so at
the end of the mark phase they're going

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:26.510
the end of the mark phase they're going
 

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.020
the end of the mark phase they're going
to do a quick pause just to sort of

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.030
to do a quick pause just to sort of
 

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.540
to do a quick pause just to sort of
collect the information and move on from

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:31.550
collect the information and move on from
 

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.990
collect the information and move on from
there

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000
there
 

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.840
there
so now let's look at a more problematic

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:34.850
so now let's look at a more problematic
 

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.340
so now let's look at a more problematic
situation this is the GC for alloc

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:36.350
situation this is the GC for alloc
 

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.830
situation this is the GC for alloc
situation you come in someone wants yet

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:38.840
situation you come in someone wants yet
 

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.260
situation you come in someone wants yet
again a blue rectangle allocated and it

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:41.270
again a blue rectangle allocated and it
 

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.610
again a blue rectangle allocated and it
comes in and says okay well I've got a

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:42.620
comes in and says okay well I've got a
 

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.140
comes in and says okay well I've got a
space for that how about a second blue

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.150
space for that how about a second blue
 

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.030
space for that how about a second blue
rectangle because I had such a good time

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040
rectangle because I had such a good time
 

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.100
rectangle because I had such a good time
allocating for the first one and it

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.110
allocating for the first one and it
 

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.690
allocating for the first one and it
walked through the entire heap and it

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:49.700
walked through the entire heap and it
 

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.060
walked through the entire heap and it
cannot find a contiguous block of space

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.070
cannot find a contiguous block of space
 

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.830
cannot find a contiguous block of space
large enough for the second blue

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:53.840
large enough for the second blue
 

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.780
large enough for the second blue
rectangle so it needs to free up space

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:55.790
rectangle so it needs to free up space
 

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.450
rectangle so it needs to free up space
for that then it does a GC for alloc and

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:58.460
for that then it does a GC for alloc and
 

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.550
for that then it does a GC for alloc and
there's a huge pause right so this is

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560
there's a huge pause right so this is
 

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.480
there's a huge pause right so this is
the really problematic thing about GC

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:04.490
the really problematic thing about GC
 

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.400
the really problematic thing about GC
not just that it's a huge pause but it

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.410
not just that it's a huge pause but it
 

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.870
not just that it's a huge pause but it
basically happens at exactly the time

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880

you do not want it to you may be in your
 

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.770
you do not want it to you may be in your
inner loop and you're doing something

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:11.780
inner loop and you're doing something
 

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.840
inner loop and you're doing something
that triggers an allocation that

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:13.850
that triggers an allocation that
 

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.360
that triggers an allocation that
triggers the need to actually walk the

triggers the need to actually walk the
 

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.430
triggers the need to actually walk the
entire heap and free everything possible

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440
entire heap and free everything possible
 

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.750
entire heap and free everything possible
just to get memory to allocate that

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:19.760

program until that is freed up for you
 

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.960
program until that is freed up for you
so that it can be put on the heap so

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:25.970
so that it can be put on the heap so
 

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.520
so that it can be put on the heap so
you're basically going to pause right in

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:27.530
you're basically going to pause right in
 

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.990
you're basically going to pause right in
the middle of you know an animation and

the heap try to allocate another big
 

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:21.140
the heap try to allocate another big
object and you will run out of memory

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:21.150
object and you will run out of memory
 

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.760

even though you have a ton of memory

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:22.770
even though you have a ton of memory
 

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.819
even though you have a ton of memory
available and that happens a lot with

introduced the concept of the large heap

00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:32.309
introduced the concept of the large heap
 

00:17:32.309 --> 00:17:34.520
introduced the concept of the large heap
so it's a special heap for large objects

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:34.530
so it's a special heap for large objects
 

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.419
so it's a special heap for large objects
and bitmaps in particular are a good

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:38.429
and bitmaps in particular are a good
 

00:17:38.429 --> 00:17:40.549
and bitmaps in particular are a good
candidate for that so not only does it

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559
candidate for that so not only does it
 

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.440
candidate for that so not only does it
help with the heap fragmentation because

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:42.450
help with the heap fragmentation because
 

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.720
help with the heap fragmentation because
we know that we are likely to find large

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:44.730
we know that we are likely to find large
 

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.030
we know that we are likely to find large
contiguous space in the large heap but

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:47.040
contiguous space in the large heap but
 

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.580
contiguous space in the large heap but
it will also make every allocation and

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:49.590
it will also make every allocation and
 

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.080
it will also make every allocation and
garbage collection in the command heap

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.090
garbage collection in the command heap
 

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.000
garbage collection in the command heap
faster because there will be less memory

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.010
faster because there will be less memory

00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419
you know in general between 512 and 2 or
 

00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:17.359
you know in general between 512 and 2 or
more but it's really important to

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:17.369
more but it's really important to
 

00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:18.919
more but it's really important to
remember the technical term is not

00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:18.929
remember the technical term is not
 

00:25:18.929 --> 00:25:23.239
remember the technical term is not
enough not enough never enough also on

00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:23.249

the UI thread some dynamics here it's a

00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:25.889
the UI thread some dynamics here it's a
 

00:25:25.889 --> 00:25:28.339
the UI thread some dynamics here it's a
single threaded UI system for the most

00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:28.349
single threaded UI system for the most
 

00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:30.259
single threaded UI system for the most
part well it's a single threaded UI

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:30.269
part well it's a single threaded UI
 

00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:31.940
part well it's a single threaded UI
system except there's a render thread

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:31.950
system except there's a render thread
 

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.739
system except there's a render thread
and you can have multiple single threads

00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:33.749
and you can have multiple single threads
 

00:25:33.749 --> 00:25:35.299
and you can have multiple single threads
ok so it's a single threaded

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:35.309
ok so it's a single threaded
 

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.289
ok so it's a single threaded
multi-threaded UI system in general you

00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299
multi-threaded UI system in general you
 

00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:41.719
multi-threaded UI system in general you
are always doing things UI related which

00:25:41.719 --> 00:25:41.729
are always doing things UI related which
 

00:25:41.729 --> 00:25:44.119

it we have to test for it but it's not
 

00:25:58.499 --> 00:25:59.839
it we have to test for it but it's not
really a situation that comes up very

really a situation that comes up very

often yet when we are done with
processing all the rendering stuff then

00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:04.169
processing all the rendering stuff then
 

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:05.629
processing all the rendering stuff then
we'll send it over the renderer thread

00:26:05.629 --> 00:26:05.639
we'll send it over the renderer thread
 

00:26:05.639 --> 00:26:07.399
we'll send it over the renderer thread
which will then send it to GL but you

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:07.409
which will then send it to GL but you
 

00:26:07.409 --> 00:26:09.019

sort of has to happen serially and the
 

00:26:15.869 --> 00:26:17.930

the trick here is to basically eliminate
 

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.810
the trick here is to basically eliminate

everything that should not or does not
 

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.700
everything that should not or does not
have to happen on the UI thread because

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:22.710
have to happen on the UI thread because
 

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.599
have to happen on the UI thread because
you really don't want to stall that

you really don't want to stall that
 

00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:24.820
you really don't want to stall that
otherwise you're gonna cross that

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:24.830
otherwise you're gonna cross that

the UI experience video so the best way

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:31.349
the UI experience video so the best way

the UI experience video so the best way
to make your app go faster is to stop

00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:33.029
to make your app go faster is to stop

to make your app go faster is to stop
writing code so just go on vacation and

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:34.830
writing code so just go on vacation and
 

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.709
writing code so just go on vacation and
the best part is you can even justify it

00:26:38.709 --> 00:26:38.719
 
 

00:26:38.719 --> 00:26:43.999
 
so in storage performance varies so just

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:44.009
so in storage performance varies so just
 

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:45.529
so in storage performance varies so just
the raw performance of these storage

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539
the raw performance of these storage
 

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:48.079

good way to test so you can use the
emulator you've seen the presentations

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:44.860
emulator you've seen the presentations
 

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.169
emulator you've seen the presentations
before so there are ways to emulate

00:28:46.169 --> 00:28:46.179
before so there are ways to emulate
 

00:28:46.179 --> 00:28:47.970
before so there are ways to emulate
slower networks while should live in the

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:47.980
slower networks while should live in the
 

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.279
slower networks while should live in the
Bay Area they are yeah you could you

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:50.289
Bay Area they are yeah you could you
 

00:28:50.289 --> 00:28:52.440
Bay Area they are yeah you could you
could just go take a hike on the heels

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:52.450
could just go take a hike on the heels
 

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.930
could just go take a hike on the heels
will buy the two to 80 Highway the

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:54.940
will buy the two to 80 Highway the
 

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.899
will buy the two to 80 Highway the
network is really bad there so that's a

00:28:57.899 --> 00:28:57.909
network is really bad there so that's a
 

00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:59.460
network is really bad there so that's a
good way to test and take some fresh air

00:28:59.460 --> 00:28:59.470
good way to test and take some fresh air
 

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.080
good way to test and take some fresh air
and again you can justify it with your

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.090
and again you can justify it with your
 

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.340
and again you can justify it with your

like are you trying to sell your

00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:07.059
like are you trying to sell your
 

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:09.749
like are you trying to sell your
application in two places where they

00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:09.759
application in two places where they
 

00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:11.310
application in two places where they
really try to avoid using the data

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320
really try to avoid using the data
 

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.310

network for whatever reason but are you

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320
network for whatever reason but are you
 

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.750
network for whatever reason but are you
very dependent upon that for your

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760
very dependent upon that for your
 

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.610
very dependent upon that for your
application experience maybe there are

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:17.620
application experience maybe there are
 

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.070
application experience maybe there are
ways

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080
ways
 

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.509
ways
you can write your applications such

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519
you can write your applications such
 

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:20.680
you can write your applications such
that you can deal with this situation

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:20.690
that you can deal with this situation
 

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.919
that you can deal with this situation
better you know allow them to wait until

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:23.929
better you know allow them to wait until
 

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.240
better you know allow them to wait until
they're on a Wi-Fi network to deal with

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.250
they're on a Wi-Fi network to deal with
 

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.060
they're on a Wi-Fi network to deal with
that or whatever and finally there's a

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.070
that or whatever and finally there's a
 

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.130
that or whatever and finally there's a
couple of these are like sort of

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:30.140
couple of these are like sort of
 

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.690
couple of these are like sort of

just a touchy-feely thing this is a
reality that all of these activities

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:38.630
reality that all of these activities
 

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.960
reality that all of these activities
need to live together and services need

need to live together and services need
to live together on the same system to

demanding a lot of memory you're gonna
 

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.149
demanding a lot of memory you're gonna
kick a lot of other stuff out so that's

00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159
kick a lot of other stuff out so that's
 

00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:50.680
kick a lot of other stuff out so that's
great for your activity when it's in the

launcher because it even kicked that out

00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:58.850
launcher because it even kicked that out
 

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.370
launcher because it even kicked that out
because you asked for so much that's

you're not contributing to happiness for
 

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:05.980
you're not contributing to happiness for
the user just because your application

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:05.990
the user just because your application
 

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.870
the user just because your application
was being greedy and then when you go in

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880
was being greedy and then when you go in
 

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.310

and that many ways you can deal with it

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279
and that many ways you can deal with it
 

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:27.669
and that many ways you can deal with it
fairly easily and fairly efficiently so

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679
fairly easily and fairly efficiently so

can do in your application in your
manifest you can disable things like the

programmatically enable your service or

your broadcast receiver and there the
system will remember that so even across

reboots your service will stay there and
it's really important because no that

those that was the sort of these are the
 

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.490
those that was the sort of these are the
higher-level concepts of why this stuff

matters now let's go through some of the

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360
matters now let's go through some of the
 

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.299
matters now let's go through some of the
actual items about and hopefully you

00:32:18.299 --> 00:32:18.309
actual items about and hopefully you
 

00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:21.570
actual items about and hopefully you
have heard of those tips before so if

that's a good thing and we're going to
 

00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:26.340
that's a good thing and we're going to
talk about it again until you stop

one of them to get rid of that and it
 

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.840
one of them to get rid of that and it
kind of works in the main but then

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:11.850
kind of works in the main but then

there's these specific cases where it

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379
there's these specific cases where it

there's these specific cases where it
causes artifacts keyboard animates up

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540
causes artifacts keyboard animates up

and the window manager doesn't know what

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.490
and the window manager doesn't know what
 

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.639
and the window manager doesn't know what
to draw there because you told us null

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:19.649
to draw there because you told us null
 

00:34:19.649 --> 00:34:21.800
to draw there because you told us null
right so how do you draw no you don't do

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:21.810
right so how do you draw no you don't do
 

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.510
right so how do you draw no you don't do
anything so we don't do anything and

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520
anything so we don't do anything and
 

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.280
anything so we don't do anything and
then the GPU will just draw some default

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:25.290
then the GPU will just draw some default
 

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.840
then the GPU will just draw some default
there which is either black or garbage

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:26.850

there which is either black or garbage
so there's other situations that can

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:28.860
so there's other situations that can
 

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.889
so there's other situations that can
trigger that same artifact the real way

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899
trigger that same artifact the real way
 

00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:32.960
trigger that same artifact the real way
to handle this is to actually have a

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:32.970
to handle this is to actually have a
 

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.879
to handle this is to actually have a
window background and not have opaque on

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:34.889
window background and not have opaque on
 

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.070
window background and not have opaque on
that main container so you can still get

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080
that main container so you can still get
 

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.930
that main container so you can still get
the benefit of having the background for

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940
the benefit of having the background for
 

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.730
the benefit of having the background for
the window so the window manager always

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740
the window so the window manager always
 

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.220
the window so the window manager always
knows what to draw when it needs to but

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:43.230
knows what to draw when it needs to but
 

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.869
knows what to draw when it needs to but
then actually use that background as

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879
then actually use that background as
 

00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:46.070
then actually use that background as
part of the background of your

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080
part of the background of your
 

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.310
part of the background of your
application similarly there's artifacts

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320

caused by disabling the starting window

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:52.250
caused by disabling the starting window
 

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.180
caused by disabling the starting window
let's see so the main reason there are a

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:56.190
let's see so the main reason there are a
 

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.349
let's see so the main reason there are a
few reasons thing about the starting

00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359
few reasons thing about the starting
 

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:59.150
few reasons thing about the starting
window one is that you want to give the

00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160
window one is that you want to give the
 

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.770
window one is that you want to give the
user immediate response that something

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780
user immediate response that something
 

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.080
user immediate response that something
has happened they tap the icon they're

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.090
has happened they tap the icon they're
 

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.460
has happened they tap the icon they're
trying to launch your application which

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:04.470
trying to launch your application which
 

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.290
trying to launch your application which
unfortunately it's going to take seven

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300
unfortunately it's going to take seven
 

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.550
unfortunately it's going to take seven
seconds to launch because there's

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560
seconds to launch because there's
 

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.050
seconds to launch because there's
entirely too much happening when you're

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060
entirely too much happening when you're
 

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.880
entirely too much happening when you're
creating an activity but in the meantime

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:10.890
creating an activity but in the meantime
 

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.349
creating an activity but in the meantime
we'd like to show them that something is

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359
we'd like to show them that something is
 

00:35:12.359 --> 00:35:14.000
we'd like to show them that something is
happening so that they don't go and tap

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.010
happening so that they don't go and tap
 

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.500
happening so that they don't go and tap
it again and wonder what's going on and

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:15.510
it again and wonder what's going on and
 

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.570
it again and wonder what's going on and
then uninstall your app so we quickly

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:17.580
then uninstall your app so we quickly
 

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.980
then uninstall your app so we quickly
launched the starting window this takes

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:18.990
launched the starting window this takes
 

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.720
launched the starting window this takes
a very small amount of time usually

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:20.730
a very small amount of time usually
 

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.400
a very small amount of time usually

we basically peek into the resources

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280
we basically peek into the resources
 

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.770
we basically peek into the resources
into the theme of the activity and we

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780
into the theme of the activity and we
 

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.480
into the theme of the activity and we
say okay here's what a window would

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:29.490
say okay here's what a window would
 

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.890

generally look like for this activity

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900
generally look like for this activity
 

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.630
generally look like for this activity
and we'll we'll pull it up there and

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640
and we'll we'll pull it up there and
 

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.130
and we'll we'll pull it up there and
then we'll crossfade it to the activity

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140
then we'll crossfade it to the activity
 

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.900
then we'll crossfade it to the activity
as soon as it's ready to draw and this

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:35.910
as soon as it's ready to draw and this
 

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.090
as soon as it's ready to draw and this
includes for example the launch window

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:38.100
includes for example the launch window
 

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.800

exact thing it's just a starting window

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:44.850
exact thing it's just a starting window
 

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.490
exact thing it's just a starting window
with a background that happens to have

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500
with a background that happens to have
 

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.320
with a background that happens to have
an icon and it's very quick for us to

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.330
an icon and it's very quick for us to
 

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.730
an icon and it's very quick for us to
figure out what this is to load it in

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740
figure out what this is to load it in
 

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.620
figure out what this is to load it in
and to launch that starting window and

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:51.630
and to launch that starting window and
 

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.220
and to launch that starting window and
then we're crossfading Z the activity

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:53.230
then we're crossfading Z the activity
 

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.230
then we're crossfading Z the activity
as soon as we can if you disable that

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240
as soon as we can if you disable that
 

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.880
as soon as we can if you disable that
starting window then there's situations

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:56.890
starting window then there's situations
 

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.790
starting window then there's situations
where like the launch experience where

00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800
where like the launch experience where
 

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.349
where like the launch experience where
we really should be drawing something

00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359
we really should be drawing something
 

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.970
we really should be drawing something
for the user and we cannot because you

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:02.980
for the user and we cannot because you
 

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.560
for the user and we cannot because you
told us not to UI stalls so this this

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:07.570
told us not to UI stalls so this this
 

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.050
told us not to UI stalls so this this
relates to the single threaded

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060
relates to the single threaded
 

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.390
relates to the single threaded
multi-threaded UI thread the situation

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400
multi-threaded UI thread the situation
 

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.830
multi-threaded UI thread the situation
that we talked about it before there's

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:13.840
that we talked about it before there's
 

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.359
that we talked about it before there's
lots of things that can cause us to

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:15.369
lots of things that can cause us to
 

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.370
lots of things that can cause us to

processing so it's good to be wary of

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.210
processing so it's good to be wary of
 

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.210
processing so it's good to be wary of
these when you're inflating resources

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:21.220
these when you're inflating resources
 

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.950
these when you're inflating resources
that's always on the UI thread so if

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960
that's always on the UI thread so if
 

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.480
that's always on the UI thread so if
you're doing a particularly expensive

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:24.490
you're doing a particularly expensive
 

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:27.120
you're doing a particularly expensive
inflation if you're launching a super

or if you have a deep hierarchy that

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:31.840
or if you have a deep hierarchy that
 

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.320
or if you have a deep hierarchy that
you're inflating along the way then that

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:34.330
you're inflating along the way then that
 

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.490
you're inflating along the way then that
may take enough time that you're gonna

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:35.500
may take enough time that you're gonna
 

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.190
may take enough time that you're gonna
Jack a frame because of that handling

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200
Jack a frame because of that handling
 

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.990
Jack a frame because of that handling
events there are some places where

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000
events there are some places where
 

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.640
events there are some places where
expensive operations won't be that

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
expensive operations won't be that
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.020
expensive operations won't be that
noticeable for instance when you click

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:46.030
noticeable for instance when you click
 

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.660
noticeable for instance when you click
on a button but then the places where

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:48.670
on a button but then the places where
 

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.130
on a button but then the places where
you want to really be careful so

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:50.140
you want to really be careful so
 

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.330
you want to really be careful so
handling events that we just talked

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:51.340
handling events that we just talked
 

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.310
handling events that we just talked
about so on touch event then there's the

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:53.320
about so on touch event then there's the
 

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.349
about so on touch event then there's the
on measurements that that's part of the

00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359
on measurements that that's part of the
 

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:57.810
on measurements that that's part of the
layout so you can keep going through the

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:57.820
layout so you can keep going through the
 

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.840
layout so you can keep going through the
slides there we go okay the on layout

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:00.850
slides there we go okay the on layout
 

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:04.859
slides there we go okay the on layout
the ondraw going and animations of

00:37:04.859 --> 00:37:04.869
the ondraw going and animations of
 

00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:06.870
the ondraw going and animations of
course are gonna trigger all those all

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880
course are gonna trigger all those all
 

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.500
course are gonna trigger all those all
those callbacks

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.510
those callbacks
 

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.599
those callbacks
so does those are really do places where

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:09.609
so does those are really do places where
 

00:37:09.609 --> 00:37:11.370
so does those are really do places where
you want to optimize your code where you

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:11.380
you want to optimize your code where you
 

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.010
you want to optimize your code where you
want to you know use this trace use the

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.020
want to you know use this trace use the
 

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.140
want to you know use this trace use the
profiler use the GPU profiler if you

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.150
profiler use the GPU profiler if you
 

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.240
profiler use the GPU profiler if you
have to use tracer for OpenGL ES and

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:18.250
have to use tracer for OpenGL ES and
 

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.640
have to use tracer for OpenGL ES and
it's okay thing to apply some micro

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:20.650
it's okay thing to apply some micro
 

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.050
it's okay thing to apply some micro
optimizations in the species of code

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:22.060
optimizations in the species of code
 

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.000
optimizations in the species of code
because they are so important that said

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.010
because they are so important that said
 

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.790
because they are so important that said
mentioned if you have 16 more seconds to

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800
mentioned if you have 16 more seconds to
 

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.650
mentioned if you have 16 more seconds to
do everything you have to do and turns

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:28.660
do everything you have to do and turns
 

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.050
do everything you have to do and turns
out that in the land of mobile 16

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.060
out that in the land of mobile 16
 

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.050
out that in the land of mobile 16
milliseconds have a different direction

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060
milliseconds have a different direction
 

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.580
milliseconds have a different direction
so depending on how fast your CPU is

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:35.590
so depending on how fast your CPU is
 

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.830
so depending on how fast your CPU is
going a millisecond might not be the

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:37.840
going a millisecond might not be the
 

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.859
going a millisecond might not be the
same as the frame before so 16

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:40.869
same as the frame before so 16
 

00:37:40.869 --> 00:37:42.930
same as the frame before so 16
milliseconds some time will be really

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:42.940
milliseconds some time will be really
 

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.940
milliseconds some time will be really
hard to hit you might also run into

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:44.950
hard to hit you might also run into
 

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:46.230
hard to hit you might also run into
issues and that's an interesting one

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240
issues and that's an interesting one
 

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.280
issues and that's an interesting one
where if you optimize your code too much

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:49.290
where if you optimize your code too much
 

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:52.050
where if you optimize your code too much
we're going to slow down the CPU so then

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:52.060
we're going to slow down the CPU so then
 

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.150
we're going to slow down the CPU so then
your code runs slower and then you're

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160
your code runs slower and then you're
 

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.910
your code runs slower and then you're
not going to be able to go fast enough

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920
not going to be able to go fast enough
 

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.150
not going to be able to go fast enough
we that happened to us before and so the

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160
we that happened to us before and so the
 

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.250
we that happened to us before and so the
system tries to take that into account

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:02.260
system tries to take that into account
 

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.830
system tries to take that into account
but if you run into that well good luck

all of them will measure the children

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:52.990
all of them will measure the children
 

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.870
all of them will measure the children
twice and so what happens when you

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880
twice and so what happens when you
 

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.060
twice and so what happens when you
measure the children twice is that if

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.070
measure the children twice is that if
 

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.680
measure the children twice is that if
some of those children's are view groups

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:58.690
some of those children's are view groups
 

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.240
some of those children's are view groups
themselves like cleaner layouts or

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:00.250
themselves like cleaner layouts or
 

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.910
themselves like cleaner layouts or
relative layouts and those cause their

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920
relative layouts and those cause their
 

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.980
relative layouts and those cause their
own children to be measured twice then

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:04.990
own children to be measured twice then
 

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.360
own children to be measured twice then
those children's have been measured four

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:06.370
those children's have been measured four
 

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:07.920
those children's have been measured four
times already so we have some

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:07.930
times already so we have some
 

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.480
times already so we have some
optimizations in the framework to

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.490
optimizations in the framework to
 

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.700
optimizations in the framework to
alleviate that issue and especially

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:11.710
alleviate that issue and especially
 

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:14.700
alleviate that issue and especially
starting with KitKat the optimizations

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:14.710
starting with KitKat the optimizations
 

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.590
starting with KitKat the optimizations
have gotten a lot better but you can

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:16.600
have gotten a lot better but you can
 

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.210
have gotten a lot better but you can
imagine that if you have you know 10 12

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:18.220
imagine that if you have you know 10 12
 

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.910
imagine that if you have you know 10 12

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.070
or 16 nested layouts and every one of
them measures the children twice you're

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.080
them measures the children twice you're
 

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.200
them measures the children twice you're
going to spend a lot of time doing your

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.210
going to spend a lot of time doing your
 

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.200
going to spend a lot of time doing your
measure on your layout so be careful be

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.210
measure on your layout so be careful be
 

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.210
measure on your layout so be careful be
careful with relative layout and linear

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:30.220
careful with relative layout and linear

child with a weight will be measured

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:35.410
child with a weight will be measured
 

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.160
child with a weight will be measured
twice so just just be careful measure

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:38.170
twice so just just be careful measure
 

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.680
twice so just just be careful measure

watch your activities fast present the

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:45.850
watch your activities fast present the
 

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.520
watch your activities fast present the
UI quickly so that's the certainly the

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:47.530
UI quickly so that's the certainly the
 

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.840
UI quickly so that's the certainly the
purpose of the starting window but it's

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:48.850
purpose of the starting window but it's
 

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.610
purpose of the starting window but it's
also nice if you can present the real

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:50.620
also nice if you can present the real
 

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.410
also nice if you can present the real
content as quickly as possible so the

allocated eventually right you don't
 

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.300
allocated eventually right you don't
have to do that at startup and make the

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:12.310
have to do that at startup and make the
 

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.950
have to do that at startup and make the

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960
user wait every time they launch this
 

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.050
user wait every time they launch this
thing instead you can wait and do it

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:16.060
thing instead you can wait and do it
 

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.640

don't know about the current launcher

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:25.930
don't know about the current launcher

don't know about the current launcher
but back in the old days loading all the

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960
but back in the old days loading all the
 

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.500
but back in the old days loading all the
icons from from this from all the apk s

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:31.510
icons from from this from all the apk s
 

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.910
icons from from this from all the apk s
to present the grid of icons was

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920
to present the grid of icons was
 

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.680
to present the grid of icons was
extremely expensive and it takes several

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:34.690
extremely expensive and it takes several
 

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:35.250
extremely expensive and it takes several
seconds

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:35.260
seconds
 

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.559
seconds
so what launcher was doing was loading

00:40:37.559 --> 00:40:37.569
so what launcher was doing was loading
 

00:40:37.569 --> 00:40:39.870
so what launcher was doing was loading
three icons at a time and after loading

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880
three icons at a time and after loading
 

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.760
three icons at a time and after loading
three icons it will post a message in

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:41.770
three icons it will post a message in
 

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.250
three icons it will post a message in
the UI queue to ask itself to go to the

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:44.260
the UI queue to ask itself to go to the
 

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.960
the UI queue to ask itself to go to the
next three icons so if you are fast

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:45.970
next three icons so if you are fast
 

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.279
next three icons so if you are fast
enough and you open the grid of icons

00:40:47.279 --> 00:40:47.289
enough and you open the grid of icons
 

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:48.870
enough and you open the grid of icons
you would see them being loaded by

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880
you would see them being loaded by
 

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.240
you would see them being loaded by
batches of like three or six but that

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:51.250
batches of like three or six but that
 

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.859
batches of like three or six but that
was the idea so we could start the

00:40:52.859 --> 00:40:52.869
was the idea so we could start the
 

00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:54.630
was the idea so we could start the
application stuff really quickly under

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640
application stuff really quickly under
 

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.549
application stuff really quickly under
half a second but then it would keep

00:40:56.549 --> 00:40:56.559
half a second but then it would keep
 

00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:58.890
half a second but then it would keep
building its own UI kind of under the

00:40:58.890 --> 00:40:58.900
building its own UI kind of under the
 

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:02.010
building its own UI kind of under the
hood and if you do it right and all of

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:02.020
hood and if you do it right and all of
 

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.839
hood and if you do it right and all of
it will be off screen anyway and I'm

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:03.849
it will be off screen anyway and I'm
 

00:41:03.849 --> 00:41:05.370
it will be off screen anyway and I'm
sure like most of you have never noticed

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:05.380
sure like most of you have never noticed
 

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.230
sure like most of you have never noticed

long it's taking for your application to
 

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.589
long it's taking for your application to
launch and then work on that optimize it

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599

faster than seven seconds but then how

00:41:23.339 --> 00:41:23.349
faster than seven seconds but then how
 

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:24.839
faster than seven seconds but then how
do you actually verify that your work

00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:24.849
do you actually verify that your work
 

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:27.390
do you actually verify that your work
has been worth it if you launch the

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400
has been worth it if you launch the
 

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.490
has been worth it if you launch the
application you know I'm that thing and

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:29.500
application you know I'm that thing and
 

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.589
application you know I'm that thing and
actually I posted something on my blog

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599
actually I posted something on my blog
 

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:34.200
actually I posted something on my blog
recently a couple weeks ago about ways

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:34.210
recently a couple weeks ago about ways
 

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.519
recently a couple weeks ago about ways
to do that basically there's a really

00:41:35.519 --> 00:41:35.529
to do that basically there's a really
 

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:38.130
to do that basically there's a really
helpful log now that will just tell you

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:38.140
helpful log now that will just tell you
 

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.049
helpful log now that will just tell you
how long this thing took and then some

00:41:40.049 --> 00:41:40.059
how long this thing took and then some
 

00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:41.819
how long this thing took and then some
of the details about that I put on my

00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:41.829
of the details about that I put on my
 

00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:44.970
of the details about that I put on my
blog recently anyway measure that like

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:44.980
blog recently anyway measure that like
 

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.680
blog recently anyway measure that like
on launch and see what that number is

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:46.690
on launch and see what that number is
 

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.150
on launch and see what that number is
and then if you put that in the

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160
and then if you put that in the
 

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.680
and then if you put that in the
background and then you launch it from

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:49.690
background and then you launch it from
 

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.240
background and then you launch it from
the icon again that's not the same

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:51.250
the icon again that's not the same
 

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.039
the icon again that's not the same
number that's called a warm start right

00:41:53.039 --> 00:41:53.049

application and the interesting thing
 

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.720
application and the interesting thing
that was happening was the application

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:27.730
that was happening was the application

has a lower priority so the UI thread

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680
has a lower priority so the UI thread
 

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.950
has a lower priority so the UI thread
was mostly idle waiting for lower

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960
was mostly idle waiting for lower
 

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.589

splash screen that's like tuned to their
 

00:43:28.579 --> 00:43:29.829
splash screen that's like tuned to their
application things so they have their

00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839
application things so they have their
 

00:43:29.839 --> 00:43:31.240
application things so they have their

starting window which has nothing to do
 

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:40.030
starting window which has nothing to do
with the other ones so you get a

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040
with the other ones so you get a
 

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.740

don't don't go with the sad window so
 

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:53.980
don't don't go with the sad window so
they bring up this one then after three

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:53.990
they bring up this one then after three
 

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.059
they bring up this one then after three
seconds they'll bring up their home

00:43:55.059 --> 00:43:55.069

information in the starting window to

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:00.980
information in the starting window to
 

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.079

better if you want a splash screen

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:11.180
better if you want a splash screen
 

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.569
better if you want a splash screen
experience just tune the starting window
