00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.197
x =2.

00:00:01.197 --> 00:00:06.620
Now we're adding another step to
our process of solving equations.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.160
Just a note I've written
that steps to solve for

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.590
x but this applies for any variable.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.800
So it can be x or it can be a or
b or c or anything you want.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.690
So the step that we need to
add is actually something that

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.820
we should do before these other two
steps, so we'll just move that down.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.280
So now the first step that we need to
do before these other two steps is

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.420
we need to clear fractions by
multiplying both sides of the equation

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.170
by a common denominator.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.570
Three, six and two all go into six.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.500
So six is the least common
denominator we should use.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.450
We will multiply both sides by six.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.643
Distributing six within
the parentheses we get six

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:56.485
thirds x minus six over
six equals six over two.

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.890
We'll simplify this a bit.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.880
Six thirds is two so 2x.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.610
And six over six is one so
2x- 1 = 6/2, that's 3.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.180
Now we can get to our next
step which is to add or

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.408
subtract to get the variable term alone.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:19.285
So we need to add one to both sides and

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:22.868
we get 2x + 0 = 3 + 1.

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:26.968
That's really 2x = 4.

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:31.810
And now we can multiply or divide so
the coefficient on the variables is one.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.470
We'll divide both sides by two.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.536
We cross out the two and
we get x = 4 / 2.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:41.330
4 / 2 is just 2.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.426
So x = 2.
