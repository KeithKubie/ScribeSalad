00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:09.354
I think one of the 
most important skill sets

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:11.274
is facilitation skills,

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:14.718
so being able to facilitate conversations

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.153
and even mediate in places

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:19.940
where people don't necessarily agree.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.607
So, I really think building better facilitation skills

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:26.115
is one good item for the toolbox.
