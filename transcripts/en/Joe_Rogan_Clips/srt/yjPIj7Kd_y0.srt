1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,860
Um, the point that we keep
getting away from them,

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:08,720
I haven't had an opportunity to,
um,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,130
and Stephanie knows this as well as I do.

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,310
If you're gaining say
four pounds a year of fat,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,150
or let's say between 20 and 40,
you've put on 40 extra pounds.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,680
So now you're obese or a nice
lean, healthy young guy in
20, like many of us were.

7
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:26,280
And by the time you're 40,
you've got 40 pounds of excess fat.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,490
That's the equivalent of putting in
about the 10 calories that she had to

9
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,950
storing about 10 calories a day into
your fat tissue that you don't burn them

10
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:41,040
metabolize. So you eat,
say 2,700 calories a day,

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,880
half carbs, you know, 35% fat,

12
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:49,881
15% protein and 10 calories that they get
trapped in your fat tissue less than a

13
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,410
bytes worth of food,
less than a sips worth of beer.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,510
So the question or actually trying to
ask is our answer, and this is again,

15
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:04,980
just my approach as a curious journalists
too with a science background is how

16
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,810
do we explain those 10 calories?

17
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:10,560
Because when we talk about those
obese woman with starving children,

18
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:15,390
all those obese women were doing was
storing 10 or 20 calories a day depending

19
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,930
on how quickly they became obese and
those populations that tends to happen

20
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:23,490
quickly in their 20s. Um, so we're
asking this question, how do we,

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,070
if you've got a situation where we have
to end up with 10 calories stuck in the

22
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:33,570
fat cells every day, that's
20, 30, 40 billion fat cells.

23
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:38,400
So it's divided up very small.
And is the brain somehow regulating that?

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,310
Or again, is there a dysregulation
in the body involving,

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,750
pick your hormones, pick your
enzymes when the one, um,

26
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,930
that somehow traps fat in the fat cells
or prevents the fat from being used for

27
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:59,031
fuel when it's released from the fat cells
until if you think about it that way,

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,200
like you let yourself go to seed today,
Joe Rogan decides I'm done.

29
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm going to do nothing but drink beer.

30
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:10,290
And you might start drinking five beers
a day and over the course of 10 years

31
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:15,240
you get 20 pounds and it's all here. That
20 pounds over the course of 10 years,

32
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,740
it's the only about 20 calories.

33
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,741
You might've added 800 calories of beer
to your diet and stored 20 calories as

34
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:26,220
fat. How does that happen?
And why does it go here

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,360
and not elsewhere in his step and said,

36
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:34,950
this is insulin dependent
fat tissue. Um, so those are,

37
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,140
that's when we're talking about this,
like this question,

38
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:42,110
could somebody get fat during a famine
or can they stay fat during a famine?

39
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,540
All they have to do is hold
on to 10 calories a day extra.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,840
If they're only eating 1,210
gets stuck in their fat cells,

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,960
1,190 is excoriated are expended.

42
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,030
It's not that hard to imagine.

43
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,540
And there's nothing in the laws of that
says it to what could be dysregulated

44
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:06,480
about their fat cells, even during a
relative fam and not a complete famine,

45
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,070
but a relative family that might be,
and again,

46
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:13,510
an animal experiments of which
there are probably hundreds by now,

47
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,710
different animal models.

48
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,820
You can disassociate obesity from hype,

49
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:22,120
from eating too much in the animal.
Can I pause you for a second? Yeah,

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,090
yeah. So essentially you're saying
that even if someone is taking in, uh,

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,550
uh, a good amount of calories at the,
uh, the, uh, smart amount of calories,

52
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,810
2000 calories a day,

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,770
if you're taking in these
calories in the form of sugar,

54
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,610
your body is going to take a
certain percentage of them,

55
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:43,430
even if you're getting enough
food and stored as fat.

56
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Whereas if you were taking in just protein
and vegetables and things along those

57
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:51,030
lines of your body would not

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,731
do that well.

59
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,290
So this is the gets to them mechanism
question and the evidence question.

60
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,810
So what you're saying that,
right,

61
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,420
so you're saying that if two
people are on the same diet,

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,700
one of us on 2000 calories of chicken
and fish and vegetables and the other one

63
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:10,701
is on 2000 calories of milkshakes and
no sugary drinks and pasta and bullshit,

64
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,870
that that person is going
to gain a certain amount of
calories and just put them

65
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:19,580
to fat.

66
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,630
Right? Regardless that's,
yeah, that's the hype.

67
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,550
Vivity this being a science at
hypothesis can be tested. Yes. Stephan,

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,710
thanks. It's been tested 80 times,
Steph, at times. I think it's,

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,750
they've done a bad job of testing it and
we will both tend to reject the studies

70
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:42,470
that we don't like and then we defined
on light by whether or not they got the

71
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:43,520
answer we think is great.

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,360
Your perspective that
this is not the case,

73
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,140
your perspective is that like as you
were saying in this study with a closely

74
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:52,810
monitored these people's diets and
they added additional fat in a,

75
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,350
an additional carbohydrates that they
both gained the same additional amounts.

76
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,310
Yeah, that's right. I mean if
cares is a shot, this is correct.

77
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,470
You have to see different levels
of fat gain. I mean, Gary's,

78
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,190
the short term study that they
did was how short term was it?

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,150
Two and three weeks. That's very
short. Yeah. It is very short term,

80
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:15,151
but still Gary says that insulin is the
thing that gets fat in fat cells and

81
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,980
that, I mean you would see
some kind of difference.

82
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,790
It insulin made any difference. You
should've seen some kind of effect, right?

83
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,820
Some kind of difference in
fat gain. I actually, um,

84
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't want to start taking out charts,

85
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,480
but this gets intense when dynamics
that was worked out so over, uh,

86
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,590
um, I promised I wasn't
going to say boy, Oh boy,

87
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,620
oh boy on the show. But it's my
thanks to my Brooklyn born mother.

88
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,590
It's my program then.
Um,

89
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,560
and they the same is true.

90
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,110
A lot of these overfeeding
experiments do the same thing.

91
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:54,340
So when they talk about over feeding,
they, they, they literally overfeed.

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,460
So they kind of do a reasonable way
of figuring out which reading is,

93
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,070
Stephen said they measured,
uh,

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,000
they calculated how much energy they
needed to stay in energy and balance.

95
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,170
And again,
right there,

96
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:11,171
that's a problem because one of the
hypotheses says that the energy balance is

97
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:14,720
dependent on the macronutrient
content of the food.

98
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,550
So you're going to get a different,

99
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,790
different level depending on what
the macronutrient content is and then

100
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,790
different level of, of what, what's
necessary for energy balance.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,780
So the classic example is a study
that's my not for profit funded,

102
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,560
that's been very controversial where they

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,050
got their subjects.

104
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:44,700
This is David Ludwig and Cara ambling and
their their colleagues at that Harvard

105
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:48,150
and Boston Children's hospital. And they
did this study in Framingham and they,

106
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,780
they basically got a subjects to lose a
10 or 12% of their body weight and then

107
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:58,860
they randomize them to
three different diets,

108
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:01,500
have three different
macronutrient composition.

109
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:05,640
And they basically calculated their
energy expenditure on the three different

110
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:06,121
diets,

111
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:10,200
which is kind of exactly what we're
talking about because if you want to be an

112
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:14,310
energy balance, who know, you feed
people exactly what they're expanding.

113
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,730
And in that study,
which was published a year ago,

114
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:22,670
and they saw different levels of
energy expenditure depending on the

115
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:27,110
carbohydrate content of the Diet.
So the higher level of carbohydrates,

116
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:32,090
this is trying to keep them in energy
balance. The, the higher the carbohydrate,

117
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,870
the lower the energy expenditure,
the lower the carbohydrate,

118
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,330
the higher the energy expenditure.
So again,

119
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,180
it's just whether or not they
did this study, right? Who knows.

120
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:45,500
Science is a compilation of a lot of
studies and we're trying to, you know,

121
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:48,230
address exactly this point,
but

122
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,980
merely building that into the experiment.

123
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,470
We know what their energy
expenditure shouldn't be.

124
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,530
And then the point is when
you increase in part, again,

125
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:02,400
part of the trick of doing science is to
say, look, we have competing hypotheses,

126
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,360
uh,

127
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,360
multiple hypotheses and it's
vitally important that you
always keep the multiple

128
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:12,990
hypotheses in mind when
you're interpreting the study.

129
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:16,950
So one hypothesis says it's how much
they eat and another hypothesis says it's

130
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:21,660
what they eat and that what they eat is,
is moderated primarily through insulin.

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,540
And when you do these experiments,
like the experiment that, that uh,

132
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,670
Steve, Steven is talking
about, Stephan, um, no,

133
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,570
I'm completely confused.
Uh, if you overfeed them,

134
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:40,260
you start out with a 50% carb diet.
Now you overfeed them.

135
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,390
If there's a threshold effect on insulin,
which turns out there is,

136
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,270
and you're just moving them.
And when you look at insulin dynamics,

137
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:50,220
when insulin is below a very low point,

138
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:54,150
the fat cells will mobilize
fat and the lean tissue,

139
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:57,690
we'll burn it for own. Above that
point, you get pretty much flat.

140
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,170
So if you start people who are eating
1500 calories from carbs and you add them,

141
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,540
pump them up to 2,500 calories from carbs
are still in the plateau side of the

142
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,750
incident. You wouldn't necessarily
expect to see any difference.

143
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,060
The only way you expect
to see a difference,

144
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:20,061
and that's why it helps
to really interrogate both
hypotheses so that you know

145
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,750
when you're doing the experiment,

146
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,470
whether or not you're actually
testing something, you one hypothesis,

147
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,560
you want to set up the experiments
that all hypothesis predicts.

148
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,500
The two hypotheses predict
something entirely different.

149
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,790
This experiment with arguably the two
hypotheses predict the same thing.

150
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,000
You'll get fat gain because
insulin is elevated regardless,

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,270
and when insulin is elevated,
you're going to get fat gain.

152
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,650
The question comes back to it. This,
again, always vital to keep this in mind.

153
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,650
We want to what could possibly cause at
10 or 20 calorie excess that causes fat

154
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:56,700
storage. I have a friend who was
four to 400 pounds when he was 18.

155
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,080
It was a tall kid, about six
foot five. Um, he was, uh,

156
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,840
say 200 pounds over weight,

157
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,180
200 pounds overweight is roughly a hundred
excess calories over 18 years stored

158
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,790
in your fat cells. That's, you know,

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
even if you assume that you have to
consume 300 calories to have 100 excess

160
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,200
stored in your fat
cells, that's, you know,

161
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,290
one to Coca Cola is a day that he was
drinking or one half a quarterpounder a

162
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:30,540
day that he was eating that is lean
friends weren't in. The question would be,

163
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,590
why can't he just stop doing that again,
Stephanie would say,

164
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:39,591
cause there's brain won't let him and
I would say because his insulin is

165
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:42,630
elevated, it doesn't matter
whether he stops it or not,

166
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,800
he's got into addressing
underlying mechanisms. Okay. Okay.

167
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,750
Um, all right. So now again,

168
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,250
it's easy to tell stories.

169
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,810
It's not easy to tell stories that are
supported by scientific evidence. Now,

170
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,673
um,

171
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,880
I want to bring people's attention
to reference number 11 on my site.

172
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,390
There have been 29 studies now that
have measured differences in energy

173
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:12,140
expenditure, metabolic or Kevin
Hall study met analysis. Correct.

174
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,120
There have been 29 studies to date
that I've measured calorie expenditure,

175
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:21,680
metabolic rate on diets differing
in carbohydrate and fat content.

176
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,990
And when you put all
those studies together,

177
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,220
when you are at least the first 28
together and you look at what the overall

178
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,270
literature says,

179
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,380
it makes almost no difference to
metabolic rate whether people are eating

180
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:34,820
carbohydrate or fat.

181
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:39,710
And in fact this very small difference
that it does make actually favors high

182
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:44,711
carbohydrate diets so you get a slightly
higher metabolic rate when the Diet is

183
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,670
predominantly carbohydrate.

184
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,090
Now this study that Gary cited is the
one study out of these 29 that has

185
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,880
reported a larger effect in any others
of carbohydrate restriction on energy

186
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:58,441
expenditure.

187
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:03,280
So this study reported in effect
bigger than any of these other 28 and

188
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,810
difference. We went on this.
You're not done, please. Thank you.

189
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,230
Um, and, and interestingly,

190
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,310
if you actually look at the data and
these data have been Rhea analyzed by a

191
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:19,120
researcher named Kevin Hall.
And if you look at the data,

192
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,790
you find that some of the participants,

193
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:26,680
some of the data that represents some
of these participants are literally

194
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,550
physically impossible. They break
the first law of thermodynamics.

195
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,010
This is the conservation of energy.
Gary knows about this.

196
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:36,790
He has a physics background and
they literally don't add up.

197
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,560
And when you start subtracting the earth,

198
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,640
the clearly erroneous data
from the pool of subjects,

199
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,040
this big effect size starts to shrink
and shrink and shrink and shrink until

200
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:53,860
after you've gotten rid of all of it.
This study does no longer,

201
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,750
no longer reports a higher
energy expenditure on a
very low carbohydrate diet.

202
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,740
And it's consistent with the
previous 28 studies that were done.

203
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,400
So that's my perspective on that.
But I want to go back to this. No,

204
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,540
no dare you taught for a long time and
I'm going to talk for as long as I want

205
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,010
now.
Um,

206
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,690
I wanna I want to talk about human
energy metabolism and this idea of the 10

207
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:19,380
extra calories a day. Gary, I,

208
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,250
I really continue to get the feeling that
you do not understand human energetics.

209
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,320
Um,
because that's not how it works.

210
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,160
Now I'm just saying 10 calories
stored in the fat tissue. 10 calories,

211
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,840
10 calories and say anything about how
much you have to eat. I'm not done. Okay.

212
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,990
No, but you're in top thing. We
carry. Got To stop doing that dude.

213
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,110
Gary back thing like you think I'm an
idiot. All right. Are you done now?

214
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,800
Are you done? Can we be clear that
we're talking about you done now?

215
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,270
Can I just finish this? No, you can't
do until I am done without Gary.

216
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,940
You have time to respond.
You can respond,

217
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,660
write down notes on what
you want to respond to and
after he's done you can tell

218
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,660
them, but we're going to get
out [inaudible] course on this.

219
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:03,220
The thing that's not the point.
No. Is this line. Thank you. Okay.

220
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,800
Now what you see,

221
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,680
there's basically two things you need
to pay attention to here in terms of

222
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,514
energetics.

223
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,960
One is the imbalance between
intake and expenditure,

224
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,310
and that is very small,

225
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,630
so it only takes a little bit of extra
calories to cause somebody to start

226
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:23,740
gaining fat. However, as they
gain fat, their bodies get bigger.

227
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,840
They're gaining fat and lean mass.

228
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,700
People with obesity have more fat and
more lean mass and their calorie needs go

229
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,120
up and up and up and up.
The larger their bodies get.

230
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,310
And so even though the imbalance between
energy and taking expenditure is small,

231
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,510
their calorie needs end up being quite
a bit higher. Can I pause for a second?

232
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah, so you're saying that
someone just gaining calories,

233
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,920
eating additional calories,
their body gains lean mass as well.

234
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,680
That's because fat. How is the brain
regulate that? I didn't say it. Regulated.

235
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:57,250
Medical doctor, Garrick Guy.
Hold on. So fascinating.

236
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,530
Like how does the brain muscle muscle,
they're gaining muscle tissue.

237
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,560
Some of its muscles.
Some of it's okay.

238
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,770
It's just because they're carrying
around this extra weight and so the extra

239
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:12,530
calories and then on top of that carrying
around the extra weight forces their

240
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:17,330
body to grow larger. Presumably, I'm, I'm
actually not sure what the mechanism is,

241
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,570
but it doesn't have anything to
do with the brain. Coincidence.

242
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,310
I don't know what causes it. That's
what I'm saying, Gary. Okay. Now, um,

243
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,740
so,
so,

244
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:31,730
but the point is by the
time the person has obesity,

245
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,780
they are consuming 20 to 35% more calories
than they were when they were lean.

246
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,780
So that's not just a one or two cokes
a day that is allowing them to remain

247
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,410
obese. They are consuming
20 to 35% more calories.

248
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,660
That is what the most
accurate studies are saying.

249
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,110
And so it's not just 10 extra calories
or maybe just one or two cokes.

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,020
We're talking about a substantial amount
of extra calories and it's not as a

251
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,940
generalization because we
don't know what I mean,

252
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,640
what's the ratio of how
much fat people get out,

253
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,850
how much weight people are
gaining. Everybody gains a
different amount of weight.

254
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,240
Like you're saying,
they're eating 20 to 30% more cowards.

255
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,990
Like who is like how many people, how much
are they gaining? Like people get fat,

256
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,970
they get 20 pounds overweight.
People get fat,

257
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:19,670
they get a hundred pounds overweight.
They made a very, that's right. Yeah,

258
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,660
and that's why I give a range because
what you see is that people who are

259
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,380
overweight, so they're in the overweight
range, you just have some extra fat.

260
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,870
They eat about 10% extra calories.

261
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,890
People who have a little bit of
obesity eat about 20% extra calories.

262
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,770
People who have,
who are very have very,

263
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:41,150
very great obesity eat more like
35% is it packs with the amount,

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,811
I'm sorry,

265
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:46,550
is it possible what he was saying that
if you do consume 10 extra calories over

266
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:50,000
long periods of time that will
accumulate extra calories.

267
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:54,500
You're accumulating hours,
like 10 diamonds going into it is,

268
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,540
so how much do you have to deposit?
Correct.

269
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,280
It is correct that if every day you eat
10 calories more than what you need,

270
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,790
then yes. Or get bodies or your
body stores. Yeah. We'll say that.

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,600
If your body is storing 10% 10 10 extra
calories over top of what you need,

272
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,170
but the thing is that as you get bigger,
what you need goes up and up and up.

273
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,550
Because you're carrying around more.
Correct. And so it's 10% in text or cow,

274
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,391
sorry,
not percent.

275
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:28,391
It's 10 extra calories on
top of the elevated amount
that you're already eating.

276
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,070
So you end up with these big differences
in calories take. So that's how,

277
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,000
that's how it really works.
