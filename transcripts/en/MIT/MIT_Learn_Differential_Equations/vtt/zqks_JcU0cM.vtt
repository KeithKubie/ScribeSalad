00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.000
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.490
So today is unforced--
that means zero

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.830
on the right-hand side, looking
for null solutions-- damped--

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.560
that means there
is a coefficient B

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.600
in the first derivative.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.250
And what's the solution?

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.790
This is really a
basic, basic equation.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.130
In many applications,
A would be the mass.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.750
In a spring, for example,
A would be a mass.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.250
B is the damping, the friction.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.290
And C is the spring
constant, the force

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010
that pulls the mass back.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.240
Or in electronics, B
would be the resistance.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.060
It's giving some friction,
giving some heat.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.720
So that's our equation.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.460
Just we have to be
able to solve it.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.630
And we want to look
for exponentials.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.970
A pure exponential is just
right for a constant coefficient

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.420
equation like that.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.240
So I'll substitute y equals e
to the st. And what happens?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650
Well, so there's a C e
to the st. That's a Cy.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.880
The derivative brings down an s.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.950
Two derivatives
bring down s squared.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.530
So I simply have As
squared, Bs, and C

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.760
all together, multiplying e
to the st. And how'd I get 0?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.430
Well the 0 is not going
to come from e to the st,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.720
so it has to come from this.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.140
So fundamentally, the
whole video and more

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.470
is about a quadratic equation.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.390
As squared plus Bs
plus C equals 0.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.520
We have to solve it.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.110
We have to understand how
does the answer depend

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.230
on these numbers, A and
B and C, the constants?

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.160
OK?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.500
So we know the route.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.460
We know the solutions.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.699
The quadratic formula tells us
that the two solutions-- there

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.570
are always two,
but they could be

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.110
equal-- have this-- do you
recognize this expression?

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:24.540
You see the damping
coefficient coming in.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.030
You see this all
important square root,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.580
which tells us, depending
on whether B squared is

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.985
bigger than 4AC, B
squared is equal 4AC,

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:36.860
B squared is smaller.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.790
So smaller B means less damping.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.160
And it would be
called underdamping..

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.930
So here are the possibilities.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.810
B could be 0.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.760
That puts us back
in a previous video

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.110
when the solution was a pure
complex exponential, pure sine

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.660
cosine.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.400
There was no damping.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.700
It just oscillated forever.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.850
That's the one we know.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.220
Now, the new ones with a B are
B squared could be smaller.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.520
So that's only a little damping.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.100
And in that case, what does
the solution look like?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.320
If B squared is
smaller than 4AC,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.550
I have to always look back here.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.040
So I have something negative.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.020
Something negative,
a minus B over 2A.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.630
And then plus or
minus-- and what's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.320
important point about this guy?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.470
B squared is smarter than 4AC.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.380
This is negative inside.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.070
So its square root is
an imaginary number.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.660
So the plus or minus,
there's an imaginary number.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260
A little different from
the natural frequency.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.300
It's called the damp frequency.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.740
Not quite as frequent.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.820
The damping slows the
oscillation down a little bit,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.570
but it brings in
exponential decay.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.010
I'll draw a picture this time
or next time of the solution,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.890
e to the minus st.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.240
But you see, e to the
minus st is decaying to 0.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.920
It's like a spring that's
slowly winding down to 0.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.950
But it's oscillating
as it does it.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.630
OK.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.380
Now, we've got two more
possibilities here.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.990
And these are just
fun to get straight.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.410
There's the next one.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.670
When B squared is exactly 4AC.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.470
Exactly 4AC.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.000
B squared over 4AC, that's going
to be the critical ratio here.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.650
And here that ratio is 1.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.700
And in that case, that
square root is nothing.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.860
The square root of B
squared minus 4AC is 0.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.440
So we get s1 and s2 equal.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.600
Two equal frequencies.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.610
Real numbers.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.410
They're the minus B over 2A.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.490
So s1 and s2 are
both minus B over 2A.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:28.660
That's just the edge between
the decay with oscillation

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.300
from underdamping.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.440
And the opposite
extreme is overdamping.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.940
Overdamping, when B
squared is bigger than 4AC,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.510
then our formula-- we're
always looking back

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.360
at that quadratic formula.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.680
B squared bigger than
4AC, this is real.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.350
Square root of a
positive number.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.340
It's perfectly real.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.510
So in that case, we
have two, s1 and s2.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.330
Oh, let me draw
you some pictures.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.530
I'll draw you the
parabola, the As squared.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.040
So this is a graph
of As squared.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:16.530
Let me plot As squared
plus Bs plus C.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.880
So in this overdamping case,
we might have a lot of damping.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.520
B is pretty large.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:30.160
And that would be--
this direction is s.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.740
And I'm graphing here s squared
plus-- well, let me see.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.130
I think probably plus 2s.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:50.520
And now I'm going to
choose this-- oh, actually,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.010
plus 0 to get that one.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.750
So this has a root at--
this is overdamping.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.250
Overdamping.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.320
A big number there.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.780
C is 0.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.180
No mass at all.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.650
No stiffness at all.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:20.190
So this parabola has a root
at 0 and a root at minus 2.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.800
That would be an extreme case
with no stiffness whatever.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.790
Now, let me add some stiffness.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.250
So what happens if I
change the constant term?

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.900
It lifts the graph.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.040
It lifts the graph.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.750
So let me make it 1.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.950
So I move the whole
graph up by 1.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.560
So you see that as I
move it up, these roots

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.330
will come closer and closer.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.450
And at the right point,
when I move it up to 1,

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.290
what's going on there?

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.600
Critical damping.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.550
Critical damping.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.537
This is the case s
squared plus 2s plus 1.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.470
Which is exactly s plus 1 twice.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.250
And it has that repeated
root, which we always

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:25.590
recognized as the marginal
case when it doesn't go below,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.350
but it doesn't
stay above either.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.970
It hits here twice.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.309
So the root is minus 1 twice.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.090
That's critical.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.530
And now what?

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.679
Increase this constant
C even further.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.490
You'll lift the graph,
lift the parabola up here.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.090
Lift it by one more, let's say.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.180
And what's going on there?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:58.070
So this would be s
squared plus 2s plus 2.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:03.260
And you see what that
graph is telling us.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.370
It's telling us there are
no roots, no real roots.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.250
This is a real graph in the
real plane, and it's never 0.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.750
This is s plus 1.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:28.540
This is the case when I have
s plus 1 squared plus 1.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.480
Can't be 0.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.790
Never 0.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:38.920
So this has-- sorry.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.310
With the 2 there,
it has damping.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.640
It has damping, but
it's underdamping.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.230
The roots are complex.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.590
So this s plus 1 squared is 0.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.290
What are the roots of that?

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.980
s is minus 1 plus or minus i.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.600
That's the case of underdamping.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.884
So let me write that.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.920
We see so much
from these graphs.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.810
So this was a graph
in which I changed

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:25.760
the constant term, the
capital C, the stiffness, k.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.450
So that lifted the graph.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.930
And eventually the
roots were complex.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.130
They weren't real anymore,
because the parabola

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.940
didn't cross the axis anymore.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.270
The roots are where
it crosses the axis.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.070
So that's one.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.320
I'll draw in the next
video another picture.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.850
Maybe change B.
Change the damping.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.250
So what would happen if
I change the damping?

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:01.801
If there's no damping, the
roots are pure imaginary.

00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:02.300
Yeah.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.620
Let's just go back through
those four possibilities,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.300
because that's what
you have to learn.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.500
If B is 0, there's
no damping at all.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.340
And we're back in
the pure oscillation,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.250
where is pure imaginary.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.490
We're just seeing
cosines and sines.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:29.990
Then if we add a little damping,
there appears a decay turn.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:38.860
If we add-- I could even
draw these possibilities.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.830
Let me draw the solution
y of t, against t.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.020
OK.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.760
So underdamping--
the solutions say

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.591
it starts there-- will
oscillate, but decay.

00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:58.590
So this is underdamping.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.250
And you remember
when that happens?

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.550
That's when B is
present but smaller.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.080
B squared is smaller than 4AC.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.960
Overdamping, if it
starts, let's say,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.140
here, it will going
to 0, probably

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.210
with no oscillation at all.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.720
It could have one oscillation.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.450
Depends how it starts.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.440
So ooh, let me
make this picture.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.550
So that one is the overdamping.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.290
This guy is the underdamping.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.200
Underdamping still
has oscillations.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.730
Overdamping has, at most, once.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.340
It could cross once.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:51.900
But overdamping is B
squared bigger than 4AC.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.770
OK.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.950
There's more to do.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:59.870
This is so central that you have
to think about the ratio of B

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.400
squared to 4AC.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.280
That has its own name.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.890
And it's a damping ratio, or
the square of a damping ratio.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.500
And we identify all
these solutions.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.040
Does everybody know where the
solution will be when B is 0?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.580
No damping at all.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.832
In that case, it
will just oscillate.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.950
So my picture is getting, you
could say, a little messed up.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.100
But this pure
oscillation would be

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.676
the B equals 0 with undamped.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:39.870
OK.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.300
That's a first look at
quadratic equations.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.080
As squared plus Bs plus C. It
has the big name characteristic

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.450
equation, but you
could see, it's

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.110
the fundamental equation for
a second order differential

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.250
equation.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.470
So we'll see more of it.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.020
Thanks.
