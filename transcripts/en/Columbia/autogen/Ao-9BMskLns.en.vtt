to talk about today we're going to talk
about what happens and what are some of

about what happens and what are some of
 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.680
about what happens and what are some of
the effects of virus long term

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
the effects of virus long term
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.840
the effects of virus long term
infections persistent infections where

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
infections persistent infections where
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.850
infections persistent infections where
virus particles are made to some extent

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860
virus particles are made to some extent

latent infections where sometimes

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649
latent infections where sometimes
 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.250
latent infections where sometimes
virtually nothing is made sometimes a

few proteins but perhaps the most
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.380
few proteins but perhaps the most
amazing part of latent infections is the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390
amazing part of latent infections is the
 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.380
amazing part of latent infections is the
fact that for the most part the virus

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390
fact that for the most part the virus
 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.320
fact that for the most part the virus
finds a place in the host where it can

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330
finds a place in the host where it can
 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.820
finds a place in the host where it can
lay dormant for the life of that animal

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
lay dormant for the life of that animal
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.130
lay dormant for the life of that animal
in our case it's men so breaking up that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140
in our case it's men so breaking up that

in our case it's men so breaking up that
is clearing the virus is an

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970
is clearing the virus is an
 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.910
is clearing the virus is an
extraordinarily difficult event in some

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
extraordinarily difficult event in some
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.730
extraordinarily difficult event in some
cases never happens in most cases and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740
cases never happens in most cases and
 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.109
cases never happens in most cases and
even when it does happen we don't know

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119
even when it does happen we don't know
 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.550
even when it does happen we don't know
that we've cleared the infection and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560
that we've cleared the infection and
 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.480
that we've cleared the infection and
that pertains to the hepatitis viruses

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
that pertains to the hepatitis viruses
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.460
that pertains to the hepatitis viruses
okay so we heard a little bit about

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470
okay so we heard a little bit about
 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.740
okay so we heard a little bit about
acute infections and persistent

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750
acute infections and persistent
 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.730
acute infections and persistent
infections from dr. Acula last week and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
infections from dr. Acula last week and
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.140
infections from dr. Acula last week and
to make life simple it doesn't hurt to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150
to make life simple it doesn't hurt to
 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.719
to make life simple it doesn't hurt to
go over it again and I want to remind

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729
go over it again and I want to remind
 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.480
go over it again and I want to remind
you that an acute infection is a natural

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490
you that an acute infection is a natural
 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.960
you that an acute infection is a natural
infection that is usually rapid and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970
infection that is usually rapid and
 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.260
infection that is usually rapid and
self-limiting you get hit you get sick

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
self-limiting you get hit you get sick
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.569
self-limiting you get hit you get sick
you're better

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579
you're better
 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.740
you're better
persistent infections on the other hand

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750
persistent infections on the other hand
 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.410
persistent infections on the other hand
our natural infection that can be

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420
our natural infection that can be
 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.580
our natural infection that can be
long-term in nature so it's slow viruses

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
long-term in nature so it's slow viruses
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.619
long-term in nature so it's slow viruses
tend to replicate over a long period of

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629
tend to replicate over a long period of
 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.559
tend to replicate over a long period of
time sometimes they're abortive the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569
time sometimes they're abortive the
 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.330
time sometimes they're abortive the
virus doesn't complete its replication

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340
virus doesn't complete its replication
 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.839
virus doesn't complete its replication
cycle sometimes the virus associates

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849
cycle sometimes the virus associates
 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.119
cycle sometimes the virus associates
with a host and something happens in its

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129
with a host and something happens in its
 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.470
with a host and something happens in its
genetic information is disrupted and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
genetic information is disrupted and
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.869
genetic information is disrupted and
sometimes they're transforming events

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879
sometimes they're transforming events
 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.119
sometimes they're transforming events
that is they cause cells to become

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129
that is they cause cells to become
 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.229
that is they cause cells to become
malignant

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239
 
 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.050
 
you saw this last week as well and I

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060
you saw this last week as well and I
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.690
you saw this last week as well and I
want to go over it just briefly and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
want to go over it just briefly and
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.429
want to go over it just briefly and
remind you that the acute infections are

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439
remind you that the acute infections are
 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.550
remind you that the acute infections are
short in duration virus replication and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
short in duration virus replication and
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.539
short in duration virus replication and
symptoms occur replication occurs before

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549
symptoms occur replication occurs before
 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.390
symptoms occur replication occurs before
symptom ology almost always in all cases

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
symptom ology almost always in all cases
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.819
symptom ology almost always in all cases
we have some instances of long-term

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829
we have some instances of long-term
 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.899
we have some instances of long-term
persistent infections such as

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909
persistent infections such as
 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.929
persistent infections such as
lymphocytic or meningitis virus and it's

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939
lymphocytic or meningitis virus and it's
 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.460
lymphocytic or meningitis virus and it's
just sort of smaller's and it stays

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470
just sort of smaller's and it stays
 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.289
just sort of smaller's and it stays
there and it does really bad things to

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299
there and it does really bad things to
 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.210
there and it does really bad things to
you and over a period of time if you're

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220
you and over a period of time if you're
 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.780
you and over a period of time if you're
a mouse you die and then you have herpes

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790
a mouse you die and then you have herpes
 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.869
a mouse you die and then you have herpes
simplex virus which is present in really

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879
simplex virus which is present in really
 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.699
simplex virus which is present in really
all of you whether you like it or not

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709
all of you whether you like it or not
 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.460
all of you whether you like it or not
and that's a persistent infection that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470
and that's a persistent infection that
 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.589
and that's a persistent infection that
lays latent in dormant in your neurons

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599
lays latent in dormant in your neurons
 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.039
lays latent in dormant in your neurons
in your ganglia in both your parents and

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049
in your ganglia in both your parents and
 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.979
in your ganglia in both your parents and
in both your sympathetic and sensory

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
in both your sympathetic and sensory
 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.219
in both your sympathetic and sensory
neurons and the hallmark of herpes

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229
neurons and the hallmark of herpes
 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.899
neurons and the hallmark of herpes
simplex virus inside the megaload virus

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909
simplex virus inside the megaload virus
 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.699
simplex virus inside the megaload virus
for that matter too is what we call

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709
for that matter too is what we call
 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.860
for that matter too is what we call
recrudescence infections and that's

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870
recrudescence infections and that's
 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.199
recrudescence infections and that's
waves periodic waves where the virus is

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209
waves periodic waves where the virus is
 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.170
waves periodic waves where the virus is
reactivated and sheds and you have a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180
reactivated and sheds and you have a
 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.500
reactivated and sheds and you have a
noticeable manifestation a cold store

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
noticeable manifestation a cold store
 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.949
noticeable manifestation a cold store
for instance in the case of chickenpox

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959
for instance in the case of chickenpox
 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.210
for instance in the case of chickenpox
virus varicella

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
virus varicella
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.219
virus varicella
it's shingles in the case of CMV it's

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229
it's shingles in the case of CMV it's
 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.920
it's shingles in the case of CMV it's
usually silent but the virus is highly

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930
usually silent but the virus is highly
 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.530
usually silent but the virus is highly
infectious in the case of

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540
infectious in the case of
 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.780
infectious in the case of
varicella-zoster virus we don't see any

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790
varicella-zoster virus we don't see any
 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.569
varicella-zoster virus we don't see any
in apparent shedding like we do with

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579
in apparent shedding like we do with
 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.699
in apparent shedding like we do with
herpes simplex virus so there are people

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709
herpes simplex virus so there are people
 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.490
herpes simplex virus so there are people
who are carrier you're all carriers

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500
who are carrier you're all carriers
 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.370
who are carrier you're all carriers
ordinary but there are people who have

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380
ordinary but there are people who have
 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.979
ordinary but there are people who have
herpes simplex virus and transmit it

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989
herpes simplex virus and transmit it
 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.900
herpes simplex virus and transmit it
without signs of overt lesions

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910
without signs of overt lesions
 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.320
without signs of overt lesions
and those are shedders so we see that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330
and those are shedders so we see that
 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.050
and those are shedders so we see that
wave and then there are these persistent

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060
wave and then there are these persistent
 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.850
wave and then there are these persistent

in some cases infections can linger on
longer and that's antigenic drift of

has novel transcription and replication

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640
has novel transcription and replication
 

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.070
has novel transcription and replication
patterns and generally it makes no new

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080
patterns and generally it makes no new
 

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.440
patterns and generally it makes no new
virus but it has three different forms

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.450
virus but it has three different forms
 

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.530
virus but it has three different forms
of latency and we'll talk about those in

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:11.540
of latency and we'll talk about those in
 

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.580
of latency and we'll talk about those in
a little more detail later on and

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:14.590
a little more detail later on and
 

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.170
a little more detail later on and
different transcription profiles to

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:17.180
different transcription profiles to
 

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.620
different transcription profiles to
match those three different forms what

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:20.630
match those three different forms what
 

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.330
match those three different forms what
is interesting is that the genome

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:22.340
is interesting is that the genome
 

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.700
is interesting is that the genome
replicates and the reason that the

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:24.710
replicates and the reason that the
 

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.770
replicates and the reason that the
genome has to replicate is that it can't

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:26.780
genome has to replicate is that it can't
 

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.740
genome has to replicate is that it can't
be partitioned to another cell that is

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:29.750
be partitioned to another cell that is
 

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.830
be partitioned to another cell that is
if the cell divides it can't go with it

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:32.840
if the cell divides it can't go with it
 

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.080
if the cell divides it can't go with it
if it doesn't replicate otherwise it

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.090
if it doesn't replicate otherwise it
 

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.690
if it doesn't replicate otherwise it
gets diluted out think about that we'll

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700
gets diluted out think about that we'll
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.730
gets diluted out think about that we'll
go through that example a couple of

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:39.740
go through that example a couple of
 

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.630
go through that example a couple of
times today if you only remain in the

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:43.640
times today if you only remain in the
 

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.040
times today if you only remain in the
cell that you infect then the cells

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.050
cell that you infect then the cells
 

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.870
cell that you infect then the cells
divide eventually there are more

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880
divide eventually there are more
 

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.220
divide eventually there are more
daughter cells than there are

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.230
daughter cells than there are
 

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:55.600
daughter cells than there are
progenitors adenovirus is most

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:55.610

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.780
progenitors adenovirus is most
frequently associated with terrible

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:58.790
frequently associated with terrible
 

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.060
frequently associated with terrible
upper respiratory illnesses can be

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.070
upper respiratory illnesses can be
 

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.140
upper respiratory illnesses can be
isolated from lymphoid tissue the

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.150
isolated from lymphoid tissue the
 

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.700
isolated from lymphoid tissue the
adenoids in the back of your throat and

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:06.710
adenoids in the back of your throat and
 

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.310
adenoids in the back of your throat and
tonsils so the viruses there at very

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320
tonsils so the viruses there at very
 

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.130
tonsils so the viruses there at very
very low levels and can persist lately

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.140
very low levels and can persist lately
 

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.070
very low levels and can persist lately
and when you take those tissues out you

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:15.080
and when you take those tissues out you
 

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.990
and when you take those tissues out you
find that most of the virus is actually

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000
find that most of the virus is actually
 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.230
find that most of the virus is actually
present in lymphocytes in those organs

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240
present in lymphocytes in those organs
 

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.150
present in lymphocytes in those organs
when your culture the organs in tissue

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160
when your culture the organs in tissue
 

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.220
when your culture the organs in tissue
culture you can't get virus out they

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.230
culture you can't get virus out they
 

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.350
culture you can't get virus out they
don't produce virus so that tells you

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360
don't produce virus so that tells you
 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.630
don't produce virus so that tells you
something about the milieu in which the

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640
something about the milieu in which the
 

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.780
something about the milieu in which the
virus sits and the cells in which it

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:31.790
virus sits and the cells in which it
 

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.460
virus sits and the cells in which it
sits and how there must be some

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:33.470
sits and how there must be some
 

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.040
sits and how there must be some
contributory factors some relationship

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.050
contributory factors some relationship
 

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.770
contributory factors some relationship
between the virus and where it is in the

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:38.780
between the virus and where it is in the
 

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.870
between the virus and where it is in the
host that allows it to replicate at a

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880
host that allows it to replicate at a
 

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.880
host that allows it to replicate at a
very very low level and persist here's

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:45.890
very very low level and persist here's
 

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.410
very very low level and persist here's
an extensive table from your book and it

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420
an extensive table from your book and it
 

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.180
an extensive table from your book and it
points out a bunch of interesting things

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.190
points out a bunch of interesting things
 

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.260
points out a bunch of interesting things
and it tells you that for example

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.270
and it tells you that for example
 

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.360
and it tells you that for example
hepatitis B can be found in the liver in

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.370
hepatitis B can be found in the liver in
 

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.000
hepatitis B can be found in the liver in
lymphocytes and the consequences of it

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.010
lymphocytes and the consequences of it
 

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.390
lymphocytes and the consequences of it
being there long time

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:02.400
being there long time
 

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.690
being there long time
a fulminate infection of the liver and

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700
a fulminate infection of the liver and
 

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.240
a fulminate infection of the liver and
later hepatocellular carcinoma and we

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.250
later hepatocellular carcinoma and we
 

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.190
later hepatocellular carcinoma and we
believe that one leads to the other

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200
believe that one leads to the other
 

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.920
believe that one leads to the other
as a result of inflammation so you see

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:12.930
as a result of inflammation so you see
 

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.320
as a result of inflammation so you see

the tie-ins to all the things that Vince
 

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.210
the tie-ins to all the things that Vince
and I have been talking about over the

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220
and I have been talking about over the
 

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.010
and I have been talking about over the
last couple of weeks and how viruses

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:19.020
last couple of weeks and how viruses
 

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.740
last couple of weeks and how viruses
elicit immune responses and sometimes

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:21.750
elicit immune responses and sometimes
 

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.690
elicit immune responses and sometimes

genital herpes papilloma viruses are

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:36.930
genital herpes papilloma viruses are
 

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.290
genital herpes papilloma viruses are
found in epithelial cells and they found

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300
found in epithelial cells and they found
 

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.720
found in epithelial cells and they found
predominantly in the basal layer of the

of long-term infection is papillomas not
 

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.829
of long-term infection is papillomas not
caused by frogs but by virus and

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839
caused by frogs but by virus and
 

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:54.110
caused by frogs but by virus and
carcinomas and that depends on the type

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120
carcinomas and that depends on the type
 

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.230
carcinomas and that depends on the type
of virus that you're infected with so

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240
of virus that you're infected with so
 

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.519
of virus that you're infected with so
there are over a hundred different types

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:58.529
there are over a hundred different types
 

00:11:58.529 --> 00:11:59.990
there are over a hundred different types
and we'll get onto that in a little

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000
and we'll get onto that in a little
 

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.420
and we'll get onto that in a little
while and then more recently it's become

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:02.430
while and then more recently it's become
 

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.040
while and then more recently it's become
very apparent to us that there are a

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.050
very apparent to us that there are a
 

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.880
very apparent to us that there are a
family of human polyomavirus and two of

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:07.890
family of human polyomavirus and two of
 

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.140
family of human polyomavirus and two of
them are on this chart and I'll talk

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.150
them are on this chart and I'll talk
 

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.300
them are on this chart and I'll talk
about another one that was found four

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:11.310
about another one that was found four
 

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.370
about another one that was found four
years ago which is yeah I think it's

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380
years ago which is yeah I think it's
 

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.170
years ago which is yeah I think it's
more interesting than these two but they

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180
more interesting than these two but they
 

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.340
more interesting than these two but they
lay in the kidneys in the central

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:11.829
called hhv-6 which is a primary cause of
 

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:15.360
called hhv-6 which is a primary cause of
a mild childhood disease but an amazing

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:15.370
a mild childhood disease but an amazing
 

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.860
a mild childhood disease but an amazing
thing happens with its genome and we'll

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:16.870
thing happens with its genome and we'll
 

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.280
thing happens with its genome and we'll
discuss that in a little bit of detail

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:19.290
discuss that in a little bit of detail
 

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.590
discuss that in a little bit of detail
so let's talk about some of the

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600
so let's talk about some of the
 

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.270
so let's talk about some of the
interactions that occur between viruses

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280
interactions that occur between viruses
 

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.189
interactions that occur between viruses
and their house and interesting one is

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199
and their house and interesting one is
 

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:28.620
and their house and interesting one is
thinnest virus and there's a model in

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:28.630
thinnest virus and there's a model in
 

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.500
thinnest virus and there's a model in
which you shove this virus into an adult

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:31.510
which you shove this virus into an adult
 

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.530
which you shove this virus into an adult
Mouse brain and you can get a persistent

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:34.540
Mouse brain and you can get a persistent
 

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.410
Mouse brain and you can get a persistent
non cytopathic infection so the virus

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:37.420
non cytopathic infection so the virus
 

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.790
non cytopathic infection so the virus
survives that event and so does the host

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:40.800
survives that event and so does the host
 

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.470
survives that event and so does the host
if you do the same thing into a neonatal

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480
if you do the same thing into a neonatal
 

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.310
if you do the same thing into a neonatal
mouse brain you get a lethal infection

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320
mouse brain you get a lethal infection
 

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.130
mouse brain you get a lethal infection
so in one case there's a symbiotic

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.140
so in one case there's a symbiotic
 

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.960
so in one case there's a symbiotic
infection if you will the virus survives

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:53.970
infection if you will the virus survives
 

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.940
infection if you will the virus survives
persists and the other case the host

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:56.950
persists and the other case the host
 

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.000
persists and the other case the host
dies as a result of infection why it's

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.010
dies as a result of infection why it's
 

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.690
dies as a result of infection why it's
all about where you are and when so in

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:03.700
all about where you are and when so in
 

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.210
all about where you are and when so in
the neonatal neurons like proteins that

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:06.220
the neonatal neurons like proteins that
 

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.160
the neonatal neurons like proteins that
block virus induced apoptosis and when

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.170
block virus induced apoptosis and when
 

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:15.240
block virus induced apoptosis and when
you pay Patos you die things to Krause

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.250
you pay Patos you die things to Krause
 

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.950
you pay Patos you die things to Krause
you send out signals you have a massive

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960
you send out signals you have a massive
 

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.440
you send out signals you have a massive
inflammatory response and the animal

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:19.450
inflammatory response and the animal
 

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.830
inflammatory response and the animal
succumbs to the infection another virus

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840
succumbs to the infection another virus
 

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.750
succumbs to the infection another virus
that provides an interesting paradigm is

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760
that provides an interesting paradigm is
 

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.500
that provides an interesting paradigm is
bdv anybody know what that stands for

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:30.510
 
 

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.150
 
bovine something right okay there's a

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:33.160
bovine something right okay there's a
 

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.730
bovine something right okay there's a
bovine diarrhea virus and it's a pesty

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:35.740
bovine diarrhea virus and it's a pesty
 

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.590
bovine diarrhea virus and it's a pesty
virus and there are two strains of this

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600
virus and there are two strains of this
 

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.440
virus and there are two strains of this
virus there's a cytopathic strain and a

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:40.450
virus there's a cytopathic strain and a
 

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.140
virus there's a cytopathic strain and a
non cytopathic strain and it turns out

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.150
non cytopathic strain and it turns out
 

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.660
non cytopathic strain and it turns out
that you can infect these animals in

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:45.670
that you can infect these animals in
 

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.440
that you can infect these animals in
utero as a natural course of events and

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:49.450
utero as a natural course of events and
 

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.660
utero as a natural course of events and
the non cytopathic virus will establish

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:51.670
the non cytopathic virus will establish
 

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.750
the non cytopathic virus will establish
a lifelong infection in cattle so it

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760
a lifelong infection in cattle so it
 

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.600
a lifelong infection in cattle so it
will persist in the infected animal when

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:57.610
will persist in the infected animal when
 

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.060
will persist in the infected animal when
it's infected in utero these animals

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.070
it's infected in utero these animals
 

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.090
it's infected in utero these animals
have no detectable antibody or t-cell

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.100
have no detectable antibody or t-cell
 

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.010
have no detectable antibody or t-cell
response to virus antigens so they're

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:05.020
response to virus antigens so they're
 

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.830
response to virus antigens so they're
making virus the infected cells are

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840
making virus the infected cells are
 

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.020
making virus the infected cells are
elaborating new viral proteins but

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.030
elaborating new viral proteins but
 

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.030
elaborating new viral proteins but
they're not being seen so what we say is

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:12.040
they're not being seen so what we say is
 

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.320
they're not being seen so what we say is
the host is tolerant

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:13.330
the host is tolerant
 

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.990
the host is tolerant
it's tolerant of what's going on and it

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000
it's tolerant of what's going on and it
 

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.760
it's tolerant of what's going on and it
just lets it go because it's going on at

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:17.770
just lets it go because it's going on at
 

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.240
just lets it go because it's going on at
a slow low level when these animals are

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.250
a slow low level when these animals are
 

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.830
a slow low level when these animals are
infected with the cytopathic strain

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840
infected with the cytopathic strain
 

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.990
infected with the cytopathic strain
though the interferon response is

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000
though the interferon response is
 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
though the interferon response is
activated and the virus is readily

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.010
activated and the virus is readily
 

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.980
activated and the virus is readily
cleared so two different strains getting

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:31.990
cleared so two different strains getting

reservoir for measles it's

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:46.630
reservoir for measles it's
 

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.540
reservoir for measles it's
extraordinarily contagious and if you

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:48.550
extraordinarily contagious and if you
 

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.790
extraordinarily contagious and if you
isolate the infection then you can stop

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:50.800
isolate the infection then you can stop
 

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.669

overt development of complex spots and

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.150
overt development of complex spots and
 

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.000
overt development of complex spots and
spots all over here the good thing is

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.010
spots all over here the good thing is
 

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.100
spots all over here the good thing is
that you develop lifelong immunity so

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.110
that you develop lifelong immunity so
 

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.470
that you develop lifelong immunity so
it's a great vaccine if that's the way

portions of the virus genome persist and
 

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.910
portions of the virus genome persist and
virus proteins are made and so what's

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:54.920
virus proteins are made and so what's
 

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.490

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.470
post infection events in neurons we know
that the nuclear capsid that structure

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480
that the nuclear capsid that structure
 

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.020
that the nuclear capsid that structure
inside the envelope travels up the axon

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.030
inside the envelope travels up the axon
 

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.930
inside the envelope travels up the axon
but we also know that the nucleic acid

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:39.940
but we also know that the nucleic acid
 

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.430
but we also know that the nucleic acid
is stripped of all those ancillary

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440
is stripped of all those ancillary
 

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.830

and so the viral

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140
and so the viral
 

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.330

is separated from the nucleocapsid so

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460
is separated from the nucleocapsid so
 

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.600
is separated from the nucleocapsid so
it's a little bit of a mystery as to how

duplicated regions of DNA and the reason
 

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:10.970
duplicated regions of DNA and the reason
for that is that it has sequences that

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980
for that is that it has sequences that
 

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.830
for that is that it has sequences that
are very similar to it and it's a very

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:12.840

Makenna sensory receptor and what we see
 

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.109
Makenna sensory receptor and what we see
is that virus DNA is integrated in a

01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119
is that virus DNA is integrated in a
 

01:05:50.119 --> 01:05:52.900
is that virus DNA is integrated in a
clonal pattern that means one cell got

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:52.910
clonal pattern that means one cell got
 

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:56.650
clonal pattern that means one cell got
infected and expanded so the integration

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:56.660
infected and expanded so the integration
 

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.700
infected and expanded so the integration

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:12.190
cell the other thing that's interesting
is that all MCV positive tumors have

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200
is that all MCV positive tumors have
 

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.970
is that all MCV positive tumors have
mutations in t antigen so they don't

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:15.980
mutations in t antigen so they don't
 

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.150

mutation occurred is not clear but we

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520
mutation occurred is not clear but we
 

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.370

know that the integrated virus genomes

01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:30.380
know that the integrated virus genomes
 

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.829
know that the integrated virus genomes
cannot be excised and that the cells

01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839
cannot be excised and that the cells
 

01:06:32.839 --> 01:06:34.990
cannot be excised and that the cells
survive because the virus doesn't

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000
survive because the virus doesn't
 

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.810
