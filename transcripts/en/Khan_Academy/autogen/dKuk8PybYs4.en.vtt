00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.419
 
let's do a few more examples of solving

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429
let's do a few more examples of solving
 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.490
let's do a few more examples of solving
radical equations so let's say I have

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
radical equations so let's say I have
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.400
radical equations so let's say I have
the square root of x plus 2 minus 2 is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410
the square root of x plus 2 minus 2 is
 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.820
the square root of x plus 2 minus 2 is
equal to 0 so just like I said in the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
equal to 0 so just like I said in the
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.740
equal to 0 so just like I said in the
last video we always want to isolate the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
last video we always want to isolate the
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.120
last video we always want to isolate the
radical and the best way I can think of

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
radical and the best way I can think of
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.269
radical and the best way I can think of
doing it over here is adding 2 to both

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
doing it over here is adding 2 to both
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.970
doing it over here is adding 2 to both
sides of this equation so if you add 2

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
sides of this equation so if you add 2
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.120
sides of this equation so if you add 2
to both sides of this equation we are

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
to both sides of this equation we are
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.900
to both sides of this equation we are
left with the square root of x plus 2 on

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
left with the square root of x plus 2 on
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269
left with the square root of x plus 2 on
the left hand side this cancels out is

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
the left hand side this cancels out is
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.740
the left hand side this cancels out is
equal to 2 and once you isolate one of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
equal to 2 and once you isolate one of
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.889
equal to 2 and once you isolate one of
the radicals then you're ready to

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899
the radicals then you're ready to
 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.080
the radicals then you're ready to
essentially square both sides of this if

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
essentially square both sides of this if
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.340
essentially square both sides of this if
we're dealing with a square root we

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
we're dealing with a square root we
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560
we're dealing with a square root we
square both sides of this so let's do

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
square both sides of this so let's do
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.040
square both sides of this so let's do
that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
that
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.510
that
so let's square both sides of that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
so let's square both sides of that
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.689
so let's square both sides of that
equation and then we get square root of

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
equation and then we get square root of
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.410
equation and then we get square root of
x plus 2 squared is just X plus 2 is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
x plus 2 squared is just X plus 2 is
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.389
x plus 2 squared is just X plus 2 is
equal to 2 squared is equal to 4

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399
equal to 2 squared is equal to 4
 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.399
equal to 2 squared is equal to 4
subtract 2 from both sides of this

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
subtract 2 from both sides of this
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.370
subtract 2 from both sides of this
equation we're left with X these twos

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
equation we're left with X these twos
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070
equation we're left with X these twos
cancel out is equal to 2 now let's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
cancel out is equal to 2 now let's
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289
cancel out is equal to 2 now let's
validate that this is truly the case

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
validate that this is truly the case
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670
validate that this is truly the case

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520
or the negative square root let's see
what when you take the principal root we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
what when you take the principal root we
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.969

through that's crazy how do we deal with

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
through that's crazy how do we deal with
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.580
through that's crazy how do we deal with
a fourth root and it's the same process

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
a fourth root and it's the same process
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530
a fourth root and it's the same process
when you had a square root we squared it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
when you had a square root we squared it
 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.089
when you had a square root we squared it
when you have the fourth root we take it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
when you have the fourth root we take it
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460
when you have the fourth root we take it
to the fourth power and just as a bit of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
to the fourth power and just as a bit of
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.440
to the fourth power and just as a bit of
a review this could be completely

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
a review this could be completely
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760
a review this could be completely
written like this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
written like this
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.200
written like this
another way to write it would be x

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210
another way to write it would be x
 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.130
another way to write it would be x
squared minus 9 to the 1/4 power is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
squared minus 9 to the 1/4 power is
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.890
squared minus 9 to the 1/4 power is
equal to 2 these are equivalent

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
equal to 2 these are equivalent
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.900
equal to 2 these are equivalent
statements just different ways of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
statements just different ways of
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.720
statements just different ways of
writing the fourth root now if we raise

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
writing the fourth root now if we raise
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.860
writing the fourth root now if we raise
both sides to the fourth power what

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
both sides to the fourth power what
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630
both sides to the fourth power what
happens to this exponent right here if

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
happens to this exponent right here if
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.190
happens to this exponent right here if
we raise something to an exponent and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
we raise something to an exponent and
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.960
we raise something to an exponent and
then raise that to another exponent we

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
then raise that to another exponent we
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.860
then raise that to another exponent we
multiply the exponents so 1/4 times 4 is

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
multiply the exponents so 1/4 times 4 is
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.790
multiply the exponents so 1/4 times 4 is
1 so this just becomes x squared minus 9

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800
1 so this just becomes x squared minus 9
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.590
1 so this just becomes x squared minus 9
to the first power or we could just

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600
to the first power or we could just
 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.140
to the first power or we could just
write x squared minus 9 and that's going

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
write x squared minus 9 and that's going
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.500
write x squared minus 9 and that's going
to be equal to 2 to the fourth power 2

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
to be equal to 2 to the fourth power 2
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.780
to be equal to 2 to the fourth power 2
to the fourth power is what 2 times 2 is

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
to the fourth power is what 2 times 2 is
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.430
to the fourth power is what 2 times 2 is
4 times 2 is 8 times 2 is 16 now we can

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
4 times 2 is 8 times 2 is 16 now we can
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.840
4 times 2 is 8 times 2 is 16 now we can
just there's two ways we can do it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850
just there's two ways we can do it
 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.090
just there's two ways we can do it
actually at this point we can add 9 to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
actually at this point we can add 9 to
 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.430
actually at this point we can add 9 to
both sides of this equation I'll do it

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
both sides of this equation I'll do it
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.230
both sides of this equation I'll do it
this way in yellow so if you add 9 you

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240
this way in yellow so if you add 9 you
 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.260
this way in yellow so if you add 9 you
get x squared is equal to 25 take the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270
get x squared is equal to 25 take the
 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.630
get x squared is equal to 25 take the
square root not just a principal square

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640
square root not just a principal square
 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.250
square root not just a principal square
root take the positive and negative

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
root take the positive and negative
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410
root take the positive and negative
square root of both sides of this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
square root of both sides of this
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.200
square root of both sides of this
equation and you get X is equal to plus

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210
equation and you get X is equal to plus
 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.980
equation and you get X is equal to plus
or minus 5 that's one way the other way

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990
or minus 5 that's one way the other way
 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.420
or minus 5 that's one way the other way
if you know sometimes it's confusing

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430
if you know sometimes it's confusing
 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.100
if you know sometimes it's confusing
people forget to take the positive and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110
people forget to take the positive and
 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.630
people forget to take the positive and
negative square roots instead to do it

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640
negative square roots instead to do it
 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.740
negative square roots instead to do it
the way we've been doing all along

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
the way we've been doing all along
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.080

through solving traditional quadratic

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
through solving traditional quadratic
 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.610
through solving traditional quadratic
setting them equal to zero so what you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
setting them equal to zero so what you
 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.650
setting them equal to zero so what you
do is you subtract 16 from both sides of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660
do is you subtract 16 from both sides of
 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.260
do is you subtract 16 from both sides of
this equation if you do that you get x

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270
this equation if you do that you get x
 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.970

squared minus 25 if we subtract 16 from

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
squared minus 25 if we subtract 16 from
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.940
squared minus 25 if we subtract 16 from
both sides is equal to zero so these two

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
both sides is equal to zero so these two
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.840
both sides is equal to zero so these two
are equivalent

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
are equivalent
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.340

this essentially we're just moving the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350
this essentially we're just moving the
 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.020
this essentially we're just moving the
25 on to the left hand side we're just

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
25 on to the left hand side we're just
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.820
25 on to the left hand side we're just
subtracting 25 from both sides of this

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830
subtracting 25 from both sides of this
 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.160
subtracting 25 from both sides of this
to get that but what this does is it

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170
to get that but what this does is it
 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.780
to get that but what this does is it
puts this in the form of a difference of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
puts this in the form of a difference of
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.210
puts this in the form of a difference of
squares we know we can rewrite this as X

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
squares we know we can rewrite this as X
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.100
squares we know we can rewrite this as X
plus 5 times X minus 5 we went over that

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110
plus 5 times X minus 5 we went over that
 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.260
plus 5 times X minus 5 we went over that
several videos ago and that will be

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270
several videos ago and that will be
 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.440
several videos ago and that will be
equal to 0 and if the product of two

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
equal to 0 and if the product of two
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.510
equal to 0 and if the product of two
numbers is equal to 0 that means that

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520
numbers is equal to 0 that means that
 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.970
numbers is equal to 0 that means that
either one or both of them is equal to 0

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980
either one or both of them is equal to 0
 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.910
either one or both of them is equal to 0
so X plus 5 is equal to 0 or X minus 5

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920
so X plus 5 is equal to 0 or X minus 5
 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.550
so X plus 5 is equal to 0 or X minus 5
is equal to 0 and we get X is equal to

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560
is equal to 0 and we get X is equal to
 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.290
is equal to 0 and we get X is equal to
negative 5 or X is equal to positive 5

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300
negative 5 or X is equal to positive 5
 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.390
negative 5 or X is equal to positive 5
which is what we got right there now the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400
which is what we got right there now the
 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.590
which is what we got right there now the
one thing we want to make sure

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600
one thing we want to make sure
 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.000
one thing we want to make sure
or once against that me neither of these

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010
or once against that me neither of these
 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.910
or once against that me neither of these
are extraneous extraneous solutions

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920
are extraneous extraneous solutions
 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.710
are extraneous extraneous solutions
because you're taking a fourth root or

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720
because you're taking a fourth root or
 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.730
because you're taking a fourth root or
when you take something to the fourth

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740
when you take something to the fourth
 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.110
when you take something to the fourth
power and negative numbers also

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120
power and negative numbers also
 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.000
power and negative numbers also
disappear so this is you can kind of is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010
disappear so this is you can kind of is
 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.310
disappear so this is you can kind of is
this a principal fourth root that we're

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320
this a principal fourth root that we're
 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.230
this a principal fourth root that we're
taking here there's a negative version

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240
taking here there's a negative version
 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.300
taking here there's a negative version
of this could have also been valid so

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310
of this could have also been valid so
 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.490
of this could have also been valid so
let's make sure that they both work well

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500
let's make sure that they both work well
 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.530
let's make sure that they both work well
whether we put negative five or positive

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540
whether we put negative five or positive
 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.450
whether we put negative five or positive
five here this right here is going to be

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460
five here this right here is going to be
 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.400
five here this right here is going to be
twenty five so you get the fourth root

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410
twenty five so you get the fourth root
 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.500
twenty five so you get the fourth root
of 25 minus 9 which is the fourth root

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510
of 25 minus 9 which is the fourth root
 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.010
of 25 minus 9 which is the fourth root
of 16 and 16 so this is the fourth root

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
of 16 and 16 so this is the fourth root
 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.150
of 16 and 16 so this is the fourth root
of 16 which is equal to 16 to the 1/4

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160
of 16 which is equal to 16 to the 1/4
 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.200
of 16 which is equal to 16 to the 1/4
power which is indeed 2 so both of these

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210
power which is indeed 2 so both of these
 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.240
power which is indeed 2 so both of these
work when you square either of these you

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250
work when you square either of these you
 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.890
work when you square either of these you
do indeed get 25
