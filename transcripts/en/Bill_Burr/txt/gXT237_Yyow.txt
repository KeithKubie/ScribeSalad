Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. And Ah, I'm just checking in on you. I'm just checking and just seeing how your week's going, you know, you know, I would think if I was in New York Yankee Fan, despite the fact we're only a couple of games up for the one game playoff, I would say that I'm having a pretty good fucking Thursday. You know, you see the last couple of games? Did you see last night's game in particular? I'm gonna tell you guys right now, I am going to gradually wean you off of watching ESPN, Fox sports west, listening to the fan. Okay? Nobody gets it right? More Times in my own mind, in my own world, without doing any research on how any of those other people, how many times they get it right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Nobody gets it right more than the manual listening to right fucking now, what the fuck did I say? Well, Bill, you, you've said a lot of things. All right, fair enough. I have said a lot of things. If I mentioned this fucking wires sucks. Jesus Christ. God forbid I turn my fucking, this is unbelievable. It's a brand new fucking wire. Does anything work? Is this how like China is going to slowly like they know they can't fucking bomb us, right? So what do they do? They just make everything just a little bit, not fucking right and it just, it's going to gradually drive him fucking crazy. Now what do I do? I've got to move this thing over here. Bring this up because God forbid there's any weight on this wire. The second thing is weight. All of a sudden it doesn't work. Now it totally does it. Come on. I need to hear myself. I need to hear myself talking about how great I am. All right, there you go. Um, I told you motherfuckers, I love how I'm mad at you guys. Like you ever said no, you didn't bill, you never told us that. Right? Fuck is my water. Oh Jesus, this is going to be one of these doll. There it is. There it is. Um, I told you way back in fucking August when the red sox swept the Yankees and ESPs are fucking over.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       What's over ESPN. Oh, I guess maybe a divisional race. Who gives a fuck? You know what I mean? There's still the wild card still the fucking wow. That's like there's an ax murderer outside you fucking house and you just lock the front door and you leave the back door wide open. You're like, well I guess that takes care of that. Not to mention if you have a wood door, you know, but so motivated axe murderer, you know, he could just chop down the door.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       That actually would work in your favor. It gives you time to try

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       to find something to defend, you know, defend yourself is acts, you know, tactically speaking will be a little more dull cause he'd gone through the front door. But this is all beside the point. I told you mother fuckers back then I was, I can tilt David Price goes into the fucking mellow folk and [inaudible] God goddamn game. I don't give a fuck that were out there sweeping the Baltimore Orioles.

Speaker 4:          00:03:22       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:03:24       Regular season stats. You know what that's like? That's like the guy who was the fucking big man on campus in high school, right? He's a fucking lie. He's a captain of this. He's got the dimple in his fucking chair and he's banging a fucking cheerleader, right? And everybody's like, oh my God, Hey, she's going up. Or you're the president right

Speaker 4:          00:03:46       now. What happens?

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       You go back to the reunion and he looks like may no, he got me. I'm just saying like it doesn't make a difference if you win 89 games or fucking 129 games. What murders is how you're doing against the fucking teams that you're going to see in October. You know? But that's not the business that does those so and so's over an ESPN and Fox News and whoever else. I'm, I'm lumping into the same fucking category. That's not the game they're in. They're in the game of what the fuck you see is what the fuck it is. And we will hype the shit out of it and not even remotely look at it analytically. So then if what happens happens, you can be, like I said, it was going to happen, but what you said was going to happen doesn't happen. Then you get to do though. What happened?

Speaker 4:          00:04:42       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:42       What happened was you got a namerd by a bunch of fucking victories against the Orioles in the fucking tigers. A bunch of Steve's or Jacob. I mean huge guys. Gate gate hit black over 9,000 homerun junior regular season, and yeah, we're absolutely anemic in the playoffs. Well, yeah. Well, how did they do against the fucking Astros?

Speaker 4:          00:05:06       Sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:05:07       Anyways, you know what? You know what that's like the, it's like watching Paul. I love Paul the death. I got to get him on the, I have to get him on this fucking podcast because I'm always making fun of them and I want you guys to know that it comes from a place of love. All right? Most of the times it comes from a place of love, but right now it comes from a place of concern. Okay. One of the dumbest fucking things that you can do. Yeah. Besides buying a fucking Goddamn fucking speaker wire. I'm, I'm blaming it on China. Okay. It's a, it's always a great guest. Everything's fucking made over there. All right. It's like when, when you get you eating a doughnut, you're like, what? What's the main ingredient ingredient in here? The one guests you have is corn corners in everything. If you don't believe me, watch the one documentary I ever watched about food and

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       have now are using that as my Bible. I saw it years ago, so I'm probably misquoting it. All right. Having said that, no, what I just said was effect. One of the dumbest things you could do is the first game of the week bet a bunch of fucking games. All right? And I'm not talking about fantasy shit and I'm not talking about all the people, the sports gambling, podcasts that I read a advertising. Then I told you to go out and do that exact fucking thing. So this would be hypocritical now for me to tell you this, but I, you know, you don't know who the fuck anybody is until about two, three fucking weeks in. All right? I've tried to tell Paul Versey this. Paul Versey is the king of betting football college or pro. In fact, when I first became friends with him back when college football wasn't brilliant enough to realize that they needed to have some good matchups in the first few weeks to get people into it, to pull them away from the NFL. And this, this is what's happening. You know, even though I haven't looked at the ratings, okay, I'm saying it's happening, therefore it is happening. Okay. Now these goddamn feminists and me tours can just say things happen without any evidence in God. Damn it. I can say this is happening with no evidence, no research, no nothing to write fucking college football is, is, is getting better ratings right now than the national football league. Dare I say a presidential address.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Okay. Now, if Netflix doesn't have to give out ratings, then why should I have to look at him? That's what I say. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:07:46       anyways, Po Po, uh, this is like 10 fucking years ago, 12 years ago. And at first knew Paul, this is back when they had all the cupcake games, you know, to establish the rankings for whatever reason they would have like Ohio State Doh play, uh, Eleanor Rigby, fucking nursing home, right? Nursing School of nursing or some shit, right? And then they would be favored by like fucking 80 points and fucking Versie would go out. And just the first week of football, you know, being a college coach is so much harder than being a pro professionals, uh, coach. Simply because every, you know, three, four years, you've got a brand new fucking team. You're just constantly, every year is a fucking rebuilding year. And now all these Goddamn millennials, which they're not millennials once again, 1980 to 1995, there are 23 to 38 years old. I actually just told a 38 year old woman yesterday that she was a millennial and she couldn't fucking believe. I say, yes, you are. According to the one website that I went to and didn't even look at a second one. Even back it up. You are a millennial. And she said, I don't identify as millennial. And I was like, are you angling for your own bathroom? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       I don't know yet. You know I'm doing this right now cause I don't even know what the fuck's going on in the world right now. I just know it's a fucking, everybody is in a Goddamn hissy fit about everything. So I just know, and I know that you don't need evidence, you don't need fucking anything. People just say things and then it's not only the person that did the thing, it's the person that stood next to the guy that did the fucking thing. So in the future, God forbid God for fucking bed, you're standing on the subway platform and somebody jumps in front of a train to commit suicide. Um, they're going to blame you for assisted suicide because you stood there and did nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       I'm sorry. That's probably a slight exaggeration. Probably a bad, you know, I probably should've read up on the story a little more. I probably don't know what I'm talking about. I probably won't even upload this, but I might. But if you're listening to it, you know are dead. So Versie would go out and he fucking would just, just the first week of college football, you have no idea who the fuck anybody anybody is. And he would just, he would just do it. It's a lot. I mean, it's literally a joke. Nebraska given 58 and he'd fucking bet on the favor. Right? He's doing it again this year.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       All right. Last week he fucking bets. Uh, you know, he's got that fucking homecoming theory, a good road team coming off a loss playing the next week, add home. He doesn't give a fuck how many fucking points they're given. He can't lay off it. So he keeps calling the lions, that hapless lions, that hapless lines. It's just like, dude, they, their first game of the year, they had a shit one. Okay, everybody's going to have a shit game. The fucking patriots just had a shit game against the Jaguars, but it was week two. So nobody is saying that that's who they are. But last year they had a shit game against Kansas City and all of a sudden the whole for all the wheels were off. The Tom Brady era was over. And what ended up happening all Tommy Brady brought us right back to the fucking super bowl. He threw for 500 yards over 500 yards in the game and he lost was our defense suck that game, you know? Um,

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       Because they will, they only held, nick falls to over 300 yards, which I guess was a great day. If the other guy threw for 500 birthday or the day we don't come out with victory than money to me.

Speaker 4:          00:11:33       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:11:35       So last week for his, he's telling me that the lions, the hapless lines, you take Jimmy g coming home, San Francisco, it's a lock and he's texting me, the whole game is San Francisco is winning. Say, what did I say? I set it all week. Exclamation points. He's an absolute euphoria that he said

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       something that now look like it was going to happen. And he's looking at Matthew Stafford like this fucking guy likes to lose every week. Like, this guy doesn't have any pride

Speaker 2:          00:12:02       like this man can't get out there and slam that fucking rock.

Speaker 4:          00:12:07       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:07       The next thing you know, the fucking lines come back in the end and they end up covering the spread. No, we've all fucking been there. All right, so you learn from your past. Well, if you learn from your past, you wouldn't keep gambling, but now you come back for more. What does vars do again this week? He's teasing the Patriots. They play, I think that they play, I don't know, somebody playing, he keeps calling them the hapless lions because they had one bad fucking week. So now the lines are playing. The Patriots are former fucking, um, coach is coaching the team. He's been when he went and what meant fucking Patricia? They're like, that guy doesn't know some of the shit that we do.

Speaker 4:          00:12:54       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       Okay. Now I'm not saying the Patriots won't go in and kick the fucking shit up. I don't, I say the pages. Okay. All right. So I don't know what the fuck I'm safe. I'm just saying, you just lost betting against his fucking tape and you're still calling them the hapless fucking lions.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       They were on the road. They almost beat the fucking 40 niners

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       they had one bad fucking game.

Speaker 4:          00:13:20       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       All right. And this brings me back to the fucking red sox. All right? They sweep the Yankees in the beginning of August. Did everybody fucking, all these guys in these fucking sports shows, they put their tasseled fucking loafers up on the desk, you know, fold their fingers on top of their head and that's fucking over.

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       It's so, it's, it ain't over. It's not over. It's not fucking over. So my prediction, the Red Sox, uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       I just don't think we, we don't have the fucking one two punch. We don't have a one and two as far as I'm concerned in our starting rotation that you need.

Speaker 4:          00:13:59       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       we just don't have it. So I think we're going to win a bunch of fucking games and then we are going to lose in the playoffs. I don't want that to happen. I didn't want to say that to you. I don't want to ruin your fucking day, but you know,

Speaker 4:          00:14:16       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       Until a price starts fucking winning and Yankee Stadium, I just don't fucking see it. Unless we're going to play for straight fucking game or I'll, I'll, you know, only have them start at home. Oh my God. I love the guy. He's a fucking amazing picture and everything and I really needed him to win last night. I needed it. Okay. I needed it because, you know, I, I, you know, I lived through sports. That's, that's how, that's what I do. Okay. There. Okay. Does that make you feel better? It's not enough that I'm a 50 year old man alone in a room right now, talking into a microphone, hoping that somebody listening, nodding in agreement almost didn't get through that word. Listening, listening. Um, and we'll have things you'll want to talk about. I will too. This is like my own Mr. Rogers show. You know,

Speaker 5:          00:15:11       it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day. And the neighbor here comes the current through the fucking door. He has always wanted to be right about something in sports, even though it has no effect on his life. So let's all fucking listen to this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:15:34       Send them some emails and say, dude, that was it. You figured it out. Your genius. Go Fuck yourself yet. Redcurrant sorry. Um, go fuck yourself. Go Fuck Yourself. I always have to finish the song. Please go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       You freckled count. Um, anyways, uh, I have not been watching the news and been working. I'm writing a script right now, so I haven't been watching anything and it's fucking hilarious to not watch the news to not what's no, what's going on because all your friends, it just constantly are just sending you texts. All caps. Are you watching this or they call you up though? Did you see this?

Speaker 5:          00:16:17       Did you see that Mark Cuban thing?

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:16:20       Did you see what Trump said? Did you hear about the fucking Albatross?

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:16:27       the Dj Dj's. Did you see what happened in Bolivia? It's fucking hell. It's never anything good.

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       Never. Never anything fucking good. Um, anyways, so I, I don't, I don't know what's going on. I did watch the Mark Cuban thing for like a minute, man. That was fucking, that was brutal.

Speaker 5:          00:16:50       That now that, that right there, that that's uh, that's one of them brutal once they ain't no, maybe there's, they know, maybe that's just

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       straight up. That's just fucking Jesus Christ. I don't know. You know, I got to tell you here at this podcast, like that's not the way we run our business here. Now. The genius of my podcast is there's, there's nobody else here. Therefore I can't get in trouble. I don't send emails to myself. At no point will I ever be on the ESPN of podcasting, sitting there, shifting, uncomfortably, trying to answer questions that I have the answers to. I just don't want to tell them to you because I know it's, it's, I did the wrong thing. Um, or maybe, maybe in the future they'll, they'll be something like that. You know, I want to see what is a woman going to be fucking squirming. What about that woman who fucking date rape? The 17 year old guy who fucking was talking all that shit about Harvey Weinstein and then she fucking paid the kid off and then blamed it on a dead guy.

Speaker 4:          00:18:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:05       Where, why isn't she shifted around? Ask it answer and fucking uncomfortable fucking questions. You know, sometimes it's deer season, sometimes it's elk season. I guess it's still deer season. I can't wait. When, when is it going to flip up? When is it going to flip around?

Speaker 4:          00:18:24       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:18:29       That's why I don't look at this shit. I saw this woman, she wrote it in like Twitter. She's just like, oh, this one guy, he was able to come out back after fucking six months. It wasn't six months. It was close to a year. So they already fucking shaved off some months. And uh, Monica Lewinsky wasn't able to come back for 20 years. It's like, what are you talking about? And she goes, and she did nothing wrong. Well, I think Hillary would probably debate that.

Speaker 4:          00:18:53       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       It's like she hosted SNL. She wrote a fucking book. She had a line of purses. She had a show. They tried to get on the air. She not only, she fucking became a cottage industry off of that thing. It's like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 4:          00:19:10       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:19:12       Anyways, I dunno, I that's, it's just like this, this fucking thing that women are doing that with all, they just keep peeking over the fence and all this scene is green grass.

Speaker 4:          00:19:23       You know?

Speaker 2:          00:19:26       I, I don't, I just don't fucking, it's like what are you looking at? That's all you see. You only see green grass.

Speaker 6:          00:19:35       Yeah. Engage fucking show up and people just, Kevin Stop for Guy did something wrong and nothing happens if a be 30 rock,

Speaker 2:          00:19:45       it sounded like fucking five-year-olds. I'm not saying there aren't double standards, everything, but like why didn't you pick one that's actually a double standard so you don't have to fid shit that sends you a whole thing is just going to fucking collapse or maybe you do research. This woman actually said she's on her fucking stump. She's saying after the Monica Lewinsky thing that Bill Clinton was those then reelected. It's like he wasn't, it happened in his second term. Do a little research. I mean, what? What? What do you mean

Speaker 4:          00:20:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       and we'll have things we'll want to yell about. I will

Speaker 4:          00:20:26       to, um,

Speaker 6:          00:20:31       when a woman brushes your teeth, she can feel the whole toothpastes community judging her. When a guy brushes his teeth, they're like, oh, we should run the company

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       next time you're in traffic, stop and go traffic ladies. Just, just look at the, look on the guy's faces. Look at the cars they're driving to. Any of them look like they're even in remote control remotely in fucking control of their lives. Ladies, be honest with yourself, okay. In the average relationship, boyfriend, girlfriend, okay. Married. Whatever life partners the end of the day,

Speaker 7:          00:21:24       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       If she wants to get brunch in the guy doesn't, what the, what do you think you're going to do? What is the guy's options? Does he have any at the end of the day, who's really calling the shots? If only one person has life insurance, okay. If there's only one fucking person that's going to benefit from the other person's death on average, who is that person?

Speaker 7:          00:21:56       Huh? Let me come on people.

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       Happy wife. Happy life. Where's the cute little rhyme for the guy? There isn't one. It's cause we don't matter.

Speaker 7:          00:22:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       Look how they hate Valentine's Day. It's all about the woman. Why? Because they know that every guy is living the fucking male female dynamic, which is keep it happy. Maybe it will fuck me. Keep it happy. Maybe I can watch the game. Keep it happy. Maybe I can enjoy 20 minutes of my weekend. That is, that is the world. Most men are living it. But if you go on the Internet and you go on social media, most men are blocking a doorway while jizzing on a plant and running a company telling you when you're in traffic, just look, look, it's, I'm telling you, you just look at the side of somebody's head and you know who the fuck they are. You can see how much hope they have left. All right?

Speaker 7:          00:23:16       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       I challenge you. Why does that thing doing that shit now I challenge you. I challenge you to find a lot of hopeful fucking guys out there. Did you see the, yeah. Did somebody else tell me that? And I actually looked it up that fucking that was that woman out there, uh, in, in Hawaii telling men did just shut up and do the right thing for once. It's a fucking, she's hold political office and it's just talking like that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:48       Just shut up and do the right thing. All the guys asking for is, is to him to say his side of the story. She's basically saying, shut up. Don't listen to the guy side of the story. As this woman says, all these things that's going to destroy this guy's career. I'm not saying what the woman's saying is true or isn't true, but the guy, he doesn't even have the right to defend himself.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       Jay Jay Dang for once.

Speaker 3:          00:24:15       All right. How about we do that when you push away from the buffet table, Oh, there's a nice low blow for you and I am proud of doing it. I'll take the 10 minute misconduct. That's what it's becoming. It's becoming literally shut the fuck up. All guys shut up and listen to one side of the fucking story and then that's the story. The story is my story. Your story doesn't count because you have a fucking Dick. That's the world that we're going into right now. And evidently it's like progressive. It's fucking insane. It's insane.

Speaker 7:          00:24:50       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       And right now, if one of these crazy women listen to this, they would completely twist what I just said and say that I'm actually against women who've been abused, getting some sort of justice, which is not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that there you have to listen to both people and then weigh the evidence.

Speaker 7:          00:25:09       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       even that is a flawed fucking system, but it's the best system we have. And now you're going to take that system and you're going to throw it out and now you just, you know, it's like Frankenstein movie that fucking coming up the hill with torches. Um, just shut up. And as you could tell them a little emotional, you saw like she had that whole fucking thing planned out. Like she, you know, she thought she was got to get like a bunch of hits, which I obviously did if I fucking heard about it. Um, yeah, I dunno. It's literally, it's like McCarthyism meets a fucking, myspace is what's going on right now.

Speaker 7:          00:25:50       Um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       Yeah. I should show up in everything works out when we show up to hear your,

Speaker 7:          00:26:01       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:26:05       Meanwhile, the average guy who's driving some sort of shitbox to work, working for somebody else

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       in a job that he never really dreamed of happening is a kid that's most people's fucking reality, but not on social media, social media. Every guys out there running a company eating steak and lobster for fucking lunch, make it as secretary, shower her tits. Like that's what's happening. That's what all that and every soul, every guy out there, shut up.

Speaker 7:          00:26:32       Hm.

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       How dare you try to defend yourself and everything you worked for. Shut up, do the right thing and shot up. Um, just a comedian me, I can't lay off this shit. It's so fucking funny that like, you're literally watching women's reaction to abuse of power and now they have power and they instantly start abusing it. I mean, it's just, it's just completely going off the fucking rails here. Um, and most people, male and female understand that. But all of us are too afraid to tweet or say fucking anything because then like, cause then you have to literally apologize. I watched somebody in my business have to go on an apology tour for literally having an opinion. He was an innocent man who hadn't done anything fucking wrong. He just had an opinion and he had to go out and apologize for having an opinion. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       And we'll have things you'll want to talk about. All right. Felix Gray, everybody the average American blast their eyes with bright screens for 11 hours every day.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       Fucking get some meat kit. Do you see those two fucking Boston guys who claim that they have the divisional red socks? Whatever, uh, banner.

Speaker 2:          00:30:00       I Dunno what's, they either stole that fucking thing or that things fake. Those things do not just fly off a fucking stadium. I love how they will like, you know, then whole thing sounded like they act like they will, these good guys. But the whole thing was like a ransom. Like they had the fucking Lindbergh baby. Hey, if you ever want to fucking shady thing again. Now they didn't even ask for regular season tickets. They asked for playoff fucking tickets. Um, all right, put your box. Do couple of shady characters, but your box delivers healthy. 100% grass fed, grass finished beef free range, organic chicken and heritage bread, pork. Oh, the greatest fucking fucking animal you'll ever eat

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       is a blue blood. I don't want to be fucking racist here against other pigs. I don't want to be in the pigs, a Ku Klux Klan. And by the way, it is cool. It's not cool. I always thought was Klu Klux Klan, Ku Klux Klan. Um, I don't want to be like the Grand Dragon. It starts saying separate but equal when it comes to pigs. But there really is nothing like a heritage bread. Pork. All right. And it also, it did come from Europe, so this is sounding more fucking pig racist as I go. But I mean it's unbelievable. If you haven't been listening to the podcast, the heritage bread, pork, they can dre sickly trace the bloodline of a pig. There's actually people out there that do that. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:31:25       But if a woman

Speaker 2:          00:31:30       fucking shit on her, um,

Speaker 3:          00:31:33       they trace the bloodline of uh, these God damn pigs, pure bred pigs all the way back to the original pigs that came across the fucking Atlantic. I don't know if they came across with Christopher Columbus. I Dunno if it was with the Nina, the Pinta in the Santa Maria. It wouldn't surprise me today if some feminist group actually claimed that a woman's sailed first and and that nature and wind in general is, it's much harder for a woman to sail than for a man. I don't know what happened, but these fucking pigs came over here and evidently there was so god damn delicious, they did not let these pigs breed with the pigs that were already here. I don't know what. So whatever fucking reason, these things, these are like, you know, these are pure bred, these, they're like the, like the royal family of Pigs, you know what I mean? So

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       they have this amazing bloodline, but also there's a lot of interest breeding, you know, so that probably a little crazy. But the thing is is when you get the pork chop, it's dead so it can't get you. So I recommend eating these pigs do not have them as pets. Okay. Back to the copy.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       simply because of my genitalia. Um, today I will go out into the world knowing that and adjusting my behavior accordingly. Women, you have no work to do when it comes to how you treat men just can just stay the fucking course and uh, keep telling everybody how difficult you fucking lives are when there's like, what, like six holidays a year. That is specifically people valley. They

It's a Thursday afternoon podcast. That'll be an extra half an hour of greatest hits Thursday afternoon, just before Monday, just for Friday. Monday morning podcast. That's what it is. All right.

Speaker 10:         00:40:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       right off the bat. This sounds fucking creepy to me. Video Doorbell.

Speaker 10:         00:40:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:52       Uh, we'll insert dinging sound. What does that mean? I was supposed to fucking insert ding. Dongs all right, let's do it again. Uh, I can do this. Here we go. Door bell sound. This is like Donald Trump announcing he's running for president doorbell sound effect.

Speaker 10:         00:41:17       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:17       Did you meet doorbell? All one word. Of course I did. Let's see if I can do this correctly. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       Hey everybody. Video Doorbell. Let's do that again. Oh, I'm mad. And all of layers to the podcast

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       here. Hang on a second. It's got a fucking, uh, it's gotta reload here. Hey everybody. I'd like to take a little bit of time to talk about

Speaker 3:          00:41:45       video doorbell. What is very odd. I was the shit video doorbell. This is the sound of a package being delivered or friends coming over for dinner, but it's also the sound of something. Plant someone planning to rob you. Blind Jesus Christ. That took a left turn, didn't it? Over nine 95% of home break ins happened during the day. And I write, but what is it? What's going on here? Oh, I think I'm stuck on one of those youtube loops where they just keep playing the fucking the doorbell. Well, I think it works with the copy. I'm going to keep it anyways. And burglars always almost always start by ringing the doorbell to see if someone's home before pillaging your possession.

Speaker 12:         00:42:29       I guess that's a fancier doorbell. Oh, I like this music too with ring video doorbell. You can see and talk to anyone from anywhere in the world using your smart phone. Hi, I'm bill her. What's happening? Is this a DJ party?

Speaker 13:         00:42:55       MMM.

Speaker 12:         00:42:56       Okay. I think we're having a fire alert here. Okay. Back to the back to the copy rings. Advanced motion detection alerts you, even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell, it's like a caller id for your home. You know, millions of people suffer every year and they don't have a video doorbell. Please share a personal story how this could help you or someone you love. Hey, will you share a fucking person story of cons? Is Isn't enough? I'm reading your copy. I don't know anybody who has a video of fucking doorbell. How does that work for you as your story? You'll get another one. I'm sorry.

Speaker 12:         00:43:39       Instilling ring takes minutes and it works with either your current wiring, my built in rechargeable battery.

Speaker 3:          00:44:43       oh and he fades up the music. Jesus Christ. They could be a DJ, but a fucking mouse had on me and see what happens. I'll tell you what'll happen, Huh? A bunch of drugs will be taken. Um, how much can I freak out? People at one of those raves. If you just had the DJ and he's clean, all this mellow shit, then all of a sudden out of nowhere I just started coming out on a mouse head screaming to over and over again. I would love to have an overhead shot of that, you know, maybe using one of those drones. He just watched them all scattered like fucking roaches all across the desert. Stepping on sidewinders.

Speaker 10:         00:45:48       [inaudible]. Hey, what's up?

Speaker 5:          00:45:49       The one on it's built, right? It is the Monday morning podcast from Monday, September 20th, 2010 and I am doing this really late. I apologize everybody. I had a Baru till day. I had a brutal Dan. It had nothing to do with my patriots getting their fucking asses handed to tool by the Goddamn jets. Congratulations. All you green concept there in the metal lands. Stick your chest out. I'm sure you happy. I'm sure you're proud. You know, you know what sucks about it is the jets game the week before the one that I predicted that I was fucking dead on right about that the ravens were gonna win happened on a Monday night. I had already recorded my podcast so I didn't get to talk Shit and pat myself on the fucking back about it. By the time I did the jets bounce back and kick the shit out of the Patriots and a, I will say this about it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:46       I actually recorded a podcast yesterday before the jets game cause I wanted to talk shit about it and give my prediction. But um, I actually ended up being dead on in my own way, but I didn't think anybody was really going to believe it. But then if some of them are reminded me that I actually did call, I said take the jets in the points. I did a thing on versus network, uh, this past week and I trashed the jets as I always do because uh, I'm from Boston and I fucking hate the New York teams. I respect your city. It's lovely, especially in the fall, walking through central park with the leaves crunching under your shoes. Who doesn't like to do that? Wonderful, wonderful museums. You know, a rare good slice of pizza. I will tell you that only because New Yorkers known for its pizza that are so many fucking assholes who can't make pizza have sprung up and they all say that they're famous.

Speaker 5:          00:47:42       I've said this shit before just out of you know, any, you New Yorkers want to tell the tourists where to go. Cause I got into a huge argument about some fucking brought Eaton cunt from Chicago who said New York pizza sucks. I mean granted he enjoys their Lasagna, whatever the fuck they called their pizza out there. And if you're from Chicago, tell me where to get the good deep dish. Because the shit I get out there, it's like even if you get the personal size one, it's like you feel like you ate a birthday cake made out of spaghetti sauce, but by the time you're done with it, it's that level of full where you want to kill yourself and it doesn't really taste that good. But I know there's no way that there's not a great spot in Chicago. So Chicago and New York have your pizza war.

Speaker 5:          00:48:29       Tell me where to go. But anyways, um, this is what I felt about the game was basically my heart. I have to go with the Patriots, but I just had that bad failing cause I have this theory on divisional rivalries is that they never go the way they go back. I remember the name of the God damn show was on, on the versus networks. That's really bad too because I had a great time and they were like, yeah, come back any time I can't remember the name of the fucking show cause that's how I operate. I go in there totally in just go in and fucking kill mode. That sold to the point that I don't even fucking, I remembered the channel that's new for me. I just did a fuck load of media and had something add something me the line in it. I can't remember what the Forza Nightline and, no, it wasn't that.

Speaker 5:          00:49:17       But uh, I was actually right two fucking weeks in a row. That's what's killing me now. This is nobi breakdown the game. This is what, uh, this is what I didn't like was the, uh, the Patriots' defense took a big step backwards and they look like the hapless crew from last fucking year. But I'm also smart enough to realize that week two does not define a fucking season. But, uh, I gotta be honest. Uh, and I was liking Hernandez. That guy look great. And I think Tom Brady was being really generous when he said, Dad, uh, we couldn't do anything right in the second half. It's like, dude, how about after the first quarter? I mean, I guess we went down and we went up 14 fucking seven, but then they march right back down the field. But anyways, hopefully I am, I am converting some people to my way of looking at sports, which is last week doesn't mean shit.

Speaker 5:          00:50:13       I mean, you gotta, you gotta like do like whatever the jets did, either being anemic or kicking the shit out of somebody. You gotta do it like three, four weeks in a row before you can get excited, you know? But I mean you just watched these analysts on TV and it's like whatever somebody just did is who the fuck they are. And uh, did I say it last week on the podcast, how the paths that led up three to 50 yards, 150 fucking yards to osho say I didn't like those numbers. I did not like those numbers. I still, I thought it was going to be one of those cunty 19 to 17 games. And I thought in the end I was praying that we were going to come out and get a victory, but I did not, I did not think that we were going to get, we were going to get pounded and we got, we got pounded in a very light way.

Speaker 5:          00:51:03       I don't remember any sort of big hit other than the big hit in the end for the fumble. But it was just sort of, I just felt like we were in a prevent defense from the second quarter on, you know, ah, just, you know, you deal with that zone, let people go. And I have to admit that fucking Reavis guy really pissed me off when he got burned for a touchdown and then grabs his Hami. Can I do that from now on? When I fuck up in life and I'm sitting there talking all kinds of shit and I'm killing for 20 minutes with jokes. And then I tell one that bombs and then I just, I started grabbing my hamstring and I fucking, you know, lay down and have somebody stretch it out. That was a really fucking bitch move. And I don't buy it.

Speaker 5:          00:51:50       I don't buy the whole goddamn story. I don't like how before the game even started, reverse already had a fucking excuse. I think he was scared from the week before. Not that he's bad, the guys to ship, but I think he was out of shape and he was worried that a Randy Moss was gonna run all over his island. That's so fucking gave Reavis island, you know, who would ever go there, but you're fucking guys standing around squatting down and that quarterback fucking position, you know, I don't know. Speaking of that. Speaking of gay, here's an email I got recently from a gay guy. Uh, believe it or not, I have, I have all kinds of fans on this. You wouldn't know this from some of those fucking assholes up in Seattle who branded me a homophobe because they listened to the first half of the, what are you a fig bit in?

Speaker 5:          00:52:47       Stomped off like the fucking pansies that they were. Here's a guy right here now. All right. Said Bill, watch, let it go last night. Uh, and it was fantastic. Congratulations. Uh, that's hilarious. Um, no, you know what's hilarious was I was thinking, let it go as my last special and I fly to held it in my head. I immediately pictured my, uh, why do I do this anyway? So I'm an idiot. Let me start over. Watch, let it go last night. It was fantastic. Congratulations. It was kind of cool to hear some of the things you had talked about on the podcast turned into developed bits. I was wondering if you brought stuff from the stage to the podcast or is it vice versa? Do you use the podcast to develop bits? I was also wondering how much input, uh, you are other comics have on editing on the editing of your specials.

Speaker 5:          00:53:38       I've noticed that your recent special is lit differently. Better in my opinion, than many comedy central specials. The audience is dark in there is a nice spotlight on you instead of the whole stage being lit. How did you get that deal? Also, the commercial breaks seem to come at strange places. Did you get to decide where they went? Sorry for all the questions. Bottom line is the special. It was amazing. The podcast is great and I'm a huge fan. Well, thank you very much that he said, ps, she looked great and better and better as you age. Does that seem gay for one man to say to another? Well guess what bill? I am gay. Deal with it.

Speaker 5:          00:54:18       Ah, that's fucking awesome. All right, great questions. They're twinkle toes. All right. What do we got here? The first one he asked, he said a watch, let it go. Less than it was for to Dah, Dah, Dah. Oh, you're wondering if do I take stuff from the podcast and take it to the stage and vice versa? Ah, there's a little bit of both, but definitely more podcasts to the stage. I try not to burn bits on the podcast where it's like if I actually did a bit from my act, then you come and see me. It's already kind of a finish thing, then I would feel like I was fucking you over. But there's definitely times when I riff on stuff that a little light goes off on my head and I'm like, you know what? That's really funny. And I think that I could take that somewhere.

Speaker 5:          00:55:05       But even then, even if you heard it on the podcast, it, it, I don't say it the way I set it on the podcast, it like continues, you know what I mean? Kind of like when Stevie Ray Vaughn did his cover of a say what Jimmy Hendricks, which was, wasn't that like two things spliced it together. I can't remember. Was that rainy day? I can't remember. He did. He did a cover up and he just sort of took the beginning riff. That's right. Yeah. He took the beginning, refer that and then he just sort of fleshed out the middle and edit his whole type of shit to it. So I tried to do that with like, did I just bring up Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jimmy Hendricks? I'm sorry. Sorry. My fucking Egos really pumped up with all the great emails you guys sent me about my special last night. But yes, to answer your question, um, occasionally shit like that does go to the stage, but I'm really sensitive about that because I don't like people, I wouldn't want someone to come to me and be like, dude, it was, it was everything you said on the podcast.

Speaker 5:          00:56:04       I, you know, I don't mind if somebody comes up and says, yeah, that was something I heard in the podcast and then you took it in this other area. Like, listen, I'm just fucking meandering right now. You can't do that on understand upstairs. People will be throwing like fucking potato skins at me. So, um, that's the deal. And if ever do an old bit from my act, I actually just say it. This is a bit I used to do and I usually do an abridged version. So there we go. All right, next one. Ah, I was also wondering how much input you had, uh, on the editing of your specials. Um, that's a huge thing that I have input on and from why do I do this and let it go is there is a specific look that I want and as specific vibe that I am looking for and that, and it's very important to me and I think it's even more important than the fucking material if you can believe it.

Speaker 5:          00:57:00       Just because I have seen some unbelievable comedians with shitty production and it knocks down the level of your performance. And that sucks because it's not your fault. So you really have to like, I've learned that just through like the few TV movie things that I've done, like as far as editing, lighting, all those fucking guys, the sound, all of those guys, director, all of those guys. It's like they can take a mediocre performance and make it look fucking unbelievable and they can take an, an amazing performance and make it look like cannonball run part two if they don't know what the fuck they're doing. So, uh, so there you go. There's my big shoutout to art and industry who's done my last two specials and we'll continue doing my specials cause they do a great fucking job. Uh, I basically tell them exactly what I'm looking for and I always come at him with shit that has nothing to do with comedy.

Speaker 5:          00:58:03       They'll just be like, what do you want it to look like? I'm like, you ever see the magnificent seven when they're fucking sitting there eating those Rancharrah Huevos whatever the fuck you saying. Um, I come at him like that. Um, so there you go. Great. Kept great question right out of the Goddamn Gate. Um, but anyways, let's continue on. Uh, talking a little football here. Um, how about those fucking bears? Huh? I didn't know that Mike Martz is, uh, is their offensive coordinator. They all of a sudden overnight got a little scary. And like I said, I'm not judging them on two weeks. I mean they've basically lost to the fucking lines and then we're given that victory. My apology to lions fans last week cause I was going like, look at you guys, you're playing competitive. I had not seen the highlight of how you got fucked out of that game. Um, but like that is a devastating combination cause Mike Martz is PR is like right in his fucking wheel wheel house. You know what I mean? It's like how Deniro was doing comedy and meet the parents and all that shit. But all of a sudden if, if they go back to doing the good fellas shit, he's right. He's debts. He's fucking in it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       So

Speaker 13:         00:59:23       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:59:24       I dunno man. That's, that's, that's the big thing. You got to have all the fucking pieces. You could have the ownership, you have to have the coaches and you have to have the players. It's like what that fucking Matt Cassel. I remember Bob, my buddy of mine was giving me Shit when we traded him for a first round fucking draft pick or whatever, the chiefs, he was like, dude, I mean the guy look it up. He went 11 and five and then all of this

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       fucking pieces, all those people who are trying to give Brady Shit because Brady was hurt yet the patriots when 11 and five typical fantasy football fucking morons, they don't realize that Mac castle was driving a Lamborghini that year. He was driving a team throughout the regular season that went 16 and oh when every fucking game and what did he, he managed the fucking game and gave us five less fucking victories, but then people's heads, they're like 11 and five man, that's fucking nuts. If he goes to Kansas City and does what it does, what drives that fucking 1972 eco liner that is the Kansas City chiefs now all of a sudden, right? You fucking need a fuel pump. The time and belt snaps and right there. Matt Cassel looks like he should be holding a fucking clipboard again. Is it his fault? I don't fucking think so. But you got to have everybody. So that's my point. Dot. The fucking Chicago bears haven't.

Speaker 13:         01:00:49       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:49       What's his face, Mike? March. Whenever the hell his God damn name is. I can't even think at this point. I'm so sick of fucking talking after a week of press last week. Um,

Speaker 13:         01:01:00       yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:01:00       having those two guys is huge, is fucking huge. And all of a sudden Jay Cutler looks like a good Goddamn quarterback, doesn't he? Doesn't he?

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       So with that, how about some predictions? I gotta Talk Shit early. Pets are playing again next Sunday. Which Patriot team is going to show up, you know, according to in your my stats, the exact same fucking defense showed up both fucking weeks. God dammit. Our defense stinks. We're not going to win shit without, you know, something that's actually a

Speaker 5:          01:01:33       great, uh, I think it, cause I never felt like the patriots players ever got their fucking do when we are winning those champions. Yet there were a mediocre team with no superstars. Now all of a sudden I don't, you look at Teddy Bruschi in verbal and all those guys in a different light. Maybe you don't, I don't fucking know. What do we got? Let me talk one thing. New Orleans at San Francisco, there's another divisional rivalry game. I don't like it. Everybody say New Orleans is going to run all over them. I don't like it. I think it's going to be closer than that just because they were in the same fucking division. Those games are always conti. All right.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       Week three buffalo at New England. Yeah. Joe G H I want to, we're going to bounce back,

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       but I mean I don't find them fucking know what that difference. You know what it is about the pets. We have no pass rush. All right. Jet Fans before you get all excited about Sanchez sitting back in a fucking lazy boy in the pocket. That son of a bitch can scramble though. I will give you that. But who do the jet have next week? Who Do they get? Who they get? Are you guys talking shit again? Oh, jetset Miami. Miami's going to beat Ya, man. He's got a fucking insane defense. You're going to go on the road. All right. I think. What's his face? Rex? Ryan's going to poke his head out of the shelf. He's going to start talking shit. It's going to look at, get a little drunk and get sunburned. Fall Asleep on the fucking beach is he's going to be miserable down there.

Speaker 5:          01:03:05       I have no idea. I have no idea. But I'm telling you right now, they are fucking jet fans before your hoist a fireman up on your shoulder like you're doing the village people fucking act. Uh, don't sleep on Miami. You don't like about Miami. Their coach looks like he's in the fucking witness protection program. The fuck is with that guy. I watched that game and, and they kept cutting to him on the sidelines on, I have no fucking idea what he looks like. He's got a baseball hat yanked down to his huge fucking Tony Curtis sunglasses. He's got that big, uh, who's that guy from the big Lebowski? Ah, does the narration, whatever the guy from mass, he's got one of those fucking, I own a Harley musty. I have no fucking idea what he looks like. And then Green Bay. It's Chicago. That's a great Monday night game.

Speaker 5:          01:03:53       All right, Jay, I have to get back to the podcast here because I know a lot of people are, are uh, not sports fans. So let me tell you about my week. Everybody, um, leading up to my specialist, I went to New York City and I did the opiod Anthony Program. Wonderful Program. If for some reason you live in a cave and you've never heard of it, it's a, a sort of a political show. Um, a lot of topics are discussed. I'm actually, obviously I'm fucking around over the top and I got to tell you, Jim Norton had the funniest God damn joke that I don't even think got the laugh it deserved. It was so funny. It actually made me a better person and I'm going to tell you why I was fucking opiate mentioned he was trying to sign something and he said that they wouldn't let him sign it with like a pen to paper.

Speaker 5:          01:04:43       He had to do this virtual signing or whatever. That's computer thing. So me being the shed head than I am immediately jump into a connecting the dots that this is this big conspiracy that they want to have this computer. Um, I dunno. Something like, I don't know. I can't see, I'm so stupid. I can't even see, I can't even say how the fuck am I trying to say here. They basically, then they have [inaudible], they have you basically your signature like on a stamp, but it's in like computer form and they go and that's for the Illuminati. And then later on five years, if you don't like what they're doing, just take out the Amaa

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       Nazi document and it just puts your computer signature right underneath it. That's what they're going to do. And then Jim just goes, or the Illuminati could just forge your signature. Uh, I butchered it was fucking great. And it really just made me feel like, exactly bill. Exactly. You know, why don't you just fucking relax if they're really that powerful, do they really need to create schemes to that fucking level? And a, I have to tell you, I, I must've thought about that line maybe 50 fucking times. I've just been walking around thinking my crazy thoughts and then that joke, his voice keeps popping in my head going, oh, the Illuminati could just forge a signature. And it just makes me laugh at what a fucking ridiculous human, yeah. Human

Speaker 5:          01:06:05       being. I am. Um, so there you go. Shout out to Jimmy Norton now. Um, but anyways, so this is my week. So I did the opening of the program. I did a, I did the versus network. Had a great time on that and hopefully we'll be doing more shit on that. I also did a Nesson where I talked to all kinds of shit about the jets. I had fun on that one because that was just in Boston. So I was able to, I didn't have to bleep be diplomatic on that one and a what others did. Pete Dominick show, I did a Jim Breuer show. All those guys just want to thank say thank you to everybody who let me run my mouth and a height, my special and thanks everybody who watched it and uh, sent me all the great emails and everything. And uh, and with that, if you'd like to buy it, go to amazon.com you can actually, the presale I think, is it still a presale price?

Speaker 5:          01:07:01       I Dunno, it was like 13, 26. Uh, if you want to buy it for that cheap amount and then bring it to one of my shows, I'll fucking sign it for you. I don't give a shit. Just go ahead and buy it. And I would really appreciate it if you guys would go out and buy it because believe it or not, it really does help me as a performer if you do things like that. And uh, one of the things I've noticed being a huge music fan is I go on, um, I go on youtube and I'm always watching, uh, you know, like clips of bands and shit like that. And one of the things that people keep asking is they say where resolved the talent. You know what I mean? Like where are the Beatles were the stones where, where are the, uh, the Marvin Gaye's where all these fucking people, and I have this theory, granted Jim Norton might take the fucking piss out of this one too with one of his fucking life, great lines, but it's the same people asking these questions of the people not paying for music and a decade of trying to have your cake and eat it.

Speaker 5:          01:08:09       Basically the music industry doesn't exist anymore. And for his dirty and filthy as those sons of bitches were,

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       there were just like, there's good and bad comics. There were genius guys in that industry and they knew they could spot talent and they knew how to develop it and nurture it before they put it out there and that type of stuff. And then of course then they would steal from them. Um, but like that system doesn't fucking exist anymore. And, uh, my business, it's going the same route where TV, film, Dvds and all those are not being paid for and uh, people are losing their jobs and that type of shit. So I don't know if you like comedy, if you like good television, I suggest trying to not saying don't watch reality shows. I would be fucking hypocrite right now cause I love the Jersey shore. I really haven't watched season

Speaker 5:          01:09:06       too, but I watched the Jersey shore, but like I still try to watch scripted shows. I pay for movies, I don't steal movies. I pay for all my fucking music. And uh, I don't know. If you don't give a fuck, then just by all means go ahead and steal it. But if, if you're one of those people who's wondering yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:09:25       where all the great bands are, where the great writers are, Eh, that they don't have

Speaker 5:          01:09:30       jobs right now, they don't because you can sit on a toilet and take a shit going, sitting on a toilet, sitting on a toilet, sitting on the toilet. You can do that and you'll get for some reason a zillion fucking hits. And uh, I dunno, I don't even know what my fucking point is. Just for the love of God. Can you buy the Goddamn DVD? All right. $13 26 cents so he can pick it up. Fucking 20 bucks at one of my shows. I'll sign it for you. Take a picture, give you a Goddamn hug, whatever the fuck you need. But for Christ's second, can you support my God, they have career. That's all I'm asking you. All right, look, I go on youtube too. All right. I'm just, I'm not saying, you know, I mean, I go there, I look at Shit and I'm looking at Shit for free.

Speaker 5:          01:10:17       I realize that, but the shit that I really like, I do pay for it, but I pay for all my fucking music. All right. God dammit. You know what's funny is most of you are probably going to go out and buy my DVD and I just basically did what the fucking Catholic priests would do when I was growing up or they would basically yell at the people who showed up for church. So with that, let's give you some funny youtube clips and you can watch all of these right in a row. Conveniently on the, uh, the EMN podcast.com the official fan page of the Monday morning podcast. And I want to thank all the listeners, uh, who go on to that left, all those great messages about them going out there, trying to get the word out. I'm telling you, even though you know it, it helps out.

Speaker 5:          01:11:02       You have no fucking idea how much that helps me out due to the fact that there's 500 channels now. There's the internet, there's video games, there's people with cameras making videos for fucking youtube. There's just so much shit out there. There's Tivo and all that like you guys do in. That really, really helped me. So I just want to say thank you. Okay. This is really a feel good podcast. You would never know that my team got trounced by the team that I've been trashing. Oh, by the way. Oh, the Jetson apology. Um, I'm not the part where I say they're not going to win the super bowl and I, I won't apologize for that. After week two, um, but the fact that I actually suggested that they still play a giant stadium and that they sub leaded their stadium from, uh, from the giants.

Speaker 5:          01:11:50       They don't now, now they co own it with the giants. So the jet's got a little more credibility in the giants became a little more pathetic, but they can spin it and just say that what they're doing is a very green thing to do. It's great for the environment. But, but considering, uh, the jets, their colors are green, I still think that they come out on top. So a what do you guys say about that? Um, I missed the game last night where Peyton beat the shit out of his little brother. Like all big brothers should do. I have to tell you that if you have a younger brother, at no point in your life can you ever lose to him in anything ever.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:12:31       Now I, you know, he can get a better fucking job, marry a hotter woman that can fucking happen. But I'm talking about shit that really counts like sports, wrestling and a, in a real fight you can never fucking loose. And if they, even if he beats you in a fight, what you do is you just turn that into a round and as you collect yourself, you grabbed something to beat them over the head with and then you went round to,

Speaker 5:          01:12:58       I know the ladies out there probably don't understand that, but anybody with a younger brother, I'm telling you, I never lost to any of my younger brothers. I am undefeated in fights undefeated. If I said that right now, considering we're all about the same size, I would have a couple of fights on my card, but, uh, hopefully no one in my family listens to this. All right, let's get onto the youtube videos for the week. All right. Your sons a bitches. Um, all of these are available on the [inaudible] podcast.com. You can watch them right in a row. All right. This is one of my favorite videos I've seen in awhile. It's called Macho Salad, m a c h o o Macho Salad. And this is just a great piece of acting from a, I don't know what movie this is. I believe at they speaking German. I can't fuck I remember, but this guy wants to get laid and his, his girl tells him, you know, she's not in the mood.

Speaker 5:          01:13:54       This is what I'm guessing from the dialogue and tells him to go make a salad. And this son of a bitch makes a fucking salad and a, it's awesome. It's just like, it's just one of those things where I don't know how many takes this guy had to do, but, uh, it's, it's the shit and I aspire to someday be able to do something like that. Acting. All right. Um, the next thing we got here, uh, this, this video actually made me so upset. You have a watch a youtube video and you wish that you could just somehow step into your screen and fucking go into the video and just basically inflict your view of what the justice should have been now. Well, okay. The watch this video, it's actually a clip from the doctor Phil Show. You know, that crooked cop looking dude who pretends he's a psychologist, but he's really just a fucking therapist who wanted to have groupies so we can get some more pussy on the side and realized that he wasn't going to get it in a, in a fucking therapy room.

Speaker 5:          01:14:57       So he was like, I know, I'll do a TV show and say obvious shit slowly. Uh, anyways, let's continue. Uh, he has a clip on there. It's the name of this video is called fat kid slaps mum. Mum. All right and just to set this one up, this is basically obviously a mother who can't control her kid. He's a fat kid. He's about 11 or 12 is voice hasn't changed yet and he's sitting there sitting down across from his mother who is also sitting down and nose to nose. They are having discussion and this kid is taking his mother to task, interrupting her and then when she gives him shit for interrupting her, he goes, well how does that feel? How does that, how do you like it? Like completely out of fucking control and this kid's got this temporary so fucking out of line.

Speaker 5:          01:15:59       And then she starts giving them shit and out of nowhere he just hauls off and fucking slaps her like a God damn pimp. Oh you only need one. The only reason why I wasn't a pimp slap it cause it wasn't a backhand but it had the same fucking, it sounded like a flare chop right to her fucking cheek. And there's this pause and I'm like, oh my God, she is going to be on him like a mountain lion and I'm going to see the bomb. My guy jumping in trying to pull her off from climbing the eyes out of this kids fucking head. There's that pies. And then the kid just goes, how does that feel? How do you like it? And the mother does absolutely nothing. And I swear to God, I was just like, I had to like stand up and like walk around and do like little circles. You don't when you want to walk away from the video, but you have to watch it again. So you just do those little fucking figure eights. I was like, you gotta you gotta be fucking kidding me. Why aren't you fucking chill in that kid right now? Right. And I, you know what I would've done if I was there, if I was at a, I just wanted to insert, I just really, I was scaring my dog over there. Sorry, Dude. Sorry about that. All right. We're just acting over here. Everything's good, man. Everything's good.

Speaker 14:         01:17:20       Cleo Odey Odey Odo

Speaker 5:          01:17:20       sorry. Um, what does it take to make it dogs fucking wag its tail? It takes literally two seconds. Um, anyways, I just looked at that video and I was,

Speaker 7:          01:17:37       yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:17:37       I immediately just imagine being married to that woman. And then that was my son and I was,

Speaker 7:          01:17:44       yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:17:44       I got to tell you right now,

Speaker 7:          01:17:46       if, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:17:48       when I married here and we have kids and do all that shit, if one of our kids ever slaps her in the face, I will. I would've, yeah, I would have fucking throat. I want to choke slam that kid through the fucking coffee table with any luck. It would be one of those old school and tea coffee tables, you know, that were made out of the really good wood from deep in the fucking forest, not that Ikea Shit that explodes like a fucking stunt table, you know? And I would just put that motherfucker right through it and then I would pull him up by his goddamn larynx and then right through the fucking dry wall. All right. My hand would be disappearing into the wall. Like I just fist it a fucking horse.

Speaker 5:          01:18:39       And you would be wondering where that kid was. And then I pull him out and he'd have all that fucking plaster in his hair and he'd start to cry and then I would just fucking take away like three quarters of his oxygen and I would whisper in his ear really calmly, like one of those bad guys in those great eighties movies with Mel Gibson. Well, once they get them tied up or fucking Stallone or whatever, all the fucking, the goons would get and tied up. And then the, the, the real, the, the head bad guy who is running shit would just come in all relaxed with his fucking dress shoes and suit and we'll just come up and just sort of put his face like parallel to the other dude's face. You know, you just come in and he just whispered right in the guys here, nice and calmly. That's what I would do to him as this kid was struggling to breathe. I just put my fucking head right next to his ear and I would just be like, if you ever slap your mother in the face again, I will fucking kill you. Do you understand me? Do you want to stay on me? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:19:48       The only reason why you're not dead right now is because I haven't figured out how to get away with it yet. I'd be saying Shit like that and then you go upstairs and you go to your fucking room. If you even look at her over the next month, I swear to God, I will grab you by your fucking baby fat and the top of your fucking head. I will throw you upside down through the fucking bay window. Do you understand that? As you sit out there in the rain, picking the glass in the woods, shards out of your body? I'm going to take a tray or hot macaroni and throw it right on your fucking face. That's what I'm going to do. If you ever fucking touch your mother again, was that a little too violent? Was it will I don't give a fuck. All right. That's how I came up.

Speaker 5:          01:20:31       You know, I grew up, if I, if I actually the reason why I expected that woman to claw their kid's eyes out, cause that's where my mom would have done. My mom did not need a father figure hanging around the Goddamn House. Basically. If, if that woman was my mother, the only role the dad would have would be at some point to pull the mom off that kid in order to fucking say, my mother would have just grabbed the nearest, she would have fucked it off. Remember old school moms, they, they've drew blood, they will like cats and they just fucking does is dug their nails into you and they grabbed you in really weird places. They would just grab like a handful of neck somehow have your juggler in their head. They do that and then the other hand, like their thumb would somehow get into this part of your arm pit you didn't even know existed and they would just take a chunk of flesh out of that somehow there'd be no holes in your fucking tee shirt and they would just stay with it was unbelievable. It's like a fucking Scifi movie. When you were done and you, you fucking went upstairs and your skin was just burning from wherever the fuck they had Claude you when you took it look like, yeah, like he got attacked by a bobcat right to delos mom's exist anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:21:56       I Dunno. I think there's been an overcorrection and more time. One of my brothers said that I kicked him in the face, which was bullshit. I kicked him in the stomach, which was considered legal and working it out amongst yourselves. My mother was brushing her hair. She was late for work. She had to, she had to go with frontier justice. She didn't have time for my side of the story. She just turned around and she went to smash this thing over my head, like a fucking gavel. So I did. Basically, I did this defensive move where I ducked, but not like a man. I didn't do like the boxing, like fucking come up and under and then fucking with the right hook. I didn't do that shit. What I basically did was I immediately did a fucking one 80 so now I wasn't facing my mother.

Speaker 5:          01:22:45       I put my shoulders up to my ears, I bent over slightly at a 45 degree angle and then for some reason I made my arms go a little, my elbows go a little past my back and I, I I squinted eye look like Pau Gasol before right before he decides to go to the rack, anticipating the foul. And Luckily I ducked enough, she missed my head and just hit me right in the back. Like I took one of those folding chairs and rustling from Pat Patterson right to my fucking back and I went down and a Goddamn heap in landed on that Kmart fucking bath mat is the shards of the plastic brush just landed all around me. And you know what my mother's big concern was was that she broke her brush, you know, and it was old school back then moon. You didn't have flat screen TVs and when you're broke a brush, if they, if the rubber part with the bristles still existed, she just continue using it.

Speaker 5:          01:23:43       And she did for years. She just, she just hit rather than having a handle and fucking combing it, like brushing it like Barbie, she just held it in her hand now like you know those brushes black guys use when they try to get waves in their hair. That's what it looked like and she just kept using that and every time I sought arrows reminded of that and it was like a week later that the two of us, we just started laughing about it like, mom, when are you going to buy a new brush? And she's one, there's nothing wrong with this one. There's nothing wrong with it. It doesn't fucking three quarters of it doesn't even exist anymore. It isn't a fucking reminder that you smash the rest of it over it over one of your kids' backs. No, she didn't give a fuck and she should enough. She was right. She was right. That was my thing about that show it. I don't know. That's the way parenting used to be. The mom used to kick the shit out of you and the dad didn't have to kick the shit out of you. All he had to do is go and you fucking peed yourself a little bit. And that was it.

Speaker 5:          01:24:42       So that's what I got out of that clip, man. That's just bad parenting. That kid should have never got it. That was my kid. That kid would have been stuffed upside down in a fucking hamper and slid down a flight of fucking stairs. Huh? How about that? How about your point now? How does that feel? All right. Give him a Lo's ass kickings where you, you only end up with one shoe on. You know, I used to do a bit about that on stage. I don't know if I ever fucking, uh, I might have to bring that one back. Speaking of that first question that I had, I used to do a bit about anytime you get beat up by five or more people, you always lose a shoe. You know, what the hell bit was that like, you know, you get your ass kicking your ass kicked when there's like debris of you afterwards and you have to like collect your personal belongings.

Speaker 5:          01:25:33       Oh fuck. I remember. What the hell did the hell did it go? Some other tag was something about having a deck of cards. I had a decade cave. You see the jacket diamonds, like just your shit was just that. I don't know. I can't remember how the fuck it went. But anyways. Um, so if you want to see what old school parenting looks like it, but in a funnier way, there's another youtube clip. Watch this, this clip. It's called spoiled kid gets yelled at and uh, yeah, the guy yelling in. This is basically dad. All right. This is the funny version of it, of what he really had to do and was totally in the right. Um, when he did it, like I don't have any, uh, that's my thing. You know what? The old school parenting, you know, it bothered me as a kid, but when I look back on it now, it's like I deserved so many ass.

Speaker 5:          01:26:24       Kickings so many fucking ass kick. I deserved them. I fucking deserve to ever, what time, what are my brother's pissed me off. And I took out a garden hose and I started spraying it through the fucking, uh, I was so mad cause I had a water, the plants and he was making fun of me and I just took this thing and I fucking, I just, I, I, you know, I had a temper, I just sprayed it right at him, right into the house. And uh, you know, and that was the day I learned what dark tastes like.

Speaker 4:          01:27:00       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:27:00       My mother had me, was on my back just pushing me into the mud. Ah Yeah. That was, those were the days. And then all your other siblings would stand around laughing cause your mother couldn't hear the laughter over the rage. She always focus on the one part is we're just laughing and then you come in with your mud covered face crying and everybody just laughs. Just Ah, Shit. I used to see, I remember back in the day, I remember seeing one of my, one of my friends mouthed off to his mother, I went over to his house to get some lunch and he mouthed off to his mom and he wanted to see when it dessert or something and she was just like, no, it's lunchtime. You don't get any dessert. And he can just go. So mom, I hate you. Like we were little kids and the kids' Dad did not even look up from his sandwich. Just took a whole Glick kids, whole glass of milk and just threw it in my face.

Speaker 5:          01:28:02       So my friend just starts crying, right? The Dad goes back to eating a sandwich and then the mother just got up right on cue, went over and just cleaned it up and that was it. And I can guarantee you that kid never said, oh mom, I hate you again. This whole fucking time out shit. I know that's a hacky bit, but I really believe it. I really believe that. You know, you got to slap them around. You gotta you gotta you know gotta hit you. I had a really hard, I'm not talking about literally abusing them, but yeah, you gotta throw a glass of milk in their face. You gotta grow, you gotta basically ruined one of their shirts. And by that I mean grabbed them by the front of it and lift them up by it to the point where all their body weight is on the neck of the shirt and it rips a little bit and leaves that red mark that goes past your fucking collarbone down to your sternum.

Speaker 5:          01:28:54       Then there's a whole generation of kids, listen to this day, have no idea what I'm talking about. But anybody remotely my age is punching the dashboard right now. Laughing, remembering all of this shit. Uh, I don't know. Did it make us better people? I don't fucking know, but we shut the fuck up at dinner. All right, let's continue. Um, question, uh, Bill, would you ever consider hosting a late night talk show? I would, I think I would love to do that. Um, I would love to do that. Provided I could do my monologue, like my stand up and I could really just sort of a do what I do in a cleaner, cleaner way. I guess. I would love to do that. And uh, I think I could actually ask some really interesting questions. Um, you know, and I'm not going to give away what the fucking questions.

Speaker 5:          01:29:47       I'm talking a little shit. Got a little Rex Ryan on you here. Go Little Rex Ryan on you here. Um, yeah, I would love, I would love doing that, but, um, I, my career has not gone down that direction. So that's like a whole thing where I think you have to decide you want to be a broadcaster. Um, like Jon Stewart, like early on, like I remember hearing like he just was this phenomenal comedian and then he just really early on started going down that road of being a broadcaster and you get seen as that. So, uh, I dunno, who knows. Never say never. If they gave me the opportunity now with fucking take it in a second. I would take it in a fucking second. Um, all right, here's some advice. All right. Uh, but, but uh, but, but uh, all right, Bill, let me paint me this picture for a moment.

Speaker 5:          01:30:40       I used to be terrible with girls. I was always a nice guy, but that gets you nowhere. Oh, Jesus. Exactly. Girls always said I was really nice, but uh, they were never interested. This was because I lacked confidence and wasn't sure of myself. There you go there. This guy taken responsibility for himself. It's exactly yet, so as time went on, I got a few practice girls in my conference inevitably grow and I started doing well. There you go right there. All you youngsters, young guys out there. Nice guys trying to get fucking laid. There it is. That's page one right there. You're a nice guy. You're fucking boring them. All right. You gotta be a little bit of a Dick, right? Nia is, you walk in and try to have respect for the podcast. How much look at you. I can see it on your face right now.

Speaker 5:          01:31:26       These, she's doing that classic girl thing where she's trying not to smile and she's rolling her fucking eyes and you know it. You gotta be a little bit of a cocky asshole. You've got to come up. You've got insult them a little bit. Yeah, you do. Like if I saw you right now, even though I like your outfit, I would walk up to you and be like, what do you, what'd you come straight from? Work. That's how you dress when you come out and you'd be like, what? I'm just fucking with you. What are you drinking right out of the gate? Come right out. Put your balls right on the fucking table. Take a look at him, sweetie. I'm just trying to grow. Shout No. Whenever you got to charmer, do what you gotta do. I don't like your fucking sandals. I don't like them. I've been meaning to tell you. Oh, that was a good one. Right in the fucking leg.

Speaker 5:          01:32:16       Didn't see that. She just gave me the finger as she walked out. See right there. That's the little ebb and flow. You have to have in your relationship. See if you're always complimenting them. You know what women are like, they're like dogs, right? This is a record for me. I've gone 46 minutes without trashing women. Um, yeah, they like dogs. They really are. As much as they tried to say, we like dogs, people are just like fucking dog. She can't reward them all the Goddamn time. Stroke in the back of that Goddamn head. Next thing you know, there's shitting on the rug. Maybe once in a while. I got to give him a little discipline. Tell him you don't like what they're wearing. Um, anyways, so he was a guy. He figured it out. Why am I not getting laid? I don't have confidence. So what do I need to do?

Speaker 5:          01:33:00       I need to go out there and get some at bats. That's what you'd do. You'd go out there and you start talking some shit and you're going to bomb and you're gonna embarrass yourself, but eventually you're going to push through and all those times you embarrassed yourself. They're just, they're just going to become, they're just gonna. They're just gonna be funny stories to tell. Um, oh shit. Do I have a funny one? I remember when I used to try and go to dance clubs, which were totally weren't my saint, cause not only was I not good looking enough to be in there, I didn't know how to dance and couldn't dance. And I would just walk up to girls and my opening line was I would yell, Hey, do you want to dance? And then they would go, no. And then I walk away. Oh.

Speaker 5:          01:33:45       And it would take me at least another 40 minutes if I did to get the courage to approach another one. And that's the thing you brought. Still fucking appreciate. You know, what are you going to do? Well, you got to sit there and pluck you who has and pick the right fucking colored dog, make sure it matches your bra. You get to do all of that and private. We got to sit there and basically it's like doing stand up. The only way to learn how to do is you have to go on stage and just eat your balls. You got to bomb. Um, I dunno. I guess it all gets made up because they get pregnant and they got to deal with that fucking Shit, you know? And if forget about the pain of pregnancy, can you imagine another thing growing inside of you? Jesus.

Speaker 5:          01:34:24       I would go to the doctor and be like, get this out of me. This, this virus that can fit. It's eating my guts. No, no, no, no. That's what's supposed to happen. Get it out. Get it out. Um, all right. Anyways, let's continue here. So a time went on and I realized how ignorant all that's. That was all right ladies. Ladies, it's ladies night today. It's ladies day morning on the Monday morning podcast. I should have a ladies' morning. Should I, a ladies night on the Monday morning, you know, and I'll play clips. I should do that and just be honoring you while I fucking just trash you. Am I own roundabout conti waste. That's what I'll do. I'll just play. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm back. I just ran out of battery power. God dammit. I was on a nice roll there. That always makes the editing difficult. I apologize. Everybody the fuck happened. Um, you know what's funny too is I went and I, and I bought a whole bunch of these two Aa batteries, you know, I'm like

Speaker 2:          01:35:37       girls, I said we need more travel aid batteries. He by Aa batteries,

Speaker 5:          01:35:41       I'm always using them. Right. So I go down to the Goddamn cvs and I buy like this big fucking 12 pack of them. 12 AA batteries. I go up to the package just like one left fucking God damn fucking women. Yeah. No matter what you buy, it's not enough. It's never a fun. I just go take a battery out of some God damn thing that she owns. No, not a vibrator. Yes. Fucking filthy assholes. So actually this baby monitor so we can watch the dog in here. Which crate? Training the motherfucker. Um, so we sit here and watch this. Why we couldn't just use our laptops and skyped it, you know, sent the signal up to the fucking satellite, whatever. Let's get back on track here. I swear to God, if I bought the 24 pack, they would still only be one left. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:36:34       Well, I just replaced the batteries and everything just in case.

Speaker 5:          01:36:39       Why is it illegal to slap you? Okay, let's plow. That's so me. I would never do that. Okay ladies, let's relax. All right, so let's, let's plow ahead yet. Let me, let me get through the advice here so I can watch the Monday night football, what you guys are probably already doing. Um, so anyway, so this guy here, so as time went on and got my confidence, I started doing well, I reserve the right. Uh Oh. Anyways, he said, you know, I didn't become cocky or start acting like I'm God's gift to women because I know, um, you know, I'm not that mentality and it's for dickheads. Uh, so anyways, this guy has been through a considerable amount of women. I'm trying to paraphrase here cause this is a really long email. He ends up meeting, meeting this girl, everything's going great. Um, he's having a good time with her.

Speaker 5:          01:37:26       After some time, this guys from Ireland, he says after some time, uh, the blow jobs in sex altogether had started to diminish. I had a paraphrase cause he wrote a ton of information there. Basically he meets this girl, everything's going great. They basically drinking and fucking, and everything's often, and then you know, it starts tapering off. So, uh, that's how it starts tapering off. And she started to use sex as a weapon. Uh, she play mental games with me and it, and I end up feeling like a bastard when she'd shoot me down for sex, I'd say that's cool. I don't mind that. I excuse myself. Go to the bathroom and crack one out. There you go sir. That's what you do. You know when, when you get to that fucking Kevin Spacey, Beautiful Mind Level, you rub one out right in front of her.

Speaker 5:          01:38:18       Never. I've never done that, but I think that, that's awesome. Um, anyways, Egos. Um, so anyways, I still got to Yampa the barrel, but she wasn't involved. And when I tried to talk to her calmly about what she was, see what she was thinking and how she was feeling, it would never go well. She returned on the waterworks and play the victim, even though she was the one who instigated the mind fucking, I'm not sure what her reject objective was because the concept of emotional blackmail is a foreign concept to me. Um, I had always tried to approach everything with the rational under understanding basis so that she wouldn't feel targeted or threatened. Um, I should also add that it took a lot for me to sit down calmly and talk while accepting criticism from her as I'm a very direct in often angry fella.

Speaker 5:          01:39:07       Well, that's the only red flag there. Other than that, you seem like you take your shit and you give it as well. Now you got to watch the anger. Do, trust me, I can speak volumes of that. Uh, I'm not the best guy in the world, so you can imagine how difficult it was, not the puncher in her cunt face. Okay. This is getting a little uglier. Uh, as soon as she started crying, as I see crying as a school yard scapegoat for girls to get what they want because they know men don't know how to handle it. All right. I'm with you with everything right up to there. Sometimes women do cry because they're upset. They do have access to that emotion more than we do. And I know, but I know that angry feeling you have where you're like, this is how you have to gauge that is basically, if they cry every time, then you can call bullshit.

Speaker 5:          01:39:57       But if they only cry once in a fucking Blue Moon, then you have to realize that you've really upset them and yeah. And then you just got to deal with that. That fucking awkwardness of not knowing what to do and then also feeling like a bully. But there's nothing worse. I will agree with you that if your right and you haven't done anything wrong and then they start crying and then you know, you can't be a dick in that moment, but you don't, that doesn't mean you have just cause they're crying doesn't mean you have to apologize if you're fucking right. You don't have to apologize. Uh, but there is that thing where if you make a female cry, I mean, if you're any sort of a guy, it's very difficult to just stand there and be like, what? Well, I don't give a fuck your crying.

Speaker 5:          01:40:41       Go ahead. Cry some more. Huh? Like you're that guy in the Great Santini you're gonna shed a few start bouncing a basketball off the back of their head. You can't be that guy. All right, so let's plow ahead here. Um, and anyways, females, if you want to chime in there, uh, ladies, um, what's the deal with the crews? Like what percentage of it is bullshit? Can I get an honest fucking woman out there? I mean, God knows guys, we have our techniques to get out of Shit, man. They're fucking pathetic. And you see right through them. And I know right now you're like, why are you just rubbing their fucking muffs right now? Because that's a strategy to win arguments. You just keep feeding their fucking ego. There's a lot of women out there who really believe that guys are so fucking dumb that they can't get anything past him.

Speaker 5:          01:41:29       And that's a great place for them to continue existing as far as I'm concerned. Um, oh yeah. Yeah. No, we can get anything by you. You're just fucking, yeah, you're the fucking goddamn world police with, you know, you have a vagina. You fucking know everything. Yeah. I can't get anything by you. You are all powerful. I bow down in front of the, um, you know what? He was funny about that. Yet any magazine out there can just, you know, fashion magazine can just tap into their fucking insecurities and get them to buy the dumbest, stupidest fucking war paid to put on their fucking face because some amazing [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          01:42:11       I don't know, nee knocked pigeon toed fucking drugged up Twat is wearing it, but you can't get it out. You can't get anything past them yet. That's great. My voice just cracked right there. Can't get a lake best them. Um, I'm sorry. I'm actually getting over a cold if you haven't, if you can't tell, how did you get the cold bill? Was it from traveling the country and doing all that press notice and it's cause I played a game of football and the fucking rain in street clothes before Monday night football last week. I'm sorry, I was amped up. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead. So, uh, basically this guy deals with her for the next two fucking months and he finally ends up just saying he woke up one day and said, get your shape out of my flat. This, this is over. I can't deal with these mind games.

Speaker 5:          01:42:58       So where do I get to his question here? Um, anyways, I don't have much of an ego. I like to accept my faults. You know, Dude, you've said that one too many times where I'm starting to think maybe you do and maybe this woman is buried in a new fucking turnip garden in your backyard. I like to accept my faults in the mid. What I have done is wrong and learn from it so as not to make the same mistakes over and over again. My question is, Bill, how do I get them to fuck up and stop testing my patients and how do I meet someone who doesn't want to control me with their bullshit games? Um, I dunno dude. I, half of this, I'm really going with you when you seem like an introspective person and the other half you're, you've worded this kind of like a psycho.

Speaker 5:          01:43:50       How do you get them to up and stop testing your pain? Like testing your patients? That's kind of like a, I pictured Dick Cheney type guy saying something like that. What the fuck do I know? Basically, I don't know what your problem is in this email. Okay. You dated a girl, she started playing mind games with you and all it was was after two months you were like, fuck this, pack up your shit and get out of my life. Um, so be one thing, if he was still in the relationship than I would say that you have problems but you don't, you uh, you met a psycho. So what I would say is, uh, I dunno, just stay singles. They single right now and wait till you find someone who doesn't, uh, try to mind. Fuck you. The problem is you sound like a younger guy and the problem is, is what you're learning is that the crazy girls, they, they're really down for anything when it comes to sex.

Speaker 5:          01:44:44       And, uh, that's really hard to resist in your 20s. So, uh, what I would say is in the future is when you meet a girl like that is not to get involved in a fucking relationship, but, uh, you know, Bang them and you know, get your stories out because it will prevent you from having a midlife crisis later on in life. Am My helping you out? I don't know. I mean, I'm kind of giving you shit here, but I'm also a, I'm trying, you know what I'm really doing right here is you're basically bearing the brunt of the fact that I've trashed women so much in the last 10 minutes. I have to try to seem like I'm balanced here and that I don't understand exactly what the fuck you're saying. Um, but I think, I think you're fine. She tried to play that mind game with you.

Speaker 5:          01:45:29       You didn't lose your shit, you said, according to you anyways, just send them fine. You went in, you rubbed one out your banker for two fucking months and one day you're like, what am I doing? And you just said, yeah, pack up. You shouldn't get outta here. So, uh, I would not, this woman is not a good example of a, of a good woman. All right? So don't try to, don't act like all women are like this. Like I have for a long time and like I do every week on my podcast just for comedic purposes. I like trash in them. It's fun and it's childish, but they're not all like that. If you're young, there's still great girls out there. Go out and go find them and, uh, I don't know. Make a list of what you're looking for. And then you also have to realize, dude, that you know, everybody's going to come with their faults like you with your temper.

Speaker 5:          01:46:21       Um, you know, you've got your faults, so there you go. Did they help you out? I probably didn't. It probably didn't help that I fucking paraphrased your fucking email. And then I also, uh, lost the batteries here in my, uh, am I God damn recorder. Uh, am I going to end with that with a whimper? You guys one of your quick revenge story. Sure. We all do a hey bill. I'm not much for shit jokes, but I thought you might be interested in one of my revenge stories when I was in high school there, this kid who was always giving me and my friend Shit. So we decided, uh, no wait, I just read that wrong. When I was in high school, there was a kid who was always giving my friend and I shit. So we decided we'd give him some look at that.

Speaker 5:          01:47:03       What a well worded shit joke. It's got a little foreshadowing going on there. Perfect amount of words. If the reader was a little bit better than what are going to laugh. So anyways, he goes, ah, he was the guy who would not people's lunch trays out of their hands in high school and high five his buddies and laugh. So he's basically like that kid who was in the Cobra Kai in the karate kid, whatever that actor's name is, who played that dude all the time. He was in back to school. He was the Goto Dick and all those movies. Anyways, he was the guy who would knock a link. [inaudible] my friend and I were known as the punk or skater kids, which I always thought was funny since we were just normal kids who happen to play music and would occasionally skateboard for transportation. Yeah. Punk skater kids. You think that that kid was just a football player?

Speaker 5:          01:47:53       I'm sure he, maybe he liked cooking also. You didn't watch the breakfast club. We stereotype at that age. Um, and he, he's a Witcher, blah, blah, blah blah. Or kids [inaudible] sorry, I keep losing my place here or any ways this asshole who will call Kent would try and start fight what fights with us in halls and would have his minions come up and push us from behind and runaway. Nice to see. Nothing has changed in high school. Um, we honestly didn't give a shit about those kids so we can more ignored them. Most of the time. Um, subutex, they were bigger than us and we didn't feel like getting our asses kicked. Um, but finally the day came, Ken came up, this is where they can't take it no more. I like this. Finally, the day came up, can't came up to my friend in the parking lot, grabbed a skateboard out of his hand, throw it on the ground and stuck his chin out saying, hit me. Come on, you fucking faggot. Hit me.

Speaker 5:          01:48:51       Was this kid real? Was he reading from a bed coming of age script? Mind you, my friend has never said a fucking word to this prick. So I go, yeah, go ahead. Fucking Arum Kent then says to me, uh, you don't even want to fucking try. I'll fucking kick your punk ass. Jesus. This is right out of the bully handbook. Uh, but me being about my friend being a smart ass, said my punk ass or my skys and p proceeded to scad, dance around Kent. It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I don't know what scar dancing is. Is that the move in that moment and is it, are you to get to and reinvent the personal computer? Is this one, this is what I see in your future. Anyways, let's continue on with this. Here are that night we went to Taco bell to get some food and decided to take revenge.

Speaker 5:          01:49:45       We each took our to go bags the bathroom and looked. It took one of the most satisfying shits of our lives. So you guys sitting in different stalls snickering at the son of your own shit hitting a plastic bag. There's a lot of layers to this. Uh, this movie here, it's got the classic bully. It's got the two nerds. They're bonding, sort of got a scat theme to it with a little scar dancing. You know, if you, if you write a treatment, you could probably get it made in this weird economy out here and now in Hollywood are let's plow to get a plow ahead. Here are we put the bags of shit in the trunk of my car. Please tell me you double bagged and drove over to, and at this point, this kid, so into the story, he actually writes this kid's real name, but we'll still call him Kent.

Speaker 5:          01:50:34       Uh, we emptied a, emptied the bags of shit into his mailbox while trying not to throw up from the smell. The combination of our shit almost made a slurry and was leaking out of the sides of the mailbox. Jesus Christ. We sped out of the neighborhood but didn't get too far because we both laughing so fucking hard. I can barely keep the vehicle on the road. The next week at school I heard some kids talking about what happened to Kent's mailbox. I couldn't help but smile every time someone mentioned it. And from then on, Ken's new nickname at school was shitbox. Ah, am I hope you enjoyed my disgusting story. But uh, I'm not usually one for revenge or shit. Jokes with this asshole deserved it. I love the podcasts. All right, well there you go. That's one way. And once he supposed to do, we can't kick the shit out of him.

Speaker 5:          01:51:23       So he shits in a bag with his friend and they dump it into his mailbox. Ah, there you go. People were going to end on that. We're going to end on that. The dungeons and dragons revenge story. Um, I mean, well, what happened? Did you ever find out why that is unsatisfying to me? Did can't go out there in reaching for his bully magazine and got a handful of our combined shit from the two of you or it is poor mom. You know, where to carry that bully around in is in her, in her womb for nine months. I Dunno. I Dunno what to do with it. I got all thrown off with my fucking, the whole thing out of the goddamn tape recorded crapping out on me. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week. Ended on a whimper rather than a roar.
