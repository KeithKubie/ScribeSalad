value divide in in modern societies I
 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.419
value divide in in modern societies I
focus a lot on Britain but I think a lot

less attachment to duty to non elite
 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.160
less attachment to duty to non elite
than they are less paternalistic than

than they are less paternalistic than
 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.510

the previous generations of elites yeah

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520
the previous generations of elites yeah
 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.830
the previous generations of elites yeah
I think one of the interesting questions

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840
I think one of the interesting questions
 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.050
I think one of the interesting questions
is why is this happening now I mean on

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060
is why is this happening now I mean on
 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.660
is why is this happening now I mean on
the face of it you might say that the

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670
the face of it you might say that the
 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.760
the face of it you might say that the
society has always been divided to some

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770
society has always been divided to some
 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.770
society has always been divided to some
extent between the highly educated and

extent between the highly educated and
 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.840
extent between the highly educated and
mobile people with perhaps more more

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850
mobile people with perhaps more more
 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.960
mobile people with perhaps more more
open minds and and more rooted people

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970
open minds and and more rooted people
 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.670
open minds and and more rooted people
with more more skepticism about the

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680
with more more skepticism about the
 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.900
with more more skepticism about the
outside world but why why is this why is

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910
outside world but why why is this why is
 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.030
outside world but why why is this why is
this now risen to such an important

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040
this now risen to such an important
 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.920
this now risen to such an important
place in our politic I think there are

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930
place in our politic I think there are
 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.560
place in our politic I think there are
two reasons for that

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570
two reasons for that
 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.270
two reasons for that
one is that and this is particularly

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280
one is that and this is particularly
 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.460
one is that and this is particularly
true I think of Britain in Europe one is

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470
true I think of Britain in Europe one is
 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.180
true I think of Britain in Europe one is
that the the framework of politics until

that the the framework of politics until
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.460
that the the framework of politics until
quite recently has been essentially

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470
quite recently has been essentially

to equality and inequality these have
 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.250

been the themes that have dominated

British and European politics in the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
British and European politics in the
 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.090
British and European politics in the
last generation or so you've seen the

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100
last generation or so you've seen the
 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.340
last generation or so you've seen the
emergence of what one might call

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350
emergence of what one might call
 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.200
emergence of what one might call
socio-cultural politics politics that

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210
socio-cultural politics politics that
 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.580
socio-cultural politics politics that
stresses issues of security and identity

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590
stresses issues of security and identity
 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.740
stresses issues of security and identity
and that's relatively new in Europe it's

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750
and that's relatively new in Europe it's
 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.050
and that's relatively new in Europe it's
perhaps not so new in America religion

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060
perhaps not so new in America religion
 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.790
perhaps not so new in America religion
and races always played a bigger role in

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800
and races always played a bigger role in
 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.970
and races always played a bigger role in
American politics and it has in in

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980
American politics and it has in in
 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.100
American politics and it has in in
Europe at least recently so I think

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110
Europe at least recently so I think
 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.170
Europe at least recently so I think
you've seen socio-cultural politics in

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180
you've seen socio-cultural politics in
 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.630
you've seen socio-cultural politics in
merging to kind of challenge that the

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640
merging to kind of challenge that the
 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.370
merging to kind of challenge that the
traditional dominance of socio-economic

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380
traditional dominance of socio-economic
 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.760
traditional dominance of socio-economic
issues and that is in itself partly a

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770
issues and that is in itself partly a
 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.710
issues and that is in itself partly a
reaction to the much greater openness of

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720
reaction to the much greater openness of
 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.740
reaction to the much greater openness of
our economies and our cultures over the

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750
our economies and our cultures over the
 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.200
our economies and our cultures over the
last 20 or 30 years it's a kind of it's

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210
last 20 or 30 years it's a kind of it's
 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.930
last 20 or 30 years it's a kind of it's
a it's a reaction against that openness

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940
a it's a reaction against that openness
 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.350
a it's a reaction against that openness
that you've seen the socio-cultural

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360
that you've seen the socio-cultural
 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.470

emerging so strongly and the second

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910
emerging so strongly and the second
 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.530
emerging so strongly and the second
reason is that the is simply that the

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540
reason is that the is simply that the
 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.590
reason is that the is simply that the
number of anyways has grown quite

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600
number of anyways has grown quite
 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.810
number of anyways has grown quite
dramatically I mean you just go back 50

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820
dramatically I mean you just go back 50
 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.870
dramatically I mean you just go back 50

about being in anyway it's about leaving
 

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.860
about being in anyway it's about leaving
often about leaving your hometown going

often about leaving your hometown going

cognitive elite and it's kind of
 

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.620

logically impossible and so everybody
