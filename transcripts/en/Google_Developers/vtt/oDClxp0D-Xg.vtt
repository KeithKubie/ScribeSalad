[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.040
JEREMY WALKER: Hi.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.540
Welcome to YouTube live.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.590
I'm sorry for the delay.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.470
We had some technical
difficulties with the HDMI

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.910
app, but we figured
a way around it.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.670
So hopefully, you guys will
get to see the demo.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.450
But I'm excited today, because
we have Skimble on.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.890
We have Maria and John with me,
and they're going to tell

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.340
us a little bit about their
product, and then we're going

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700
to do some demos on the Nexus
10, is that right?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.740
MARIA LY: That's right.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.960
JEREMY WALKER: On an Android
First app from what I

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.250
understand?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.720
MARIA LY: It is.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.120
Great.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.670
So let's dive into it,
since we're starting

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.830
a little bit late.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.600
Let's start with the
history of Skimble.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.930
Maria, do you want to tell me
a little bit about that?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.350
MARIA LY: Sure.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.730
Thanks for having us.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.560
So first off, we wanted to make
it as easy as possible to

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.840
have people get fit and active
wherever they are.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.110
And what's great about the
proliferation of mobile

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.450
devices is that people have
their phones with them 24/7.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.630
So we really wanted to unleash
the capabilities of the phone

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.920
to help people live
more active.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.670
We started Skimble with our
applications, basically to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.080
help ourselves train for the
sports that we love.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.440
And from that grew now three
different applications that

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.120
help people live active.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.230
And the latest one is
Fitness Flow, which

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.670
we'll demonstrate today.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.415
JEREMY WALKER: So you guys have
a website, too, so you

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:38.830
have a web app where you can
sign up and do some stuff too.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.080
So you have a web app
and a mobile app.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.310
Do you want to talk about the
differences between the two?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.770
MARIA LY: Sure.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.100
So what we offer is a platform
of applications that are fun

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.040
and dynamic.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.855
They all tie together on our
website, and just newly

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:57.620
launched for this year are web
workouts that you can do from

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.380
the big screen, your
Mac or PC.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.680
The three different apps that
we have right now are the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.850
Fitness Flow app and Workout
Trainer, as well as a GPS

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.880
multisports tracking
application.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.410
So as you track your different
activities, whether it's a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.650
workout or a rock climb or
a yoga session, it all

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.420
aggregates into your
profile and you can

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.956
access that on the website.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:24.380
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.240
And you can share this all
socially, like what you're

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.292
doing, and don't you get ranked
or something by how

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:29.380
many workouts you do?

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.140
MARIA LY: Absolutely.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.990
So as you complete workouts, you
gain activity points and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.630
you get to rank on our monthly
leader boards against your

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.940
friends, people nearby, and
our global community.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.910
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.770
One other interesting thing
I saw on "Tech Crunch," an

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.580
article about you guys, is you
had some link with Harvard.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.770
There was something you
were doing with that.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.820
Can you tell me about that?

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.190
MARIA LY: Right.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.240
So what we do is we work with
a big network of certified

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.130
personal trainers, health
professionals, and that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.070
actually includes the Harvard
Medical School.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.590
So we're partnered with them
to collaborate and create

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.550
content for our applications.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.070
And specifically, our Workout
Trainer app has a program

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.010
called the Harvard Health Gym
Coach, and you can unlock that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.160
inner app to basically get fit
and get trained with a bunch

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.280
of workouts customized
for your busy life.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.800
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.960
So I'm excited about this.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.330
It helps you work out,
especially if

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.340
you're new to it.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.320
But I'm really excited because
you guys are one of our launch

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.820
partners for the YouTube Android
Player API, which if

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.660
you guys don't know, it's a
native API that you can use to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.600
allow you to play YouTube
within your app without

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.430
leaving and going to
a separate app.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.080
So let's look at the demo
because that always helps me.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.260
I'm more of a visual person.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.590
So let's have a look at the
demo, and then we'll talk

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.650
about the technical details.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.155
MARIA LY: Sounds good.

00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:55.730
So I'll load this
up over here.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.440
So as you get into the app,
you can just click on the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.080
Quick Start button.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.550
-Bottom to Bottom Squats.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.860
These squats start and end
at the bottom position.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.591
Stand with feet shoulder
width apart,

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:11.545
bent knees to 90 degrees.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.000
Stand up and squat down, holding
for a one-second count

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.312
each time at the bottom.

00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:21.570
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.050
MARIA LY: All right.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.400
Let's say we wanted
to mix it up.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.852
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:24.852 --> 00:04:25.756
-Kimura sit-ups.

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:27.980
Start on your back with
your knees bent and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.160
feet flat on the floor.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.280
Place your hands palm
down by your sides.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.460
Crunch up to 30 degrees with
your left arm straight in

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.660
front of you and your right
elbow on the ground.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.420
At the top, twist your torso
to the right and bring your

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.330
left arm over to grasp
your right elbow.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.880
Return to the starting position
and then repeat,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.700
alternating sides.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.810
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.060
JEREMY WALKER: So this is
actually grabbing a bunch of

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.685
YouTube videos, and putting
them together and then

00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:51.530
flipping them out, right?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.800
MARIA LY: Yes.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.020
JOHN TIGHE: Right.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.490
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.900
-Start laying face down
on the exercise mat--

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.190
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.800
MARIA LY: So as you can see,
we're streaming videos from

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.170
YouTube and displaying
it on the big screen.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.850
When we have enough of one
exercise, we can choose a

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.050
bunch of other ones.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.910
You can even filter exercises,
so for instance, if I wanted

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.730
to just do body weight
exercises that,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.700
say, work my core.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.130
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.800
-Alternating full side planks.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.490
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.365
MARIA LY: Then it'll load the
exercises that are customized

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:21.245
for that specific body area.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.182
Once I've had enough, I can get
a summary of my workout

00:05:30.182 --> 00:05:35.820
and in the History View, I can
always do my workouts again.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.450
So it's kind of like a new
workout every time.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.410
Unlike maybe a traditional
fitness DVD that can get stale

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.930
fast, we offer hundreds of
exercise videos which you can

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.250
pick and choose from and go at
your own pace to really have a

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.560
customized workout experience
every time.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.080
JEREMY WALKER: That's great.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.590
So again, you guys are using
the YouTube Android Player

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.640
API, so do you want to tell
us a little bit about the

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.250
technical integration?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.970
JOHN TIGHE: Sure.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.090
So the challenge for us in
building this app was that we

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.830
really wanted to make something
that we think is

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.260
more interactive than the
typical YouTube app.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.920
Because as you can see, we're
playing the videos and we're

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.740
looping them, and the sound
isn't actually coming from the

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.990
video, it's coming from
a separate source.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.740
So we don't have to repeat the
sound as we repeat the video.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.190
And we really wanted the videos
to be driven by the

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.670
user interaction rather
than, say, the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.340
video's entire length.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.700
So that created a number of
different challenges for us.

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:47.470
The YouTube API's been
really simple, very

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.340
straightforward to use.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.970
So we just load the video,
and then we take a lot of

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.950
advantage of all the different
video callbacks you get.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.730
There's a Video Started
callback, a Playing, a Paused.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.020
And that lets us queue the timer
that records how long

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.822
you've been doing things, and
there's an Unended callback

00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:10.120
that we can use to start looping
the video again.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.440
And then we monitor
that state.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.910
And as we see the videos
progressing, we play the

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.410
different sounds that correspond
to the stage of the

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.340
workout you're in.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.450
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.461
Now, what part of the player
API, because we

00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:29.260
have different versions.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.340
We have a full one
that will pop up.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.405
Of course, we have an example
of all of this, like a wall

00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:33.990
and everything.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.900
We have fragment versions.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.110
Which particular one
did you use?

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.740
JOHN TIGHE: This is just the
YouTube Player View.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.800
And then we also take advantage
of the Thumbnail

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.296
Views for the List Views you
can see on the side there.

00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:48.830
Those are all Thumbnail Views.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.375
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:51.450
So you have a couple
of them running.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.780
JOHN TIGHE: Yeah.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.590
JEREMY WALKER: So I guess what
I always like to ask is--

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.852
something we always ask is what
language did you use, but

00:07:59.852 --> 00:08:01.770
obviously you used Java, because
that's all you can use

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.420
with the Android Player API.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:11.070
But did anything surprise you
when you started integrating?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.580
That said, you guys did start
early in the beta period, so

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.450
you gave us a lot of feedback,
which is great.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.860
But anything actually even
during that period that

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.780
surprised you as you
were going along?

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.080
JOHN TIGHE: No.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.140
I mean, just to be honest, to
me, "surprise" is sort of

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.940
maybe a bad word when you're
working on a project.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.980
And no.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.179
There were some moderate changes
to the course as you

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.150
guys progressed towards the
actual launched version of it,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.960
but no, everything was really
straightforward.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.280
So I thought it worked
very smoothly to be

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.380
integrated into the app.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.400
JEREMY WALKER: I guess
I should have said

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.230
counterintuitive maybe.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.130
But no?

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.730
JOHN TIGHE: Not that
I can think of off

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.980
the top of my head.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.380
For the functionality you get,
it's really a pretty limited

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:09.370
set of things you have to pick
up, just a few basic objects.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.470
Play a video, show
a thumbnail.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.525
It's all pretty straightforward.

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:13.070
JEREMY WALKER: Pretty
straightforward.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.330
Great.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.440
That's good to hear.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.310
So we always like to ask, are
there any features that you'd

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.940
like to see in the product?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.340
And I know you at least
mentioned one offline, which

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.090
you're welcome to
mention again.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.790
You were talking about you're
hoping to eventually release--

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.800
because people don't know
this, but this is an

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.370
Android First app.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.140
And for you guys to do
everything that you need to

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.900
do, you need a pretty low level
of control with the

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.470
YouTube Player API, correct?

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.080
So I think you were saying
you're looking for an iOS

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.600
version of this as well.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.815
JOHN TIGHE: Yeah, we'd love to
see an iOS version of the

00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:54.970
Android API, or the YouTube
Android API.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.520
No pressure.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.250
JEREMY WALKER: We've heard that
before, and I always like

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.720
to bring it up and at least
hear all the feedback.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.980
But we've definitely heard that,
so we hear the feedback,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.840
and we're looking into
it as much as we can.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.300
MARIA LY: And just to add to
that, I think overall, the

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.270
experience working with the
API has been fantastic.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.215
And we really like being able to
stream our exercise videos.

00:10:22.215 --> 00:10:27.150
They're HD in quality, so
bandwidth is sort of

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.950
a concern for us.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.150
So what I'd love to see would
be an even slicker way to

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.170
provide our streaming experience
in areas where the

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.900
bandwidth might be a little
lower or you might have some

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.660
issues with connectivity.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.440
We also provide an Offline Mode
setting, which provides

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.140
all the audio coaching, timing
cues, and motivational

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.230
messages sans the
video itself.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.550
So being able to manage the
experience in providing an

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.540
optimal experience for areas
or times when you have high

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.980
bandwidth, and also lower
and even none.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.990
JEREMY WALKER: OK.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.330
That's a good suggestion.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.840
I'll definitely take that
back to the team.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.740
Well, we usually like to
traditionally open it up, see

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.780
if we have any questions.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.220
I'll see if anybody's
asking anything.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.360
So there's a question
about IO.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.650
And obviously, just keep
an eye on our IO site.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.370
If you want to join,
go to that.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.910
There is a bug report.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.840
But of course with YouTube, we
always look at bugs, so you'll

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.610
want to go to YouTube.com/dev
and just log your bug there.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.760
We definitely look
at all those.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.050
And if you do have any
questions, you definitely want

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.690
to send them to Stack Overflow,
because we actually

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.450
keep track of that.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.930
But for bugs, definitely
look at that.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.510
And then there's, of course,
the same question.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.330
We put the same question
as a plug every week.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.440
Is YouTube Developers hiring?

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.640
And we are.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.790
Just go to
developers.google.com/jobs,

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.810
and just have a look there
if you're interested.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.010
Thanks again for coming.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.220
One more thing I'd like to point
out is you were telling

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.030
me, aren't you rated
on the top?

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.470
You want to talk about
that, your ratings?

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.450
MARIA LY: Sure.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.500
So we launched Fitness Flow in
time for the new year, and

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.440
we've already seen it
organically grow to be one of

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.430
the top apps in Free and Paid
For Health and Fitness

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.520
category on Google Play.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.460
So I think right now on tablet,
we're in the top 10 in

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.140
both Free and Paid.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.050
And our other application,
Workout Trainer, is also up

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.700
there as well, top 10.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.420
JEREMY WALKER: So if you don't
remember, you'll see it when

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.010
you look at the top downloads.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.220
Because actually, that's where I
found it when I was browsing

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.310
around before I started
searching for Skimble.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.302
It was pretty cool.

00:12:58.302 --> 00:13:00.930
But thanks for coming today,
thanks for talking about the

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.380
Player API.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.960
Any other closing words?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.150
JOHN TIGHE: No.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.620
I mean, just thank you for
putting this out there.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.890
I think it makes life a lot
simpler for Android

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.810
developers.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.290
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.190
We're happy to help.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.730
And download the app.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.330
It's pretty cool.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.490
I've been playing with it.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.670
You'll get a workout.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.570
MARIA LY: One sit-up
at a time.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.650
JEREMY WALKER: One
sit-up at a time.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.180
All right.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.460
Thank you for coming, and sorry
again for the delay.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.540
MARIA LY: Thanks
for having us.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.790
Bye.
