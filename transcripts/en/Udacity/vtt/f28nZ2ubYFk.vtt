00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.090
Now that we're logged into our server
as the student user, let's try and

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.900
run a sudo command.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.830
We'll try and run sudo cat /etc/passwd.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.410
We're asked for a [sudo] password for
the student which is just the standard

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.400
password we set for the user
when we initially made the user.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.330
We now get this warning.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
The student is not in the sudoers file.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.810
This incident will be reported.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.830
Our students does not have
permission to use the sudo command.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.330
So, let's fix that.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.290
I switch back to my other terminal
where I'm logged in as vagrant.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.190
This is a user we know
can run sudo commands.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.850
They can perform administrative tasks.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.770
Now, the list of users that
are allowed to do this

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.130
is within the etc/sudoers file.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.360
Let's read that file using
sudo cat /etc/sudoers.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.820
Here we can see that
the root user is listed

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.510
along with a few groups using % and
then the name of the group.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.770
On some systems you would just add
the student user just like this,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.640
using a special program called visudo,
that's allowed to edit this file.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.420
But on Ubuntu,
it handles it a bit differently.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.770
If you look at the very
bottom of this file,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.410
there's a here that says
includedir /etc/sudoers.d.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.310
This command tells the system to also
look through any files in etc/sudoers.d

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.830
and include those as if they were
written directly within this file.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.410
This is a common pattern since
distribution updates could

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.610
overwrite this file.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.740
And if that were to happen, you would
lose all of the users you added.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.700
By keeping your customizations
in this other directory,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.170
the system eliminates that risk.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.050
Let's see what files are currently
included in that directory

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.290
by running sudo ls etc/sudoers.d.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.160
We see a file here called vagrant and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.900
that makes sense since we're
actually using sudo here.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.730
Even though vagrant wasn't within our
etc/sudoers file itself, this file is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.960
being included by this directory, giving
this user the permissions it needs.
