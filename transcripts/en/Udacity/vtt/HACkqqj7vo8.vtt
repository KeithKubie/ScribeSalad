00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.250
We can express the amount of pizza
left as a fraction, thirteen-eighths.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.380
Remember that each whole
pizza is eight slices and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.680
the denominator needs to tell us the
number of pieces that are in one whole.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.100
The improper fraction thirteen-eighths
tells us that we have more than one

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.200
whole pizza because the numerator
is bigger than the denominator.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.250

write thirteen-eighths?
