Speaker 3:          00:01:02       ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       the lovely and talented Mr

Speaker 3:          00:01:07       Bill Burr has joined us. He's going on. How are you? How are you fella? I'm fantastic. I'm enjoying my coconut water. This is shit, isn't it? It's going to be all product placement. Yeah, it should be three. They sent me a couple of cases of this stuff. It's fucking awesome. Do you know something? If anybody else offered me a coconut water, I wouldn't have done it. I'd be like, that sounds like some gross, uh, Vegan whole shit at. But just because it was you when you always read like that, you know, dude, I was on a, you know, fucking coconut science.com read this whole thing about it so well somebody just stops man. Once after Jujitsu classes at Duda I work out with brought like a whole bunch of them to class. Was it an apology after he body slammed you with something here though? I have some coconut water though. Nice gesture, but it's fucking delicious. It's a, it's, it doesn't feel, it doesn't, it's not as boring as water,

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       but it doesn't feel like you're drinking juice or something where it's like heavy and Sarah be and you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:01:58       That I absolutely still shit. I'm gonna love it. And this, this stuff is healthy. Yeah. Yeah. That's really good for seriously, if you drink a lot of Gatorade, see I drink a lot of Gatorade cause I drink a lot. So I've kind of switched my Gatorade out for coconut water. That's all I drink when I work out. Now how I drink Gatorade if I get the stomach flu or like a food poisoning or whatever the hell I had. Like yeah, like last week. Yeah. They have PTO light. That's, that's something that's actually even better for you because it's all balanced out. Like when guys dehydrate, when they cut weight, they drink pedialyte, isn't it for me? I don't have any kids. Yeah. Everybody who has a kids was just saying, no, no, no, not gateway. Do you want to get PDO? Like why does that, that the beginning of that word just scared me. He just having a beard and not having any children being a Caucasian, I can't go. You don't even that Pto light for the pdf file over here. My names in the mix. Carrots, the name's not, that's a little unfortunate, right? Media Light. It should be, you know, some sort of a super electrolyte drink. You know, obviously means kid like pediatrician. Well it's, I think it's designing for it for children when they get sick, if they're dehydrated because you want to make sure that they get enough

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       electrolytes or fucks them up. Yeah. You know there's plenty of kids out there. There are. Look at the one there. Oh dear. Your own bill. You'll see and you'll see when they had half looks like you and no matter how bad your day is, when you to [inaudible] people used to say that your two minutes to drive me nuts. You'll see when you have young kids would be like, we shut the fuck up. You're all wrapped up in your own bullshit. You got this little fucking human being. It was an accident. You shot a load into a woman. The A's divided. Come on man, what the fuck are you talking about? Half looks like you and half the trick, man. It's a fucking biological trick, but then you have one. You Go, Whoa, this is a different, I never considered the amount of responsibility and attachment and just the biological attachment you have to them. Oh No, no, I'm not. I'm not crazy. I'm not saying that it is an amazing, oh no, I know you're not. No, you're not. A lot of times I say things, I say things and they become misconstrued. Yeah, you build. It doesn't like that. Slurping by the way is just for all you fucking getting angry that I slept my coffee. I get all these people emailing me easy drinking. You cough, you mute the microphone. When he drinking during your pants.

Speaker 5:          00:04:08       I gotta admit that's one of my pet peeves. When I watched your movie. I hate if there's a scene where the actors are eating. I hit mute. I can't listen to it because they fucking, you know actors, they've got to make an interesting, they can't just eat. They got up, we're going to fucking fucking robbed the bank and they start throwing shit in their mouth and it drives me nuts. Just the sound of somebody's lip smacking or like when you're a car with a girl that you just got in a fight with and she's eating Doritos and get to hear it like echoing off her skull, the crunching noise issues. This mother Fucker, he turned that into

Speaker 4:          00:04:41       shit. Yeah, he went to his own life. I have a fucking pet peeve. It's a weird one, but when I see someone eating in the movie, I secretly hoped they had to do a hundred fucking takes and they all threw up. I can can't keep eating because it just seems so forced. You know you're eating while you're having this conversation, you know, like what you were saying. No, we're going rubbers, folk on break. He's got a mouth. I'm on point with the bread was shit. You wouldn't do it. People will fuck is pointing with their sandwich. He'd be like, this guy is an asshole. He's one. He's fucking sandwich at me and telling me what's going to happen some way. You know? That's some weird intimidation. Shit. You ever have someone fucking talk to you and in the middle of we had talking, they put a hand on your knee, squeeze your knee while they're talking to you. It's like, what is happening here?

Speaker 5:          00:05:23       I got it. I got a couple of those. I mean, one time I liked it. I was shooting a pilot for some show that never got picked up and it was, it was hilarious because, uh, what the hell happened? Basically what they wanted, an edgy show, you know, all these things always start. So we give them this edgy show and right around, right before we did the run through the don imus thing went down what he said, nappy headed hoes. So the industry gets so terrified, it's not even just about radio now becomes about this frigging pilot. So they were already nervous about the jokes. So we went in there and one of the first jokes was, um, I dunno, some homeless guy comes up and as you know me for some change, um, you know, on the liberal guy, no, no, I don't want that.

Speaker 5:          00:06:02       And the other guy was a republican guy and he turns around and he flicks ice cream and it hits them right in the face. It was hilarious. Right. So they basically, they freaked out and then they didn't laugh at any jokes who are doing this run through and do it. I'm telling you, we're absolutely bombing. Okay. Now to me it's hilarious and it's not even that big a deal because I've bombed horrifically by myself. I'm bombing with the group. It's funny. Easier. Yes. I'm walking into scenes and the other actors, I see the deer in the headlights, I'm almost laughing. And the more it bombs, the harder I'm committing to these jokes. So anyways, so the whole thing tanks and by the end of it, you know, me and the other guy like, dude, I'm getting fired. He's like, no, I'm getting fired. So he ended up going back to the hotel and everybody shows up to talk about it and you know the creators of the show, I'll come walking in along with the director and I'm standing up.

Speaker 5:          00:06:44       I let him to run, the fucking director comes walking in, sits down in my bed and then reaches over, had some pain, it's there and just grabs a handful and start and starts eating. And I just wanted to be like, yeah dude, yeah, make yourself at home, have some fucking peanuts. But I was so in that I'm going to get fired. I was trying to be the nice guy. And that's like one of those things that slowly killing me is every once in a while like, you know, it was like years ago, I'll be driving down the highway and I just think of that motherfucker sitting down eating my goddamn peanuts, and I talked to you about it and you're like, dude, that's like some Alpha male shit. He comes into your placement live. He starts eating your food.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       That is a weird thing that people do. Some people just open refrigerator and start eating. I don't like that. Now that drives me nuts. The only person that I mind, I don't mind it is Brian Cowen and Joey and Joey always ask Brian Cowen, I'll come in my fucking kitchen. This dude's Eaton Pumpkin Pie. He's got whip cream on it and shit. I'm like, you, you broke up the whip cream. You made yourself a plate of Pumpkin and you broke out the whip cream and everything. I got all mine with Brian, Brian's my brother. I mean, he can do whatever the fuck he wants. Doesn't bother me, but it's still crazy. I wouldn't do it if I'm over your house. Somebody I'm gonna need. You don't even get a drink water. I'm going to wait. I'm going to ask you. Hey, can I have a water? I know you're going to say yes, but I have to ask you. I'm not gonna eat your fucking Pumpkin pie and put whipped cream

Speaker 5:          00:07:56       pill. Then I could let go of chef, stuff like that. I'd like a high school teacher called me the dumbest kid in the room and I'll still think about that. There was a 20 something years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       I have the same issue. I talk about it on stage. I reenact arguments from 1997 screaming at your windshield. That's what I do now. Now let me tell you something. Math teacher. Well, I'm glad I over all the years though, although all the stupid ideas that I've had about arguments in my head, I've avoided all physical altercations. I've never had a physical altercation of kid. I've had situations where, you know, a long time ago, I wish I told this guy that or I wish I told them this, but the reality is it's way better than I didn't cause what if he went, well fuck you. And then he fucking throws a rock at me and then all of a sudden were two men biting each other. You don't, you don't go that route. Wrestling in the street like fucking children. You know what the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       When I was a kid, my dad came home from work once with a fucking black eye. My Step Dad's business was going, it was falling apart and at one point shit got squirrelly in him and his partner fucking duked it out is crazy. Yeah, he can. Youtube wasn't around then. You know, there'd be some sort of security who was like, Whoa, aren't you looking your fucking forties it's like, what is happening? It was, it was disappointing. Embarrassing. It was sad. It was a bunch of different things all at once. It was bad ass on any level that your stepdad could still throw down. No, he could. I think he got his ass kicked. I'm pretty sure that's embarrassing. I'm sure. I'm pretty sure he got sucker punched and then uh, he hit the guy back. He punched the guy in the stomach, but I don't know who punched who first, but it's just fucking pathetic.

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       This guy was his friend and this guy used to come over to the house and we used to, you know, we all still have family dinners together. Like him and his wife would come over to the house and there was, this is my dad's partner and then all of a sudden they're fucking duking it out at work. Cause the, the business fell apart. Who was very, very strange to come over for dinner again or no, they became friends again. Yeah, they, they, they stayed friends. You know, they just, they've duked it out as friends and then they stayed friends. But it was just embarrassing and he was embarrassed to, he felt like such a fucking idiot. He came home with a black eye, you know, it's like, what am I dealt with? Ayroni man to read, pick up the friendship. It'd be easier if I won the fight, if I lost the fight, that would be in the back of mind.

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       You want the rematch? Uh, at some point you get used to, when you do Jujitsu a lot, you get used to getting beat comes formal. That's a different thing. They're going to fight and then like, hey, let's, let's try these techniques. It, you know, if like what if we had some big argument about we were going to combine our podcasts and then it just didn't go well and I didn't give you the money for the microphones and then we duked it out and you somehow lost. I somehow surprised you and it had all feel like one in a million chance. I somehow caught you. I would feel way stupid or that we're fighting. I would feel way stupid. Other than that, it's my buddies. I know, but you're martial artists that get it yet, but just right now go in peace. You've got [inaudible]. It's always worth, you wouldn't see me in there and like I got my back turned you down and my head, I'd be like, what bill?

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       How can you host me in the face? Did that Ron Howard look and Jackie has that wouldn't bug you. Depends on if you really just told me up. Like all of a sudden you just fucking unload like uh, a one to leg kick combination on me and robbed me. You hit me with a liver shot and dropped me in a, and then I had a tap out. Yeah. Then I'd probably want some sort of a rematch. Let me ask you this, which really upset, which you lose a belt class. Would you have to go back down to Brown belt? Purple Belt? You don't lose, I mean the only way you get the ideas that you're a certain level of proficiency, but it doesn't mean that someone can't get you. What if I started tapped all the time? If my face do your Dojo, there's no way you'd have to lose out when a bill who's next and I'm just sitting there with a stupid look on my face. You know, competition is healthy. I think it's fun and everything, but when it gets in the real world, like as far as like fighting people and shit like that, it's too squirrely because you don't just fight someone. They get mad and they come back and they want to bring a baseball bat or fucking stab you or shoot you. I never fought outside my family past June. Outside class you in

Speaker 5:          00:12:03       junior high? Oh yeah, let's get started getting to be like, you know, buck and a quarter and like knew how to becoming coordinated through. I saw one kid take a pounding and I was just like, yeah, I'm sticking with the jokes. It was this kid who, he was Jack, he's one of those man childs, you know, and like in like eighth grade, you know they aren't, they could like beat up the teacher but then they get to high school and they just stopped growing and then they're just this little fireplug. But in eighth grade that's like the, that's their peak. And this kid was at his apex of, of physical fitness and he was fighting this doughy, this baby who we looking kid and they go to get off the bus and baby who is behind Manchild and he just, you know, he just pushed him down from behind, jumped, got on his chest and it was just, he just started teeing off of his head and it was one of those, you know, when people go crazy and then it becomes disgusting.

Speaker 5:          00:12:48       Like the crowd was just like, oh. And I was just like, he was just beating the fuck out of him. He didn't come to school for the rest of the week and he came back the next week and the swelling in his face, he had come down probably 80% but he listens. Manchild still didn't look and he had a look in his eye. I remember his confidence was shaken. I'm I, it was, it was amazing, man. I was like, you saw it was a, it was a moment in his life and I remember just looking at that going, yeah, yeah, def, it was funny because I almost went out with that baby. He was a kid I would've gotten killed. And he's like, he just, he would have stabbed me with the, the fucking kid. No, he used to get bullied and he just, I dunno, uh, he was used to getting the crap kicked out of him by people like two years older, which is basically you're in seventh grade. Like that two years is a huge jump physically. And uh, it's like you're sitting there, you know, like, okay, I'm going to fight you. And the other guys, like you got like a beard, you know, smashing you over the head. So, um, yeah. So all my fights were basically within my family and I had four brothers, so I used to practice on my three younger ones and then try to take my older brother where the psychological advantage over me. So

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       all the brothers always have an advantage. Yeah. I can beat. I had a friend who's a older brother, used to beat the fuck out of him and it tortured him late into like adulthood. He was in his late thirties and it was fucked. It fucked his head up. He always wanted to get back at his brother. He used to go over his brother's house and his brother wasn't home and steal shit from him. Like he would go like his wife, his brother's wife was there. He'd say hi. And again, John told me to go pick something up and you'd go in and just steal from his brother was still in friendship rather than the other way the fuck out of him. His brother beat the fuck out of them. My brother was like two years older and just used to just box him up. He used to fucking really hurt them and intimidate the shit out of him. I got one for Ya. I went last time I fought

Speaker 5:          00:14:38       my youngest brother, uh, I forget where we went out and about. My Dad came in to break it up and like a piece of shit. I did one more over my dad's shoulder, caught them and it made that classic like Hollywood should have rec recorded the sound for like the punch in the face was that classic but like with a little bit of lip sounds caught him right in the mouth. And uh, I knew what bugged him and then what would it for like 15 years we would be out drinking. And like when he got on his third drink, I would feel him sizing me up. I felt it. I felt that I was just going, is this in my head or is this dude sizing me up? And then like years later I'm drinking with my other brother and we were talking about, and I'm going, yeah, he doesn't think I noticed, but I feel him size and up.

Speaker 5:          00:15:18       He goes, oh yeah, dude. He goes, every time I drink with them, he brings that. And like by then he was a little bit taller than me and he had that, that, that anger and stuff. But, uh, I just want to, I want to just tied them up. Like I got to a point where I just, you know, I'm going to strategy play that you had dug out of the sucker punch. Get the clench. Yeah. My older brother came at me a baobab 11 years ago and like a red roof inn. It was some, some sort of bullshit. Uh, and he came flying at me, you know, my brother is no joke. He can fight and I, I just tied them up. I had been, but I had the advantage where he has a real job so he has to work. I can sit here and going on hikes and going to the gym and stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:15:58       So I was in cardio, I was in better shape, so I just, I just tied them up. Hello Jeff. Time up for not, not long too. And he was like, he was teen. Second was liking cubicle shape. He had like that initial, I'm going to, I'm going to kill you. But this is the thing though, if he would have, if I didn't, uh, tie him up. Yeah. That's all I, it's, it's like in hockey when, when someone goes out on a fight, they just grabbed the guy in like bear hug them. I just thought it did that and I was, uh, how was it? He was kind of on top of me, but I just, I just said I'm sort of smothered in there. I was like, dude, I'm not gonna find nothing. Can he didn't talk to me for a year. Wow. You didn't talk to me for a year.

Speaker 5:          00:16:31       And what was he mad about? I don't, it was, dude, it's that family shit. Some, I dunno, something from 1974. I'm glad I don't have bread off cause I would not want to grow up with someone like me if I was a brother, if I either like one or two things would have happened would have been either we would join an alliance and fucking start a team take on the world and tag team chicks or we would fight to the death. It's going to be one or the other. I don't really see any of the other options. Yeah. So which one's going to be fucker? Yeah. No, I think there's a reason why you didn't have a brother. Cause I, whenever I talked to him, he has like, you'll have like a couple of parakeets and they somehow have a fight to the death. Like, dude, I don't know what's with Perkins.

Speaker 5:          00:17:10       They just go at it too. It's like you're way more mellow. When I met you in the nineties dude, this guy was like in game seven energy. It's so fun. Everyone keeps on saying that the way, way more mellow. I think we're just now feel comfortable to tell him now. Is that what it is? Not [inaudible] you're now so mellow. We can talk about it. No, but I was way more angrier when I met him. You know what I mean? It's one of those things while you're, you're, yeah, you're, yeah, your twenties you're processing what the fuck just happened to you when your first 20th hopefully you had a good childhood. If you didn't, you end up in show business or whatever and then you know, you kind of thinking back

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       to that stuff. So, yeah. You know? Yeah. I'm kind of just realizing how, how much of a difference it must be for people because so many fucking people bring it up and I try to think like, what the fuck I was like when I was younger that I don't think I was a Douchebag, but I definitely think I had douchebag tendencies. You know, like if you were a Douche bag to me I could just go full douche right back at Ya. And it gets stuck in some stupid ass douchey argument that really rationally I shouldn't have been caught into it. Like your energy man, you are on the balls of your feet, you will fucking ready. It was like your energy was like you had just gotten into a fight. Well you met me. I was only probably when, what do you mean when I 96 96.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       Wow. That's a lot of years later. That so's thinking you probably met me earlier in the nineties when I, uh, my last fight I think was like an 89. I took a while for me to just wind down as a human being from that, just from the idea of competing, because most of my life from 15 to 21 was just competing in martial arts tournaments. That's all I dare you would like a retired athlete and now you just, you know, 21 you know, it's all of a sudden I'm trying to do comedy and I still have this fucking weird mind. You know, that's tuned in for physical plan to hand combat. You're still in blood. Sport is so stupid. When I look back and think about what I have done that now, there's no fucking way. I'm not going to fight somebody for free and dedicate my whole life to doing this, traveling around the country and kicking people in the head like that's what I'm gonna do it and they're going to kick me travel now.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       Nobody covers shit. You had to pay for your own travel everywhere. He had to pay for your own hotel room. We sleep like a bunch of people in a hotel room. Like one of us would sleep on the floor. One guy was sleeping, one bed, one guy was sleeping in another bed, one guy would sleep in that tub. We just slept a bunch of guys in rooms. Everyone who was broke and we're all fighting full contact with no fucking no protection. I mean you, you, you have like this little chest protector on your body. But the really scary thing, the really scary thing is your feet. It's not, it's not punches and it's kicking someone in the head. It's a scary shit. So after awhile, what part of your foot do you use? So it hurts, the less the least. Who has you just get used to kick your head is going to hurt a lot more than my foot is.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       You know, it, it will hurt. Like I've broken my foot on people's Shins and a broken my foot on elbows. But you're, you're, it's like between like kicking someone in the head. It doesn't really hurt your foot. And I go out, Family Guy Miller had gone somewhere and it would be over if you'd catch them with the toes. You see that a lot in fights. Like it's more of a slap. But if somebody like solidly kicks you in the head, man, God, if you do it right, almost everybody goes out. It's like scary things. I watched those bus route videos where he just, I dunno like watching that guy like he was so everybody was so afraid of

Speaker 5:          00:20:33       of that liver shot. Oh yeah. Richard Pryor victim a minute. But where he talked about how he came out with his hands high in the guy. Right, right. In the next round he comes out, he's going to say elbows down by his waist and then they're doing this like, I don't know. I watch his videos and it's like this amazing like information

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       and then just completely Hillel like the guys is Great. We had one, the podcast I saw that you had that you haven't listened to a yard. That guy is fucking a killing machine and he's absolutely hilarious. Did you see that one where he goes, he walks in. If you see somebody fucking your wife, I give him the gun and then I take out the nine. It's just a hilarious, he's crazy. He's the fighting days and he did. He did the bare knuckle Pancrase days where you weren't allowed to punch to the face, but you're allowed to punch the body and you can open palm slap each other in the face. Just so much more humiliating. Yeah. Yes. Well he knock guys out like that and he's such a savage. He figured out if you just pull your hand way back and throw it like a punch and they use the palm of your, your fist instead of like slapping them in, hitting him with the hand, which is kind of flexible.

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       It gives into the shot of you hit him with the palm. It's like it's a bone, it's a, and it's a bone that you really don't have to worry about breaking unlike your hands. How can you punch someone in the face? Bare knuckle. You really have to worry about breaking your hands. Yeah, he's, people don't realize that. Like a lot of [inaudible] not stab, Smash Bang, Bang, goodbye thing. And you know what's funny is that sound effect is so funny, but you're watching him. His form is perfect. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's got some fucking great stories about brawls too. You know, he managed, imagine picking a fight with that fucking guy. What? I want a giant dantic mistake. Apparently there was some football player that got mouthy with them. Boss accidentally stepped on the guy's foot and the guy goes, you know, he's a little animated and get a little crazy and other guy didn't know until afterwards.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       But you know, boss gets a little animated and he's at a bar, I guess he was just really loud and he's fun guy, you know, and you just tell them some story or somebody stepped on this guy's foot and the guy got just really do shit with him. And he goes, I'm sorry, I apologize. My fault. Let me buy you a drink and the guy has no fuck you and fuck your drink. And you're like, got in his face. And he said, you want to take this outside of class room and goes, sure, okay, let's take it outside. And then his friends come up to him and goes, dude, you know what the fuck you're doing. Okay. You know, he's just some, we just a big dude and thought I'm going to go outside and fuck up this bald guy. He's got a giant mistake.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       Yeah. But this guy is way bigger this because of football and football players. Man, I was in Phoenix once, I was in tamping, it was going to the Improv and some fucking kid was there. Who's a one of the uh, Arizona state guys who's playing what professional football now. He was so big, right? Like you don't realize like how big that kind of big is that Bas Rutten is like 215 pounds. That's like, that's nothing compared to these guys in a bar in Utah. And there was a guy who used to play quarterback for like Oregon or Oregon state and I was just looking at a guy going, that's a, that's a quarterback. That's cause they looked like rag dolls when they get hit on TV. This guy was, he was like six, five, like two 40 yeah. And he was still in shape and it's like that guy, you know, if a linebacker comes from behind, he doesn't seem as head snaps back and he's on the ground like all woozy. Are you a football fan? Yeah. Football. Hockey to you. When you see guys like collide, when you see like a really bad hit, you know, does it, does it fucking freak out when you see that? When you see like a guy go out? Not really in foot. It's hockey. Hockey is because

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       hockey players, I don't know that they're as big as football players, but they're going like 15, 20 miles an hour. I don't know that you can obviously go faster on skates, but just sometimes like when guys, uh, you know, the head shots sometimes in hockey, if you just watch a guy, you know, I've seen a couple of guys that their careers got ended. Somebody's phone is somebody buzzing some mung? I don't even have a phone on me. That's boss calling in the show. Joe Rogan. It's bus route then. Yeah. Uh, your comb is here too, somewhere. Joe. Does he still have his comb? Uh, laying around here, I probably got 80 emails about that comb. Uh, we were going to auction it off. Oh there it goes. A couple of Buddhas I was telling, I was telling, I'm sure this is still nice and clean. Um, it is, he has a blue stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:24:35       He keeps your use the Tacoma ball hairs special. No, I played drums and a lot of times I'll play right before I go out. So it would like the headphones on. I get like this weird like it's, it's not even a hat head, it's a head headphone head and it comes down here on the side so it just, you know, push my hair up and go like that. So I saw him would go to what do you, what do you like fucking John Travolta and racist and all the things that we always wondered who still buys combs. My dad still carries around a comb and I always tried to like try it up. Like there's something to it if my dad uses it. So like I always try to do it but it does nothing for me. No, you have to, you have to be like over like I dunno, 60 I think at this point.

Speaker 3:          00:25:14       I think that because you've got to realize like a lot of them, like one of the guys like Ted nutrients and under, they're in their sixties now, so it's William Shatner just turned 80 yeah, the fuck man. That real freaks me out when someone, you know what I say so many things in the podcasts that people tell me. What about you can't be real. No, no, no. He's like 70 he was, he was like 35 when he did it. How do you spell his name? William Wallace. A. H. A. T. N. E. R, maybe not an s. H Shatner. Yeah, Shah. S. H. A. T in the year maybe. Okay. What's truly exposing? How stupid we are not done. You can beat people and still be successful in Showbiz. Yeah. It's amazing. You could be so stupid and yet still make it. I remember an agent one time telling me he gets, you've got some comedian, some huge gigs, some huge big money playing gay cause this guy was kind of, no, it's true.

Speaker 3:          00:26:05       He was born in 1931 that is fucking crazy. It's crazy. What makes sense? Because the star trek was in the 60s so he was thirties thirties. Well he was kind of sucking in his gut with that little tidy 30 seconds, go a little bit. And then they were, they were walking a wig with him back then. I don't know. He still had his hair. Wow. That's so weird. Ah, I don't know. Yeah, it was like, it was just going. But he's got parents. Fuck right plugs though. Cause you could never really look like you don't thinks that's not plugs. Oh, what did he get? Oh, it's a toupee. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a set. Pay as a wig. Whatever. He's cool as fuck. I let them get away with it. Those old guys, like you ever see like Humphrey bogarts

Speaker 4:          00:26:43       wig than he used to wear back in the day. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Pretty obvious one. Yeah. I'm free. Bogart was going bald as he was a movie star. They got him a fucking wig.

Speaker 5:          00:26:52       Frankly. Jesus Christ, you know. So I have watched a bunch of his movies, man. Honestly, bro Grind. I saw a lot of Frank Sinatra and I know frank liked him. Frank took a lot of his swagger from that guy nearly. Yeah. Yeah. If you watch those movies. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a couple man, he's got one. I can't, I'm so bad at remembering the names of movies. He's got one where he calls this girl out on some female shit that like, you know, I saw it. I was like, that shit happened to me last week. Just totally calls her out when she tried to change the subject about something and it was, it was just, it was awesome. Say That's not what we were talking about. Naw, he, but he wasn't back. This story he had that he didn't know that was, what was it like Edward G. Robinson? Shitty accent. So w w was it like hit no, his, he had just more, I can't do an impression of the guy, but he had just more of a laid back. He just would, she just would be sitting in a scene looking at you and you just immediately felt like, oh shit.

Speaker 4:          00:27:46       Movies where the guy would get mad, he would fucking smack the check. Yeah, that's what they used to do. I think they did it on Archie bunker, didn't they? They would never consider it watch. She didn't, Archie hit Eden's. She got really mad at him I think so she was really upset. I remember that Shit. I just sort of vaguely remembers you. We're not making this up. I think I remember that too. I think there was so long ago that's, that's tricky. Wanted it to happen. You know you're home. Every cell in your body except your neurons gets replaced every seven years. So your memory, where the fuck is you memory stored? Is it in your brain? Is it in your neurons? Is it nonlocal? Nobody really knows. So when you look back on a memory that you had from like 20 years ago, who knows what the fuck, whether you've made that up on the story of a memory that you use to remember and he created something new.

Speaker 5:          00:28:36       You know who lived in, no, I know what you're saying because I've listened to guys tell stories about stuff where I was there. And I was just like, I don't remember it like it. Yeah. Well people were, remember the guy in the sale, people, you know, we want our living room. Are you talking about no brow. We just won the lottery. You don't remember

Speaker 4:          00:28:56       just came back from a banding on a Ustream. Um, I was banned yesterday for throw. Showing a phone. Showing a thong. Yeah. What? Yeah, this girl, uh, we had on peaches and we also had the holidays of all, what, what'd you say her name was peaches. I know one peaches. That it was her real name. She was a wardrobe person on a fear factor. Very nice lady. Right. That was a real name. What's this girl's real names? This girl Sarah Peaches. And the reason we were asking why she was called peaches cause there, but it looks like a peach. And so we're like, oh, we got to see this button now. So she pulled down her pants and she had a thong on. Uh, and uh, I guess people complained and they just banned my whole account. But, but I thought they, the Ustream just hooked you up and just said that you were going to get oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But that doesn't, there's that there's

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       a difference between, uh, like, you know, standards and practices. Exactly. So did you contact the guy contacted him, they pulled the video and then put me back up and they're just saying that, you know, nowadays it's kind of like a network TV. They have sponsors, you know, you can't, you can't have certain things. But that's what I thought I was like, thongs though are like you can go on the beach with a Thong, right? Yeah. I mean, what two? You like country music, right? And that work, I'm sure. Like you couldn't show a thong on that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So the broadcast network, so I guess, you know, it's all new technology. It's all new shit. So kind of had to find the Bordeaux, we talk about, well we talk about it as a fucking thousand times more light. Absolutely. All a thong. That's it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       Really. Yeah. So fucking weird. Like what you were saying about that, the, you know, the situation that happened when you were doing that show and you know, people get offended. And what was the, was the one, what was the story that was in the news while you're doing the show? Don Imus with Donna. I'm a store. Would you call the girls nappy headed hoes? When I was doing the man show, it was um, Janet Jackson's nipple. Janet Jackson's nipple in the Superbowl came out right while we were doing the man show. And I thought, Oh, what the fuck? It's nothing. You know, what is this stupid stunt, you know, but Dee, who cares really? I mean to me it was, it was a nonissue, but it became this fucking huge thing in show business where you could, I mean they came in and changed monologues. They came in and cut out scenes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       They cut out, cut out sketches. They were like, no more, we can't, we can't do this. We're going to have to take this way back. Could be on the phone call when it comes from whatever group or Washington DC. When they say that I, I think it's, it's, it's because that they actually take it seriously. Yeah. It's just so disappointing though. When you see all these fucking people scrambled because some chick pulled out her nipple and the crazy thing was the news, the big thing, and the paper said that it was during the dinner hour. That's what it said. I totally blocked it. People will write to be amended. It was on network television. All right. It was the super bowl. You got your kids watching. I understood. What could I have kids are you raising that are going to be freaking out about a chicks nipple?

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       Siri, yeah. Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, and when you still want your kids to have a child that, that's what I think about Nipples, a smelling months. That's a little bit bit of excitement in their childhood. It's not like fucking Janet Jackson and starts stroking the nipple and, and fingering or I'll tell you what, man is whip out a black tent in front of my kids. They're going to start laughing at you. I don't think it's funny. Well listen. Okay, because people out there, they have how they want to raise their kids. So it's like they don't have cable, so keep all the smite on cable and I should be able to be here. So that thing crossed in, I would, you know what I compared it to, it was like a orange juice and brushing your teeth individually, they were fine, but you bring them together.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       It's back. There's nothing wrong with seeing an iconic good point, iconic titty. But you had it on network TV and that was, that was the problem. So that's an interesting way to look at it. Yeah. I think we're way too hung up about sex though. I think that's a nonissue. I really do. It's not like they were fucking on TV. If they, if she pulled out her pussy and fingered herself in front of the camera and go, yeah, you just went too far. Now you're all sexual. It's a football game. Yeah. Yeah. But they're doing some sexual performance network television. We watch dancing with the stars. They're fucking on the stage. I mean the, the lumbar on each other and when the woman will straddle the guy's cock, what's going on there? But you're, you're imitating some songs for sexuality. Yeah. But this is the thing, you know that okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:11       Football, the kid doesn't know that. Know what I'm saying is as a parent, if you've decided to watch dancing with the stars, if you're going to watch a football game, you're not expecting to see a titty. So you just expect to see dudes that weigh 300 pounds of jacked up with Anna and human growth hormone running at each other and smashing into each other. Yeah. And somehow or another, a tit is scarier than that. I'm not saying I have a problem with it. I'm saying, look, you have to understand I'm not either, I'm just does a fake argument, bro. I'm just try to keep this going. All right. People are fucking roll with it. Like you just fucking like, just like you got to respect that other people don't aren't, you know, I told, I told her, I go, look, I want my kid to have like, dude, you know, even if it was like one second, I don't even know what a pussy looked like until I was like, what?

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       Like 12 should I grew up with me, you know, I want to show you, we're talking about one second by the way, I'm just saying I was allowed to have a fucking childhood and be innocent for a little bit. But like now it's just like the shit that you can get away with on like network TV now because of cable is fucking, I remember like the, when the Benny Hill show came out, people are freaking out. He was doing, he was walking up behind girls acids pretending he was warming his hands and you'd had that silly and Wayne Antica Dante's walking in fast motion and they were freaking out. And I sat there as like a fucking like seven year old turned on by it because the that was like to bait was the Benny Hill show back then. And I think that like, seriously, I don't think that it's that, I think kids do see way too much.

Speaker 3:          00:34:41       I don't think that you should be embarrassed about bodies and stuff like that. But I mean, dude, you want to understand they can go into your laptop and like we didn't, we couldn't, you couldn't see any light. I got porno when we were coming up here to have to have a fucking night at work, a reel to reel, and then it became VCR and then you'd have to find your parents stash. Now you can just go on the damn laptop. I really sound like some, right? No, but you're right, you're right. I'm just everything that they're going to raise their kids the way they want to raise him. So if you chose not to have cable and you want to stay away from that shit, then it's fine. I see what you're saying. But the way I look at it as everything accelerates and including access to things, access to information, access to even bad things.

Speaker 3:          00:35:18       And you know, the, the kids are gonna have to deal with an ever changing world. And if you went from where you were when you were 12 to how you see the world now, it'd be a pretty big fucking shock, you know? And I think for kids, it's like they're, they're going to get it way earlier than did, but that's just the nature of the world today. It's kind of fight against that. I don't think it's kind of like how the started off as such slow speeds. They get 56 k modem for top four and he used to be like, Hey, what's this photo? Oh Hey, oh, that's a horse's stick. Oh my God, what's going on in that person's ass? You know, you kind of were diluted to the Internet because you did this slowly as it was a slow process of all this disgusting Shit route on the Internet where people watch that type of shit or they watch like, uh, beheadings oh no, no.

Speaker 3:          00:35:59       I mean I'm talking about sending you things or you're not going to do really fucked up. There's a lot of people who aren't on the vice squad but have like that level of mental damage in there like an accountant because they go on and watch somebody get their head sought off. Like I remember that video and like comics come in and go on yet. Dude, I shouldn't have watched say like you saw like I've got a bit my echo. I talk about you Sol. I view it like it's pixelated and every time you see something that you shouldn't have seen, like a couple of cubes float away and you get just never the same person. So I, I think, I don't know, I'm trying, I'm trying to like watching porn is though. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I tried to do that when I started having kids, but stop watching porn.

Speaker 3:          00:36:37       You started thinking about those kids, you know, stars and you've got the Watson anymore. It's like a tipping point. There's a tipping point with this shit where it's kind of like, all right, this is healthy. You're exploring what you're into and then you just go down a rabbit hole, you closes behind you and uh, easily you can easily go down. How many guys do we know that have been addicted to masturbating when they talk about live masturbate in three times a day, every day. Even if they're not hard, you know, they just keep going. See what I mean? [inaudible] get a guy a lot of free times. Shag rug here. You give guys enough free time there. They're going to drug off just the fact totally. They do it in prison. Even though people know people are watching. They don't care who's guys in solitary confinement there.

Speaker 3:          00:37:17       Naked beaten off with a camera on him. Just do it on that, on that podcast with that chick with the Sarah Peaches. Uh, the guy that came with her was the Hollywood sex, uh, like anyone that has a sex tape, they go to him to sell it and stuff. He did a Paris Hilton's and he was talking about how no, she was behind that. She made about $7 million from that shit. And like, like he just fucking broke through. Like all these people like that have come up to him like, he's like, yeah, I have a Lindsay Lohan one, but it's from the back, so I can't verify if it's herb. It's supposedly, it really is her giving a blow job. And how crazy is it that these people figured out a way to make money and get famous off of porn? Yeah, I was in dash was in, yeah, I was in Australia and there was a fucking giant Kim Kardashian poster and all I can think of that girl got famous for fucking a guy on film.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       I mean, she's a porno star, you know, I mean fucking the film that they used to ruin your career now makes something out of nothing. I'm going, I should really shouldn't throw a name out here by it. Was it Jane Kennedy? You guys don't watch sports. There was this girl back in the day. She was on the NFL on CBS and uh, her ex boyfriend sent out a tape, a sex tape after they broke up a, of her getting fisted, I believe. Oh my goodness. The general public didn't see it because there was no youtube, none of that. It just went around the industry. That was the end of her career.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       Wow. Yeah. You can't get fisted. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:38:38       And now nowadays, yeah. Like that would actually, you know, you know that that would be part of like your, your imdv page, you know, if they will try and see how much money she get paid for a pilot. Well he's done already two pilots. He's done a Letterman, you know, we uh, Bang this girl and fucking came on her face so you know, his dick is out there. Definitely has some sort of cue ration, you know, ratio, whatever the fuck you say. Well she has two fists things online. Actually, wait a minute, why am I saying I've got a guy can't get away with that shit. Like think like females can make like a sex tape.

Speaker 4:          00:39:08       Certain ones can have it sex tapes before and I'm going to Tom Sizemore and one or the Tom Sizemore one, but he didn't blow up after that. That was part of that. We're still awesome. It's still awesome. Oh yeah. Yeah. I know what he said, that he has a tape right now with usher that he's like getting sued for something like that and he's getting pegged in it. And I didn't know what pegged means, but uh, whoa. Wait a minute. Ushers Gay. Wait a minute. You don't like peg means, I don't know, zooming in the, but it's, it's where a girl wears a Dildo and fucks you in the ass. Why listen to the podcasts. It's crazy. Uh, it's not as show number 12. I going to get sued. Yeah. Yeah. You can't say he said, I didn't say it. All right on. I will say allegedly, but that's what he said.

Speaker 4:          00:39:56       Funny. That is so common that guys like girls fuck them would strap ons. They have a nickname for it pegged and everybody's like, oh yeah, hey does that before? Oh yeah. Oh, I'm well aware of what that entails. What a fucking crazy business. It was a, this, this guy that I know, his buddy was dating a porn star and he was dealing with it for awhile because he was kind of a loser. He didn't have a job and you know, didn't really have much going on. She would like pay for dinner and stuff like that. And you know, he just said, ah, it's just work for her. It's work for her. She just work. One day he comes home and she's going over her contract for our next thing and uh, and he goes, what is air tight mean? That's like one of the descriptions of scenes.

Speaker 4:          00:40:38       It means a dick and every hole. And she goes, one of my mouth, what am I? But when I post it, I'm out. He goes, that's it. I'm out. He got up. That was the end of the relationship. He packed up his shit and he moved out. Fucking them. Done what? Air Tight. Like this bitch wasn't just doing porn, you know, he tried to distance himself and not watch any of it. You know, it just kind of a liberal fellow and I'm trying to create this man air tight. I like this, but it was just, it's so common that girls know what it means when it's in the, in your contract, you have to do one air tight. You know, one cream pie,

Speaker 5:          00:41:10       they'll think it's funny that they still have to come up with these euphemisms because even with them they try and make it so you know, we're gonna, you know, start off with the standard or do you know Blah Blah Blah and we'll build to an airtight and do a facial sounds like a spa. Well some of them,

Speaker 4:          00:41:26       some of them are so common that it's actually with the search terms, like cream pie cream pie is you shoot a load inside a girl and then she kind of squirts

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       it out like a, like a cream pie. I'm familiar with the porn. Yeah, but I mean what the fuck man? Yeah, everyone, it's so common that it's a category. Like if you go to like youporn or something like that, that's one of the categories is cream pies, shooting loads and girls like hello diseases here have a disease in your butt.

Speaker 5:          00:41:50       But that's, that's what I, I don't get that in there, but I don't get like a, I know they get tested all the time. What does that mean? Those guys are fucking heroin junkies every night. You know, who knows what they're doing. You take, they get tested like every three months, you know, like that doesn't mean anything. That's crazy. I don't know. I don't know how good it is now, but I remember back in the day, man, when they way of scaring the shit out of every straight guy out there that you're gonna get aids. Yeah. They said that uh, the fuck doesn't mean the safest way. Oh yeah. Do you remember that? Like back in the day you get, when did, what year did you take an aids test? When I took one was 96 or seven and I remember I had to, you had to wait like five, six days.

Speaker 5:          00:42:28       It's one thing walking about walking around worrying because they had everybody worried that they had it. So worrying that you had, it was something that you give out, you know, but knowing that you are going to find out in fact, actually one way or the other in five days. But fortunately I had a really cool doctor. I was sitting there in the waiting room just like just rocking back and forth on why did I bang that shit? Jesus Christ so fucking weak. Why did I give it to her? Right. And he came walking up and he was really cool. He said, Mr. Byrd combined. He said, come on back. And he goes, don't worry, you're all set. Like he said it in the waiting room. He didn't, he didn't let me take that long walk, like the next Douche bag. Like I, I would like I, the only time I would get tested would be like if I was getting into a relationship and basically the girl said, we need to go out and get tested for everything. And I was like, yeah, let's be responsible.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       Well, and I was like, fuck the guy taking my test. I took, I had to get insurance when I first moved to New York because it was like 90 91 that's why I took my first test and the guy who was testing me, he said, have you ever had gay sex? No. Have you ever shared a needle? No. He goes, you don't have nothing to worry about. I'm like, really? Really goes, you got nothing to worry about it. He goes, trust me, you're going to be okay. And I'm like, this guy's just being nice to me. Manage just being nice. And you just think about all those girls. I should've wore a condom with the fuck was I thinking and what does that mean? I should have wore a condom if you knew she had aids or would you stick your dick inside of her with a little tiny thin little membrane protecting you from the depths of hell?

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       No, you wouldn't. You know, it's fucking craziness. But uh, I, I went and the guy did the same thing. He called me up and he gave me the results over the phone. And as he called me up, he goes, Joe, you're all set. You're all set. I just want to relax. Nope, totally negative. No problem. Yeah. But for fucking days are shitting my pants. Convinced, convinced I added like a red shirt. Virgin. What do you get to think about that and how much knowledge that we have, what we really know the average person knows about medical science and think about what it must've been like when medical science didn't exist and you thought you really were cursed. You know the shit probably worked. You know you could probably car someone with witchcraft and they probably would fucking trip every way they go and fall and land on their fucking face and break their neck

Speaker 5:          00:44:28       and I dodged. That happens. That's like when say bad things come in threes. It's no, you keep restarting counting after three. That's what happens when people go off this, do this, and then this is like, yes, that makes four. If you count back to the beginning of your life, you now is it divisible by three? It's like it's life. Bad Shit happens. Good Cycle. Whenever his celebrity dies, they would say, you know, dead straight. They're all comes from,

Speaker 4:          00:44:53       this is a thing though. Even jokes when you described jokes, they'd come in through the best way to tell a joke. I have. Yeah. I usually have three, three examples that are ridiculous. I know that's true. I'm just talking about the bad she'll, why is that though that things in three celebrities dies in celebrities dying in three they don't. People recount after three if they went one right there. We're talking about a small period in time. It's not like time is open ended. They're talking about over a course of all your couple of weeks, three very famous people will die and it happens all the time. It really does.

Speaker 5:          00:45:23       It really doesn't know that people just stopped counting at three and then I just start over again. I could say let somebody would die like two days later and it doesn't count. It all dies like a month later. Then they go, okay, that's one. You wait and you wait. It's like, yeah, I guess

Speaker 4:          00:45:40       celebrities probably don't count because fucking there's a billion people over there. They must be dropping off every day. Yeah, there's, I'm sure there's famous country singers to you. That would have been like the biggest star ever. Where other who me, I don't even know who that guy is. Wrap your fucking head around the fact that China has more than three times the people that America has. Yeah. More than three times. What's up? People shitting on the side of the road. I said to on the podcast that they will self sustainable that they uh, but apparently they're not anymore. Apparently now they're, they're important grain people got upset at me so no, I guess they'd not, but you know what I want to hear about pouring rain. I always wonder like how am I wonder if that's, I wonder if they're forced to do that one. If they're forced to buy like American grain and we sell them grain and you know,

Speaker 5:          00:46:20       well if you want to read a great article is the one in rolling stone this month that has Howard stern on the cover is they talk about these two basically potheads who became these international arms dealers and just how that whole thing goes down. How boundaries when they want to arm a certain side and some smaller country, but they don't want the shit coming back to them. How they go about it, how they go through these people. There's to some website, uh, uh, Christ, what the hell is it? I can't remember, but it's like the military is required to put all their contracts on it so you can read all their contracts. This is typical, may something interesting and I can't tell you where to go to and you can read all their contracts and they're open to any bitter. I think during the Bush administration they made it like that, you know, so I dunno, free enterprise. I don't know why, but it kind of seemed like it was a way for them to then arm certain people without it coming back. It's like we basically have another people do your dirty work, but just the way, well that's what the hard

Speaker 4:          00:47:14       idea about mercenaries is. I mean that's what the big complaint about what, you know, blackwater and those types of groups is that we use them overseas and it's basically a way to get away with doing like really dirty.

Speaker 5:          00:47:25       Oh yeah, totally thing. I mean, this is the, how I look at it. Everybody does it and I don't know what their end game. Right. But she's been doing it. I mean [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:47:35       if we are what we pretend we are, then we should be the ones who stand up and say that this is, well, this is what you can't do. You can't torture prisoners. You can't, you can't. Absolutely.

Speaker 5:          00:47:45       Do you think we can do that in a country that uh, actually sticks by what we say we are? Because everybody

Speaker 4:          00:47:51       seems that someone has to lead an example, right? We do. We say the world's filled with line con, so we're going to be lying. Cons, I don't know. I mean, I see what you're saying. I see the other argument that like, look, the world's a dirty place and you're going to have people that are willing to do your bidding. No. You know, like,

Speaker 5:          00:48:04       yeah, no, I'm going to ask. Yeah. I don't get how war is legal and I don't get how like Jesus freaks and really religious people get behind war. They've been doing it for like the acquisitions and the, and the Crusades. They were taking murderers out of prison going, you are forgiven and then unleashing them and like the Middle East to do what you, the reason why you stuck it behind bars but they just don't want it for them.

Speaker 4:          00:48:28       Church, did they really? Yeah. When? What year was this? That's just some fucking website. I've read it off for three minutes. One of the reasons why I wanted to have presented as fact, I mean I always loved my son talking to you, but I know that you're one of those guys that doesn't believe anything in the news is what it is and these motherfuckers, so that's why I wanted to talk to you about all this shit that's going on in the Middle East. It's like every fucking day some new government is being overthrown. It's, it's getting really weird to the point where I'm like, man, they both like fucking prepping for something. Like what is going down? Why? How's that? Is it really what everybody says it is that all the sudden with the Internet, people are becoming aware and they're all rising up. It takes more than just being aware to get people to risk their fucking lives and get, I mean, in Libya, this is motherfuckers flying jets and launching missiles in the crowds and shit. He's killing people. They're shooting right into crowd. Might not be with jets, but I might've made that up, but I know they're shooting into crowns and killing people left and right and like these people that are fighting against him.

Speaker 5:          00:49:26       Yeah. There's a movement that's going on. I don't know what it is, but it was, you know, no, the real fear. There's guys out there who we put in power and we were cool with and then when they stopped being cool with us, then we go in and we try to take them off. I'll tell you, you know what's really fucked up where those celebrities who went out and they did like a corporate gig for like Kadafi these kids. Yeah. They try to act like, oh, I didn't know. It's like, dude, if you work at a comedy club and there's somebody like in a wheelchair, the club owner comes back, hey, not telling you how to do your act. Just to let you know that someone in the crowd, the wheelchair. So I mean, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:49:58       Is she aware of that show that you close with? You might want to not use it.

Speaker 5:          00:50:02       So these people are going to perform for the kids. Have a mass murderer. Don't you think they get some sort of halftime speeds? Listen, don't say this. You don't want offend their cult. Just letting them know, like I had no idea. I was really disappointed when I saw it are formed for Gaddafi. Uh, what was it? A Beyonce usher, Mariah Carey. And then they all just sit. Then they all donated it to charity, but only cause they got busted Kadafi pegs. That's what I heard.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       Gadhafi pays a peg eggs. Are you just making shit up? Oh, they're asking people if they should, uh, give their, uh, their money back. Apparently there's a lot. Yeah, be onsite. Did it? Huh?

Speaker 5:          00:50:39       Yeah. And I saw this photo and it's like, dude, it's hilarious. It's like you got somebody who can sell out the fucking staple center. It's like, why you do, you really got to go there and entertain. That's scumbag cause it just so much money. Like what do they all, they pay for like a million million bucks for like a night and you come. There was funny. Was that one of the pictures I saw now, I don't know if this was actually her at the Gig, but dude, it's like she's standing out in your living room going full out doing fucking routines. Be Awesome for the kid of a murder of, of a mass murder. The guy who admittedly is buying those pan-am bombings. Right. Wow. My crazy thinking that that killed Americans and that kid has a musical. Yeah, no, he is the [inaudible] rig on it. Dancing like literally dancing dance for me. Let's go. And that kid is my backup. Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       Oh sure. Apparently performed for him to the bow. He gave a Beyonce $2 million for her private performance. Whoa. That's pretty crazy. His youngest son Hannibal. That's his fucking son. After the silence of the lambs, if you name your kid Hannibal, you're a sick fuck. Yeah, and it wasn't even a nickname. He knew coming out of the woods yet his kid was going to be a sick. Fuck you. So nothing is scarier than the sons of dictators. You ever hear about what is the Udi and Qusay or whatever the fuck Saddam's kids wrote all the shit they did. They fed women to dogs. They did. They did horrible. Should they do, they were fine women. One of the things we would do is find a woman as she was getting married, they would find her like as like you literally go into the wedding, kill the husband in front of everybody. I take the wife raper and killer and feeder the dogs is, they used to grind people up in meat grinders. Like some of those stores are just horrific. I mean they grew up with Ryan and Mikko. What's what sort of, how big was the MC when they're alive? I don't know who. Who Will? Ha Ha. Well, you can easily stick someone in the wood chipper if you want it to. Oh yeah, no, I understand that. That would be easy. Guys fall into woodchippers all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:52:32       I saw, I saw a guy get busted. They figured out that he did it and then they just went out on his property and he just had like, you know, basically human bone shrapnel. Oh, I love this part of the Oliver, the part of the woods. Dude, I was on a key recently and this guy, you know, who is, uh, allegedly a federal agent, but if by the end of it, I didn't even believe, and he was telling me all these horrific stories and I'm sitting there looking at the guy, first of all, when he walked in on of the first things he did was he picked his nose and I'm like, and I had already shook his hand, like a fucking segway who doesn't pick their nose? Then he adjusts his Dick and at one point he's in the middle of telling me about being on a stakeout.

Speaker 5:          00:53:08       He starts digging in his ass to the point. It's like almost on his tip toes. He's like fucking dude. And he's like, and you could tell he was like habitually picking his ass because he's in the middle of talking to me. He just met me and he said, yeah, you know, so standing out there and we have fucking sounds going like this. I'm looking at and he's going, yeah, I'm a federal agent. It's like, Dude, you're picking your ass. And also why you telling me all this shit? It's Kinda like the guys who go to war and they actually see some shit, never talk about it. And then the guy who's fucking working in the kitchen, oh yeah, man, shit was crazy. I shot this guy in the fucking head. That's after awhile. I was like, I think this guy is like this.

Speaker 4:          00:53:43       Did you see these new photos that came out from Afghanistan? They're basically just like the, um, the, what was the fucking, the prison was the prison where a Guantanamo? No, no, no. Well the one where they took all those photos of all the Iraqi's and did all that fucked up shit in the soldiers did. I can't remember too long ago. Brian, do you remember? No. You don't know what it is. You don't even know what the story is anyway. These, um, there's new photos to just surfaced and they're, uh, they're just like those photos. What the fuck was the name of the, uh, yeah, but is that shocking you, you really don't want to get captured by the enemy? No. Yeah, it's pretty fucked up. The Oem, they won't be there smiling like holding people up by the hair and like look, Aba grave. Thank you. Bobby Walton 42. Mr. Alex Walton. You've, you got it for me bunny. They Aba grape, you know, and they, uh, they were doing the same sort of shit and one of them was a fence. Family friends with Sarah Pailin for like 20 years. It's fucking holding up this guy by his hair. Bullet holes in them and shit. I'll have to, he's dead. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       The definition. I gotta admit, if I was over there, I'd be doing that shit with you. How many people can you shoot in the head before you don't get a little twisted? You've got to find the comedy in it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:51       Well, the crazy thing is I was fucking poor. Kids are coming back, you know, and you meet him, you know. [inaudible] they kind of cocked a squelch that, by the way. But yeah. Well at one point in time, more people had died in one month in suicides than had died in combat. I mean, it's, it's scary shit. You know the number, the ratio for the month. I, yeah, I mean, you're not supposed to kill another human pig if it goes against the, uh, I don't know. Especially somebody you don't even know, you know. All right. It's okay if you know him. No, I mean, pinup killing someone for, you know, you just get told this is a bad person. Go over there and kill them and you're over there going, what the fuck? I flew to their neighborhood, I landed and I snuck into their backyard and I shot them in the fucking head.

Speaker 5:          00:55:40       Yeah. If I think if I ever went to war, I would be the guy crying in the foxhole during battle. But if I could somehow muster up the balls to kill somebody after I did that one, it would be like a fucking water slide. I mentally would just get used to it. Now that and know, it's like I just know how my brain works. It's why, you know I had, I had some buddies of mine who will, who have, you know, go down to Brazil and banging those girls and doing that. And it's just like, and I never went and they, you know, wow. Why don't you go? It's like, cause I'll go down there, I'll come back, but mentally you'll be fucked, dude. I can't go to a land where I can go. Yeah, well you can go fuck a bunch of j Lo's for like eight bucks. Come back here and think that I can function in society. That's what those x patch and we need to sit down and talk about

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       this. Lately I'd be like, shut up. Fuck j Lo for $8 you can get on a plane. It's six hours. I can, I can as many as I wanted. I know that you can bring her back here. You could go stealer, bring her back here. Yeah. I mean it's evil. If you are willing to deal with something. I don't want to fly to the third world and fuck the children of some of the poorest people on the planet for like DVD money after my shows. It's just something, you know, not to say I'm not a twisted fuck. I think it's cause I know how twisted I am. I try to like stay away from that shit. I'm the same way. I think there's a certain, well I think everybody's a comic cause a little bit of a side girl, you know, just to the act of going on stage, demanding that kind of attention.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       Lit Microphone, voice, the whole deal. I woke up the other day, I had an argument with a girl I went out with 15 years ago about what about, I asked you, it's a long fucking store. Just some bullshit. She did something stupid. She did something stupid. All right. And I wanted to be like, I was trying and she fucked up in her life and she fucked up so bad. I was actually scared going, how am I going to pick her up off the mat because I know if I did some shit like that, I'll be thinking about kill me. She fucked up. So I'm trying to build her up and the whole time of more specific emotions now, she just goes, I know. I know. She kept gone. I know, I know. I just maybe being so fucking people like, you know what? You don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:57:48       You're a fucking moron, but you did you arrogant pig headed it just, it just, she have a nice house. Yeah. So I woke up and that's what I was, my eyes weren't even what weren't even open. I was laying in a, in a fucking hotel yelling at it with my eyes closed and then sort of knowing in my head how fucked up that is. How long ago was this argument that you had with her? Like I said, it was like 15 years or so by yourself. You're in a hotel room, you wake up, your eyes aren't even open and you go like, you fucking dummy. I told you. Yeah, that's crazy. You need. I bet. I bet. Been need a cat scan home. I've been to one, I got one. Uh, whenever I do Letterman, I always have a nightmare than I that I, that I bombed. But I've been through enough times and I always do well, so I know I'm fine. I thought you were going to say, whenever I do Letterman, I always get a cat scan. No, no, no. So last time I did it, I was having those thoughts. They woke me up in the middle of the night and I actually started talking to the voices. I just said, oh, shut the fuck up. It's going to be fine. And I went back to sleep.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       Well sometimes it's a good thing to do to actually have conversations with yourself, I think. I think you have to be aware that you're a psycho. That's, that's step one. And then just you, you know, you, if you're a psycho, you're a fight. You can't be cured of being a psycho. You just have, oh, that's not true. You evolve to put show on showtime where he only kills the bad people. Dexter Dexter. Yeah. It's like Dexter. No, you evolve, you evolve, you texters time. You recognize what you're doing wrong with your life. You understand what makes you feel shitty, what you feel good and you have

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       all that happened. That's for it for me. I'm joking. You don't want it anymore. So this shit is a deck. The coconut water, it's the shit, that little burst of energy and then you want some more. You're, you're all fired up. You look at fight one of your brothers right now. Fun, Fun, fun, fun, fun. Yeah. Have you heard this fucking song and I talked about it to you before we started. You haven't heard it. It's a song bed. So the by a 13 year old girl and they were talking about it on Opie and Anthony. I had already heard it, but I didn't know the story behind it. And uh, uh, opie and Anthony were saying that apparently this girl, 13 or dad has a lot of money and they produced a song for her and it's fucking Rudel this pork kid, first of all, there's like 34 million hits in Youtube. And when I watched it the other day, it was only a couple of days ago, there was only 24 million, so 10 million fucking hands in a couple of days just because it's awful. That's how awful it is. And can people's lives are awful. Yeah, but may want to see somebody fail. They do, but it's also the [inaudible]. I want to see it do. What the fuck is that thing? That's an iPad.

Before he let fame consumer many days and he did a special with fucking girls on the ends of dog leashes. Do his first specials. His first Letterman. Yes. Still holds up. Yes. Yes I am with you on matters. And I say it all the time. That is the test of how like people go talk about comics now. All this guy's this, this guy's at, you're not gonna know until 1520 years later and then you go back and you listen to this stuff. Does it hold up? You know Kinison and 86 was the best comment that ever lived. That's what I think the Kinison the came out. There was never a guy like him. There was never a guy who was

Speaker 8:          01:07:00       fuck [inaudible] he had his own thing and this rage and get in front of people. She this parachute, it's phase. This is marriage. Motherfucker just [inaudible]. There was nobody

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       [inaudible] what about, but he had the ability to, to reel it in and then unleash it like preacher. Yeah. Like a lot of guys who, I've been guilty, I've been on stage and you just feel like Jesus, I just screamed for an hour. That was bullshit. And I said, fuck too many times they hit, bought him. He had a, he had the ability, you know, when he would bring it down? Yeah. When he did that bit about like necrophilia and when he's laying, laying face down and he just goes, okay, all right, so I'm dead. You know, he's all the way down there and then, oh, what is that? You know how I found out about it? One of the greatest tags ever. It never ends. It never ends. One of the greatest excuse fucking in the ass, even after you're dead. It never ends. But he, he, he, he, but he, all of that was in just the line. It never ends. Yeah. It's just fine. I heard about that bit because I was working at the Boston Athletic Club. There was a girl who worked there and she just got home from seeing the Hbo Comedy Special With Sam Kennison and she reenacted that bit in the fucking parking lot of the club in South Boston. She got on her stomach

Speaker 8:          01:08:09       and she goes, so I'm dead. I'm going to be with Jesus. What is this? It feels there's a deck in my head. You mean live keeps fucking in the ass. You've been after your dad had never ran. Never had. Oh God.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       Yeah and I was like, that is the funny. I was 19 and I remember thinking that is the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life and then I got a copy of it. It was the first time I ever thought I got in common.

Speaker 5:          01:08:33       This is sort of throw off bit that he did. Why was this a CD after he had died, they did like this compilation. He did like the whole, that whole bit on Captain Kangaroo, which would normally be like a hacky bit, but he got into the psyche of the guy playing captain kangaroo. This was the w later CD, right? Yeah. This is like one of his last ones and he was one of the things with that. He decided not to put on and then he dies and then somebody else puts it out. It's one of those things, it's kind of not fair. Like a lot of the other material wasn't, you know, up to snuff. But he never released it. Don't when he was alive. So I don't, I don't criticize them for that, but the uh, the captain kangaroo bit through where he gets into the psyche of the guy talking about and he somehow he brings it all around to s he was an out of work actor. So he took the Gig and the, and the end of the bit, he's yelling at his wife

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       go and we data the cash, you know, I didn't know that Gig was gonna last 20 fucking years and just screaming, fucking haircut and just the, the, the, the, the horrific life of this guy.

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       Make somebody great. The ability, anybody can be like a cat. The cat group, let's up with this guy. Like he got out and eat the whole thing and just he turned the guy, you saw the actor that played them, which I grew up

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       watching him. And here's the most important thing, and this is where, I mean, again, I'm a huge bill Hicks Fan. I think what he did was brilliant and he changed the way I looked at a lot of things and he opened my eyes up to a lot of things that were fascinating and interesting but not necessarily funny. And I would scream and cheer with it and I would laugh along with it because I agreed with it. But you would see Kinison and he would make a point that would fucking have you doubled over with laughing. And it's totally different. Like there's a hicks bit that you can find online about Hicks talking about he wants his rock stars to have passion. It's another one of these things, you know, I want you to rock stars, to go onstage and to unite everybody to shoot yourself in the head and do heroin. All is all these different things. And he's screaming and yelling. I want him to have passion. But I'm looking at him like, but where's the jokes? Where's, where's the joke? Whereas you watch a Kinison sketch, especially the 86 Kennison like how about the fucking thing about sending money to the homeless, the poor kids in Africa. And he goes, he goes, don't send the money. Send them a guy like me send. My guy was going to go over there and go, hey,

Speaker 8:          01:10:38       we just drove 3000 miles with your food and it's realized, look, we wouldn't have to do this if you'll be able to live where they live in a fucking desert. Can you see that? See that this is not going to be a hundred years now. We got deserts in America too. We just don't live in a mass.

Speaker 1:          01:10:54       I know that word word fucking is the best. He was based,

Speaker 5:          01:11:02       he's the guy. He's the guy. My Mount Rushmore's guy would be prior Kinison. Uh, Carlin. Yeah, I need like one out of gangs is in there for me. Pixels in there for me. But Hicks

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       is in there in a different way. He's like a brilliant social satirist. Just say Martin Martin. Lawrence. I'm tell you something, man, don't discount Martin Lawrence Dude. And then the Sunday see Martin Martin Lawrence. Oh yes, for sure. Good point. Steve Martin's a monster. The early Steve Martin fucking, I wish he never stopped, man. He was so good. Let's get small. Actually, it's a brilliant, especially Martin Lawrence because what everybody else was doing at the time, everyone was trying to do what I think Carla was doing. Oh, what prior was doing? And he just came out with a fucking arrows between and was just being simply guys. That's the thing too. Like I love silly comedy. Yes. I love that stupid shit. Like not saying that his stuff was stupid, but I liked that kind of stuff. Uh, I like my stuff. Wait, silly. My favorite stuff is my stuff. That's silly.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       I mean, I like angry stuff, but I like doing silly stuff. Sometimes it's a function of Gio has to wear the leather coat, smoking the cigarette guy. Hey man, you know, corporations, I mean I, I have parts of my equity talk about like a conspiracy theory in that type of thing and I'm not into that. But I'm always conscious, like one of the words I avoid when I do my act, this is the word we, whenever somebody uses that, it's a fucking turn off to me and I feel like I'm being preached at, I'm not really, ah, I learned weird. I thought I learned writing word. No, I know with the PR, depends on how you do it, but I just, I saw comic a long time ago at the comic strip and I just remember he was going, he was going on, on ongoing like, you know, but do we do this now?

Speaker 3:          01:12:38       We want to country in that form yet. Like you don't fucking speak. That's silliness. Say, say what you think about it and then I'll listen to your opinion. If I agree with it, I'll laugh. Or you if I don't, if it's funny, I'm going to laugh, but like, uh, like I don't like being, I don't like preachiness out like being selfish fake shit. Yeah. That you're being dangerous or yeah. Or like pushing an image. Like, you know, you're going on stage with an image. You're trying hard to push it. Yeah. I worked with this chick Laura House once. She knows she is not a comic. Funny girl from, I believe she's from Texas and you lived in San Francisco and uh, she, when she met me, the first thing she said, she took a deep breath. She goes, I heard you're really like edgy and dark and I was so worried that you're going to show up wearing black.

Speaker 3:          01:13:23       That's hilarious. Areas she gives us worried. You're going to be one of those cards with a black shirt and black jeans sitting in the green room and [inaudible] I have a bill Hicks shirt that says, do you think I'm wearing all black in the summer because I'm a ray of sunshine. It's like, you know, like I'm wearing but I'm wearing black. I'm dangerous. It is sort of fucking stupid. It's an outfit. No different than ones that someone wears at Burger King or at a fucking monastery. We're in a big stupid orange row. I will give it a shot. Him is his Leno bit was great, like, yeah. And he had great shit, but I shouldn't say some of us, some of his stuff was funny. You know, I laughed at it. But Ari, you know, was like he was making a very, very valid point that there's a lot of like fluff in his business. Just him talking about ideas. There's nothing wrong with that. I think it's interesting and you, I don't need to laugh every minute to be entertaining. It's like 20 later. And then you're also

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       talking about a guy who went down a road where you're not going to get a sitcom, you're not going to leap to movies. So there's, you gotta give the Guy Credit that he did that he had a lot of the statistical integrity,

Speaker 1:          01:14:25       but that's also who he was. I mean, he would just snug it was going to get one. Anyway,

Speaker 5:          01:14:28       dude, you're going to get tweets where people are going to our emails where people say Kinison socks. So it's, so it's one of those deals where it all comes down to, I definitely like personally for me, the guy during that period, for me, what was,

Speaker 1:          01:14:40       but I have to be honest with one time I watched, um, I saw Richard Pryor's first specials when I was, but I hadn't even done comedy yet. I had just moved out of my parents' house and, uh, I was with my buddies and we watched two, uh, we had a VHR player in the fucking VHS rather in a, an apartment shitty apartment wall fam. And uh, we watched Sam Kinison and then right afterwards we worked Richard Pryor and I was like, wow, prior is way better prior, first prior. The first prior special is just fucking brilliant. It was brilliant. It wasn't that he was better, it's just, I've almost felt like, God, why was Kenton screaming so much? You know what I mean? Like prior, like Pri was so smooth and so real on stage. We're sitting as Kinison was putting on a show, it was a brilliant fucking show, but the way he was talking to you was not the way you would really talk to someone, you know? Oh, I was mad for two fucking, yeah. Whereas prior would be talking to you the way you really felt. You were drawn into him as a human being.

Speaker 5:          01:15:41       That's how I looked at. There's certain is a very few guys, but certain guys who just take it so far, you can't be surpassed. I would say him, James Brown, all this music that has come, no one has ever done it better than that guy. You can't. You can't. There's very few guys as a handful of artists that they're just, you can't pass.

Speaker 1:          01:15:58       Have you ever seen the James Brown live and Zaire clip you want to show? We played this on here once with Joey Diaz. Find that Brion pull that shit up on your iPad. James Brown live in Zaire. I, I've seen that yet. One of the greatest performances the human race has ever, the thing that was just one night. Yeah. Yeah. Just one lady and I was like 50, and he kept banging that out all over the country. He would throw that mic stand offish shoulder and kick it and he just fucking never missed a beat, never slipped. He had leather fucking slippery bottom shoes on, spinning around. I also

Speaker 5:          01:16:31       liked as far as like, you know when you work with the comedian and after like two shows, you realize, oh, this guy is going to do the exact same jokes in the exact same order. That whole shit we'll with a band, he just starts. If he decides he's just going to talk, they just start playing on like a loop. Like that's what I like when I, when I watched like bands like you can tell when they're, when they're improvin is because they don't look at the crowd there fucking looking at the s there's waiting for some sort of cue. Like what is it that one, like Steve, when I used to watch Stevie Ray Vaughan, like, uh, like some of the live shit that he did always knows Tommy Shanna, Chris late in the drum and the bass player in the drama. They would always be kind of looking in the, and once you got educated to watching him enough you would see the nods where like sometimes they would be looking, thinking out, here he comes, he's coming out of an anti, he's going back into more soloing and then he'd be on his way out and he just, we just sort of glance over at him and then seamlessly that that shut shit just blows me away.

Speaker 4:          01:17:22       People were able to do that. It's just the practice together all the time like that. I guess you just get tuned in.

Speaker 5:          01:17:27       I don't know. I just, I'm not a musician so I don't understand that. You play drums, right? Yeah. And that's the kind of thing, but I'm like the same way I watch sports. Like I'm a geek. Like I wish I played in the NFL, but you know, I wish she played drums. I wish, no know I can play drums at decent for a comedian, but like the like how good those guys are, man. Sure. Like I went to a foul on tape and I was watching the roots. I actually got to see them play during a break. Dude, they're fucking ridiculous raising. Yeah, ridiculous. And they don't even have to look at each other to us. What blows me away, they just sort, Kj. Glen said, man, let's do this for a while.

Speaker 4:          01:17:58       We think you're doing that when you, when you go on stage and you're free ball and sometimes talking to somebody in the crowd and all of a sudden it becomes a bit, I mean how many times you've done that? Someone will say something in the crowd

Speaker 5:          01:18:07       and you go, look at this fucking guy. He thinks all the sudden he's at a carnival. Hey, I'll have some popcorn, please. You know, and then you turn it into a fucking bit. How many times have you done that? And I've talked to people that say after you get off stage, like is that guy a plant? And you go, Nah, I was just fucking around with that guy though. You made all that up on the spot. I don't want to think about it. Is, is your locked into you right? You got to fucking worry about the guy in the bongos and the dude over here like, is this guy paying attention when I go to do this? Did he, did he see what he just did like gave the little nod like I don't get how it works, but like maybe it's because I can't do it then I'm so blown away by,

Speaker 4:          01:18:40       no, you're good point. I mean I can't do it either. I mean I don't even, I wouldn't even know where to start. I think it's the same thing though. I think when you tune into comedy, I guess it's got to be harder because you got to have a bunch of people that are tuned into May. It's got to be all about everyone making the song better. It can't be all about like, okay, here's it's Tom for time for Tommy's fucking drum solo. He needs a drum solo. Every song or he gets pissed off and this guy gets to go off and then it becomes like self indulgent, but there's, when it's tuned in and it's just to to make the song better and they do it together, you know? I guess that's what you like. Jazz is supposed to be all about, right? Everybody like does it together to make the song better

Speaker 5:          01:19:16       me, once I got out of that bad at that bed, I can't let somebody sounds like five guys playing five different songs on that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:19:24       On my message board about this. Cause I said that I hate jazz and uh, I don't really hate jazz. I just don't like it. I, I shouldn't say I hated because I do listen to it sometimes in the background. Have you ever listened to that? Yeah, I've listened to a lot of different shit. I look, I don't, I, but I wouldn't choose it over fucking the almond brothers. You know, you choose it over. See if it's fucking Leonard Skinner.

Speaker 5:          01:19:44       Alabama is the only thing I cannot fucking listen to other than if it's early on.

Speaker 4:          01:19:49       Ban Dwight Yoakam I can listen to Dwight Yoakam and that guy's a bad mother fucker. And I even like some stupid shit. I'll ask them to Coby Tz I like some of, should have been a cow boy. I liked that stuff. I know it's stupid. I like stupid shit. I don't mind. I like a lot of stupid shit. It doesn't bother me that it's stupid. I enjoy some of that, but often it's corny. Me,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       I just, I get like douche chips when I listened. I have a problem with people that don't like Willie Nelson or something. I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't judge people. But when some people don't like certain things, I think badly of them. Like this girl the other day said that she didn't like now cause I don't like those are, those are fine things. But this girl said she didn't like Stevie Ray Vaughn. She's like, oh, I can't listen to that. I go, what are you talking about? She goes, I can't listen to that. It's, it's guitar stuff. It's terrible. And I don't know her very well. So I just walked someone who works for the UFC, I just walked away. I'm like, okay, well but all I think it was that Bro, she's broken. You don't like see you can't, you don't like couldn't stand the weather. Du Du, Du, Du, Du du Du and it just because I've heard it so many times culturally is man, you smoke a joint and listen to Stevie Ray Vaughan live.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       Listen to that shit. Stevie Ray Vaughan and double trouble live. I would introduce it. He has a fucking live version of Voodoo child that will knock your Dick into the dirt. He has the only version of Voodoo child that's right up there with Hendrix. Put head. Find that friend that when you use, when you talk about a guy just took it to the end and you can't be passed. Yes, I would say him. Stevie is as close as you can to that, but he was definitely a major deciphal yes. Of of Hendricks. Just to put that out there cause everyone's gonna to be writing and going like, oh actually he stole a lot from Hendrix. Well yeah, he certainly did, but he also was a huge Hendrix fan and like broadcast that thing, you know what I mean? He like, it was all in, in homage to Hendricks.

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       He never pretend your fans to watch. Just to watch Stevie Ray Vaughan play are not tight rope. Our Live Austin city limits. Yeah, it's just add to, it's fucking me thinking. He was a tremendous motherfucker dude. He was a tremendous motherfucker. I, you know, I almost got a chance to drive him. I drove Jeff Beck around once I, when I was driving limos and Jeff Beck and Stevie Ray Vaughan were on tour together and I was going to get to drive Steve Ray Vaughan. I was all psyched about it, but Steve Ray Vaughan was such a bad mother fucker. You wouldn't take limos, took a cab everywhere he goes, the band would all get in their limos and their vans and he would just get in a cab by himself and smoke cigarettes. Listen to how good this is. Cracked the shit out. Jeff Beck is unreal. It's a slightly different version. I mean it's not what Jimmy Hendrix did is different.

Speaker 3:          01:22:23       He's got like a little twain going on. It's funny. Is in the middle. He does it. He does a solo on one of them and he actually is playing the harmony of a Hendrickson when he played with a band of Gypsies. Crank that shit up. Brian. This is the only guy that comes close to Hendrickson with the song. Yeah. No, it's overall stomps him. Oh yeah. He came up is he's the man. I mean, he's a complete original, but there are both heroin addicts. That ain't a coincidence. Now here at the, Steve really kicked up the name is coke. His heroin to Roddy heroin makes you feel that groove. I don't know what it is with those singers. Love that. Heroin musicians love that. Heroin is a great one. [inaudible] it you ever see when he got

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       booed now you got booed. Stevie Ray Vaughan. I hope they're all in hell now. Bring this down. This is great. Why did they, why did the performance gives me chills to, this is what happened. He went over to the, uh, still not as good as Hendrix. Pretty God damn good. But I was good. Yeah. That the Monterey jazz festival he played at, so they pursued him off for some stupid reason. They book them at a jazz festival and he plays blues. He plays loud. I mean other than that, like Stang swaying. I mean it's not a lot of jazzy shit. So everybody had been playing acoustic up to that point, I think it was in France, I don't know what it was. Somewhere over in Europe. So he goes out there unknown and he went out there and starts playing and stuff and it took about two, three songs in and they started booing them.

Speaker 5:          01:23:45       But what are, and you could see it was affecting him those really, but when they would start playing the song, dude, he total commitment. It gives me chills every time I watch it eat. That's all. One of his DVDs, they finally showed it and uh, but that was the time when David Bowie was in the crown and David Bowie's watched him go on, this guy's a beast. That's how he ended up playing the solo on that song. Let's do while he was bombing. That's funny. You can bond way better as a musician though, then you can as a comic, as a musician I have to do is just do the song as a comic you, this was pretty brutal because he was playing by the time he got to the third song or something like you can od, you can audibly hear boos. Yeah. But the thing is is it's, as much as it's bugging him, he still fucking is, is just ripping on the G. It's unbelievable.

Speaker 5:          01:24:27       And He, and he gets off stage. I remember, I remember reading a thing where he said, I'm a total Seaver Yvonne head. He got off stage and just like Jesus, I didn't think we were that bad. And uh, then of course he got with David Bowie, but we wanted them to go on tour and do like these dance steps and he wouldn't fucking do, it was like, I'm not doing, it's like a comedian not selling out. And he went back to Texas. I'm going to go back with my trio. We're going to try and make it that way. So we've got huge credibility that way. And then, then he blew up. And then a couple of years later he went back to, uh, the Monterey jazz festival. Of course, they were giving them a call. He wanted them to do dead stumps. Yeah. It was probably step one. The second his car, he was like, Texas.

Speaker 5:          01:25:01       Two steps on my fucking balls here. We're going to have a choreographer. We're going to work together. And before I performance, which we'll take a shower, they wanted him. Yeah, he was, he was going to be on the let's dance tour. Uh, you know, we had that whole pop, you know, put on your red shoes at Hong Kong. There was some sort of thing. He was coming down the stairs and he had to do like some little dance step with everybody else. And Stevie would just, yeah, I'm not doing it. We just walked down. And then finally it was just like, ah, I can't do the [inaudible] replace me. Steve [inaudible] fucking tour with David Bowie. Wow. And I heard he also used to get mad laws gossip. I know he's gonna get mad at the, uh, David Bowie video. Wait for, let's dance. Is David boy with with a pair of gloves on starts playing the solo that Stevie played. I heard Stevie saw the video was like, no, he shouldn't be out there fucking pretending like he played some shitty didn't play. Wow. Like all stuff like that. Wow. This is all shit that just old like I've poured through the Internet. Just reading all these. That makes sense. It's like comics that you know, I mean, how many comics do you know that looked down upon that hired joke

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       writers? You know, we know a lot of guys. There's a lot of guys, especially when they hit a certain level, they really did become like, uh, like almost like a figurehead. They almost become like a character and then they have guys write for them. It looks old school guys especially, well they have a lot of writers, you know? Yeah. I mean, I know a guy who has like five fucking writers and he's a, you know, national headliner and he has all these guys who come up with his own jokes for him because he's too busy with movies and all sorts of other shit.

Speaker 5:          01:26:27       So, but that, that is the way to do it. This is a bad idea tank. At least that's not the way to do it. But like as far as a business model, so you act never slips down. Like I look at that with like what it does slip. I look at it with them because I go, I could never fucking do that. And I watched like five years from now, here's the problem, here's the problem, Louie.

Speaker 4:          01:26:48       Okay, does it absolutely the best because he does a new hour every year and he does his own hour. It's all his writing, right? When you hire somebody else, man, you might agree that something's funny. You might agree that you know, this idea is funny and you might use it as a tool. You say, well, I'm going to go on stage. I'm going to plug this thing in and press this button. It's going to get a big laugh. It's going to work, but it's not going to be your thoughts being pretty

Speaker 5:          01:27:08       Jeff. That's what I thought to get fast. If I can't get past that, how can I stay in and if it kills and you'd be like, do you want to be like, oh yeah, keep it going. For Frank, frank wrote that one. You know no districts

Speaker 4:          01:27:16       back to the comics that we know that. Do you use writers that do use writers but they do not have the same impact on me as guys like Norton or guys like Louie or guys who I know write their own shit. The Guy, so I know that's, this is their thoughts like Norton especially, I got Norton's new CD sent me despicable. I heard it's awesome. Fucking whole areas. It's very fun. Gordon's, oh by the way, Norton is doing my podcast tonight. We're doing it live at the smog castle. By the time you hear this, if you're on iTunes, it's Tuesday the 23rd and 22nd do you use during meetings? It's so it's, it's probably not going to be on Ustream. And if you're listening on iTunes, it already happened. But it's tonight we're going to do a at nine o'clock at the smog cast. We're going to try these out.

Speaker 4:          01:27:55       We're gonna start doing live ones in front of an audience. I think it'd be fun if 50 people, we put the tickets online, it's sold out in two hours. So did these, they already have like Mike's and everything. They have it all set up and you, he has it completely wired for a podcast and then he just put in an SD card and he records it and gives it to you and you can upload it that night. But anyway, Norton is, I'm Greens down there. It was great. Yeah, I did his too. And Norton is doing my thing tonight and not, so I've been listening to a CD over the like last night on the way to the gym. It's fucking hilarious. It's so twisted and crazy. He's so funny, man. I saw him when I was in Austin. I was there for uh, the, um, the UFC and I had the Friday night off.

Speaker 4:          01:28:33       So a buddy of mine who lives in Austin, we, I said, hey, you know Jim Norton's sales, go see him, fucking killed it. He was show funny dude. He made me want to go home and write and he made me do shorter sets. He did like 50 minutes and I've been doing this thing lately where I did like, I was doing like an hour and a half, sometimes two hours and I'd do like a big question in the answer at the end. But I always felt like, and a lot of ways it kind of like took away from the energy of like just one big powerful performance. Yeah. A huge believer that you don't go beyond,

Speaker 5:          01:29:00       I've done. And it's like,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       you know, you do an hour. That's perfect. They get at you funny. They walk out, they got that excitement. Yeah. No, cause I, you know, whore myself out selling DVDs afterwards. If I do an hour and 10 an hour and 15, they come out like, yeah, they're like this. Especially if you don't close strong. Yeah, no. Even if you do though, even if you do, it's just a fucking exhausted and it's just like 50 to an hour is you've given them their money's worth and you've the classic show business. You left them wanting more, but like you go beyond that to what? I saw a guy one time, he did two hours. Okay. Right in an hour I looked at my watch. I just instinct avails and how much has he done? Oh right now look at me. This is my first kind of, okay again.

Speaker 4:          01:29:39       Yeah your, this is your take on the world. I get it. Then I'll 15 hour and 20 to one hour and 25 my fucking ass to start to fall asleep. I agree. A hundred by an hour and 35 I came up with a strategy for me and my girl to leave cause it was like, what's that in a theater and it was really going to be noticeable if we got up and left and so I ended up being the bad guy. She got up, made it look like she was going to the bathroom and then I just grabbed both our cooks. I go, excuse me. She was, and I saw people like, oh my God, I can't believe he was walking out on it. Really. It really is too much to sit there and listen to [inaudible] though. Depends though. Cause I've seen some guys, I've seen some hour and a half sets while I was fucking real happy that the show didn't end.

Speaker 4:          01:30:15       Like I saw Chappelle do an hour and a half for the comedy store and I enjoyed the fuck out of it. I enjoyed the whole hour and a half. But then again I'm a stand up comic. I'm going to on a sewer of comedy. I had the night off. I don't fucking have to get up at seven in the morning. I don't have, at the time I didn't know a, you know, a a normal job that I had to go to and work all day. So it's like when, especially Friday night late show, dude, that shows fucking 10 o'clock these people been up since seven you know, that's a long ass time. They're tired. Ship your barn in the crowd and they're drunk. You know?

Speaker 5:          01:30:43       I think it actually, it decreases them wanting to come and see you again. Yes. I definitely like if you go out there and just

Speaker 4:          01:30:49       can you just blast to for an hour, that's Boston style to Boston style is short and nobody in Boston ever did a fucking two hour set. They would look at you like, what are you fucking retarded? What did we do 40 remember those fucking Nick's comedy stop sets where the fucking headliner would do 20 minutes. Everybody would do 20 I'm, it'd be five guys do in 20 minutes and they would do the same 20 minutes for a hundred years and it would be honed to a Samurai sword, sharpness, Don Gavin, his timing, he could talk about anything and it would be brilliant because he had talked about it so long he knew the exact right beats and how to pause Knoxy all those guys. Don Gavin made me think that I shouldn't have been in comedy. Made me think, how could I ever be as good as this guy? I was an open miker watching him fucking destroy one night it was stitches, comedy club.

Speaker 4:          01:31:36       Okay. And it was the new stitches, which wasn't as good as the old stitches. It was nice because it was bigger and it had a restaurant attached to it, but there was like carpet in the floor, the ceiling, it was a little too high. I didn't absorb the, it didn't bounce back. The laughter like the old stitches. Stitches with dark anyway, the fucking shows long dude. It was like an a an open mic night and you know, 1520 unfunny want to be over and over again. Go Up. And I was one of them. And then at the end, Kevin Flynn, who was part of the pool, I was part of the problem for sure. And I was thinking, wow, this is audiences exhausted. At the end, Kevin Flynn brings up Don Gavin any fucking crushes and crushed to the point where me and Chris Mcguire and a couple other guys were sitting in the back room, hands in our face, like the fucking home alone kid going, we should just quit comedy.

Speaker 4:          01:32:25       We can't do this and will never be able to do this. I'm never going to be that good. We're going, we need to stop right now. No, that was a great thing. I think about that shit. Like thank God I started there as fuck. It was a few place like San Francisco, Boston and New York is a great place back in the day. Like now, not the same. Unfortunately. The last stops gone and now they just have, they do it on Sundays. They call it the comics union I think. But uh, the, the old laugh stop, the old one in river oaks was the shit, you know, that was a, that was the place where, you know, I mean Kinison started out back then, you know, they used to have, it was the comedy annex, I think they call it. They, by the time I got out there, that place was already gone.

Speaker 4:          01:33:00       Unfortunately. Man, I, I recorded my first CD there. Yeah. And Hicks did his uh, his first special sane man. Yeah, yeah. At the same club that see that, that that's that thing on the wall. That's from [inaudible] 99. That's what I recorded my, those are my Warner brothers CD. I'm going to be dead some day and I did that in Houston. That was when I was on news radio on those, there was only one place in the country where I would sell out every show and that was Houston. I'd sell out way in advance. Like, like, like I would sell out the whole weekend by Friday. No, my dad says no, I didn't do that anywhere else, you know, and does nowhere else. But the um, maybe I didn't, maybe I sold out like one day in advance. What a point is. There was no place where I would like they would stuff in extra people in like violate the fire code.

Speaker 4:          01:33:41       Like when I recorded my CD there, they stuffed in 50, 60 people over the fire code. I mean, there was people, there was chairs in the aisles and shed. It was ridiculous, but it was because that was the style of comedy that they love. Like Hicks and Kinison and they were both dead by that time. They had grown, like Houston had developed this table. One of those guys left. Yes. Both of them. I saw both of them live. I saw Kennison live only as an audience member, but as I Hicks alive when I was already a comic, I saw him live at least three times. One time I left the room because he wasn't doing so well. So it was just like the audience had no idea who he was. And he was just onstage talking about, uh, Debbie Gibson and Jimmy Hendrickson was just fucking, people weren't buying it.

Speaker 4:          01:34:19       You know, there's a couple of times where I saw him where he absolutely destroyed though one time at the old comedy connection man, where he was just on his fucking game. Man, he just destroyed, just, just came in there, guns blazing, all this shit about Jim Fixx dying while jogging and all that shit. You know, because Jim Fixx was the jogging guy and the Yule Brenner bit, you know, he had a Yule Brenner, Yule Brenner, you know, Jim Fixx would get up and Dewey track at dawn jogging and you'll run. It would be coming home, its head out of the limousine to chicks blowing them smoking a cigarette and they're both dead and he's like, you know, he's dead. I'm dead. Shit. That could be, I was fucking up at dawn

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       doing. Yeah, I mean it was a really lovely guys saw from back then. I saw dice clay at the, at the height of, I saw him at the Worcester Centrum. I sat at the second to last row in the upper deck. Eddie Griffin or unknown Eddie Griffin opened up and we were all like Boone ago [inaudible] dice man. And I was doing that. I was doing that dumb audience, you know, [inaudible] going to like us because we're treating his opener like shit. And Eddie Griffin was hilarious. He's like, fuck you motherfuckers. And then he actually got the crowd, he turned him around and everything. But uh, how old was I at the time? 28 I saw Tennyson when I was 19 when I was working for a great woods. I was wearing you for a great woods performance arts center and he's like, yeah, I saw Eddie Murphy on the raw tour. Oh, did you?

Speaker 3:          01:35:41       Yeah. I just didn't see Eddie Murphy out there, but I saw bill Cosby. I saw Rodney Dangerfield out. Dangerfield out there to Dangerfield was naked with a robe on who would go with a bathrobe on and slippers and that's how he'd do comedy. Fucking naked as balls hanging out. He'd go backstage as balls were hanging out. He didn't give a fuck. You like to do comedy naked with a robot and destroyed. By the way, one of the most underrated comics of all time fucking destroyed. He had the classic get up with the red tag. We see something that you said before that I wanted to go back to because I both, we both agree with this about this, and I've talked about this before, is that Hicks or not in a Hicks? Whether the Kinison was genius in the beginning, but then terrible at the end. He's might be an example of a guy that got famous and he got huge and then he bought into his own hype and then he became a character.

Speaker 3:          01:36:27       He stopped writing when he was at doing. I don't think I've ever seen a guy handled it worse. If you just watch the difference between his first and second Letterman, his first Letterman, like, you know, they say that like, you know, they give that intro like, Jesus, we don't this next guy, the next guy's going to be different. We know does that air of like something crazy could fucking happen. And usually it's just hype will, this guy's crazy. But it's, it's, his act is, he's crazy, but it's like Kennison it was real. And he came out, dude. I mean he just fucking came out and he was walking up into the crowd and it wasn't cheesy, it was just, it was, it was amazing. And then the second one, he comes in, he just comes, you know, do you know that his face, what's going on day?

Speaker 3:          01:37:08       And he just was just like relaxed to him. Yeah, he was just like a, I made it not hungry yet. I made it. He's a fat guy, you know, at the end of the day he's lazy. I mean that's really true. I mean fat people are fucking lazy. You know his personality in his book, his brother Bill, his brother, his brother's name, I forget his name, I met him, unfortunately, I forgot his name. Whatever his name is. I'm sorry, whoever you are as Rocco, his brother who wrote the book wrote that he was a normal kid and then you get hit by a fucking truck. He got hit by a car and when you get hit by a car, he got fucked up and he came out of that head injury, a completely different person. And then it became like reckless and fearless and all fucking wild person like the accident literally made him Sam Kinison. I mean, cause you think about it, I'm like, who the fuck thinks like that? Who

Speaker 8:          01:37:56       has that kind of boldness to go on stage and scream and yell about things? You know? And did you ever see when he was preaching, you ever see the videos of him preaching? Yeah. Hey man, it's great. Holy Shit. I mean it was so, there was like a rhythm to someone preaching when they believe have a Lord touches me. You're like, fuck. I mean, knowing what I know what I'm saying is nonsense. The applause break. Yeah. And nobody knows how to build. They fucking like you're, that's why he was such a good comic. Cause you would add those principles. He would draw it out. Like ladies and gentlemen, I know the devil's in this room. And they were like, oh, we'll bring them down. Yeah, the devil would like you to believe that there's something wrong with the Lord. You know? And then he starts walking back and forth and then it builds up to this. But I'm here to tell you, James, that says a lot, Jay, this is where he's with. And then everybody's fucking screaming,

Speaker 5:          01:38:51       dude, I gotta tell you she would do. I don't buy any of the, any of that shit. But I love watching preachers. I watched the guy that, you know, we just clearly a bigoted psychopath, but he was fucking a phenomenal performer and you know that guy, he would, he would bring up people who like, uh, you know, who were living like probably the life that we're living in. And he had this way of saying what they were doing and then he would just sort of look to the side and shake and you'd get a laugh every time I got now he would read a quote with somebody said like, you know, this guy says premarital sex is not a bad thing. It doesn't want to think for yourself. It doesn't do anything bad to your soul. Right. And then he just had this look, he was like Carson watching Carson when he would look over at the band.

Speaker 5:          01:39:29       He just had this thing where he would just sort of looked down and the crowd was just like, oh, here he comes. He's going to take the piss out of this guy. You know what I mean? It's like watching your favorite wrestler. Like here you go, here we go. Then the guy builds it all the way up and I would just, you know, and it was one of those things where he, I would actually start getting into it like, hey, maybe this guy's got a point, and then they would just say something horrific about gay people or just something that just, you just, you're like, God, this is how does an adult think something like me, while he probably couldn't wait to get off stage and fuck some kid, I ain't go to Thailand, Bang some kids. Yeah. You know, do what I got in this huge thing with this fucking guy in the internet.

Speaker 5:          01:40:00       Like it's the last time I'm getting with like, I fucking like 10 deep on emails and emails, deep diameter and about what? About how I said why I stopped going to Catholic Church and this guy was upset at that. Yeah. And he knew, bothered to argue with that because I'm an Ada yet, like I come from a, you know, I can't, I take the fucking budget, use that one. Um, guilty because note, because there's, there's a, uh, a sense of, uh, I don't know what the fuck it is, what the word is that super religious people have that, you know, you just wanna boners no, you just want to expose like their bullshit. Right. All right. So I just said, listen, you know, I stopped going because I was going to church and every time the basket came around and I was putting the money in, I felt like I was giving money for a fucking defense attorney did offend these guys who look the other during pedophilia, right?

Speaker 5:          01:40:55       Or whatever. So He's, his big issue was saying that I couldn't say that they were kid fuckers because most of the people who got violated were teens. And I was like, oh, great. See you grade on a fucking scale. So he directs me to this Wikipedia page. It was over 10,000 fucking incidences that they're talking about it. This is just the ones that were reported, forget about the kids who killed themselves and didn't come forward because they're too embarrassed. They 10,000 instances, 22% of them were 10 10 years of age and under. So I go, let's just round it off to 10 grand. That's 2100 cases of dental and a kid. How many kids do you gotta fuck before you get labeled as a kid? Fuck her. Because the other ones and a and he was trying to spin it that I was actually helping pedophiles because I wasn't going to church and the church did all these things and people back in the day were confused. They thought

Speaker 6:          01:41:41       was it? You got trolled thought it was like a spirit. Second thing I was me, you got trolled by a 14 year old pretending to be religion. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Cause it happened possible. Possible. You can't trick me. I know. A real really know but

Speaker 5:          01:41:56       no, cause there's, there's certain, there's certain things that he was going through cause I was sitting at some point goes this guy just trying to piss me off, but two he got all the way into the fucking, I'm a correctional officer. My grandfather was a correctional officer and I work with these pieces of shit I made. If I did, it was the greatest one ever. [inaudible] website.

Speaker 6:          01:42:14       Yeah. Everyone's in their trolls. Seems easy. It seems like I want to try it. I know. I'm thinking about getting a vague email gets low. I fuck with you every day. I'm going to bring up [inaudible] like there's people who go to those churches who aren't that fucking stupid would there is, but there's a lot more people that would like to fuck with you now that they know how easy it is. Look, my message board right now, they're sharpening up their dicks right now. Right dress, but it's over. No, no, no, no. Not Him. You say it's not, they're going to get nice and subtle with you. They're going to start off nice and slow. They're going to say something to you about some picture of the timeline of you grow your Dayton. Yeah. Just don't send any photos of you and your Dick. Yeah. At the same time that your face and you're going to know some shit about you that's personal, some inside shit and they're going to exploit it.

Speaker 6:          01:42:58       Your fuck? Nah, Nah. You've got an issue, bro. You're you're, you're in trouble. I'm not theories. Easy to troll. I'm not in screen capturing things. You were thinking about coming to Jujitsu. I talked to you about it for awhile. You were thinking about doing it. Just even if you don't want to do that, get out God damn punching bag. It'll make a better bill burr. Just get a bag of gloves. It's so easy. That's nice and cute and shit, but you get off telling me that I need that to not take the bait. You Joe are really worse at this than me. I'm telling you this is what happened. You basically just said that I got trolled and I used your presenting it as fact having not read any wild, obviously additional candidates. You're arguing core. Who are you with? Me? [inaudible] you fucking listeners. [inaudible] sending me fucking emails. It's ridiculous. Easy. This is how easy it is to get you upset you or trolled right now. Tell you right now, I

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       could get you. I could get you if I didn't tell you what my feelings about weed, where I couldn't. I had you standing up with a fucking vain, even high. I could make you freak out if I, if I pushed your buttons, I was still laughing at you. I would say it's ridiculous. Oh, that's right. I forgot this is, this is the new spot. Joe Rogan. Come on out. Jesus. Stop his joke. Joke. Joke me. Well, one of the great things about being a psycho as you can spot another one across the room for you to sit here, but I managed my psychosis better than you. That's all it is, buddy. I'm all Tom saying you've got, you've not signed them. I have it on the line. A bubbling brook in the back. I get it. Not Saying I got it under the one that I'll go with that, but you're a little out of hand. You're going

Speaker 1:          01:44:29       back and forth with a guy who believes that the church protects pedophiles.

Speaker 5:          01:44:33       Yeah. I like to debate. I go back and forth with fucking jets fans. I hate the phone Jack. I go back and forth on them.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       Did you hear about this fucking guy? You know, I'm only kidding, right? What about all, I mean, I don't really think you're a loser. I don't think that. Now you never said,

Speaker 5:          01:44:49       I'm going to interrupt. Think that you're going to be easy to troll. I know. I want people to know that this all in fun. I want people to know that this is all in fun people. Right moment on the pocket. People

Speaker 1:          01:45:02       don't understand. Like people go, Whoa, fucking these idiots on my message board. We go Joe Rogan to Bill Berg on issues. I thought, but they really got into it all. You hear bill first, Joe Comics, fuck around like this all the time. This is what we do. And especially people that, uh, you know, especially if you live on the west coast, she never really understand that sort of sense of humor. It's why people didn't understand that Gilbert Godfried thing. To me, it was like, you know, when, when he started tweeting about Japan, I'm like, east coast comic would do, I mean, you know, you gotta you all want to go for the juggler. Yeah, I didn't like to do, but how he leave in new, he did the voice of the duck. You know who fucking just like that classic. Certainly it's a lot of Japanese people that were in this insurance competence.

Speaker 1:          01:45:41       One of the reasons why I was a busy always. Now did you hear about this? A high profile Vegas drug prosecutor. This guy, uh, he busted Bruno Mars. He busted Paris Hilton on all, on cocaine charges. He got arrested for buying crack head. You gotta believe that she must know who you hang out with. But I was thinking about this when we were talking about, you know, the pedophiles and you know, all these fucking crazy people that don't want to believe. It's like w how, how many people that go against something really want to do it. I mean, how many fucking people like that? How many people that are against gain, like the Ted haggards of the world that are against gay marriage against gay, this, against that, let's say something like that. Yeah, yeah. I remember that guy that got busted in New York. You're really recently, he was a a judge or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:46:28       He got busted and some sort of an influence scandal and it turns out that he was a voting against gay marriage and he was fucking gang, you know, the guy's gay and he was living with a guy and he's, you know, making all these votes against gay rights. Yeah. Which goes back to religion. They just let people live and be who the fuck they were. Then you wouldn't have people doing shit like that. But as far as like the drug thing I think is a lot of people don't have to drugs that they, they seriously are. I like

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       against him. But, uh, I think you know the thing, you've got to watch out who you hang out with because you end up doing what they're doing. I think eventually you just try it. You think you're in the evidence room. Wow. Really. You fill tried crack, you're feeling a little sleepy. You can leave me alone with buckets of crack in my house and I'm not going to smoke it. Yeah, but can you just leave it all over the place? I'm never going to touch the crack. This is what I would do. I leave you with booze first, get you when you're like 11 you know, and we moved away. This is a developed human, which is like a gateway drug, right? You go to the weed, then that must've then it all depends on what you want to feel like for you. I see why the way your makeup, you want to feel less smell like Joe Rogan on coke.

Speaker 5:          01:47:31       You'd start, you'd be like Godzilla. He'd start stepping on fucking skyscrapers downtown, so it would be hard to get you to go the crack route, but like hallucinogenics and that type of thing. It'd be, well my buddy Jimmy, when I was in high school and my buddy Jimmy used to do coke and he told me, whatever you do, don't do it. You'd like it. Don't do it. Yeah. That's my resume. Well, that's why I never really fucked her another week because I knew when I finally did it, I loved it. I definitely loved it and I, that's, I get a lot of shit in my podcasts cause people think I'm anti wait cause they fucking more, I got a million tweets around those. Yeah, no it's, I'm not anti weed. I'm just saying stop acting like it's not addicting like this that it's just, it's just like alcohol. Well No, it's not just like alcohol, but in, that'd be addictive. Psychologically. Physically though physiologically is not physically whatever, psychologically, what do you want to call it? But like those wake and bake guys, those guys, I got a buddy of mine who smokes weed because I said, why do you, why do you like doing in a seriously fucking with his life and he's going to do weed is not the issue. And I go, why? First of all, why do you do it? He goes, I like weed because it turns my life into a movie.

Speaker 5:          01:48:37       All right. And it's like this dude, like, I don't know. I don't want to fucking rat them out or nothing like that. But he's lost the job because he flunked a fucking drug test. That's a shitty job. And every job that was their job sucked. Okay. Any job that you can do that's boring as fuck you can do on weed. And it becomes interesting. You know? I find, I'm not saying that it's a bedroom, I'm saying, but this guy, he gets fucking high because he's just keeping life. Yeah. He's using it the way an Alka uses alcohol, where it's just like, I got all this pain. I don't how to process it. I don't want to deal with it. Let me just, let me just get fucked up. That's how he does it. And Dude, I'm telling, and the thing about it, think about it is too, with weed, is I can't go to work drunk.

Speaker 5:          01:49:18       You know what I mean? But you will be high, you can go to work fucking high, and as long as you're going to handle your shit, people aren't gonna fucking notice. I just, there's a bunch of emails I gotta gotta gotta go, you know? Yeah, I handle, we straight just every night I smoke a little fucking bowl and then I go to bed and it's just like, well what if I, you know, drank a beer and a half, two beers. So I got buzzed every fucking night. People will be looking at me like, dude, I think, I think you have like a drinking problem that you have to get. He's like sedating himself. So he's using it as like a fucking sleep aid. I'm not saying that, but I don't have any problem with me. I think it makes you feel great and that type of shit.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       It's just like anything as long in moderation. But people who sit there like, and annoys me that on intervention, they've never had just some pothead who's been fucking high since he's 16 and he's still watching like fucking the Hanna Barbera hour. And you know, cause it doesn't compare to the math guys pulling his face off with his fingernails. And I know that she seems a lot worse. That's the, don't know that that's definitely worse. But that's, that's what then if you know meth heads, they're the fucking worst. Does that mean you shouldn't go after? It was all the difference between not being

Speaker 9:          01:50:15       in your normal state. You know, you're escaping your normal self. So even if your wheat stoned all day, you're escaping, you're, you're sober self, your, your core self, which is always a problem in some ways. You know what I mean? Like just people, I drive better when I'm high and I know exactly the way he's talking about. There's so many people that we know that just wake up from the beginning. They wake up, they have to get stone to the go to bed and they're never, they're sober self because they're hiding something.

Speaker 3:          01:50:41       You know, they all have in common photo bombing. I agree. I agree. 100% of the vaporizer, it's probably a thousand times more healthier than drinking a fucking six pack. You know what they all have in common? They're all fucking hilarious. Yeah, absolutely. Listen, when I was on fear factor, I totally self medicated. I used to get high before every show. After the first season, I got high before every fucking show. I was so bored doing that show. I mean, sometimes it was cool. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy I had the job. It was a fucking wonderful opportunity, great people to work with the producers and everyone was the fucking, the crew grow fantastic. It was just a wonderful job. But I would rather be doing other shit, you know? Yeah. I wanted the money and I wanted to do it and I wasn't gonna quit.

Speaker 3:          01:51:23       But Mandy, you know, at certain points in time, I mean, how many fucking animal Dick's can you feed people? But we like, what the fuck am I doing with my life? You know, how many times can you hang somebody by a crane and go, ready? Three, two, one, go. Right. You know how many is to think about you. It's like you smoking weed doesn't affect you from prevent you from fucking coming up with the new hour of material doesn't prevent you. It doesn't, it helps. I ended. Okay. Yeah. And you're not slacking off and just watch some cartoons fucking up your motivation. All right. So, yeah, I'm not saying like people just thought I was just straight across the board saying it was bad. I wasn't saying that. I was just saying like I just got sick of people going, yeah, it's not addicting. I drive better when I'm high and like, like there was no repercussions.

Speaker 3:          01:52:05       Like there's repercussions to fucking everything. You don't, especially if you're smoking that Fuckin Oji Kush that a lot of dudes like to smoke that that Endeca, there's two different types of weeds, sativa and Indica and the sativa is, or like more heady, like you want to go watch a documentary on space and the indycars you just want to watch cartoons and eat cereal and sleep. You know, they're two really different effects and most of the country only gets that. We'd most of the country gets the sleepy weed. They get to college. You know what I found lately that sleepy weeds the best we'd have sex on. That's like ecstasy on weed. Yeah, they're kind of makes sense. Yeah. Well, you know what though? The regular is pretty awesome to the regular, you know, what's the best for sex? Eating weed. When you eat wheat, you get that body. You get

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       that because it's, you know, it really affects you in a different way because it's a different chemical. When you knew it's processed by your liver and that's the best for second.

Speaker 5:          01:52:52       It's like everything feels better. Watch the Oscars and it was like the Best Oscars. Why was I heard that there was some bad monologue or something. I didn't, I don't watch any of that nonsense. I think people awards for ours. It's ridiculous. Was the moment James Franco, you could just see tapped. I was just like, ah, fuck this. He got, I came out in a dress and you're not going to laugh at me. Go Fuck yourself and just had this look on his face and I keep working. Who gives a fuck? It was great. He says, take my phone out and check. It was like a comedian when you just look at a crown and they got, these people are fucking idiots.

Speaker 4:          01:53:22       Well, how about the shitheads that got upset at a, what's his name? The English guy. There was, yeah, there was doing the Golden Globes. They got upset at him

Speaker 5:          01:53:30       cause he was shitting on everybody. But I didn't think he deserved any sort of edgy points. I mean it's like you show up and you, you, you, you have a staff of writers write roast jokes and you took his jeep like, yeah cause been done heavy. That was like, like it was this amazing fucking, can you believe in, know you fucking get a staff writers to write roast jokes to sling them at people armed with acceptance speeches. It's like, and then when you did go down and fucking start slapping around some first graders, I just think that that's a gig where it's really easy to come off as edgy. I mean given were gasping and what was he doing? I'll Robert Downey JR Rehab joke. It goes back to that Hicks Shit that you were talking about. It's just like, I thought it was really like, uh, like I just look at that Gig boy, that's like the comic where you get like a corporate gig and they go, listen, don't talk about this, don't talk about this and we're clean. Okay. And you agree to it. And then you go out there and then you just say fucking blah, blah blah, and you're walking around like you're fucking Lenny Bruce. You're now, you just have to do, if you didn't want to do the Gig, if you don't like celebrities, do you think they fucking suck? What are you doing there? And awards show with the fucking Tuxedo on.

Speaker 4:          01:54:32       Greg Fitzsimmons was telling me the story about a Gig that he did in New Hampshire, you to drive up there, it's like fucking four hours in the middle of nowhere. And he did the Gig and they told them whatever you do, you can't swear. Don't say fuck. So he goes on stage, he goes, apparently I'm not supposed to say fuck like what's that about? He gets off stage, they have his bags packed like right there by the side says, get the fuck out of here. You're fired. And so he has to drive home and you know, he was telling it to rich slicer actually and slicers like Dan let you drive home at night. Usually they tell you to never drive at night because there's a moose.

Speaker 5:          01:55:02       They're like, fuck this kid. He said the evil word. But yeah, that's a Douche. But that's a thing you do when you're 20 you know, you're like, yeah, that's how I always viewed it. I viewed it like, cause I went through that period, but I sort of viewed it like, it's like they're telling you what they want and they hired me to do this and you're agreeing to fight. It's like that fucking kid at Byu. Everybody's flipping out. Like he had sex and they kicked him off the team. They said what they expected and you signed a fucking contract, you know, don't go to this school. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:55:33       But the idea of stopping teenagers for fucking, it's just like saying,

Speaker 5:          01:55:37       I'll drink water is ridiculous. I'm not saying it's smart, I don't agree with it. I think it's fucking ridiculous. But

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       who in their right fucking mind signs a contract and says, I'm not, I'm not gonna fuck. Dan had to have been all written up back in the fucking dark ages though, right? It was in Brigham Young University. That's a Mormon University. Right. I don't agree with it, but it's one of those things. Don't take the Gig. You're telling me that guy couldn't put a ball through a hoop and someplace else. Yeah, but it's not like Byu is his fucking North Carolina or some really like, you know, traditional like where they were all these like Jordans and James Worthy's came from. Byu is like the best they got. They, they've had a couple of seasons with like Steve Young and Jim Mcmahon. They've had like great, great teams with their football, but now with basketball it's fucking Byu. No idea what you're talking about. Now you lost [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:56:28       Right? But you know what your listeners see, right? Do they, they know sort of sports football for the losers out there. All right. It would be like kidding. I don't think you're losing. If you like basketball, right? Settle Down, put your panties, straighten them out and say this is Sydney thinks he's going to get on with that. Talking about them, not you. I'm talking about those people out there. Then you just get upset because I said, you're a fucking loser if you're like basketball. And then I'm like, relax everybody on Twitter. I'm just joking around. These are just jokes. These are just chokes. And did you see Gallagher? I heard that he fucking got a stroke on stage right now. I saw I was on the local news when a satisfying things I've ever seen. He's standing outside of his house that he somehow owed. He's owned for 30 years and he's having an auction.

Speaker 3:          01:57:09       He's selling all it half the shit you've seen in a special. Why selling these off? Because he's losing his house. Jadon tells losing his house. Yeah. I'm telling you right now, there aren't fucking TV. Talk about Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens and what they, you know what baseball means? They should be hunting down these bankers and fucking shooting him between the eyes. Oh wait a minute. The owner house for 30 years and you're getting kicked out of it. I thought it's a 30 year loan money. Type it in the SEC is loan. So you know, he really puts a second mortgages and probably didn't pay it. I didn't hear that. He got, he was getting kicked out of his house. He was like selling large bananas and he just had a fucking heart attack on stage to it. I don't get how you're in a fucking house for 30 years.

Speaker 3:          01:57:46       You're doing road gigs and you somehow can't afford to keep your fucking house to those mortgages. It's modern day fucking slavery. It's ridiculous. How can you say that when you say that a kid should be able to go to Brigham young and sign a contract that he's not going to fuck. You don't think that. It's just as ridiculous that someone signs a contract for a second mortgage on there. This is why they're green to that because you can't live outside home. Well, you're a fucking idiot. You're an idiot, man. If you're homeless, you better have some friends sleep on the couch. You're the dummy wants to take out a second mortgage when you think you can pay it off. I mean, it's an agreement. It's like it's not, you're not dealing with a long a loan shark who, I completely disagree reeling because I felt like first of all, it shouldn't take you 30 fucking years to pay the thing off. Didn't take, you'll get 30 years. You shouldn't take a Donald Trump. 30 years is a lot of people that play this capitalism game. They figured out a way to do it and this guy didn't, he didn't pay his fucking bills. It's that simple. Organic or something crazy

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       organic watermelons. Maybe something happened. We don't know about. Forget it right now. It's just how the game is set up, dude. Banks and insurance companies are the two most crooked motherfuckers out. Yes, I agree and as you get older you start having health fucking problems and you have a little heart attack and then you got it. You know you get hospital bills through, right? They look, this is what the deal. They want you to run on the wheel for 30 years and then they want you to fuck up financial to, they can kick you out and stick somebody else. Listen to what you're saying. You are right now doing exactly what you say you hate comedians doing. They want you to do this and they want you to do that. That's just the same as we this the same thing. Notice you're, you're making this them, which you're doing is you're being like, the guy sent me the email and you're defending pedophiles in a financial way.

Speaker 1:          01:59:29       I'm not defending them at all. You're saying, I think the system is completely fucked up and did a lot more people should be in jail. They, Bernie Madoff. They should fucking front end load the interest. I think Gallagher made millions of dollars. That's what I think. And I think of Gallagher lost his house. He's probably a fucking idiot. Absolutely. And then I heard Gallagher on the Marin podcasts like running off and I've seen Gallagher on opie and Anthony. He's a douchebag. All those stupid jokes he was trying to play on Patrice. This is that. This is the thing, this is what I can't stand about. This shit is Gallagher's the douchebag. But what about the fucking bankers do that made homeless guys qualified to get a fucking home? That's a different argument. They drive. They were talking about Gallagher. I'm never getting back. It's Calico. I'm never going to defend defend Gallagher or bankers or Gallagher.

Speaker 1:          02:00:10       Fuck Gallagher. You know, obviously I don't know the guy's finances shit. It just got any chance I had to take a shot at fucking bankers. Have you seen inside job yet? It's on the wall. Just got it and I'm going to watch it tonight. I was going to watch it last night, but I try to fix my pool stroke guy named Stevie more told me my elbow comes up in a funny way. I gotta fix my pool's trucks. I've been telling you, doctor, you have been watching pool instructional [inaudible] Estrada than a fucking hot chick who's good at pool. There's a few, but the problem is you don't want to beating you. You don't want to grow beating. You know that's a very masculine game. I know guys that were going on when I would play in a tournament, so they didn't have to play women. They would freeze up.

Speaker 1:          02:00:48       Even good pro players, they freeze up. They panic because I don't want to lose to a chick. I think Bullard chicks he bench pressing more than does matters. She's playing pool into a whole who is a very manly game cause it's about controlling your instincts and controlling your emotions and staying calm and focused and showing that you can fire under when you're, when they're under pressure, like pull like the most, the big thing about pool is not playing for fun. The big thing about pools, gambling, that's where pool really what? Pool meeting halls. A manly, well, what pool means is pooled the money in and gamble. That's what it was invented. I mean that's literally the name, the origins of the name pool, the game, his pocket billiards. That's the real game. It's called pool because you fucking gamble on it. And when, when guys are gambling, man, last thing we'll do is lose money to a chick and a game. When you dog the ball, you panic and you think, oh don't miss this nine ball. This is yet. This is everything.

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       Put the jars in the moment when he's going to lose to her in the, in the driving thing. Yeah, man. Gotta beat Marsha. Got To get closer than a quarter of an inch and he knocks the fucking egg off the coast in man. I remember I had a sit up contest with my cousin when I was like 11 and I was fucking so devastated that she was beating me in this sit up contest. I was super upset or 11. I know, but look, some people don't mature. Some guys, it just, look, I've lost the girls and tournament's before and I didn't enjoy it back when I was like in my early twenties. I didn't like it at all playing some fucking a woman. Anything other than an argument. If I lost an argument that would fucking kill me. I really just, I mean, just like, like whatever. She yelled louder than me.

Speaker 5:          02:02:21       I mean, like she got down, she just got just like reams of information and that's why you're wrong. Go Fuck Yourself. Has that ever happened? That would drive me nuts. Has that ever happened? I lost an arm to the uh, yeah, but this is the thing. Um, I, I don't, I should have clarified that not a girl I'm in a relationship with. Right. That's a big thing with me. If I'm wrong, I admit I'm wrong in a relationship. You got to do that because then you're setting up if they're wrong, for them to tap up and that, that will save and do, you just had a little help a lot and you know, you're right. You're right. I flipped up. I shouldn't have yelled at that guy. You're right. Blah, blah, blah. What it, it shows, it shows like a willingness to grow and honesty and things that people appreciate.

Speaker 5:          02:02:57       I appreciate that in friendships too. When a, a friend will come up to me, dude, I, I shouldn't have said that to you. I'm sorry. I appreciate that. That's what about strangers? You don't give a shit and you get no, fuck. You fuck you back with them. If they actually, if they actually, uh, like I had a victory in and turned it into a loss about fucking about a month ago I was sitting in my car and I'm happy doing this phoner this meeting, right? And I'm outside the bank, right? And this girl pulls up, gets out of a car, opens the car door right into my door, boom, hits it and like, but didn't even react. I mean, not like really hard, hard enough, but it was the fact that she didn't fucking react that I actually questioned. I'm like, did she just maybe, I dunno, is it that maybe I, I thought she did it or whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:03:40       So I'm still on the phone doing this conference call, right. She fucking comes back out. She does it again. So I'm on comp, I get these people on speaker 10 noise. So I said, hang on a second. I opened the door. I said, hey, I go, you just opened your car door to my car on the way into the bank and on the way out of the bank. And she goes, oh, I didn't chip the paint. I go, chip. The paint. He didn't even look, why don't you be a little more considerate next time? And I slammed the door so I won game set, fucking match. And then like an idiot, I still have to look over at her and she just goes, smile, have a nice day. Like I'm an asshole for getting upset. And then she gave me the finger and drove away. She kind of, she kind of stole around on me. It's like I won and I got when sugar ray Leonard that yeah. Yeah. Like when you hang on one that fucking fight by the way you like to the little fucking American flag shorts decided my head and I was like, oh, why did I look at her? I should just spend like be a little more

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       considerate. I had the slam of the door at everything you do. You know the conspiracy on that fight is that Hagler through it and then Hagler a kudo knocked out Leonard, but he was hitting him with pity pat punches, which if you watch it, it really doesn't look like the same kind of punches he threw on with Gabi and Hearns. It looks like he was like, you know, almost like three quarters speeding his punches because I am genuinely looked devastated when they lie, when these problems is why I should, should've never fought in Vegas. Maybe. I mean, but he retired. Look, it was close enough. I did. He could have lost decision. He retired. I mean, only if he doesn't see it that way it's as ego because it was pretty close. You can see a decisions are squirrely. Anything could happen. Judges don't have monitors.

Speaker 4:          02:05:11       No, he didn't. No one got knocked down that fight. I thought he'd knocked him down. I believe so. I don't think so. I don't think Hagler ever knocked down. Leonard, hold on. You didn't knock him down. Maybe I'm thinking one of his, all the fines that was the worst watching liner down knock guys down. They really usually didn't get up to how great was the Middle Weight Division. But what I was saying is amazing, but what I was saying is that, um, he sent her, Nah, Nah, Nah, I don't think he knocked him down. Um, when we're saying is though that he retired and he moved to Italy and it became a fucking movie star. Yeah. And it's like, look, if the mom really wanted a bet, a shitload of money on the, the underdog, which is sugar ray Leonard fighting this destroyer, who is Marvin Hagler, just fucking crushed.

Speaker 4:          02:05:51       Tommy Hearns was knocking everybody senseless and sugar ray Leonard had fought years and years, you know, he's older. He would look like, even when people didn't ever think anybody ever came back and was successful because most of the time they weren't. I thought he did. Is he looked like he did a cycle before that, that fight. He was, Leonard did. Yeah. He was huge. Didn't Tommy Hearns accused him of that? Tommy Hearns accused him of that before their second fight. Oh, Atlantic. Yeah. Yeah. I do know he, when he, when he won that fight in any, he did the classic flex dude. He was like, you know that guy, you know, I don't know. You know who they're going after is Lance Armstrong? Ooh. They're going after him, man Damn. And Barry bonds forever. But they got a lot in. They've got a lot of information then there's, fuck no, no, they gotta stop.

Speaker 4:          02:06:29       We gotta Stop Martha Stewart. We've got to say that. Yeah, we got stop Rodger Clements. This is just, it's just fodder. It's too, it's true. You're totally right. It's a good point. Yeah. It's kind of crazy. It's not that it's, it's not that it's baseball. It's what baseball represents. While it's like what the fucking bankers that's, does it represent it? That is our of losing their houses a lot worse than someone losing a fucking baseball game. Let's just bothers me every week that I work. And then I go, it's just everybody works. And you go and you just give these cuts your money. You hand it over like a fucking child, like a child. Well, here, here's the very worst. What the fuck does money even mean anymore? It's not even backed up by anything. That's just based on your confidence. A piece of paper that used to be, uh, what you could claim gold that you can now no longer claim that gold for. The most maddening thing to me is these people that used to work for the sec used to be investigating these big companies and then when they retire they get huge jobs inside these companies. Like how the fuck is that legal? How is that allowed? How you let people profit off of the fact that they build some sort of a relationship with these big fucking financial institutions that are raping the public and taking

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       all this buyout money and paying off their fucking executives giant bonuses while they lost billions and they're paying these guys 40 million, 30 million like what is going on? How was this? It's like, oh and robbery in front of everyone's eyes.

Speaker 5:          02:07:49       I feel like they're in tight, but it isn't because nobody liked. They just Bam, Brittany Spears shaved her head.

Speaker 1:          02:07:56       Yeah, we're bombing Libya. Folks were bombing Libya. Do not pay attention to the hundred mile long streak of oil that we just knew. We discovered in the Gulf. You hear that there's a new fucking oil spill in the Gulf, a new one, a giant 100 miles long. 20 miles from the other one. Yeah. I was in like a second floor

Speaker 5:          02:08:13       core into conspiracy theory in that type of shift for about a year and a half. And then I just said, fuck it. I got a great girl and getting a dog. I don't got shit. I got, I got sick, I got a dog for you. If you want a dog, no dogs a whore or don't take his dog in mind. Dogs are serious slut. My dog. I actually, I finally, if we worked with a trainer and we got it now, it's all cool. And he came. How long did, how long did it take for? The check was wrong. Six months. Six months. And did they train at your house? When did you drop was I was a psycho and like, no, seriously, like dogs, dogs, they feed off of your fucking energy. So you know, I'd watch games, I slammed the table, you know, and I just, it just in general that fucking the same energy that I had when I was a kid, man, we had these little west Highland terriers, like we turned them into maniacs. This one. You really didn't think bit me in my face. I had to get fucking see, chill. You beat the kids. What do you do? A, we would fuck with it. We didn't know any better meet the dogs. No, we didn't beat him. We just thought piece of play the glove game. The glove like a uh, like a baseball glove. Fucking wrestle with, I'll get to it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:09:12       See Price. It's like we're on fucking $10,000 pyramid. Fucking Christ. Uh, a gardener's glove

Speaker 5:          02:09:22       and we were just fucking them in the face and then he started biting too hard and be like Fox, then moved onto the boat. We didn't realize we turned it into a fucking maniac. We basically, any psychologists who wanted to see how fucked up my family was, all we would have to do is walk in, look at the dog and be like, wow. It's cause the trickle down effect. It's like what was happening to us as kids. We did to each other and then everybody did it to the fucking dog.

Speaker 1:          02:09:45       This house, this house was, I sh I gotta be careful how I say this because they were nice people, but the woman was a very hot and a little bit older, but you know, still hot like in a MILF way and but super controlling. And the man was just like this sort of a meek guy who happened to be rich and the woman had these fucking dogs and this woman was a mean lady. She was me. She would yell at her husband in front of us and she had these dogs that which fucking snap at everybody. They would bite people a bit like three different people in the ground people. And I grew up with dogs. I grew up in the pit bulls pit bulls. My, my whole life I had crazy dogs. So I saw these dogs and they came running up to me like when I was in the house and the dogs got right up to the mountain, what's going on guys? I'm gonna get my hand. And then she goes, this is incredible. They don't let anyone touch them. They would pay your throat out by this time. Okay, great. Owner and I'm like, fuck is wrong with you. You've

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       got these crazy animals live in you. They want to tear people's throats out. When you invite them in your house and you come into my house, let them come up to you. Yeah, you come to my house and I go, hey, there's just say hi Johnny. Johnny will come over wagging his tail. You pet him, he'll kiss your face this cause he recognizes you as a friend. You're, you're in this group of Nice people. The fuck is really, that's a, that's an indicative of a creepy person, right. I was just fucking wound up. So the dog, they feed off the fucking energy. So the dog started getting wound up and then it started growing and people on the street and then I got nervous. So then the dog would sense my nervous system will growl a little bit, fucking more. And it just, it just built.

Speaker 5:          02:11:09       And then I would be terrified walking down the street with the thing and the dog. And in the meanwhile is the dog would come up on the couch whenever it wants. It's just sort of running shit. And I didn't know any of that shit. But so we undid all of that. Now the dog is totally fucking cool. People come over, it's wagging its tail and it all had to do with uh, the way you were applying with the energy that the, I mean no I didn't do any of that, that rough housing with the dog, but the dog I've been doing in my act is even if you rough house with a dog, you got to bring their energy back down to being chill. You can't have them if this heightened fucking thing. Right. And then walk outside cause they fucking, especially like pit bulls, that thing, if you own one, you have to address the fact that you fucking own a dangerous breed because people just said, Nah, she's the most lovable, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Speaker 5:          02:11:52       It's like yeah. And also has ability to rip somebodies face off. So I was having like panic attacks. Like if this thing I've a bit, somebody called like nerve damage of fucked up their face. Oh Deonte Deonte beyond getting sued. It's the level of guilt I would have had. So you know, uh, I knew, you know, a couple people who had pit bulls and they took him to this guy and they just did a great job. But it was literally, it was six fucking months of uh, in your house or did they not know he took the dog, first of all, I took the dog for six months and then you get it back a half a year later. He's still so shocking. That dog, he had him for like a month. No, he had it for a month and electrode the same, should they did the data into your oma putting neglect Trojans asshole?

Speaker 5:          02:12:29       No, no. He had it for a fucking month. The whole month. It's great. Yeah as well. Cause you got to chill the fuck out because I've got this because uh, yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't cheap but it was way cheaper than getting the living shit out of me and him being guilt and fill in the guilt. So we went through all of that bullshit and now the dog is just like, it's, it's cool as hell. He just trains it all day every day. Now it's like, well, the funny thing is it's like the dog. The second he's around him and we're removed from the equation, it goes back and he's chilling. He's in control and instantly was fine. The dog was instantly did, the problem was was us. We didn't know. And now we were all fucking scared. Anytime you would come over, all right, you just blah blah. And everything I was doing was fucking wrong. And it just kept, it just kept building the experience, which would add to my paranoia. So it just became a really bad situation. But the second he went over with him, you know, he was fine. He was walking in with dogs. Everything was cool. He had to learn like a cause. It's walking into a totally new environment, new set of rules. We were gone. It didn't feel like it had to protect

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       anybody. So the dog was instantly fine. What he had to do was undo us. It had nothing to do with the dog. It was us four a. And the reason why it took six months was cause I'm on the road every other fucking weak ones. Like would they, the whole family grew from that experience? I think so. I go from offering it. It was awesome. It's very romantic. It's good that there's someone out there that can do that, man, because there's a lot of people that would say, I wish it was cheaper because there's a lot of people with fucking dangerous dogs. There's a guy who lives down the street from me. His pit bulls are always out and he's like, oh, they're nice. They're friendly. Like get the fuck Outta here, man. To, I've had pit bulls, I've had a bunch of them. They don't like other dogs.

Speaker 3:          02:14:05       If somebody else's dogs lose too, like you didn't have a dead dog in the street. It depends on, it really depends on like if we wanted to get another dog, we would have to, as a female, we'd have to get a male and you have to get a pop in so they would have a mother. So relationship. Absolutely right. You do it that way. You don't, you don't bring in another female. Yeah, like my dog. Just it's personality. It's not the kind of dog that you want to walk with other dogs. Very possessive, very jealous. So it's something you have to keep in con, but they're just like people, they have different personalities where I'm fucking a wound up psycho. There's another guy who's just totally fucking chill and wouldn't have had a problem with the dog. The dog would have become a chill dog.

Speaker 3:          02:14:41       Yeah. Do they do that show you're watching a game and some band? What do, what the fuck? And then like they come up like, yeah dude, what the fuck? You know, they start getting into that mode and then if you have a dog that's, you know, bred to fight in a pit, it's red show. It's amazing that you could just buy that. And then people, I mean they're great dogs, they're super friendly and super sweet that you can go down to a shelter and they just, it's like just giving somebody a gun. You don't even know what ended the bullet comes in other than the guns, like given him a monster to giving them a wild monster that's going to be your buddy. You know, you didn't even speak English. She didn't even tell him, listen, you can't eat kids. He can't even fucking tell him shit.

Speaker 3:          02:15:14       Do you understand? I have a bank account and this is how your dog, how about you shouldn't fucking kill people. He'd be a nice doggy, you know, that's the end. See on the fucking show, dude, I can't believe this. He careful with pit bulls two hours, two and a half hours. We went on for a long time. But you know what, it's always, uh, it's always fun to have you on Bro. You're, you're hilarious. Your phone number stories I didn't even, hype is a means of buddies of mine made a, a short film and we just got into the Tribeca film festival. Really? It was it called cheat? Cheat. Yeah. What's it about me, Joe de Rosa and Robert Kelly. Joe, Bobby Kelly asked me to write an article or other, um, uh, uh, a chapter because you got, I guess you guys are going to do a book on it now.

Speaker 3:          02:15:55       That story, something to go along with. That book came out of that. Uh, yeah, it's been this, it's been this great thing. So, you know, we wrote it and shot at ourselves about a year ago and finally, you know, started submitting it to festivals. So we're in that thing. So we're all really excited about. Nice. So when can people see it? Uh, while they can see it at the festival if you live anywhere around there. Uh, but then afterwards that we're striking back at film festival is in Tribeca, New York and Manhattan and a there'll be a, I think it's April 20th through like May 3rd and then afterwards it will be available for DVD or what you're going to try to get it? We haven't got to that point

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       yet. Yeah, I don't know how that works. This is the first thing we've ever done. So, uh, how many minutes is it like 1515 film.

Speaker 4:          02:16:36       So do you think you would put it online and have it available online or how would a, what would you do afterwards? I have no idea. So it's cool. Would, where would, what started this just started talking and

Speaker 5:          02:16:47       yeah, I don't want to give away, like, I don't want to give away the movie, but basically it was one of those deals where it was like three comedians sitting around there was a fucking problem and we just started brainstorming on it and somebody was like, dude, this is a movie. And then we, I know we just fucking sat down and wrote it and then, uh, awesome. Yeah, it was really cool. Now it's one of the best times I ever had because we just put the money up ourselves and shot at ourselves and afterwards we were trying to figure out why we had such a great fucking time and it's like, oh yeah, there was no industry going. Why doesn't he wear like a red shirt and he can be like a plumber.

Speaker 4:          02:17:18       Well you that you were there for the Chapelle show. Did you get to experience any of them? You are on a regular on that show, right?

Speaker 5:          02:17:24       I know I, I wasn't on the second season, I was becoming a regular, I only did five sketches, but I just ended up being in five of the huge ones, the racial draft, the world series of dice. Even like the Sam Jackson wanted somebody that everybody loves. And all I did was I just sat there and got yelled at so easy. I just took cotton and stuck it in my ear and just let, let them yell. And he was, and he was absolutely hilarious. But as far as why the show stopped and all that time, I mean, I'm as much in the dark as a, as you go. I do know that he was going out and trying to do with shows and everybody was, you know, he couldn't get a word out. Yeah, yeah. You know what, that's my couch, motherfucker. They believe all of that shit. So he, you know, I have no idea. But what I think is cool about it is that you just have to killer fucking seasons, you know, air tight to get back to that expression rather than, you know, there's, there's certain shows that they probably should acquit five seasons in and they just kept making them.

Speaker 4:          02:18:20       I think if you gave Dave a ton of weed and let them do whatever the fuck he wanted to do, he would keep cranking them out our, oh yeah, he's perfect for that shit. That blind racist that was accidentally blind Klu Klux Klan Guy. That was accident blackout. That was at first, what was it? Which one was that called? What was the name of this catch? Clayton Bigsby. Yeah. God Damn, that was brilliant. Fucking brilliant. Yeah. They just need to leave that guy alone. When I did the fear factor sketch with him, he was telling me that they were, they were trying to tell him like how many times he could say nigger and he couldn't say nigger. And you got to stop saying this to stop saying that. And you know.

Speaker 5:          02:18:55       Well what happens is, is I think when something becomes a success, then everybody wants to try and get that stink on it. So that can be like I was the guy who said to put the desk over there and blow. Rather than you just go on like, hey, you're killing it. Just keep whatever that, whatever the fuck you doing. Cause I know like, like they, they thought that uh, somebody on the show read me that the industry notes for that, uh, I'm Rick James Bitch sketch and they, the overall thing was basically, this is just a series of things that aren't really funny. Like they, they didn't get what was going on. Like I remember when, uh, when they were

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       doing that, Neal, I lived like a like, I dunno, like, like I could walk up to where they were editing the thing. And when they did the Rick James thing, like Neil called me up, he's like, dude, you got to come up here and check this thing out. I don't think we can talk to shit. And I remember walking in there dying laughing for like the first four minutes. And I was just in awe. I was like, dude, this is the greatest, that's the greatest fucking sketch of all time ever. That shows the greatest gift show of all time. Nothing even comes close. Nothing comes close. I'll send her and love, can't fuck with that. No, no. Shows can fuck with that. Yeah. If I ever had that laugh reading quality as far as like social commentary and then just like ridiculous, like silliness of the show when fucking depressed because it kills me. That fucking kills me too, is that he's like, he's doing stand up and he like, you know, he'll announce on Thursday, he's going to show at cobb's on Friday and I'll do two shows and play bongos for five hours. You know, it's like, I wish that guy was like putting out specials, you know, when she was putting out DVDs and shit. You know, I meet him twice in the last month. What have you done would you say on the comedy store, which is on that the parlor. And I saw him at the comedy store.

Speaker 9:          02:20:26       Uh, it's interesting the, the direction he's going, he's kind of going into more of a, where it seems really organic, uh, talking to the audience and stuff like that. But with bits kind of mixed in so you don't even realize you're getting doing like he's doing standup on you. So it's weird. It's really weird. And then he had some guys come up and play music and he was like, I kind of doing like singing and rapping at points and stuff like that. But again, it felt like it wasn't planned. It felt like you were getting a show that no one else got to see. Right. But then I talked to a couple of the other mic, uh, comics and they're like, oh no, no, this is, if you see a couple of these, you'll see that this is exactly what is act is now. Wow. And it was kind of interesting. I liked it. I thought it was cool.

Speaker 3:          02:21:10       I was entertained. He pissed off. A lot of people have jobs because he's doing like these five hour sets and wait, staff's going fucking nuts, dude. That's like do two shows and do like three hours, three and a half hours in what Dan was some lamps. I mean how many fucking, I don't know. It's him. And I remember when Dan Cook tried to top that and he like fucking stayed on stage for like eight hours or something crazy. Was it seven? So that what it is. And by the way, the Guinness Book of World Records is ridiculous because there's always some retard out there with nothing to lose, especially when it comes to standup comedy. Who the fucking get define what standup comedy. You can get some complete sociopath to stand on stage for three days in a row and just shit himself and, and piss all over the fucking stage.

Speaker 3:          02:21:50       And then he wins. Flagpoles yeah, that's both. Stay up there. They, you know what they should be, there should be some like laugh meter and once you just start running out of jokes and just said [inaudible] the lights go out of the house on a minutes where you can play with the crowd. Yeah. A certain amount of times you can say, so what else is going on? I guess you just get like a red flag and it's just like, dude, this isn't stand up zero airplanes through there. Yeah. It's like, it would be funny if the less you laughed, the last the audience laughed, the brighter the lights in the room got. Yeah. You know, and to let you know when all the lights are on and the show's not dark anymore. It's like, it's like can get off like a video game. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like that guitar hero

Speaker 9:          02:22:26       starts going, Huh, your spotlight dims your spotlight dems and the audience gets brighter. Yeah. So if people want to listen to a bill, Bill also has a great podcast called the Monday morning podcast that's available on iTunes and it's not on stitcher anymore. Right. You pull it off stitcher. Yeah, I took it off. Yeah. So it's not a lot of controversy with the stitcher APP. Yeah. They just saw that apparently people are getting stitcher and I back it up 100% I think it's fucking awesome. Be able to go in your car and just have, be able to choose podcasts and listen to them automatically, you know, streaming kind of problem I had, they just took mine, never told me, and then was selling advertising and they will make and fucking money. Whoa. Which is, yeah, that's not fucking cool. So that's illegal to sue them to stop.

Speaker 9:          02:23:12       And then they sent me an offer, which is hilarious. It's like someone stole your, your fucking car and then you show up guy and give him my car back. Like, hey look, I put some rims on it. You know, you want a piece of that. It's like, yeah, well apparently there's a big move to get off of it. Marin was talking to me about it yesterday and Greg Fitzsimmons called me about it and Greg Fitzsimmons at the same situation that you had when they put it shut off. So he said it was a lot of people that are going to cut me in on the average of what about all the money you've already made off for the fucking thing. He didn't get you. Yeah, exactly. Like that Internet thing. We're just like, hey, you know everybody can take everybody's shit. I don't think there's a problem with that.

Speaker 9:          02:23:44       Brian [inaudible] free content and they're selling advertisement on it now. I have no problem with it. How come? Because they're offering or the service they're offering. Lift My, if my listeners want to drive around and be able to stream my show, I'm not offering that on my website. So let them do it and I offered online. How do you drive around? You have to throw it on mine. On dream it. You can stream it off of your mobile phone. No, you can go to iTunes and I like look at, look it. This is the thing about what I'm saying though. You can't do that. You if you, if you're driving in your car right now and you were like, I want to listen to Joe Rogan's podcast from four weeks ago. You're streaming something that I created, you got to kick me money for that. You just take not just streaming that.

Speaker 9:          02:24:20       That'd be like if I started a radio station and I started playing it, but let me finish and I didn't pay anybody. I didn't play any of the musicians, but they're not putting advertising in the show. Yeah, they are. Nope. I listened to stream of that. I showed you miss, why are they coming to the website? They're not, they're not putting advertising in the show, not adding. Know that they're not adding ads in the shorter guy saying that they are. Because I think on stitchers website where like on the Apps, they have advertising and they're getting all these hits cares about that because, because they're making money on my stuff. Do. People aren't going to the website to just just sit there and listen to, to streaming. They're going, they're listening to content. It's like, dude, it's like a fucking network. Yeah. But if they let me finish, you have a production house and they make shows and to p, it's not like, oh, I have a TV show, so I'm just going to show you a TV show.

Speaker 9:          02:25:07       I'm not gonna pay any of the creators of the show. I don't have a problem with them or with what they're doing. But you don't just take it and not pay somebody. That's true. Yeah. You're gonna. If you're gonna make money off of it, you have to kick somebody some money. And how even you use youtube, whenever you have a, that gets a lot of hits, they offer you, you know, you can, Hey, you can sell ads on this and we'll give you money. I mean, I gotta offers on my videos all the time. I'm not saying like what their business model is not a bad thing. It's the way they went about it. It's like if they said, hey listen, I want to put, if they approached me first and said, listen, we got this great model, it's gonna allow people to listen to streaming the thing or whatever and you know, we're gonna, we're gonna advertise, we're going to kick you some money.

Speaker 9:          02:25:48       Fine, but don't just start doing it and making money. Then out of nowhere, I find out about it like six months later, a year later after you've made all that money and then I'm like, what the fuck? And I go to take it off and now that I'm taking it off, now you're going to offer me money. That's fucked up. That's not how you do business. You could also think of it this way though, to stream stitcher has their own community as strip stickers, like a Facebook or a Twitter, and so when they, when you have a show on there, they're also introducing you to their whole community. You have to ask. I know, but what if I'm signed on for is you're making it seem like stitcher is this entity that is amazing that people are just going to sit there and stare at stitcher. Well, it's, they're going there for the content.

Speaker 9:          02:26:28       I know. I'm not saying that they don't provide a service and I'm not saying any of that, but for them to take my shit and just put it up there and make money off of it, I'm not saying that they have to give me 100% of the money. I'm saying you just can't just, you can't just, you can't just take his stuff and copy it and then start selling ads on it on your thing. You can't do that. Well, I agree. But you have thought sue. He can say no, I know, but listen, I listened. They also like as an example, stitcher is now putting in all the brand new Fords and also with a couple of other car dealer or companies have now added Stitcher as inside there, uh, cars now. Why? Because now it's where they're moving away from Sirius radio and Xm radio until Internet connected because of the content and the amount of hits that they're getting.

Speaker 9:          02:27:10       And that has nothing to do with stitcher. That has to do with Joe Rogan's fucking hilarious. Greg Fitzsimmons fucking hilarious. Mark Marin is doing these great pot. That's why people are going there. I guess to me, um, if I, if I could have my shit fucking in every single Ford car that people can listen to and it's a, it's a part of the car now. She was like, you know, what's your choice? You're pitching, you're pitching what people on that side too, which is the pimp game where they talk about the exposure and all this great exposure and then the only way for us to make money off of the exposures are people going to your shows and people buy your cds. Yeah. Let me finish. I still have to get on a fucking plane and fly to Kansas City. While that was motherfuckers get to sleep in their own bed, they don't have to leave. You know what I mean? No, Huh?

Speaker 9:          02:27:54       What I'm saying? That's what's you're acting like you're acting eats toast. No, wait. What you're saying is, is your, your, your, your, your debt. That bullshit where artists get paid in exposure is the big pimp game in fucking Hollywood. It's this character. They have you changed. We're going to stick you on this. We're not going to give you any fucking money, but everybody's going to hear this and then you're going to go to Kansas City and Jesus Christ, the whole, you're going to play with a fucking royals play. Meanwhile, they're making all this fucking money. Well that's the kind of you, and you got to be like fucking what it would dif. You got to fucking pack up and go fly out to go get your money. They're sitting at home raking in all this shit and this is the thing. You are providing the fucking content.

Speaker 9:          02:28:40       They're providing the service so they should get paid for the service. You should get paid for your content. That's all I'm saying. This should be a business, Mary. If you just don't take the fucking content. If your content with some money free already though, your content for free on iTunes. Yeah, but you can't put it on your own application. That's, which is my choice. It on iTunes and I have, and I have the choice. I have the choice to decide. My podcast is fucking free. I could sit there and I could decide if I want to charge money for it, but dude, it's mine. It's mine and it's my decision. It's not yours to just fucking take. And then because you know, I've been busting my ass and work on this thing for fucking three years and everybody wants to go see it and now you just take it and make a ton of fucking money off him and you don't even tell me.

Speaker 9:          02:29:22       Didn't call me on. I don't think that they're making a shitload of money at all. I don't have stitchers. It's not really making a shit. It doesn't matter if they're making $2 you have to give me one, but you can't just do so I just make money off people's stuff. You're, you're pretending that they're not selling content. They have a dream. I listened to my shit on stitcher everyday. I've never heard of ad once. Okay, so it's not seeing the ads. The ads are on the, there's no ads playing during my, on my podcast. There's No ads before or after my podcast. So to me saying no problem with stitcher and they're not making any money off me directly. Okay. That's you. But I see, I don't know how we're buying it. How you're saying that they're making money or anything. I opened the stitch up right house, open up, stitch it.

Speaker 9:          02:30:00       Right now I find my pint that they do those people ads for free. You're confused. Like you listen to a radio station. Let Brian Finish. Let me do they have listened to a radio. I don't remember every hearing or seeing one SME. Listen to me. All right. Okay. When you listen to a radio station, they don't play an ad during a song, but you listened to the radio station because the play in the kind of music you want to listen to. That's why. Are you listening to duty? Yeah, I'm listening. So that's why if you play a band song on the fucking radio, the band gets paid. Okay? You get paid. Do you want to stay in that are saying that there's no ads on this? So, so I'm going to comedy right now. I'm typing in comedy. Now I'm going to comedians. Here's comedians right up here.

Speaker 9:          02:30:44       Now there's a a little banner that pops up the very bottom, but best make some money. Does squad him at the very top little banner, various money. I know, but Facebook makes money off of you, but you're on Facebook. Are you going to sue Facebook and pull off your stuff on Facebook that makes shitloads wait a hold up. And he had a blog and they copied his blog entries and put it on Facebook. Then started selling advertising show. You chose to be on Stitcher, right? No, I didn't ask. You know, didn't I? That's the whole point of what he's saying. Brian is that high. I chose to be on Facebook and I choose what I put to go to put up. I did not choose to be on Stitcher, stitcher took my shit and put it. See No advertisement before this is me talking. Okay.

Speaker 9:          02:31:26       Brian, he's targeting. Yeah, Dude. It's like I'm trying to make, I'm trying to explain it. We had it right there and you're so convinced of your argument. I mean, if you're totally conviction of argument, I'll just stop right now. No, I don't think you understand a lot of like the Internet, like I understand that you don't want your MP three on here so you can tell them, yes, I don't want you on here, but stitcher is not like selling advertisements during your show. They're doing, they're pretty much doing what it's available. You want them to give you this free. I already read on the Internet. I answered this like three minutes ago. You're just not listening to me. You're not listening to me. I realize that they're not playing it during it. I said, when you listen to a radio station, they play ACDC back in black.

Speaker 9:          02:32:02       They don't play a wool light commercial in the middle of it, but in between the songs they advertise and the amount of listeners that are radio station gets is not because of the commercials. It's because of the music that is there. The artists that put that out there that that's why that the bands get played. They get a portion of the advertising. That's how business is done. I don't have a problem with that. I would love to be on stitcher if they did it the right way. If they approached me and said, listen, this is what we're doing. We're going to sell advertising. We're making this amount of money, we're going to kick you that. I would've done it in a second, but the thing is they just took my podcasts and all my listeners who go on there because they like what I do and then they made money off of that because inbetween on the side of their website and that shit that you saw at the bottom, they're making money off of that and they didn't kick me any money until you got, you got caught.

Speaker 9:          02:32:50       And I said, does keep people from getting it off of iTunes. It's definitely the only negative part about it in my opinion, is that it takes a hurts your iTunes, the numbers, but like as any single website that you used people, if you give something out for free on the Internet, you can consider stitcher to be just an MP, three player. Right. And, and, and any application on here. And I was like, at different numbers, they're making money off of it. Look, I put it out there and everybody downloads it and it's for free. Right. But the second you take it and you start making money off of it, it's the same way. Like if you see both of your points, I see both of your points. I do see Brian's point that he did pull up the application and the only ad was this little tiny ass banner that I'm making money off of that.

Speaker 9:          02:33:32       Yeah, you could say that. That might be just enough to keep your sites growing. How much money you think that little banner, how much, how much does the APP, let me ask you this dude. How do you, how do you run a business? The Free App, how do you run a business that makes no money? Because they are selling their programs at to put companies like Ford. So now you buy a Ford and they have a stitch you up in there. So it's like a serious rate. No. And why is for getting in business with them? Because the s the future of radio is podcasting. It's not satellite radio. It's not [inaudible] is the thing. Yeah but I'm doing a podcast. How come for doesn't come to me? He came to these guys cause they stuck them all together and it's because of all the hits that Joe gets.

Speaker 9:          02:34:10       All the fans that I have, all the fans at, all these people have these guys stuck it all into one, but they should have come to us and said this is we want to do and get in business with us. You just don't hijack everybody shit and then stick it on there. Start selling advertising banners on the bottom and then getting contracts with Ford because they're looking at their website, they're seeing all the hits that they won't get an RSS feed. What you have when you have a podcast, so you have an RSS feed. What that RSS feed means is that every single thing you're letting everyone you want to play your MP three players. So there's websites that will grab your RSS feed and just and put it on their website. That's what ours says. You're sharing it. You're giving me for free. Right.

Speaker 9:          02:34:49       But this is the thing is still count one a load from an RSS feed counts. The big argument is a Twitter, you know, or rather then then take the free thing and then start making money off it. You have to pee. It's common as business. There's business one on one. You have to pay the person. If I'm giving away for free, you can just take it. You can't just go out. Well, maybe they tried to do it this way and just stitcher also has a way to to pay their artists now. They had a pay thing. Now they've started a couple of, a couple of months ago. Bill was right when I was saying they should have come to me and say, listen, we'd like your podcast. We've seen you're getting this amount of hits. We want to put it on here. We have some advertising and we'll kick you some of it.

Speaker 9:          02:35:27       Dude, I would be on stitcher. I haven't done that to you. Never. You sure? Oh yeah, he's positive, bro. You can. They'd come to me. They've come to me to do it. Two months ago they came to me too. I allowed them to think. [inaudible] never came to me. They never came to him. They never put it into me. They just took my shit. See, that's the thing. If they came to me, I would've, I would've, I wouldn't have had a problem. Our pocket, our podcast is fake, came to me when my lawyer sent him a cease and desist and then they go, oh, you want, what if we gave your percentage of this money that we've been making? Hmm. Now if it had nothing to do with my podcast, they wouldn't have offered me that. The, I think a precedent has

Speaker 4:          02:36:00       established once and it becomes really profitable. And right now it's not. And I totally agree with you that you can't take your stuff and just put it up there without asking and then put advertisement on the application. Even if it's indirectly, you know, if there's a certain amount of ads that you know, you, you just get every time you go to stitcher, but one podcast gets a, you know, a really high number of downloads, like your Monday morning podcast does. Well that's, you're, you're selling that, you're selling the Monday morning podcast. That's what you're selling when you're advertising. You know, I, I totally get that. But the way, the way I look at podcasting in the first place is, um, I want, I agree that it's good to have, you know, sponsors that pay for things and you can, you know, you could, you know, make money off the show and it's good. It's good to get paid for someone downloading it and listening to it. But for me what's important is that people get it. That's what's important for me. It's important that it is the reason why it's free on my website as well as free unused stream as well as free on iTunes as well as on stickers.

Speaker 9:          02:36:58       Yeah. USTREAM is making shit off of it right now.

Speaker 4:          02:37:01       I don't have a problem with that. I mean they have to pay for bandwidth. They take care of us and I

Speaker 9:          02:37:05       don't, to be honest with you, I don't know. I like Youtube. I found out that [inaudible] no, you streaming the video. It's, we're doing this right now. This is not right. No, I don't, I don't do video. I don't do video a youtube account, but this is the most, I'm actually

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       trying to get advertising on, on a, on my website. I mean, I mean all my podcasts, I don't have a problem with that, but this is like, this is, this is, this is the game of this business where it's like the artist's does the work and then the, the business guys come in and they give you the fucking Heisman. Right? I mean, I mean it's right through the whole business with those guys. Those guys who made fucking Lord of the rings never got paid. They made $6 billion. They had to sue to get their fucking money. What do you mean go look it up? They got the whole fucking thing though. That was always the lawsuit. Is that one of those things where they have Hollywood type of counting where they show losses, man? Yeah, we have, we had $4 billion in whiteout in 9 billion in, in paper clips.

Speaker 5:          02:37:58       So we're still not in profit and fucking, you know, the director doesn't get paid and yeah, it was a huge fucking lawsuit and they just, they, and then whatever the conglomerate was, they decided that it was cheaper to just get sued. They paid themselves out, then they imploded the thing and just left. And these guys and it was total is totally fucking legal. Wow. It's an interesting thing. The, this whole podcast thing though, isn't it? How, you know, I mean, basically what we're doing right now, as you know, at any moment when we put one of these things out during the week, a quarter million people download this fucking thing. And that's a, that's a big number of human beings that you could just reach on your own. Don't you find that like shows or more packed with like your real fans now than ever before? Do you find that?

Speaker 5:          02:38:41       I find it, it's a combination of doing an opening. Anthony doing morning radio, my specials and my podcast people definitely listened to the podcast and that. And, uh, yeah, no, it's a great way to get out and have people, uh, come out to your shows. But it's, it's one of those things where like, I don't do that shit where I'm getting paid in exposure and you're taking all the fucking money. And then so for the rest of my life, in order for me to get the fruits of my labor, I got to go fly to fucking Tennessee when it's like I'm, I'm doing a fun doing a fucking radio show here. Radio guys don't go on the fucking road for some reason. It just all goes back to, but then when you do your monkey dance, you get paid and it's like, so no value is being put on the fact when you go and don't get money.

Speaker 5:          02:39:26       I see their error in judgment. I see their error in judgment and I see the wooded truant doing is they take something that's already free and they make a device that allows you to get it to people that wouldn't ordinarily get it. But it does when I didn't want it. His point that when I do radio, I'm flying, I'm in there, I fly in there, I do radio and I'm hyping my shows. That's the point of it. My podcast is not hyping my shipping you, my podcast is my radio show. It's my radio show. That's what this is a fucking radio show dude. Right as they call it a pocket. It's my radio show you. I can't just hijack the stern show and the and put it on my site and just start selling advertising and then when he tells me to cease and desist, go, hey, can I let you in on some of this money? And then I go, well Howard, you're fucking huge man. Why don't you go fly and stand on a stage

Speaker 9:          02:40:14       and tell jokes and Kansas City you'll get paid that way. I see what you're saying. Yeah, I see. Like I understand like it's, it's, it becomes an issue. If it takes a while. I would love to be in business, those guys with their exposure, but you just have to do it the right way, dude. You don't just take it and make money and wait till I find out about it and then offer me a cut. I think when you, when it comes to podcast and certain things on the Internet, especially when it comes to RSS feeds, uh, that, that that's just common for the Internet. Like there's companies, there's Zoe now that you're saying though is because this not RSS feeds or you're dealing with, you're dealing with someone copying a thing and then sending it out through an application, which is completely different is RSS feeds.

Speaker 9:          02:40:55       You're going to get an account of every doubt. He is presented the two classic arguments that they do when they fuck artists, they stay talk about exposure, what great exposure this is Nevins and then suddenly let me finish. And then secondly, he did, he did the whole, this is just the way it's done. Like, you know, like when, when a, when a manager hands you that contract with this automatically renews. If I get you one, one thing at the chuckle hut and you say, dude, this is bullshit. And it's like, no, everything's negotiable. You're right. It's negotiable. If you have an RSS feed as an example, if you have something on your ear, you have something on most websites, wordpress, even RSS feed, right. There's programs like there's one called Flipboard on the IPAD. What it, what it does is it collects RSS feeds and it's it repackages.

Speaker 9:          02:41:39       It makes your website kind of look like a magazine, but they sell kind of mix advertising in there, here and there. You know there's, there's, there's programs that do that same thing that stitcher doing except the only thing that stitchers doing is different is taking it off your server, putting it on their server so it doesn't affect your bandwidth. That's a big issue. And it's not affecting the bandwidth. This is my number. I'm not confused. No, you've explained it like three times. Dude, I understand what it is. I know, but they're not directly like, like I'm trying to say is that they're not like these little banner advertisements. Like that's not making millions of dollars. It doesn't matter. But it's making its affecting the downloads from iTunes, which affect his numbers yet. But you can get those numbers from stitcher and if you don't want to be on Stitcher, you can tell them to take you off a stitcher.

Speaker 9:          02:42:21       Yeah. But even if you watch this one, numbers lie and, and I, and I told them and then they fucking obviously, so this is the funny thing, obviously they're making some money if they offered me to stay. Okay. And I also know you can't pay your rent unless you're making money. I'm not saying that those guys are millionaires over there. What I'm saying is that that's not the way you conduct business. That's wrong. That's, you can't do that, man. That's wrong. You can't just take somebody's creative shit and just start making money off of it and not, and not paying them. I don't underst like that. That said, bizarre Internet thing where people feel that because they can, they can see it and they can put it on their site, that they own it and then have the right to do whatever they want with it and make money off it and not paying anybody.

Speaker 9:          02:43:03       I'm not being a dick here too. I'm really not. I'm just, I'm just asking to go about it. I would love to be on stitcher. It in a, in a, in a functional business model. I don't want to be on it where it's just you just fucking swipe it and make money and wait for me to find out about it. Well, one thing you should definitely do is take off your, your podcast off of your RSS feed so that, that, cause you're not only a stitcher doing, that's about probably a hundred different companies are using your RSS feed and your MP3 to make money right now. Okay. So you have to take probably a hundred people daily, over a hundred companies that are using his shit. To me, one of the women, he got things like stitcher. There's so many websites that we'll play your MP three days on it and have banner ever talking about too.

Speaker 9:          02:43:43       We're talking about what's right and wrong. You just basically said, well you busted this drug dealer, there's another hundred drug dealers out there doing it. It's like, I'm not saying that there aren't other people doing it. I'm saying why I'm not on stitcher anymore. Yeah. But what I'm saying is that that's why the RSS means on the Internet. If you're putting out an RSS feed, you're pretty much saying, all right, this is an unprotected work that I am sending out for you guys to have. Yes. Do whatever you want. No, I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that you can then go make money off of it. I'm saying this is free. Here you go. All right, well that's what I'm saying. You to take off your RSS feed off your website, Brian, because they're profiting off the point. I'm not missing the point. I'm not missing quite, that's what an RSS feed is and that's mean that you're pretty much, it's like an intendant advertisement.

Speaker 9:          02:44:25       This is my injuries. What you're doing is you're telling me what I'm thinking, what my intent is. No, no. I'm just saying what an RSS feed is. We know what an RSS feed is. It's just something that allows people to download something. It's an automatic download. You're saying that because I, I was saying that sites that I'm on that, yeah, but you can't sell the advertising. Usually someone's content and sell advertising. I don't know why that's so hard for you to understand. If they're not directly selling content advertising towards your content. They're there. That's what I'm saying. Like the, the RSS feeds. There's websites that are playing his MP3 right now. Gone there but you don't even know. It's like, I don't know exactly when you're using you're shitty logic. They're selling advertising and they're, they're using [inaudible] radio so you don't put on the radio station because of the fucking advertising.

Speaker 9:          02:45:13       It's the bands that bring you there. Like these guys play the music I want. That's why the bands get play. People are going to stitch here so you have a problem with youtube too. Then do you have videos on Youtube? This is one of these guys like this. This is going to be those guys where it's just like you can't make a point because he's RSS feeds are already thinking of his next point and he just wants to be right. No, I'm just saying what the west with RSF seats, if you don't want your shit like distributed and like made money off, like you don't have an RSS feed on your website. Rss Feed for your website is for other websites to grab and use your content for. No, it's not. It's to get shit vacations. No, it's the download shit for free. It's, it's something that allows you to keep up with people as they put out podcasts. [inaudible],

Speaker 9:          02:45:52       stitcher does stitcher grabs your RSS feed and repackages no, it doesn't dry out your MP three you're wrong and it gets your MP three and then sends it out through its own application. [inaudible] top 100% wrong and, but there's no way to convince them because he's, he's totally of his argument. Okay. Yeah, it totally convinced of it, Brian. The point is they're not saying you're a bad person down at yourself. You cannot listen. You use the youtube argument and it's a shitty argument and here's why. If, if fucking youtube was stealing bill burrs shit and putting it on Youtube and then selling ads, that would work. That would be like, Hey, what the fuck? You can't have bill [inaudible] but youtube is fans. It's some kid in Nebraska that things bill bursts hilarious and he watches his special on comedy central and he takes his computer and he edits or 10 minute chunk and he throws it up on Youtube and then she had been to John with exact no problem.

Speaker 9:          02:46:44       That's completely different. It's bad enough when I have a DVD coming out in the second, somebody sees it, then they put it on that. But I understand now it's like, okay, the DVD thing is over now. Like I get that thing but this, this is where the problem comes is you then take my content, okay and then start advertising off of it and you don't fucking pay me. That's the thing. I understand that my shit's going to end up on on the Internet and people are going to get it for free and that's just the way things are now. I don't have a problem with that. The, the, the big fucking hurdle is when you take it and then you start making money on application, then have as you start making money off your arguments completely. Yeah. There's a reason why they came back to me when I took it down and, and offered me a cut and there's a reason why they didn't want me to take it down because I have listeners who go there and when they go there, they see the ad and they read it.

Speaker 9:          02:47:35       And in the advertising world, that means while we get enough guys looking at it, they're going to fucking buy something. But if they're going there because they like your podcasts or they're like my podcast, that's, that's why they have to kick you a little bit of money. [inaudible] people want to say shit. I'm not saying like their website is fucking awesome the way they do business is not in the youtube argument that the thing about youtube that's crazy as the, even though the kids are putting bill burrs podcast or bill burrs a, you know, standup mp3s or clips from a movie, that's funny. They're getting sued by all these people that own that switch. I wouldn't let the kids hold down. That's one of those things where if stitcher wasn't making any money and just want to fucking throw it out there, I wouldn't give a shit.

Speaker 9:          02:48:13       It's the fact that you're making money off my podcast. You've got to give me some money. Those kids who take my my specials and put them all over the fucking youtube, I love it. That's fucking great. I have no problem with that. If they were somehow figured out a way to make money, you have to fucking pay me a certain portion and I respect the fact that you come up with the business model that makes that, cause I don't have the business model, but you still, you know the content is the model of start charging for your podcast. What's that? The model is you start charging for your podcast. What do you mean? That's pretty much how you have to, if that is or if you protect yourself and protect your MBA real. I want to have that of ads. That's what I want to have.

Speaker 9:          02:48:51       But when I've had on a chart and I don't want to have somebody take my podcast and, and have advertising around it and that type of shit and make money, not tell me they take on my podcast, earn money and not give me any of the money. That's all I'm saying. I don't have any problem. I, I'm, I would love to be in business with those guys. Like if they just, if they fucking did it the right way, they didn't. So I just had them take it down. I mean it's just normal business. Yeah. I mean I think eventually that there's, everybody has got saying that eventually I won't be back up on stitcher cause they already offered me something. But what I'm saying, the reason why I took it down because what they did was not right. That's just not how you do business. It's stealing.

Speaker 4:          02:49:28       I agree. I agree. Our situation's totally different. I, uh, agreed to be on stitcher cause my, my, uh, my way of looking at it is I just want more people to get the podcast and are only advertisement that we have is by the fleshlight. And I have no idea. I mean, having them on Stitcher, in my opinion, that's good for the fleshlight is good for that.

Speaker 9:          02:49:47       Then people who want to read or they what they want to sell advertising and on my podcast and they want to do a 50, 50 split. And I'm like, dude, that sounds cool. My feeling is that I'm going to happen,

Speaker 4:          02:49:57       bring in my own advertisers, you know, and I've got some other people that I'm looking at as far as advertisers. It's gotta be something that I think is valid some, and I'm just going to have him just advertise the podcast and you can put it wherever the fuck you want, man. Put it anywhere. I don't care. What's important to me is that it gets out there, which is exactly how I did these shows in Gotham, in uh, in New York this weekend. And I had fucking four hours sleep in two days. I mean, I was exhausted and I had to do two shows, but the fucking crowds were so good. It was so intense, man. And when I asked them like, how many you guys listen to the podcast? It was like fucking 99% it was crazy. Like it's, it's an audience of podcast fans now. It's, it's, it's a totally different audience, which it's not just stand up fans or not just fans of, of, of, you know, of um, MMA, UFC fans. It's people that are fucking fans of the podcast. And so it's, to me it's invaluable and the most important thing is that the most people possible can get it for free. But I completely see your argument and I think you're absolutely right to be upset that someone downloaded your stuff. And even if it's just a little pop up banner, if you're making money off that, it's the same as the youtube argument. You know, you have to,

Speaker 9:          02:51:04       well, and this is the thing about it was unless somebody told me it was on there, I was never going to know. Right. Because they didn't come to me.

Speaker 4:          02:51:12       Right. Yeah. That's not cool. It's just be, it would be just as if youtube came and sorted, download your stuff off TV and putting it online. Well, Hey, he was on TV. It was free. But no, it had ads on TV and you know, now you're just putting it in this list.

Speaker 9:          02:51:23       It does. The thing that the, the, the big hurdle is when you start making money off of my shit. Yeah. That's the thing. But it's like if people see me on TV and they download, they put it up there. I don't give a fuck if you don't make time players and make some money off windows media player makes money off your shirt just by playing your stuff. You know all this crap. Is this like just how the Internet works and how the Internet works ads while you're stepping up in Windows Media Player, there's advertising all evidence. Windows Media Player, it's banners was playing and stuff. No, no, no. You, you windows media player can only download some. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:51:54       That's readily available for free and you play it from somewhere. You have to download a file and then play it on windows

Speaker 9:          02:52:00       and it's providing a service. Like I can already have people listen to my shit. Don't stop on on stitcher. They can listen to what Brian let him know and he had a can't explain RSS feeds thought you explained it 100,000 times. We know exactly. You're saying do it and you don't understand that you should get paid for your work. You don't get that for some reason. You feel like like when I, when I give it out for free now that you shouldn't Brian, they're making money off something that's available for free. You can't do that. You can't make money off. Someone's constantly got money.

Speaker 9:          02:52:30       Let's go, let's go. Let's go this route. I mean, why are you [inaudible] I'm trying not to [inaudible] up attitude man. I understand that NFL football on fucking NBC, I watch NFL football. I'm not allowed to record that and then go send the fucking game up to other people and make money off of it, out for free and then the that they do give it out for features of player is a player player RSS feeds and advice. Stop repeating yourself. That's why I'm trying to fucking stop talking. What you say has already been refuted by both of us. We both know what an RSS feed is. We both know football is free on network teachers not selling stitcher. Listen to bill. Birds get come here and listen to his podcast. The Fuck Day are there selling gaming God player out that collects RSS feed in place and making money.

Speaker 9:          02:53:21       No reason why Adam Carolla Greg Fitzsimmons. Everybody wants to pull their shit off of it. There's no reason if everyone's crazy because everyone's crazy that they're making my iTunes numbers. It hurts their iTunes numbers would cost them money and advertisement. That's a big deal. You're telling us what we're thinking. I've been telling you for 45 bucks why I take it off, but it's not like stitcher is making money off of your podcast and selling you into their their servers. They're giving a free player out and that's all it is. A free player sell Brian. Huh? What does a free player have on it? A collects RSS feeds off the Internet. Stop, stop, stop. This RSS talk, what is it like a podcast, podcasts and his podcasts. Flex arts as feet but as podcast and it sells ads. It sells ads. It has a banner that pops up in the player. Yes and sells. It, sells their services, is collect, see that they want to listen to Joe Rogan reflect, stop repeating yourself. [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          02:54:17       first of all, understand you're yelling like a little child [inaudible] me and saying, we just disagree with you and we're using logic and you're not getting angry out. I think the best example is when a baseball game or a football game, it's on network TV. That's free. Not going to fucking TV. Network TV is free. Okay. You're not allowed to record it and then start selling it. Putting it on a player that they had at the end of every single, even if you include the advertisements, you're not allowed to do that. You can't just have your own TV thing. It's a new format. I can record the thing and have some friends come over and watch the fucking thing. That's no big deal, but the second I start charging people to come through the door to watch this game didn't provided, you know, all my friends didn't have TVs. Then it's, yeah, it's like, no,

Speaker 3:          02:55:03       you're making money off our shore. Taking that show and like playing it at a bar on a VHS tape and causing, you know, costing people do judge and charging them to get in trouble. I see your point and I see where Brian's coming from. I know what you're trying to say, Brian. I think you're just a little emotionally tied up in this argument anyway. Okay, well I'm just, I'm trying to pursue things over and not have you be a little child here. I'm not seeing it now. I'm considered a child. I'm a considerate chow now you guys, you guys, I can't talk about it though. I can't be, can't talk about him and just like I'm talking to my mom about email right now. No, it's not. It's like we're talking to a challenge. Just getting condescending attitude, not ascending man. Like you're talking to your mom about email.

Speaker 3:          02:55:44       You clearly are being condescending. Look, you could be, the fourth hour will be the best fucking hours or minutes until it, let's read this bitch, ride this bitch right into the rocks and no, I didn't think I was going to prom with rush hour traffic. Well we were, we started to stopping an hour ago and somehow we've been talking about stitcher and internet. Use your illusion one and two podcast. Listen, it's all good folks. You know, to spicy Brian's point. I know Brian Likes stitcher and he loves the APP and I see what he's saying about if you put something out there, people are going to take it. But I also absolutely see bill's point. You can't just download the stuff and then use it. Limewire why wouldn't you love limewire? It's sell free fucking shit. Exactly. Yeah. At the end of the day, the service is corrupt. The beautiful thing about the Internet is that you can put things out there and you can use, uh, use, you know, this format to get more people to watch your shows and get more people.

Speaker 3:          02:56:38       But if you're going to sell ads, I agree with you. You gotta, you gotta get paid. I mean, it's no different than radio. It's no different than television. It's no different than any other service that you're providing that people profiting off. And that was my thing. As long as they just came to me. And just said, listen, we want to put it on him. You provide this service. We're going to sell the advertising. We'll give you a little piece of it. Yeah, because we know people aren't coming here stare at our website. They're actually coming here to listen to your show that you produce and you create, but I agree with Brian Lapointe, money as an internet realist. I totally agree with Brian's point that you put something on an RSS feed. You're just allowing people to download it for free and they can probably pretty much do whatever the fuck they want with it, but they don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:57:13       Short of trying to make money out of it. Yeah, we got three minutes, but people sell heroin. That doesn't mean it's legal. All right, three minutes. Yeah, we heard you bro. We're going to have three minutes of silence and see if you can cry. I know that cry. It's just, it never, I can't even talk about it. Yeah, you can't talk to us. I started getting, I says we don't agree with your point of view. There's a lot of that upset. You don't understand. My point of view and then every time I tried to explain it, you say you're repeating yourself. Let me tell you a point of view. Right? Right now you're saying it's my fault for putting it out there. I put it out there and I put it on on this they RSS feed and that gives it out to anybody. It's your fault. I'm saying if you want to stop it, then don't have an RSS feed out there because that's what it's for. Hey, if you don't want to get shot in the head, don't go out of the house.
