00:00:00.964 --> 00:00:02.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.520
-How do native peoples perform
and protect their sovereignty?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.040
We heard the last
panel about how

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.170
they do so via legal
and judicial means

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.770
in courts, both
Supreme and small.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.430
And we heard how complicated
that process was, and is,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.290
about struggles
with federal courts,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.290
about the tensions between
tribal, and federal courts,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.460
and about the tensions
between being a tribal judge,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.220
on the one hand, and being a
federal judge, on the other.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.280
It is all too easy to presume
that Native politics means

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.610
Native defeat.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.410
But the history and the present
reality of Native politics

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.000
shows us otherwise.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.340
We heard just a
few evenings ago,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.340
during Kristiana
Kahakauwila's talk,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.200
that Native Hawaiians
may soon come

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.250
into repossession of important
indigenous water rights.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.250
Those who have
visited Taos Pueblo,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.190
will recognize that, in 1970,
Taos Pueblo successfully

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.780
culminated a long-term
lobbying campaign

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.310
with the return of its sacred
Blue Lake, land and waterscape,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.550
in the Act of 1970.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.200
And today I note that
our keynote address

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.070
is being given by Rob
Porter of the Seneca Nation.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.310
And the Seneca Nation,
in 1842, successfully

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.270
reversed critical portions of
the fraudulent Buffalo Creek

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.400
Treaty of 1838, which created,
in that successful reversal,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.220
the two-- the three,
excuse me, reservations

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.520
on which the Seneca Nation
lives, thrives, and prospers

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.170
today.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.390
We're going to talk about those
more political, less judicial,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.570
aspects of native politics
and empowerment today.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.040
And we've got three amazing
panelists with whom to do so.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.310
We're going to proceed
in alphabetical order,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.460
Karen Diver, to my
left, currently serves

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.530
as the Special Assistant to the
President for Native American

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.760
Affairs at the
White House, having

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.020
been appointed to that
position by President Obama.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.380
She previously served nine years
as chairwoman of the Fond du

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.510
Lac Band of Lake
Superior Chippewa,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.360
where she oversaw a workforce
of over 2,000 employees

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.120
for the second largest
employer in northern Minnesota.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.430
She is uniquely
positioned to speak

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.340
toward internal domestic
tribal governance,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.320
as well as, national
politics in Indian Affairs.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.610
John Dossett, to her left,
is the General Counsel

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.550
to the National Congress
of American Indians, NCAI.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.830
And his work includes
legal, legislative,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.840
and intergovernmental
issues relating

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.190
to the rights of
tribal governments.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.550
He has served in his
position since 1997.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.370
And finally, to his
left, Sylvia McAdam

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.670
is from the Treaty 6 lands,
and a direct descendant

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.050
of Treaty People.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.550
She is nêhiyaw and Nakawe and
speaks fluently in nêhiyaw.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.220
McAdam is best
known as a cofounder

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.780
of the global grassroots
movement called,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.970
Idle No More, which seeks to
assert the inherent indigenous

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.470
rights to its sovereignty, and
re-institute traditional laws,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.600
and nation-to-nation treaties by
protecting the lands and waters

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.640
from corporate destruction.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.570
We're going to begin
with Karen Diver,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.503
thanks for being with us.

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:41.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.440
-Good morning.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.134
Yeah.

00:03:50.134 --> 00:03:51.556
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:56.830
--[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
I'm Karen Diver,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.680
Chairwoman Emeritus of the
Fond du Lac of Lake Superior

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.270
Chippewa.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.980
It is primarily
in that role today

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.610
that I'm sharing some remarks
with you, not necessarily

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.650
that of the White House,
although I hang around

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.210
there a little bit, as well.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.350
So I usually tell people that
now that I'm a bit removed

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.019
from being a tribal
chairwoman, that I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.160
have a little bit of
post-traumatic stress syndrome,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.890
and I'm thinking there should
be some kind of support

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.710
group for former
elected tribal leaders.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.750
You know, they say, all
politics is personal,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.890
well it's way different
when it's your aunties,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.276
and that they can walk
right into your door.

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:41.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.220
So I'm also really delighted
to be back here in Cambridge.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.890
My year at the
Harvard Kennedy School

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.350
is actually one of the
most fulfilling years

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.460
that I have ever had the
privilege to be a part of,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.000
particularly because
of HUNAP and getting

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.430
to know such bright, committed,
young, Native individuals.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.430
I came as a little bit and of an
older student, so I was auntie.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.720
I was the one that
actually brought real food

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.820
to the potlucks.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.050
Which made me a rare commodity.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.730
There's people here
who ate that food.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.590
Why did I come to
Kennedy School?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.590
I came to the Kennedy
School because I

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.140
was interested in learning
more from the Harvard

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.640
Project on American Indian
Economic Development.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.490
Really one of the
only institutions

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.550
of higher learning that looked
at what does best practices

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.570
look like in Indian
country, around governance

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.730
and economic development.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.630
I had saw my tribal community
go from an institution that

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.990
was very small, less
than 80 employees,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.320
had a hard time
sometimes making payroll,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.350
and had to pick between
payroll and the light bill.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.640
And overtime-- just
extraordinary poverty.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.820
Was the product of many
of my family members,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.130
kind of participating, and
having federal Indian policy

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.540
impact their lives.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.180
My dad was a
boarding school kid,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.820
so he was taken away from
his family at age six,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.940
with his brother, and
didn't really see them again

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.690
until they were eight
years old, lost his fluency

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.940
in the language, but never
forgot who his people were,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.760
and where he came from.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.537
My family chose to go away
on the relocation program

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:24.620
because they knew they had
to feed their children,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.180
and in my small town, you just
didn't hire Native people back

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.010
then for the full-time jobs, the
good living-wage jobs, always

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.985
day labor and on the edge.

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:36.880
So I had the benefit of
being able to grow up

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.270
in an urban area, but what
my parents did for me is,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.820
they put all four
of their children

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.690
through 12 years
of private school.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.420
They put their money
where their values

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.930
were, which was in education.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.210
So as I grew, and wanted to
make a better bigger impact

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.660
in my career, I knew
I had to learn more,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.910
and I came here to learn it.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.520
I went back home, and
started working for my tribe.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.950
I worked as the director
of special projects

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.210
doing lots of different things,
a lot of program development,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.050
administrative work.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.270
And when the job opened
up as the chairperson

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.560
I thought I would give it a try.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.340
My motives were
probably a little bit

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.240
different than previous
tribal chair people, in that,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.200
I was mostly
interested in building

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.180
the institution of
governance, and building

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.310
an active citizenry.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.300
Much just to my dismay,
when you start doing that,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.600
they often practice
it on you, first.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.770
But that's OK, right?

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.040
That's the stuff that
thick skin is made of,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.680
and it's for the greater good.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.900
So, the lesson I wanted to
work with my community on,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.490
is this balance of
internal, versus external.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.610
Very much Indian politics
in the home rule community

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.880
is about, how is
what you're going

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.800
to do in your elected office,
how does that benefit me?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.900
How does this increase
my housing options?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.350
How does this increase
my employment options?

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.550
And where really siloed
in Indian country,

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.840
I mean, the government
did a real good job

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.380
in making reservations,
they're very close,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.340
they're very cloistered,
they're gulags.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.370
And they intended-- the
purpose and the intention

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.560
of isolation of Native
communities, it worked.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.450
We have a tribal people
now whom by and large look

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.480
to their tribal governments
for 100% of their daily needs,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.860
everything from
their employment,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.310
to their energy assistance,
to their recreational

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.640
opportunities, to access to
their language and culture,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.680
and on, and on, and on, and on.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.070
But how does that actually
relate to a broader world

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.400
that we're a part of?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.490
And is that strategy OK
for Natives long term?

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.890
Well, we saw it changing
when we became more

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.090
of an economic entity, right?

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.480
So tribes were able
to take advantage

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.200
of learning Federal Indian Law,
and learning more about how

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.570
our governance relates to
the larger federal picture,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.240
and we found a niche in the
market that allowed tribes to,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.040
under civil regulatory
jurisdiction,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.060
undertake a form of economic
development called, gaming.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.400
That brought us to the attention
of broader communities in a way

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.110
that we had pretty
much not had before.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.640
It was really easy to ignore
Native communities when

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.310
we were poor and dependent,
just stay on your reservation,

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.844
and stay out of our way.

00:09:15.844 --> 00:09:17.260
Well, it's a whole
different thing

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.310
if you fast forward through
becoming economic entities,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.800
and starting to become the
largest employer in your area,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.870
if not a large
swath of your state.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.270
Now people are paying
attention in a different way.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.700
To me that really
meant we needed

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.640
to do some intention-- turn
our attention internally,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.620
to our systems,
that we grow them.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.280
To be able to have the
capacity to take on this larger

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.232
role and broader communities.

00:09:41.232 --> 00:09:42.940
But we also needed to
get a little better

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.910
about communicating
what it is we are,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.190
why we do what we do, how does
that matter to our people,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.960
internally, within our home rule
community, and our citizenry,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.440
and how does that relate
to the rest of the world?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.690
All of a sudden we're bumping
into these multijurisdictional

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.540
issues.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.670
Whether it's growing
our police department,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.490
and figuring out how to do
mutual-aid agreements so that

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.530
we can serve our joint
citizens just as well.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.820
The panel previous
to me, actually,

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.290
was a good foundation for,
kind of the way I looked

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.610
at what tribal governance is.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.250
And, you know, people confuse
race with political status.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.220
And that was a
constant mantra that I

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.820
had to have over and
over again, whether it

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.110
was with townships, or cities,
or counties, or the state.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.810
Of saying, my citizens
are still your citizens.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.670
They have an absolute
right to service delivery,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.960
and your attention, and
for you to understand

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.920
what their needs
are, and balance them

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.700
with the rest of
your constituency.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.780
You do not get to abdicate your
responsibility to your citizens

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.800
just because they are tribal.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.250
I will share that
with you, but I

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.010
will hold you accountable
for your service delivery.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.290
You don't get to not
send your police officers

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.380
to the reservation, when
were a Public Law 280

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.560
state, which says, that their
state criminal jurisdiction

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.410
that rules.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.000
So even though I'm
not a lawyer, I

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.161
had to play one on TV regularly.

00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:08.661
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.452
It was called the news. [LAUGHS]

00:11:13.452 --> 00:11:14.871
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.680
Because I had to be
able to articulate

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.330
to those other jurisdictions,
and to those other

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.250
stakeholders, why what happened
in my piece of Indian country

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.180
mattered to them, and why my
citizens continued to matter,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.480
and that we were not
going to allow ourselves

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.450
to be ignored anymore.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.720
But we do, and we are, and
it's very selective, right?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.440
They look at our
economic success

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.980
and say, well, why don't
we get to have casinos.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.480
And I would say back, well,
we are a political entities.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.620
You're confusing our race
with our political status.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.414
We have a different
jurisdiction.

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:55.830
And then, generally,
I would point

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.510
out they didn't share
250 years of oppression,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:04.100
poverty, and everything
else, too, but, you know.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.217
Politics is
personal, even to me.

00:12:08.217 --> 00:12:09.800
But then there was
the broader picture

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.700
of talking to my citizens about
what could they expect out

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.050
of their elected leadership
that went a little bit beyond,

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.730
what can I do in
the home community?

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.370
Because I had all of
these multijuristictional

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.130
relationships to
manage, as well as,

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.330
making sure that the
2,200 employees did

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.720
service delivery, and economic
development, really well.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.500
And I would have my home rule
community say to me, well,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.860
why are you going to DC, Karen?

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.770
What about here?

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.540
How are you taken care of here?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.500
And so the communication
started to begin, and we--

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.280
I ramped up my own
personal transparency,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.960
through regular open meetings
with our own citizens,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.225
and newspaper articles, and
tried to let them know why.

00:12:54.225 --> 00:12:55.720
Why do I go to DC?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.330
Why do I talk to
federal officials?

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.740
Why do I talk to
our legislators?

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.250
Why does that matter in
the home rule community?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.450
How do we broaden the scope
of our active citizenry

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:11.190
to say, out there matters
as much to us, as here.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.870
And that was the story we
really needed to get out.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.760
Obviously, we look to
Congress to help us

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.820
with some of the poor
decisions of the Court.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.490
Congress has plenary
power, obviously provide

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.270
a legislative fix to some of the
poor federal, and Supreme Court

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.142
decisions, [INAUDIBLE],
land into trust issues.

00:13:32.142 --> 00:13:34.310
A very poor ruling
out of the courts

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.970
that really narrowed
the definition

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.670
of the types of lands that
the Department of Interior

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.810
can take into trusts.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.010
We need a legislative fix.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.370
Some of the inroads, or,
not even the inroads,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.620
incursions into Indian
Child Welfare Act.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.250
That's going to be
a federal response,

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.910
either through federal
agency rule-making,

00:13:52.910 --> 00:14:00.460
or additional activity
out of Congress.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.740
One of the things we started
with, was real basic.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.950
You can understand
as a tribal person

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:11.680
why you need to be engaged
in tribal politics,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.900
why do they need to be engaged
in the broader world politics.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.430
And we got out the vote.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.360
We got out the vote
in such a big way

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.750
that we swung local elections.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.180
If you talk to Al
Franken, he will tell you,

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.710
and conf-- and say that the
Indian vote helped get him

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.100
in office.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.880
As politics has gotten
more polarized, and-- nah,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.503
that's not happening, right?

00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:37.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.620
Smaller constituencies
can matter

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.220
more as we become more divided.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.800
So the voices are even
more, and more important.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.150
Senator Franken
won by 312 votes.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.040
312 votes.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.830
We registered more voters
just at Fond du Lac,

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.320
new voters that year.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.870
We gave them rides,
we had free transit,

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.910
we did voter
registration drives,

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.060
we had, I voted, stickers,
made into our language.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.820
And they became a thing of
pride to wear in our community

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.900
for people to vote.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.660
We told them that your
legislators are the ones that

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.760
are your voice at
the table, and rather

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.630
than fix things that are
broken, they can be proactive.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.700
We challenged Senator Franken
to become a member of the Senate

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.950
Committee on Indian Affairs,
because we hadn't had

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.780
one out of Minnesota, a member.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.970
And there's 11
tribes in Minnesota.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.590
And that we wanted him to know
that, if he wanted our support,

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.990
we expected him to be
a part of the voice.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.250
And he did it, and
he's there, and he's

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.040
fighting for Indian
people on that committee.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.210
As tribal governance
has grown and taken

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.740
on more responsibility,
we're starting

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.170
to see more and more
that, what you're

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.370
electing as a local
tribal leader,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.950
isn't just somebody who
manages the governance,

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.910
you're electing an advocate.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.590
And so we're trying
to push the idea of,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.090
don't just vote because that
someone is your relative,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.070
and you think that means
your family will do better

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.870
under a new regime.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.160
But they are able to articulate
kind of the global needs

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.240
of your community.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.050
How many children--
do we see spikes

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.050
in our local counties
of children being placed

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.280
in out-of-home placement?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.840
What kind of economic
impact do we make?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.700
Are they able to articulate
that a rising tide really

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.560
does lift all boats, and a
healthy tribal community,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.420
in my case, contributed
well over $300 million

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.590
to a local role economy.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.360
You need to have that advocacy.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.980
Sequestration, actually,
was one of the things that

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.280
came to my people, that
was really able for them

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.310
to understand, how
does this affect me?

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.020
When we talked about, if
we're not an advocate in DC,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.390
here's what will happen in
the home rule community,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.620
in terms of our
service delivery.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.460
We expect these things
to be able to not

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.090
be able to continue.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.300
Everything from elder
Meals On Wheels,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.750
to home health care
aides, to Head Start,

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.450
and on, and on, and on.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.510
Now Washington,
DC, feels very real

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.880
when you're talking
about our loved ones.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.920
The other part is, maybe not
as sexy, but just as important,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.741
talking to our community about
the census, and participation,

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:23.990
and different data collection.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.589
Data collection is
terrible in Indian country.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.620
We are tired of people tracking
us, they track our blood,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.240
they track where we live, they
track who our ancestors are.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.200
Would you quit
tracking us already?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.050
Well, here's a
tribal leader saying,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.530
I need you to fill
out the census,

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.290
and tell some people, you
know, everything about you

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.640
that really is none of their
business, but yet it matters.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.220
So we had our own census people,
members from our own community,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.400
that could go in and
make our families

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.520
feel comfortable, and
understand the reason why

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.210
it was important for good data.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.270
Because federal, and
state, and elections,

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.120
get decided based on census.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.876
It's about redistricting,
and obviously, lately,

00:18:03.876 --> 00:18:04.750
about gerrymandering.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.290
That's true.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.250
And it's about
allocations of resources.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.990
And data collection continues
to be something that's

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.370
important in so
many ways in terms

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.490
of how states
allocate resources,

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.420
how the feds allocate resources.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.390
Once again, DC matters to
the home rule community,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.630
St. Paul, in Minnesota, matters
to the home rule community.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.070
Understanding that working
with federal agencies

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.860
is also politics.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.430
Tribes actually, because of the
Federal Trust Responsibility--

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.172
everybody know what the Federal
Trust Responsibility is?

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.920
OK.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.712
So we prepaid for a
whole bunch of stuff.

00:18:56.712 --> 00:18:58.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.310
We paid with the country.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.020
And the promise was, if
we give up the country,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.780
that some of-- that our
needs would be taken care of.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.900
That didn't go so well, but
we're kind of expecting it now.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.660
Our place in politics is about
saying the bill is coming due.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.770
We would like to
be self-determined,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.800
self-sufficient, and we would
like to carry our own water,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.070
and be truly
self-governing, and exercise

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.610
that full political
status as sovereigns.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.700
And then guess what?

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.180
Then you don't have to worry
about us too much anymore.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.320
We want those
things for our self,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.280
just like every person and
family wants it for themselves.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.150
Working directly with
the federal government

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.750
and the agencies as politics.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.540
At the top level you
have secretaries,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.980
and those are
political appointees.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.690
It matters who you elect.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.430
I'll use the current president.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.000
He has been the best
friend to Indian country

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.930
that we have ever seen
in the executive branch.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.640
We are on track to take
about a 1/2 a million

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.780
more acres of tribal
homelands into trust,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.920
as well as having a fairly
robust agenda through each

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.950
of the departments around
strengthening Indian country.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.800
Consultation policies--
you will not do to us,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.970
you will do with us.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.870
We will communicate, we will
do negotiated rule-making,

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.440
and we know how best to
serve our own communities.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.630
You have proven you're
not that good at it,

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.950
so let's have this
conversation about how to get

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.800
it done on a day-to-day basis.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.680
We have institutionalized
the relationship, not just

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.730
the ward status.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.820
We are a participant
in our own governance.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.180
Finally I'll talk a little
bit about Native peoples,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.510
and Native politics,
and saying that,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.840
I am absolutely delighted,
as I look at social media,

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.110
and I see tribal citizens
across the country taking

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.970
that final step of
becoming candidates.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.320
It has been something that
has been woefully lacking.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.970
And we talked about this
in Indian country a lot

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.640
about representation.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.280
Whether it's in our
classrooms, where our kids

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.230
can see teachers
that look like them,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.910
and have curricula that's
reflective of them.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:27.100
We talk about it in social
services, family caseworkers,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.340
how do you know about the
dynamics in an Indian family,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.020
if you are not
culturally competent.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.890
And the quickest and easiest
way to get culturally competent

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.070
is to be from the culture.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.390
This goes then to electoral
politics, as well.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.610
If we can change
voting in Minnesota,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.250
and elect an ally in
Al Franken, can we

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.490
turn out the vote to elect
someone who looks just

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.300
like us, from our community,
to be representative

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.970
of communities that
are largely Native.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.370
In the Southwest
we see candidates,

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.330
we see them up in the Northwest.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.380
We have state legislatures
who are increasingly

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.590
having people understand
that their road to higher

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.280
elected office
starts in their home

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.320
communities with local
seats, city council members,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.620
to statewide politics, and
hopefully, quite a number more

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.210
at the federal level.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.540
Why does that matter to people
outside of Indian country?

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.880
Our diversity is our strength.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.440
By 2030 the majority
of this culture

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.180
will be people of color.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.270
And that wide
fabric of diversity

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.070
is what makes us
strong, and it makes

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.930
us resilient as a country,
but only if it's inclusive.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.810
We talk a lot at
the federal level

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.080
of how do we compete against
China, and TPP, and everything

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.200
else.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.870
A part of it is
making sure that we

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.350
have a healthy and
participatory society, right?

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.070
Because that's where the
solutions come to homegrown

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.500
issues, and then bubble up,
and become our strength.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.404
So, vote Indian.

00:23:03.404 --> 00:23:04.268
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:04.268 --> 00:23:06.580
You know you want to.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.440
You know you want to.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.910
Just in closing, all
politics is personal, right?

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.440
Although you won't be seeing
me running for anything else

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.000
anytime soon.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
That whole post-traumatic
stress thing.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.700
You know, understand that
politics for Indian country

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.430
is personal.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.440
It becomes, first and foremost,
with the home rule community.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.290
How can we become as
healthy as we can be,

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.520
and as inclusive as we can
be in our home community.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.014
And then making that story more
broadly to other jurisdictions,

00:23:40.014 --> 00:23:41.930
where, hopefully, we'll
be talking to familiar

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.280
faces in the future.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.810
And telling the story that
Native peoples-- our country

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.080
is only as healthy as
those who have the least.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.300
So let's bring that least up,
and work towards full equality.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.172
That's my job.

00:23:56.172 --> 00:23:56.880
Thank you, folks.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.359
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.050
Hello, my name's
John Dossett, I'm

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.230
with the National Congress
of American Indians.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.805
Thanks very much
for having me here.

00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:11.680
I thought before I
started-- my presentation,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.140
I was really going to leap
right into sort of recent events

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.316
in working with Congress,
and the administration,

00:24:18.316 --> 00:24:20.440
getting a lot of policy
things done, but I thought,

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.300
maybe, first, I should tell you
a little bit about the National

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.060
Congress of American Indians.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.481
NCAI is a membership
organization of Indian tribes

00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:27.730
from around the United States.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.700
There's about 250 member
tribes, that varies

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.829
a little bit from year to year.

00:24:32.829 --> 00:24:34.870
The tribes get together
about three times a year,

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.550
and they pass
resolutions, and then

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.410
those resolutions are--
they're the marching orders

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.730
for the staff of NCAI,
what we're supposed

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.880
to try to achieve with
Congress, and what

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.940
we try to achieve collectively.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.660
The mission statement,
or the preamble

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.700
to the NCAI constitution
says that our goal

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.940
is to advance
tribal sovereignty,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.770
and respect for tribal laws,
treaty rights, and the Federal

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.360
Trust Responsibility.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.000
To promote the common
welfare of Indian people,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.730
and educate the public towards
a better understanding.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.000
So that's the broad
goals of NCAI.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.240
And NCAI, over the
years, formed in 1944,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.600
fought against
termination, then pushed

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.450
the self-determination policy.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.610
And since then NCAI
has probably been

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.620
involved in most of the major
laws and regulations that

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.220
have-- working to
advance Indian policy.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.010
So with that, I guess I'll
turn to my next subject.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.010
And I guess it was,
you know, when I first

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.010
talked about this with
Maggie McKinley, Maggie--

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.230
she wanted me to talk about
Indian tribal leaders,

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.000
and NCAI, and how we
work on lobbying issues,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.950
and that we need to reclaim
the language of lobbying.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.260
And I thought-- it was a
little bit dissonant for me

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.910
because, I don't think
tribal leaders have ever

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.850
thought of lobbying as
anything but 100% good.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.440
Lobbying, it isn't some--
it isn't a thing where

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.230
there's-- it's not shady
or corrupt, I mean,

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.250
maybe that's something in
other parts of America that--

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.650
but, I think tribal leaders
really see this as, you know,

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.000
the right to petition for
the redress of grievances.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.640
They're in the mode
of advancing what--

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.760
trying to make good things
happen for their cultures,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.530
and for their tribes back home.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.310
And I've never had
any sense that it's

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.042
anything less than what
we ought to be doing.

00:26:19.042 --> 00:26:20.500
In fact, tribal
leaders consider it

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.630
sort of a privilege, and
an honor, and a duty,

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.620
to lobby on behalf
of their tribes.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.470
And it's not something that
they'd ever consider anything

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.370
less than what everybody ought
to want to do with their life.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.420
So I've been very lucky
to work with this group,

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.948
and I enjoy it a great deal.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.160
I thought I'd start by,
maybe bragging a little bit

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.830
about tribal leaders, and about
what this administration has

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.080
accomplished.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.960
And so here's a
series of photographs.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.790
This here is the Tribal
Law and Order Act.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.340
And I always like to point
out in these photographs,

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.770
I mean, it isn't just
one guy, President Obama

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.540
didn't do this all by himself.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.200
There's members of Congress,
there's tribal leaders,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.750
and all working together
to pass this legislation.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.942
This is the HEARTH
Act, this is the-- we

00:27:03.942 --> 00:27:05.650
talked about the Tribal
Law and Order Act

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.720
before, the HEARTH Act was
the one where tribes can now

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.270
control leasing on their
own lands, at least surface

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.219
leasing, which is a
great step forward.

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:16.010
And this was the Violence
Against Women Act

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.670
Reauthorization, and this
was a huge crowd of people.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.371
And I will-- and, as you see
in this photo, a lot of folks

00:27:22.371 --> 00:27:23.870
here, the Violence
Against Women Act

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.360
was a coalition much broader
than Indian country itself.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.870
The National Task Force
to End Domestic Violence,

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.430
and all kinds of folks
are involved in that.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:35.237
So I want to-- in
addition to that,

00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:37.570
some of the other recent
things that this administration

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.120
and tribal leaders have achieved
working together, amendments

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.410
to the Stafford Acts
so that tribes can now

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.740
request their own disaster
declarations in Indian country.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.550
They don't have to
work through the state.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.250
There are now new
guidelines and regulations

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.580
pending on the Indian
Child Welfare Act.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.060
Tribes have achieved land
into trust over 400,000 acres,

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.740
I think that's 625 square
miles of land into trust,

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.950
massively improved processes,
much quicker land into trust

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.250
processes, land into
trust in Alaska, which

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.960
is going to be a
great step forward,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.200
and then a lot of
reservation proclamations.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.170
There'd been quite a number of
settlements in Indian country,

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.100
the Cobell settlement for
mismanagement of Indian trust

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:23.299
funds, 86 tribal cases
over $2.8 billion.

00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:25.590
The Contract Support Litigation
for self-determination,

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.730
and self-governance
contracts, about $1.5 billion

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.210
there, about $2 billion worth
of water rights settlements,

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.640
the Keepseagle settlement
for discrimination

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.520
against Native American
farmers, altogether, this

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.320
might be about $10 billion in
settlements for Indian country

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.260
that tribes have
worked with Congress,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.970
and the administration, to
achieve over the last seven

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.710
years.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.661
So I started-- I
wanted to keep a list,

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.410
because so many good
things were happening

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.820
during these last
years, that I was like,

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.160
somebody better write this
down, or else nobody's going

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.410
to remember this stuff, right?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.990
It all goes by in
kind of a blur.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.740
So I started keeping
a list, and you know,

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.480
I used to keep it on this one
slide of all these great things

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.280
that had happened.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.320
But now I have to go
into a second slide,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.540
and then keep talking
about all the good things--

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.120
these ICWA regulations
the retrocessions,

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.270
the new right of way
regulations, where tribes can

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.760
preempt state taxes on
Indian reservations,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.355
and collect their own taxes.

00:29:16.355 --> 00:29:18.730
And then I had to keep going
with a third slide of things

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.210
that have continued to
happen in Indian country.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.959
I think in some
ways it's possible

00:29:22.959 --> 00:29:24.500
that tribal governments
have achieved

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.130
more, working with
this administration,

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.090
than any other group.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.106
It's really amazing
all that's been done.

00:29:29.106 --> 00:29:30.980
And we're trying to keep
track of everything,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.360
but if I lost track
of some stuff.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.260
But, anyway, thanks to tribal
leaders, like Karen Diver,

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.335
and administration officials,
like Karen Diver, it's really--

00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:39.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.835 --> 00:29:41.250
gotten a lot done.

00:29:43.564 --> 00:29:45.230
So I want to talk a
little bit about how

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.800
we can keep this going.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.900
You know, tribal
leaders are out there,

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.740
and Karen talked about
this, working together,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.460
and by themselves,
to educate Congress

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.530
and the administration.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.610
Getting out the vote, and
getting bipartisan support.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.070
Having that leadership
from the administration

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.860
and the leadership in Congress.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.800
And it's really important to
have bipartisan leadership.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.850
And then coalition
building in Indian country.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.725
And that's really what
I'm going to focus on,

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.020
it's coalition building.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.020
And here's a couple other
points, but keep it going.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.880
So I wanted to focus on one
coalition building effort that

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.210
was a really important one,
that we were very honored

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.790
to work on.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.240
And I wanted to show this
photograph because I think

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.530
it emphasizes the coalition.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.450
You know, there's a
tendency, I think sometimes,

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.450
as if, you know, there were one,
or two, charismatic people who

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.160
got a lot of stuff
done, and it's,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.480
I think, maybe afterwards,
we impose that narrative

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.410
on what happened.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.460
But really when
it's going on it's

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.610
a swarm of people all over the
country doing amazing things.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.190
And here's just an example
of part of that swarm.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.510
And there are many
different points in time

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.820
when individuals
step up to the plate,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.430
and they keep pushing the ball
forward in critical events,

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.730
and it takes this whole
series of serendipitous events

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.050
to get you to the point.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.520
And this expansion of tribal
jurisdiction over non-Indians

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.955
of the Violence
Against Women Act,

00:31:05.955 --> 00:31:08.580
was really one of those things,
where a lot of different things

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.870
came together, a lot of
people came together.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.315
It was really great
to be a part of it,

00:31:13.315 --> 00:31:14.940
and that's what I
wanted to talk about,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.490
is that kind of
coalition building.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.355
As background on this
issue, I think it-- maybe

00:31:21.355 --> 00:31:23.730
it started with the Tribal
Law and Order Act discussions,

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.430
when, in 2007, they
started holding hearings.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.780
And this problem of
domestic violence

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.046
committed by non-Indians really
began coming to the forefront.

00:31:33.046 --> 00:31:34.920
There were a lot of
hearings held in Congress

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.070
during that time.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.340
And these facts kept coming
forward, 61% of Native women

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.880
have been subject
to assault, that's

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.700
triple the national rate.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.580
66% of the perpetrators
are non-Indian.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.600
There's this in-- the
federal government

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.570
is the only entity that has
jurisdiction over non-Indians,

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.030
until recently, anyway.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.760
And there's this
incredibly high rate

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.040
of declinations, where the
federal government won't

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.600
prosecute these cases,
particularly domestic violence

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.270
cases, because they're
kind of hard to prosecute.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.330
And that tribal governments
are the only entity

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.960
that could provide
safety for Native women.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.380
So this proposed
remedy came forward

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.120
to amend the Indian Civil
Rights Act to restore

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.070
tribal jurisdiction
over non-Indians

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.950
for domestic violence crimes.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.440
There were a whole bunch of
factors that fed into this,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.856
and I think, first
of all, we have

00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:25.640
to credit the VAWA movement more
generally across the country.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.290
I mean, they passed the Violence
Against Women Act in 1994,

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.800
I think before tribes
were deeply involved.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.750
But the infrastructure
that they set up,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.340
particularly the shelters,
and then funding the shelters

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.850
on Indian reservations,
funding the victims

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.960
advocates around the country.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.930
That infrastructure,
I think, created

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:48.380
the basis for what then
went forward from there.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.740
And some of that took
place in the NCAI Violence

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.740
Against Women Task Force,
led by tribal leaders,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.720
like Juana Majel,
and Terri Henry,

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.070
where they've been pushing
this issue probably

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.930
since about 1999.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.140
So it really-- I guess one
point I want to get across

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.030
is these kind of things, you may
think it all happened in 2013,

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.460
they started working on that
like a decade and a half

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.476
to get to that point.

00:33:13.476 --> 00:33:15.850
There were some very important
studies, the Ninth Circuit

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.470
Gender Bias Task Force
report that came out in 1997,

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.800
highlighted this problem,
and it was this really great,

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.650
you know, the Ninth Circuit
judges come out with a report,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.870
highlighting the issue,
from a long time ago.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.030
The fact that there was
now crime data-- crime

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.240
data in Indian country
wasn't generally available

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.760
until the Clinton administration
started collecting it.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.120
So that-- you know that data
that I just recited to you,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.300
that's pretty compelling?

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.110
None of that existed
until before then.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.940
We had an NCAI
resolution as of 2003,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.210
the Lara case came along,
that Maze of Injustice report

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.342
was incredibly important,
from Amnesty International.

00:33:51.342 --> 00:33:52.800
Anyway, there was
this whole series

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.050
of events that led to this.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.770
I probably think the most
important thing was native vote

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:58.307
overall.

00:33:58.307 --> 00:33:59.765
When it came right
down to it, when

00:33:59.765 --> 00:34:01.806
we were trying to get the
bill through the house,

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:04.360
you know, it was a Republican
House of Representatives,

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.090
they weren't
generally supportive,

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.882
but it was about finding
enough Republicans

00:34:07.882 --> 00:34:09.298
to go with the
Democrats, who were

00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:10.530
going to vote for the bill.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:14.179
So we got out the map, and
there are 63 Republicans who

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.489
have Indian tribes
in their districts,

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.394
and we started targeting them,
one after another, and flipping

00:34:19.394 --> 00:34:20.560
them over to the other side.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.768
And then by the time we got
to about 60, it was like,

00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:25.850
OK, the bill headed to the
floor, and it went to a vote.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.159
So the fact that tribes
are turning out the vote,

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.610
even if it's small
tribes in one district,

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.280
it's just incredibly
important for politics.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.350
And in the end, that's
what got the bill done,

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.270
and it showed itself
in this legislation.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.679
This was a slide
that one of the-- I

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.504
think the National Indian
Women's Resource Center,

00:34:46.504 --> 00:34:47.920
they had a
presentation about it--

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.139
and this was as it was going on.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:54.250
And I just thought it was a nice
graphic of how the coalition

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.340
building process works.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.580
I mean, it really isn't
one person, or one entity,

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.690
it's everybody working together.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.630
This is a photograph of a group
of women in North Dakota--

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.740
South Dakota, who
are-- they were

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.110
holding marches and rallies.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.590
I mean, this was going on all
across the country in 2012,

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.830
and 2013.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.650
And it was like we're-- it
was like a social movement,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.960
you know, like people
heard about it.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.870
It was the most exciting
thing I've been involved in.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.770
I wanted to-- Sarah Deer-- there
are probably some academics

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.690
here in the crowd,
so there is a role

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.160
for academics in this process.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.430
And Sarah Deer and her Maze of
Injustice Report, I thought,

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.870
were very important in
moving this forward.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.390
But it wasn't those-- it wasn't
this report all by itself.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.110
This was just one more piece
of the puzzle coming together

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.100
so everybody can play a role.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.940
And you just have to watch
these issues and figure out

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.500
the right timing, and
when to come forward.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.000
So this new law,
what it did is, it

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.490
affirmed tribal
inherent authority

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.870
to exercise criminal
jurisdiction

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.300
over domestic violence,
dating violence,

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.240
and violation of
protection orders.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.190
Those violations of
protective orders

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.940
aren't just intimate partners,
that could be anybody.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.670
So that's really, I
mean, in some ways

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.320
people think that this is
fairly narrow jurisdiction,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.970
but when you think
about this authority

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.880
to criminally prosecute any
violation of protection order,

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.670
you could get jurisdiction
over just about anyone,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.560
by first issuing a protection
order, and then enforcing it.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.940
There are 12 tribes who
are currently implementing,

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.240
I think there are
more on the way.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.120
There have been more than
50 cases prosecuted to date.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.850
So far the experience
shows that there

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.610
have been some difficulties with
child victims, related crimes,

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.120
like if you find a drug
crime at the same scene,

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.460
and then, how violent
does it have to be?

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.000
Exactly, what is violence?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.830
So there is already
legislation pending in Congress

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.840
to address these issues
that got introduced

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.970
a month, or two, ago.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.750
So I think that can show you
how this stuff, this ball,

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.270
is continuing to roll.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.950
You know, now we have
data about what's

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.140
going on in these--
at the 12 tribes

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.250
who are already prosecuting, and
it continues to move forward,

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.230
and we're going
to keep it going.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.930
I'll skip past this one.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:05.230
If you want to learn more about
the VAWA issue, here it is.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.630
One of the tricks
of lobbying is,

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.671
when you're sitting in
front of a decision maker,

00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:10.370
like Karen Diver,
for instance, you

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.920
might want to talk about
issues that are important you.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.261
So I was going to highlight
a couple of other issues--

00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:14.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.270
--that are coming up.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.390
And this is more
coalition work that we all

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.620
need to work together on.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.390
And there are some things
that we really want to submit.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.850
The administration has achieved
this amazing list of things,

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.141
but there's a couple more
things we'd like to get done.

00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:30.310
One of them is to modernize
the Indian Trader Regulations.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.170
The secretary has authority
to regulate, basically,

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.160
trade with the Indians
on reservations.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.670
And the administration's
been really

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.520
great about asserting that in
the [INAUDIBLE] litigation,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.300
where the state is
collecting dual taxation

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.300
on the reservation.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.820
And at least in my
opinion, this is

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.300
the-- why are Indian
reservations always struggling

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.200
economically?

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.432
It's because the
states tax everything,

00:37:50.432 --> 00:37:52.140
and then they don't
provide any services,

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.120
and then the tribes
can't tax on top of that.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.270
If tribes-- if you can
eliminate the state taxes,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.060
and tribe could collect
their own taxes,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.840
tribes could provide
taxes-- you know,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.660
services on the
reservation, just

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.560
like most other
local communities do.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.810
But they've been unable to
do that because of a series

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.740
of bad Supreme Court decisions.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.420
But there is this
proposal, pending

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.970
at the Department of
Interior, that we'd really

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.540
like them to move
forward on, that

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.710
would empower tribal
business licensing,

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.250
there would be consent to
tribal jurisdiction addressing

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.820
the Dollar General case, and
would eliminate dual taxation.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.910
Another interesting one
that's going on right

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.800
now is this Bears Ears
National Monument.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.480
This is also a coalition of five
tribes out of the Southwest.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.070
They are asking the
federal government

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.153
to create a national
monument through presidential

00:38:34.153 --> 00:38:37.750
proclamation to set aside
1.9 million acres of very

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.700
important tribal
cultural sacred lands,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.070
but to do it under
tribal code management,

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.320
under a code management
plan, it would really

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.350
be an amazing step forward.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.440
Charles Wilkinson is
working with the tribes

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.160
in that area on
this, so it's really

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.272
a very interesting development.

00:38:53.272 --> 00:38:54.730
So the last thing
I wanted to share

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.640
with you is, this is the--
staff come in to NCAI,

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.190
and they're like,
OK, what do we do?

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.800
So this is the formula that--
I think we have at NCAI-- this

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.030
is what you do with your job.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.950
You study the issue, you've
got to know it really well,

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.270
and you identify a solution.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.895
This is a lot more
work than you think,

00:39:08.895 --> 00:39:10.860
but this is basically
the part of it.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.167
Second, you've got to
identify the decision

00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:15.500
makers, and the process that
you're going to go through.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.041
Whether you're
working with Congress,

00:39:17.041 --> 00:39:19.440
which there's-- and there's
a process and rules for all

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.280
of this stuff.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.472
Also, working with the
agencies, so understanding

00:39:22.472 --> 00:39:24.430
those rules, and the
process, and how it works,

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.054
it's not that much
different than being

00:39:26.054 --> 00:39:27.100
a lawyer in the courts.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.440
There's rules and a process.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.600
You've got to have very
concise, short messages,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.170
and make sure that
they're delivered.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.720
Know the timing, you get
them-- you got to deliver them,

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.810
you do it early,
you do a follow up,

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.420
and then right at the decision
time, you do it again.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.760
You share all this information
with your coalition,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.660
and you ask them to do
the same things that

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.460
they're-- everybody's
on the same page,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.100
putting all these messages in
front of the decision makers.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.370
And then you work with
media, and social media,

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.275
to make sure that the message
spreads as far as you can.

00:39:54.275 --> 00:39:55.150
Anyway, there you go.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.490
That's the advocacy formula
that we use at NCAI.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.156
Thanks very much.

00:39:59.156 --> 00:40:00.584
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:06.790
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.585
If you see me like, sitting over
there, and have my head down,

00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:11.178
I'm tweeting.

00:40:11.178 --> 00:40:12.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:12.642 --> 00:40:14.320
It's not that I'm
not paying attention,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.840
I'm tweeting out to people.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.810
I want to thank Harvard
and I want to thank

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:34.465
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I
want to thank the creator,

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.850
the four directions,
and our Mother Earth,

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.010
for being here today.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.220
And I want to thank
the Original Peoples

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.620
for the lands in
which we are in today,

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:47.150
and I want to thank them
for inviting me in here.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.310
I also want to thank
the organizers,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.580
incredible organizing,
well done, very smooth.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.050
Thank you for that.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:41:00.540
Today I'm going to talk about
something very different,

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.920
and I'm going to try
and talk about it.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.340
I'm going to be teaching it
for a week in Jasper, Alberta.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.590
I am from the Treaty 6 lands of
the [INAUDIBLE], I am nêhiyaw.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.580
In English we are
called the Cree people.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.590
Now, what I'm going
to talk to you,

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.580
I have to talk to you in
15 minutes, and less--

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.540
--in a four-day
intensive program.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.830
[LAUGHS] So, if I sound like
an auctioneer, I apologize.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:27.756
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:29.380
I'm going to have to
move very quickly.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.370
How many of you have heard
of the Doctrine of Discovery?

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.550
Wonderful, wonderful.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:40.700
I want to also ask, are there
indigenous people in the crowd?

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.010
Wonderful.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.220
I wanted to tell you, you
are our ancestors prayers

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.610
made flesh.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.850
I'm so grateful that
you're here today amidst

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.760
all of the brutal genocide
that we've lived through

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.600
to stand here today.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.197
So, at the time-- this
is really important,

00:42:03.197 --> 00:42:04.780
so you have to follow
me very quickly.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.090
I have to teach you
quickly on this.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.650
And I know that
the USA and Canada

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.930
have very parallel histories,
because I researched it.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:19.070
And I'm not saying I'm an
expert in the US law, I'm not.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.630
I am a lawyer in the
Canadian common law system,

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.740
and I'm primarily a researcher.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.780
So the Doctrine of Discovery
is under the umbrella

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.640
of the Manifest Destiny
[INAUDIBLE] indigenous peoples.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.040
The original peoples were
considered the flora and fauna,

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.320
we're not human.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.200
We are not human.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.870
I say that over, and over
again, because that's

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:49.380
what rolls out in every policy
and law that we see today.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.400
Today.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.220
And I want the young
people to know,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.430
and I want the
indigenous women to know,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:59.320
that this system targets you
as the most marginalized,

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.380
and the most hated.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:06.050
And I am very blunt because I
don't have time for niceties.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:12.950
Christian monarchs at that
time worked with Pope Alexander

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:17.890
in creating, from the
imaginations of men,

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:23.550
from the imaginations of a
pope, a Doctrine of Discovery.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:26.040
And it's exactly the
same here for you,

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.210
except you had Columbus.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.540
We had John Cabot, The Explorer.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:38.430
So John Cabot came across
the ocean with instruments,

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.140
and when he arrived,
and these instruments

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:46.800
were the charters directed from
the pope-- OK, from the pope.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.650
And when he arrived here
he did a Christian chant.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:54.810
The very first thing he did when
he landed on Original People's

00:43:54.810 --> 00:44:00.940
soil, he got off his
boat, went to our lands,

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.590
took instruments that he
carried across the ocean,

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.520
and did a very-- the very
first act that he did

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.320
was a Christian chant, and
he put that instrument deep

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.790
in the soil of our
people's lands,

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:21.560
and he baptized our lands for
the sovereign, for the pope.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:28.620
That's a very symbolic
Christian and sovereign act

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.070
of those nations
across the ocean,

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.000
and very important for us today.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.320
At that moment, when he did
that, the presumed sovereignty

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.410
of the monarch, the presumed
sovereignty on our side

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.110
was the British rule.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.900
It was crystallized, as
they say in law, right?

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.590
Crystallized at that moment.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.470
This is the timeline.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.250
So before that, the
Original Peoples

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:06.880
lived in independent, powerful
societies governed by our laws,

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:13.020
the original instructions
given to us by our [INAUDIBLE],

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:16.160
or for other
nations, however you

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.900
choose to call your
spiritual entities.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.870
With my people we call
him [NON-ENGLISH],

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.550
our original instructions,
vibrant, beautiful.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.940
And when the Doctrine
of Christian Discovery

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.350
was applied in 1497,
the crystallization

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:40.310
of their presumed sovereignty
rolled out onto our lands,

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:44.320
without our knowledge,
without our consent.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.080
And then a series of events
happened from that moment on,

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.930
the Royal Proclamation,
in the 1700s, consolidated

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.680
with the Doctrine of
Discovery, consolidated

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.530
with the Doctrine of
Discovery, and they took us

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.800
under their wing because
we were not human.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:11.500
We became wards of this colonial
state, and we are not human.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.290
And at that moment, when we
were taken under their wing,

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.977
we see a lot of colonial
policies and laws

00:46:20.977 --> 00:46:21.810
coming out of there.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:27.200
We hear the language, fiduciary,
trust-like, coming out

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.960
of there.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.370
And it's because
we're not human.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:34.210
I keep repeating
that because that's

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.190
what comes out of these
court cases, the Indian Act,

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.420
and everything that
we're hearing today.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:47.910
Then something else happened,
Johnson versus M'Intosh,

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:51.220
in 1923, came out
of here, and then

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.150
Canada took it, and
applied it over there.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:59.530
And then became a
series of case law

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.530
that said we were
parasitic on the underlying

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:05.710
title of the crown.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:08.200
The underlying
title of the crown

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.700
is the Doctrine of Discovery.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.620
You need to understand that.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.370
The Doctrine of Discovery,
in this case law,

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:20.410
has been disguised at the
underlying title of the crown.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:25.910
It's a myth, and a lie
told over, and over again,

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.460
every time we go to court.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:33.490
Every time we go to court
they apply the underlying

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:36.980
title of the crown, which
is a myth, and a lie,

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.950
from the imaginations of
men who brought it here.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:48.520
From there, in Canada, they
created the British North

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.900
America Act, and
they took our lands,

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.860
instantly condemning
us into poverty,

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.990
instantly making them wealthy.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.830
Because in [? 9124 ?] they
took our lands, lands,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:08.960
and Indian lands
reserved for Indians,

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.110
instantly condemning
us into poverty.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.220
A direct connection to
the Doctrine of Discovery,

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.520
because as human
beings, as non-humans,

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:24.730
as non-human beings,
we cannot own property.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:32.620
We had no laws, we were
barbarians, savages.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.520
And then from there they
created the Indian Act,

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.980
and then from there
the number of treaties.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.600
Think about that.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.240
The treaties were
created on the notion

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.390
that our lands have
already been taken.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.530
All of our resources
have already

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.580
been taken by the
Doctrine of Discovery,

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.850
by the underlying
title of the crown.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:01.720
And then from there,
today, even in the US,

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.540
I see that language,
the language

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.900
that they used in calling
us stakeholders, occupiers.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.310
And then we see the
land claims process

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:20.330
that we have to go to their
artificial illegal system

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.390
to gain back our lands.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.970
How ridiculous is that?

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:28.390
How awful is that?

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:31.820
And then we see the
Treaty Land Entitlement,

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.480
Indian residential schools.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.680
You know what the Indian
residential schools did?

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.800
And I'm sure they did
the very same thing here.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.410
We have something in
a number of treaties,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:45.410
and I'm from Treaty 6,
and I've researched this.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:48.900
I even wrote a book called,
Nationhood Interrupted,

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.260
Revitalizing Nehiyaw
Legal Systems,

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.240
and I talk about
this in chapter 4.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.660
And I talk about a treaty
term and promise, where, and

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:05.610
I'm quoting from the treaty
negotiations, where it says,

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:09.310
for a family of-- one square
mile, for a family of five,

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.230
more or less.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:16.160
I have seven children,
eight, including myself.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.570
I'm supposed to be entitled,
by that treaty term

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:23.280
and promise, a one square mile.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.990
I have yet to see that.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.190
It's my dream in my lifetime
that the treaty term

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.030
and promise will be fulfilled.

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.470
But what happened
at the time when

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:36.890
Indian residential schools,
when they came for the children?

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:40.110
How was the fastest way
to prevent a treaty term

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:43.090
and promise from
being fulfilled?

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:43.940
Was the fastest way?

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.420
Anyone guess?

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.900
You take the children.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:54.320
You can no longer meet the
criteria of a family, right.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.240
You take the children.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.990
In total violation
of what we thought

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.770
was an authentic treaty.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.050
And then you see
the conversations

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.570
about self-government.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:17.460
And during this era
we see the Indian Act.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.070
And right away, the first
language you see is,

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.700
an Indian woman cannot vote.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.910
And Indian woman
will lose her status

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:28.120
if she marries a non-Indian man.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:35.680
The target of women was
insidious, insidious.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.000
In 1670 the Jesuits came
looking for my people,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.410
indigenous nehiyaw people.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.380
And they found them
in the James Bay Area.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.660
And if you see the
journals of the Jesuits,

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:53.980
right away they
say, the Cree women

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.800
have far too much
authority and jurisdiction.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.020
We have to eliminate that.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:05.090
It took them a long time,
but they became successful.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:09.370
Today our matrilineal
societies are so decimated,

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:13.855
they're a mere shadow
of what they should be.

00:52:13.855 --> 00:52:18.120
What they should be,
they're a shadow of it.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.610
Another thing happened,
as they were working

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:25.960
to dismantle and abolish the
authority of indigenous women,

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.060
the Original Peoples'
jurisdiction,

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.690
they began to target the women.

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:38.200
In the Indian Act they targeted
the birthright to determine who

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.090
their citizens are by
legislating who they can marry

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:45.460
and who they cannot.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.900
And another thing-- I'm
not for voting, by the way,

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.060
and I'll tell you why
in two minutes or less.

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.720
So, women, under the Indian
Act, were not allowed to vote,

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.260
nor were they allowed
to run for leadership.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:08.210
And when that ended
about, between 1940--

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:12.230
and there's debate
in that-- into 1960,

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.580
another thing happened, they
rolled out the traplines,

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.850
from 1945, to what we see today.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:23.560
And the traplines are
anywhere, from 95% to 98%,

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.803
under the men's names.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.450
The women in my nation have
jurisdiction and authority

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.760
over land and water, because
we carry the water ceremonies.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.640
We carry them.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.010
That has been decimated under
this Doctrine of Discovery.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:44.170
All of us need to
understand, we have

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:50.450
to work collectively and be
very strong in abolishing

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.000
the Doctrine of Discovery.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.370
And what will that mean?

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.510
I don't know.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.880
I'm not sure because
I'm still researching.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.470
This is relatively new to me.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.290
I was blown away when I
was going to law school.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.050
Why weren't we not told that
the underlying title was

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:08.240
the Doctrine of Discovery?

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.900
When we go, and I say this
with all respect, and kindness,

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.770
and I know it's-- I'm not
here to offend anyone,

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.660
nor to demean your work--
but when we go to vote

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.620
in their systems, or to
run in their systems,

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.010
we entrench them, and
we legitimize them,

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:32.320
when we should be
stepping away, and saying,

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:40.580
you do not have authority to
be putting this system out that

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:45.790
dehumanizes women, that
marginalizes women,

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:49.700
continues the patriarchy
and the misogyny,

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.480
especially on indigenous women.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.010
We have missing
or murdered women

00:54:54.010 --> 00:55:00.460
in Canada, the official
numbers, approximately 1,300.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:05.650
The unofficial number
is approximately 4,000.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:10.700
In my own family, my brother
was murdered, two of my aunties

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.840
were murdered.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.700
And that's not a unique story.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:19.635
Every indigenous family that you
talk to, this is their story.

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.020
We have to change that story.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:31.870
We need to believe and
envision a time of freedom

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.940
for indigenous people,
because we do not have it.

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.540
We do not have it.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.770
Not as long as the
Doctrine of Discovery

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:43.180
still applies as the
underlying title, giving

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:49.350
jurisdiction to the colonizer
in an illegal imagining,

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.900
coming from it.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:56:00.160
I want a dream, I have a dream,
that some day, in my lifetime,

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.560
I will see my grandchildren
born in freedom and liberation,

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.260
and self-determination.

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.161
That's my dream.

00:56:09.161 --> 00:56:10.036
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:20.570
I speak my language
today because something

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:24.070
happened that's very unique.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.040
My great grandmother didn't
go to residential school.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.560
When the Indian agent and the
priest came for the children,

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.660
they were hidden away deep
in the forests of my people.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:39.780
My grandmother, same thing,
my mother same thing--

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.970
hidden away.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.430
With me, same
thing, hidden away.

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:46.320
I'm grateful for that today.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.860
Speak my language.
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.324
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:00.777
-Thank you so much, Sylvia.

00:57:00.777 --> 00:57:01.610
That was remarkable.

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:08.460
So we're going to go straight
to audience question and answer.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:14.380
Once again, we have
a mic set up there.

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:20.600
Please form a line behind the
microphone, and approach--

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.820
-Remember, lunch is next.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.980
-Yes, remember lunch
is next, and remember

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.080
that there are other people
who wish to ask questions.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:33.800
So I would ask you all to
keep your questions brief,

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:38.040
in respect of others, and of our
assembled audience and panel.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.570
Thank you.

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:43.250
-I'm Todd Larson, I've
had a long term interest

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.060
in Native American issues.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:52.000
And I recall a 1980s documentary
film called, Broken Rainbow,

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.570
which documented the
continuous displacement

00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:01.040
of Native American reservations
to other parts of Arizona,

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.700
so that those former
reservations could be exploited

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.890
by private companies.

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:09.500
And I remember one
scene, where one

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.460
of the Native American leaders
petitioned senators like,

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.940
Daniel Inouye and
Barry Goldwater,

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:22.340
to stop this relocation,
concluding with the statement,

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:24.330
Congress, wake up.

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:27.880
And the senators refused
to do anything about it.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.120
So I'm wondering if any of you
know if this trend in Arizona

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.470
is still continuing?

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:41.590
Or if any laws have improved
to try to reduce, or eliminate,

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:42.377
this problem?

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:49.319
-Sure, I mean, at least-- what I
think you may be talking about,

00:58:49.319 --> 00:58:50.860
and I'll let other
folks get to this,

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.230
is that there was quite
a dispute in the 1980s

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:58.970
over the Navajo Hopi relocation,
and got on the television

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.370
quite a bit then.

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:03.010
I don't really know
the-- and I'm not

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.010
going to weigh in on how
that issue is resolved.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.800
I think there's still
probably some tensions there.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.900
-Subsurface rights?

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.440
Yeah, there are still issues.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.540
For surface rights,
the HEARTH Act actually

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.620
has-- so, some of it depends
on the treaty language

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.770
of the individual tribes.

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:26.730
But the HEARTH Act removes
the Department of Interior

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:31.200
and the Bureau of Indian Affairs
from managing leasehold rights

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.530
within Indian country.

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:36.960
So, yes, there's a
partial fix, and there

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.160
are some still outstanding.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:40.800
-Thank you.

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.030
-Hi, my name is
Tanya [INAUDIBLE],

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:49.720
I was born as an
Armenian in Turkey.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.230
And Armenian people were
also subjected to genocide,

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:56.130
except we couldn't talk
about it in Turkey.

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:59.700
I am here now with a gratitude
to the Native Peoples,

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.400
obviously, and also fortunate
to have gone to Harvard.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.430
I have two questions, one is,
how do you feel about the fact

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:17.090
that it has not been
officially acknowledged

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:21.550
that Native American people
were subjected to genocide?

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:24.800
And the second one,
my second question

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.220
is about domestic
violence issues,

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:34.100
how do you feel about
whether those who perpetrate

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.970
domestic violence, if they
are Indians themselves,

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.530
should they be judged
only in Indian courts,

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.470
or should there be
appeals, should they also

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.141
be subject to US persecution?

01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:46.640
Thank you.

01:00:50.919 --> 01:00:51.460
-[INAUDIBLE].

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.340
-Regarding the domestic
violence issue,

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.930
there is quite a
bit of attention

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:02.330
right now in Indian
country around

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.940
building more robust
tribal court system,

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:10.060
including wellness courts.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:15.090
So, when you look at a
lot of crime, regardless

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:17.810
of the race of the
perpetrator, sometimes

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.800
that's a symptom
of something else,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.760
whether it's mental health
issues, chemical dependency.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.320
So what you want to do is get
at the root of the issues.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.290
And then there's also
around reconciliation

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.060
in the community,
restorative justice

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.520
issues, and more traditional
ways of handling crime.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.570
So an awfully big
push right now, quite

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:45.680
a number of federal agencies,
a whole robust system

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.456
of doing an assessment
process in the community.

01:01:48.456 --> 01:01:50.330
Of not only, what do
they need to do to build

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.330
their tribal court system?

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.880
But a set of holistic services
around the court system

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.900
so you can work on actually
getting better, rather than

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.150
just throwing them in jail, and
throwing away our men, women,

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.820
or perpetrators.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.800
Now I'll let him
take the other issue.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.300
No?

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.750
-I don't-- I don't have anything

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.890
-Sylvia, did you want to
talk to the woman's question

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:19.730
about acknowledgement
of genocide, or no?

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:20.480
You don't have to.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.910
-I think at this point, until
we revitalize our own systems

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:38.030
of justice, as in limitation
to the English language,

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:43.960
I think utilizing both systems
is acceptable because sometimes

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.840
I notice that decisions are not
exactly healthy when they come

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.870
out of our own systems because
of the effects of colonization,

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.490
right?

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:58.130
Those are the effects of that
patriarchy and the misogyny,

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:00.320
and the hatred against women.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.510
And one of the examples
to that, that I talk about

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:07.360
is, I recently ran for Indian
Act chief in my system,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.100
to try and disrupt some of
those narratives, right?

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:15.420
We've never had a woman for
chief, or a woman in council.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.820
And while I was running I
was told, in the language,

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.420
I was told [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.400
It means, women don't
belong in leadership.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.450
You go home and
make [? bannock. ?]

01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:35.080
And I'm one of higher
educated people there.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.590
But that gives you an idea
of some of the dynamics

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.760
that we have to deal
with in the community,

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.780
and that's the effects
of colonization.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:45.089
So both systems,
I would support.

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:45.630
Both systems.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:51.300
-I think we're going to move
on to the next question.

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:51.900
Thank you.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.590
Go ahead.

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.102
-It'd be nice to
hear you're sorry.

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.020
-I'm Tunica-Biloxi, and
Mississippi Choctaw,

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.340
enrolled in the Tunica-Biloxi
Tribe of Louisiana.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.230
My name is Jean-Luc
[INAUDIBLE] To our membership,

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:07.220
our governments operate
under the assumption

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.470
that to get forward
legislatively we

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:11.220
have to ante up
hundreds of thousands

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.720
of dollars in
lobbying expenditures.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.460
What can we do to organize our
communities, our Indian people,

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.170
to combat moneyed interests
and lobbyists that

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:21.940
may influence our councils?

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:25.350
Because with IRA constitutions
and unilateral governments

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:28.110
our sovereignty is abused
more often than not.

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.760
-I know that some
tribes have adopted

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.930
ethical rules, internal ethical
rules, about the kinds of gifts

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.060
that tribal council members
can receive in order

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.240
to address that issue.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.020
It's becoming, I think,
more and more common.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.250
It used to be that there
weren't a lot of resources

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.040
around the tribes, I mean, there
wasn't a great deal of interest

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.860
in influencing tribal council.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.520
But now that there's more
money involved, there is.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.190
So tribes, these days,
they're in a position

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.270
where they need to think
about internal ethical rules.

01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:07.880
-And mineral rights,
as well, are at stake.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.536
-Can I follow up on that just
for the panel really quickly?

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:17.700
In the past 40, or 50
years, some tribes-- and I'm

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.970
speaking mainly of what
I know about the US,

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:24.230
and less about
First Nations-- have

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:27.410
become wealthier, have
become more powerful,

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.960
and others much less.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.690
And so there's been
this divergence.

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:36.820
And what does that fact of
wealthier tribes and less

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.680
wealthy tribes, and potentially
that divergence in wealth

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.990
and power, mean for the kind
of coalitions that you build,

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:48.060
that you've built others?

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.260
and, does it create
more tensions,

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.480
does it create opportunities?

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.120
How do you deal with this
kind of changing landscape

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.260
of wealthier, more powerful,
and less powerful, less wealthy,

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.540
tribal governments?

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.630
-How has the United States
dealt with less wealthy states--

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.130
-Yes, well--

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:12.260
---that are next door
to wealthier states?

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.636
-Yeah, that's-- I
don't know, so--

01:06:15.636 --> 01:06:16.990
-Do I have to say more?

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.824
-OK.

01:06:17.824 --> 01:06:18.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.351
-You need not.

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:19.850
-OK.

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:24.932
-Next question.

01:06:24.932 --> 01:06:27.172
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:27.172 --> 01:06:29.630
-My name's Nancy Krieger, I'm
a professor at the Harvard TH

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:31.090
Chan School of Public Health.

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:32.550
I'm here very much
today to learn,

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:35.470
and very appreciative of
this day and the panel.

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:37.720
And my question
to you is, health

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.170
becomes a way of uniting
many different sectors

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:41.920
in government, many
different coalitions,

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.080
in and outside of government,
and provides a lens for change

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.049
that's for good.

01:06:47.049 --> 01:06:48.590
And I'm just wondering
if each of you

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:51.270
could reflect on ways that you
think people in public health

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:54.680
can be working more
effectively, efficaciously,

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.070
cross collaboratively,
cross-sectorly,

01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:59.089
where health fits
in, right to health,

01:06:59.089 --> 01:07:01.630
to advance the kinds of concerns
that you were talking about.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:04.960
Because I think that there's
a particular responsibility

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.440
and obligation, within
the [INAUDIBLE] to do so.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.970
And I also think there's a
lot to learn and benefit from.

01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:11.843
So I just be really
curious, just as-- this

01:07:11.843 --> 01:07:13.712
is an open-ended
question with no agenda,

01:07:13.712 --> 01:07:15.670
other than to learn, and
to hear your thoughts,

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:16.503
and your challenges.

01:07:19.374 --> 01:07:20.290
-I'll give one answer.

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.250
I think one of the
great advances,

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.000
recently, was the passage of the
Indian Health Care Improvement

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.950
Act, as a part of the
Affordable Care Act.

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:31.000
And tribes now have the ability
to define their own service

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.270
populations, and provide
services to anyone,

01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:35.740
and then to do
third-party billing,

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.410
whether it's to
Medicare, or Medicaid,

01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:39.880
or the VA, or private insurance.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.240
And some tribes are becoming
regional health care providers.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.180
I know of tribes out
in the Northwest,

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.220
you know, they've got
26 doctors on staff,

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.442
they're setting up facilities.

01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:51.900
At least, I think
that, that may be

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.483
one of the great
opportunities coming,

01:07:53.483 --> 01:07:57.030
is for tribes to really expand
providing health care, not

01:07:57.030 --> 01:08:00.090
just to their own community,
but to everybody around them.

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.090
And then through that
being able to increase

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:04.170
the amount of services they can
provide to their own members,

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:04.670
as well.

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:10.300
-So we continue to
face a public health

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.760
crisis in Indian country.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.480
The average age of
death in the 70s,

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.020
for a Native American
person, was around 56.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:22.029
Now that number, I
believe, is in the low 70s,

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:25.590
still well below the
national average.

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.000
A lot of chronic
conditions, particularly

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.510
hit hard by diabetes,
which many attribute

01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:36.330
to the quick change in diet
in the reservation system.

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:40.060
Additionally, the
reservations themselves,

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:44.620
and how isolated they are,
and coupled with poverty,

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.620
and things like that--
even though I was teasing

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:50.950
him-- create food
deserts, and things

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:54.069
like that, which they catch
up with you later, obviously,

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:56.479
in terms of chronic conditions.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:09:01.319
Indian Health Service continues
to be funded at only about 48%

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.930
of defined need.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:07.069
Before the Obama administration
it was in the 30s, 30%,

01:09:07.069 --> 01:09:10.340
so even though we've done
well, and getting it better,

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.720
it's still not adequate.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.890
Attracting and retaining quality
staff in the Indian country

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.480
remains a hardship,
because there's

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.479
a lack of workforce,
housing-- so these are just

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.920
like huge complex issues.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.830
On the other hand,
you've seen tribes

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:26.330
under self-governance,
who have made

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:30.229
huge inroads in terms
of public health,

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:34.899
and really restructuring
how they deliver

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:38.270
care, one, around cultural
competency, but also,

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:39.825
really a holistic approach.

01:09:39.825 --> 01:09:41.450
You can go in and
get your ear checked,

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:44.649
and they're going to check
your toes if you're diabetic.

01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:47.020
And even if you're
not diabetic, so

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.710
that we're no longer
managing the outcomes,

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:51.800
we're managing health.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.500
There's-- and getting back
to traditional food sources,

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.370
you know, there's this big
cycle of what goes around comes

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:03.100
around, and this ties
back to our, one,

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.120
right to health care as part
of the Trust Responsibility,

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.500
and a treaty right, but also
the ties that we have around

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.420
managing natural resources,
and our rights to hunt, fish,

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.340
and gather.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.810
And get our people back
to those traditional food

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:21.270
sources, where it leads
to better health outcomes.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:23.909
But the quality of
that resource matters.

01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:25.450
We can't tell our
people to eat fish,

01:10:25.450 --> 01:10:28.100
if our fish have
too much mercury.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.290
We can't harvest wild
rice if the water

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:33.050
is of such poor
condition that it

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:36.970
reduces the quality
of the harvest,

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.400
and on, and on, and on.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.250
So, it's not as
simple as saying,

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.410
more doctors, more
health education,

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.190
it is about being better.

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:47.650
Being better to our planet,
being better to our community,

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:50.640
making sure that they have
access, and the economics,

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.760
to have a well-rounded
diet, and to be

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:56.710
able to afford-- I bought an
apple the other day, it was $1.

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.720
A whole dollar, you
know what I mean?

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.730
And so, when we
tell our families,

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:06.500
you need to have access
to fruits and vegetables,

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.980
you need access to an
economy to make that happen,

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.330
and too many of our
reservation communities

01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:15.960
still don't have as robust
access to a living wage.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.460
-The other thing I
would suggest is,

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.710
being an ally to the
indigenous peoples,

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:25.600
or the Original
Peoples close by here,

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.310
and ask them, and approach
them, what is it that you need?

01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:29.700
What can we do to support you?

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.100
They absolutely
have the answers.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:37.790
In my own community, after
I didn't get in for chief,

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.630
I went-- I'm not
a political person

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:42.690
by any stretch of
the imagination.

01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:45.000
I'm not an activist or
an environmentalist,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.590
I am a defender and
protector of my homelands.

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:51.740
When I was going door to
door, and I found this man

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.840
in just a inhumane situation.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.540
He had been homeless
for 15 years,

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.810
he dug a hole in the ground,
and basically put some boards

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:01.860
together.

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:06.040
And yet, our reserve
built a $450,000 church

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.830
almost literally
right beside him.

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:13.980
See, there's these-- just
a conflict in ideology.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.670
Anyway, I told him, even if
I don't get in for chief,

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.990
I was going to see
what I could do.

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:23.873
I don't want to leave you the
impression that I work alone,

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:25.100
I don't.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.450
I just have an idea and
some brilliant people

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.060
bring it to life.

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.690
I work with really incredibly,
incredibly powerful corps

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.160
of people.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.660
And we decided that
we would fund-raise.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:41.480
So we fund-raised for him,
and we raised about $25,000.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.480
And today he has a mini
home that's self-sustaining,

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.800
and it's built from material
that is eco-friendly.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.410
So now he has a home,
but it's healthy.

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:59.650
But you should see him
today, he's about 45,

01:12:59.650 --> 01:13:01.560
but he looks much
older than that.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.740
Because that's what stress
and injustice does to people,

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.890
it ages them.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:12.310
But today he has a home,
and it's off the grid.

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.634
All of us will go without
power, but he won't even notice.

01:13:15.634 --> 01:13:16.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.342
He has a wood stove that
can generate electricity,

01:13:19.342 --> 01:13:20.190
-Cool.

01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:21.700
-Right?

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.900
That's the law of our people.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.690
You live it, you don't just
talk about it, you live it.

01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:31.640
If you see injustice you try
to do something about it.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.780
And I do little actions to try
and live our self-determination

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.490
already.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:40.960
But reach out to the indigenous
people, to the Original

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.970
Peoples, and ask
them, what can we

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:47.830
do to support you in abolishing
the Doctrine of Discovery?

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:51.140
So that there's a way
to begin the dialogue,

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.710
to get your lands back, so
that you get your health back.

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:58.210
Because shelter, health, land,
is everything, everything.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.300
-Unfortunately-- can you make
your question very, very brief?

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.850
I'll make it as brief as I
possibly can, is that OK?

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:09.410
-Yeah.

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.382
-I'm Jamie Bissonnette Lewey.

01:14:11.382 --> 01:14:14.340
I'm Abenaki, from
Odanak First Nation,

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:17.140
but I'm also the chair of
the Maine Indian Tribal State

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.380
Commission.

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:22.220
And as-- many of the
Northeast tribes,

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.810
here, are subject to restrictive
settlement acts, which are more

01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:28.730
onerous than Public Law 280.

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:32.900
I'm wondering, Sylvia,
if you could comment

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:39.850
on the impact that acknowledged
treaty reservations might have

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:45.740
on these laws, and the
protections, and preservation,

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.580
of existence and
natural resources?

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.690
Because in the laws--
is the treaties.

01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:56.950
And then, perhaps,
attorney Dossett,

01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:03.160
how the settlement
acts impact both VAWA,

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:09.970
and Collins Colloquy
on the Stafford Act?

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:12.220
Thank you.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.790
-I would suggest--
and this is what's

01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:17.270
happening in my
homelands over there,

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.790
and that's what
started, Idle No More.

01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:23.510
It was us talking about
our inherent structures,

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.390
and our laws.

01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:28.130
Now, the Canadian
government is inviting us

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:30.840
to the table saying, hey,
let's talk about your laws,

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.810
how can we apply them?

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:36.050
But we have to be
careful in how it--

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:42.250
is it going to be immersed
into that colonial, artificial,

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:45.240
structure of governance, right?

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.290
Is it going to get
assimilated in there,

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.630
or is it going to be
a separate entity?

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:53.770
And this is going to be a
dialogue for all indigenous,

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:55.270
or Original Peoples.

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:58.640
And I suggest to you
to begin revisiting,

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.600
what are your laws to the water?

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.910
What are your laws to the land?

01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:09.770
What is your constitution
that must begin incorporating

01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:11.570
all of these laws?

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:13.530
And I talk about
that in my book.

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:16.480
And if you could get
a hold of my book,

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.500
and it's available through my
publisher, Purich Publishing.

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.600
And you could use
it as a template.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.380
I'm not saying is the
answer to everything,

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.770
but at least it
will guide a seed

01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:32.330
into beginning to
talk about your laws.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:36.140
Because we're not a lawless
people, we are not lawless.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.150
We have beautiful laws.

01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:41.370
And they weren't perfect,
but they're beautiful,

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:42.124
and they did work.

01:16:42.124 --> 01:16:44.540
And those are the kind of
things that your community needs

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.720
to talk about.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.720
We need to start
acting like nations.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.720
-On the Stafford Act--
just very quickly--

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.135
I think that what you mention
is a very good example

01:16:55.135 --> 01:16:57.010
of the problem with the
Maine Settlement Act.

01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:59.594
That when the Stafford
Act came through,

01:16:59.594 --> 01:17:02.010
there actually was this debate
with the Maine legislators,

01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:04.080
like, should the
Maine tribes really be

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.510
able to-- if there's a
flood, or a storm, you know,

01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:09.460
should they be able to get a
disaster declaration so they

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:10.770
could get emergency relief?

01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:13.270
And people in the state were
like questioning whether that's

01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:15.000
a good idea, like, you know,
the state should really

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.420
have jurisdiction over them.

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.570
I think the colloquy
was intended

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:21.620
to help the tribes in
Maine get over that.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.300
But I think it's just an
example of what a problem

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.780
the Maine Settlement Act
is, and it's something

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.650
we need to keep working on.

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:30.480
-Thank you.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.270
Karen Diver, John
Dossett, Sylvia McAdam,

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:34.212
thank you so much.

01:17:34.212 --> 01:17:36.610
