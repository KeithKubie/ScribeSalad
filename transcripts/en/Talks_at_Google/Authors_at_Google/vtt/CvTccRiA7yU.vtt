[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.247
RYAN SERHANT: Thanks.

00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:12.730
PAUL DARRAH: You're welcome.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.620
RYAN SERHANT: Hello.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.280
How's work?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.245
This is a cool place.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:20.620
PAUL DARRAH: It's
not a bad spot.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.129
We have our own real estate.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:22.920
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.660
You're the real estate guy.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.280
PAUL DARRAH: I'm
the real estate guy.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.184
It's exciting to interview
the other real estate guy.

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:29.350
RYAN SERHANT: I love doing
deals with Google people.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.200
It's great.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.567
You always know they can close.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:32.066
You know?

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:32.409
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.492
PAUL DARRAH: That's right.

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:35.409
RYAN SERHANT: Which is
really important to me.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.158
PAUL DARRAH: Well,
it's a big talent pool.

00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:39.120
We have 10,000
Googlers in New York.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.000
RYAN SERHANT: I know.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.650
PAUL DARRAH: I don't think
you've sold to all of them yet.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.620
RYAN SERHANT: No, not yet.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.970
PAUL DARRAH: Not yet.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.570
RYAN SERHANT: Not yet.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.445
PAUL DARRAH: Not yet.

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:45.790
RYAN SERHANT: That is the goal.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.831
PAUL DARRAH: So why don't
we start-- in the book,

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.850
you talked about your
childhood growing up,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.020
opposite to the
guy you see on TV,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.830
and I thought that would
be a great place to start.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.020
RYAN SERHANT: [LAUGH] Great.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.874
Yeah, a lot of people--

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:03.040
most people know me from
"Million Dollar Listing New

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.170
York," which started in 2012.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.090
I was cast on it in 2010.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.750
How I got cast on
that is totally--

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.910
it's like book number two.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.700
But I think I was kind of
the opposite person when

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.820
I was a little kid.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.760
Like, the anti-salesperson,
which was a big

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.320
push for me to write the book.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.620
Like, I didn't necessarily
write it for great sales people

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.780
out there, who are crushing it
and at the top of their class.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.280
Right?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280
I mean, I think those
people should also get it.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.880
But I really wrote
it for the people

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.810
who were like me, who were
super shy, introverted.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.160
I moved eight times
before I hit fourth grade.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.410
I was really overweight.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.620
I had really bad
self-confidence.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.857
I just liked theater.

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:45.190
My parents made me play every
single sport known to man,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.314
hoping I would get over it.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.700
My whole family's in finance.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.590
Everyone's very
business oriented,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.960
and I just wanted to do
theater and come to New York

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.640
after college, which no
one approved of whatsoever.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.130
And then I ran out
of money, right?

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.500
I mean, that's kind
of classic story.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.610
I moved here in 2006.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.780
I went to Hamilton College
in upstate New York.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.509
I was a Theater major,
also English Lit

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.600
because my parents made me.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.020
And I gave myself two
years on summer savings,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.820
and it lasted me two years.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.999
And I ran out of money and
didn't know what to do.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.540
And it was either
go home to Colorado

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.574
and paint fence for
the rest of my life--

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:28.990
which was an actual summer job
I had, painting wood fence.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.390
There's a lot of
it in Colorado--

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.810
or figure out something.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.790
I had a friend of
mine who was like,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.873
listen, don't be a waiter.

00:02:34.873 --> 00:02:36.100
Don't be a bartender.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.480
Get your real estate license.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.990
The market's insane.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.540
This was the summer of 2008.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.650
PAUL DARRAH: Your
timing was impeccable.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.400
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.650
Yeah, I could not
tell the future yet.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.860
PAUL DARRAH: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.010
And as a real estate
guy for Lehman Brothers

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.460
when it went under, I know
what your first day of work

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.960
was like.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.762
So you started the
day Lehman collapsed.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.220
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah,
September 15th.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.673
PAUL DARRAH: Yeah.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:55.580
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah, 2008.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.940
PAUL DARRAH: It was a big--

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.648
RYAN SERHANT: Which,
for a lot of people,

00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:58.960
was a really awful day.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.470
For me--

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.803
PAUL DARRAH: I was one of those.

00:03:00.803 --> 00:03:02.120
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.610
And it's tough.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.970
I had a lot of friends
who worked at Lehman.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.140
But for me, I had no money.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.470
I was either, figure out
this real estate thing

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.630
or go home to Colorado.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.000
And I had gotten my
real estate license.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.690
It didn't really
all make sense to me

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.481
yet what was really
happening in the world.

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.010
Because if you're
living in New York

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.426
City trying to be
an actor, you're

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:23.710
not watching CNBC every day.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.950
And you have no money.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.320
So you don't watch the markets.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.640
You don't really know.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.250
And I just though real
estate was the hardest thing

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.466
in the history of the world.

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:33.340
I just figured that
everyone in New York City

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.207
lost their jobs all the time.

00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:37.540
Those first two years, I mean,
every client I would get,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.232
they would lose their
job in 2008 and 2009.

00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:42.190
And they wouldn't be able
to afford apartments.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.022
So in hindsight, it was
the absolute best time

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.230
for me to start, because
every broker was getting out

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.605
of the business,
because they all

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.880
called the end of the world.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.520
And, for me, I was there to
kind of pick up the pieces

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.180
and just sort of figure
it out as I went.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.919
PAUL DARRAH: So you talk about
improv as a training ground.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.710
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.750
PAUL DARRAH: So spend
a minute on that.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.610
RYAN SERHANT: The most
important training

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.610
I ever did to be a real estate
agent was taking improv classes

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.930
in high school and college.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.740
And I still make everyone
who works for me take improv.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.510
Because the most
important thing you

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.050
can do as a salesperson is
learn how to listen and learn

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.067
how to act on your feet.

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:23.650
And those are two things that a
lot of people think they have,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.990
but it's a real muscle.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.740
To be able to think on your
feet and never use the word "no"

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.010
is a really kind of
hard thing to do.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.520
Because most people will say,
"um," "like," "right," or

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.305
"let me think."

00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:39.940
That's how we grow up.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.160
But to be able to
say "yes, and,"

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.370
over and over and over to
whatever your client is saying,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.250
it really, really helped me
a lot when I first started.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.550
PAUL DARRAH: How many
people have taken improv

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.560
in the audience?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.910
OK, so we have some work to do.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.560
RYAN SERHANT: It's important,
especially because-- yeah,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.400
exactly--

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.740
because it's really scary,
especially as you get older.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.990
I was just fortunate that I
took it when I was younger

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.190
and then thought it was fun.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.610
But once you get older,
you're more self-aware,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.380
and you don't like to
embarrass yourself.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.879
And so that's actually when
it's more fun, because it's just

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.780
ridiculous to watch people.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.616
And you should just go
watch improv classes,

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:15.740
just because they're funny.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.823
They have them everywhere.

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:19.480
And they're like $5 or $10.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.155
And you just create situations.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.780
And in sales, that's
what you're doing.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.950
You're negotiating
people's emotions,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.380
and there's no script for that.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.460
You're figuring
it out as you go,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.194
and that's what improv has
taught me and taught the team.

00:05:31.194 --> 00:05:33.610
PAUL DARRAH: I think the other
big observation you have is

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.930
that in real estate
sales and TV,

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.599
the first impressions
are literally everything.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:40.390
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.950
And if you're not
careful, they're

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.500
also your last
impression, right?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.640
PAUL DARRAH: So give an example
of where that moment occurred,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.995
where you were at risk
of the last impression.

00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:55.370
RYAN SERHANT:
Probably when I met

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.587
you and I didn't look up from
my phone, so I apologize.

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:00.170
I was just in the
middle of something.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.360
PAUL DARRAH: Well, he was
eating Raisin Bran, as well.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.030
RYAN SERHANT: Also that.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.869
You guys have food
here, which is great.

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:04.910
I'm a real estate broker.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.326
Every time I see food, I'm
like, ooh, I've got to survive.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.560
You know, just take
it really simply.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.290
I didn't write the book
for real estate agents.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.039
I mean, my life is as
a real estate agent.

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.660
But I really wrote
it for anyone who

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.880
just wants to do
better and do more,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.370
whether they're selling
digital advertising,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.059
or they're selling
themselves to their boss

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.600
to get a bigger
promotion, or they're

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.060
trying to convince their
kids to go to bed on time,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.100
or they're trying to
pay down student debt.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.900
I wrote it for everybody.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.660
But put yourself
in the shoes of,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.320
you're walking into a store.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.512
And someone comes up
to you and they say--

00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:39.720
what do people typically say?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.960
Like, "Hey, can I help
you with anything?"

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.720
And what do you say?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.850
"No, thanks."

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.622
Right?

00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:47.830
For the most part, you say,
"No, thanks," because you

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.205
don't really want
to be bothered,

00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:50.970
and it's a salesperson,
and it's gross.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.790
Like, no, no, it's fine.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.060
I got it.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.361
I'm looking at shoes over here.

00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:53.860
Right?

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.440
And then they'll say, "Hey.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.140
OK, let me know if
you need anything."

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.310
And then they walk away.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.270
That is every salesperson
in every store

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.780
in the entire world.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.830
So you have to remember that
every client interaction

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.430
you have is just like you
would be making a friend

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.110
or meeting a future
boyfriend or a girlfriend.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.180
I mean, could you
imagine going into a bar,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.870
and tapping on someone's
shoulder randomly and saying,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.894
"Hey, let me know if
you need anything."

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:19.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.610
Like, how do you
think that would go?

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.220
You could get super
lucky and they could say,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.610
"Actually, I do need something,"
and then that's a one-off deal.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.322
But, for the most part,
everyone is going to say,

00:07:31.322 --> 00:07:32.030
"You're with me?"

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.720
OK.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.400
So, for the most part, people
are going to say, "No, no.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.130
I'm OK," or, "That's
weird," right?

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.610
So that's a bad
first impression,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.890
which is now the last
impression you're going

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.190
to have of that salesperson.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.690
Right?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.427
A different way is to
introduce yourself.

00:07:43.427 --> 00:07:45.760
Introduce yourself and start
with something super simple

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.500
like a compliment, right?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.260
Most people think about the
clothes they're putting on

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.540
or think about their
ridiculous mustache

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.210
that they grew out to
try to sell books or--

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.196 --> 00:07:59.147
--mm-hmm, true story--
or something, right?

00:07:59.147 --> 00:08:01.480
Or if they have a kid with
them, you compliment the kid.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.580
Something small, just
to get them to smile

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.650
and to start a
positive interaction.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.320
I swear to you, it
works every time.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.569
I've gone into stores
to buy a pair of socks.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:12.610
Someone has come up to
me, introduced themselves,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.330
and complimented
me on something,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.022
and I've left with,
like, a canoe.

00:08:16.022 --> 00:08:17.170
[LAUGTER]

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.510
And maybe that's just
because I'm gullible,

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.460
but also it works, right?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.460
You're building that trust
in that first impression,

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.440
and you have less than
20 seconds to do it.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.476
Oftentimes, you have
less than 10 seconds.

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:30.100
Every relationship,
even with your best

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.390
friend or your partner, started
with a 10-second introduction.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.710
And with the people you know
that you're friendly with,

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.510
it worked.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.830
Other people, it didn't work.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.138
So I talk a lot about
how to make it work more.

00:08:41.138 --> 00:08:43.179
PAUL DARRAH: And then,
how about at the other end

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.550
of the spectrum, the
indecisive client.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.270
Because we all have indecisive
bosses and associates,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.950
how do you manage the
indecisive client?

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.730
RYAN SERHANT: Good question.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.050
I broke down as
much as I could--

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.450
you know how there's
the six stages of grief

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.060
and then the types of tornadoes?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.150
I always, when I got into
the business, really,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.660
kind of thought of sales, like
the six stages of selling, what

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.280
emotional clients go through.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.863
Because they go
through their grieving

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:15.467
period, their denial period,
their excited period.

00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:17.550
And you have to walk them
through all those steps.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.091
And the best
salespeople are the ones

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.750
who can anticipate
it, like an ER doctor.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.420
They know when this
next emotional phase

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.480
is going to hit, so you can
prepare how your conversation

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.880
is going to lead
into that moment,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.720
kind of like a
psychologist, right?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.960
But people who
are indecisive are

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.300
people who are insecure
about the decision

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.550
that they're going
to make anyway.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.620
At the end of the day, a
lot of indecisive people

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.980
we know, they end up
making a decision.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.950
They're just really
self-conscious or insecure

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.202
about their intelligence
or something,

00:09:49.202 --> 00:09:50.910
and you have to help
them get comfortable

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.750
and figure out how to get there.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.680
And a lot of it is just
laying out options.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.130
So kind of the way I just talked
to you about first impressions,

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.060
and it could have
been super boring

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.999
but I made it relative by
talking about dating in a bar.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:05.790
And then people laugh
and they're like, oh,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.998
that is kind of the same way.

00:10:06.998 --> 00:10:08.370
Oh, interesting.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.740
Same thing with people
who are indecisive.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.980
It's figuring out a way to
make it relatable to them.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.790
And if you have a client
or a boss, or somebody,

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.860
you figure out what they
like to do personally.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.510
So you track them
on social media,

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.810
let's say, and you figure out
that they really like cats,

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.650
or they really like golf, or
they're really into the Jets.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.670
I don't know,
something like that.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.440
You try to--
without telling them

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.492
that you internet stalked
them, you figure out,

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:34.950
in your conversation
with them, how

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.616
to make whatever the
situation is you're

00:10:36.616 --> 00:10:39.560
talking about relatable to
something they really like.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.660
Like, I understand you
want to take your time,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.560
but if Sam Darnold had taken
his time in his first game

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.960
out, he might not have
won that first game, huh?

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.050
And then that guy's going to be
like, dude, you're a Jets fan?

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.130
I mean, sure.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.270
Yeah, now I am.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.080
Oh, crazy!

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.580
Yeah, anyway the
real reason I don't

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.399
want to do this is
because of x, y, and z.

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.940
Because now it's on
a personal level,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.870
now they're thinking
about something

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.820
they really like, plus
you made it relatable,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.890
and it's just how you
present that information

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.869
versus that salesperson
who just says,

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:08.160
"Can I help you with anything?"

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.755
"No."

00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:10.380
"OK, let me know if
you need anything."

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.910
"Great."

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.449
That's most people.

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:15.240
PAUL DARRAH: And so
you talk about the four

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.749
tenets of work, the four Ws.

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:18.540
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.700
PAUL DARRAH: So it's the
Why, the Work, your Wall,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.360
and the When.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.900
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.820
PAUL DARRAH: Spend a
little time on the wall.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.330
RYAN SERHANT: So when I
first got into the business,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.250
I had no boss.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.917
I had no mentor.

00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:33.916
I went to a brokerage
called Nest Seekers, which

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:34.864
is still there.

00:11:34.864 --> 00:11:36.280
There's like 800
agents there now.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.660
When I was there,
it was like 20--

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.910
above Burger Heaven
on 49th and Madison.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.100
And didn't really have a mentor.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.660
No one told me what to do.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.400
All the direction
I was given was,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.610
find apartments that are in
other cities that look cool.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.230
Post them on Craigslist.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.520
Use really good pricing.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.960
Meet people at Starbucks.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.380
Take them to other apartments.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.530
That was the New York City
rental broker way of life

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.040
up until, like, 2009.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.200
And so I didn't want to do that.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.640
That seemed super weird to me.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.139
And I wanted to figure out how
I was going to actually build

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:12.980
a sales business, and how I was
going to build a sales career

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.250
and not just be someone who
lived deal by deal by deal.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.080
Or somebody who woke
up a year from now

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.850
and said, "Wow,
last year was great,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.650
but it was also the
same exact kind of year

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.566
that I had the year
before and the year before

00:12:23.566 --> 00:12:24.800
and the year before."

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.960
And I had looked at
all the top performers

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.920
in the business and all the top
companies, like all the Fortune

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.300
500 companies.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.710
And they all had really,
really strong through lines

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.900
to how they figured out what
they were working against.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.950
Like what's Google's
kind of through line?

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.450
Right?

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.150
They're trying to make the
internet a better place,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.822
more searchable, all that stuff,
something like that, right?

00:12:49.822 --> 00:12:51.280
You guys would know
better than me.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.238
PAUL DARRAH: Anybody want
to cover the mission?

00:12:53.238 --> 00:12:55.530
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah, I'm
sure it's out there.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.400
And so, for me, I
wanted to figure out,

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.320
what's that thing that
I'm running against,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.310
as much as possible.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.770
And as an individual
salesperson,

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.370
it has to be something personal.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.500
So for me, the wall is that
moment in the summer of 2008,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.070
when my debit card was declined
at Food Emporium on 59th

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.492
Street, buying
tofu, of all things,

00:13:15.492 --> 00:13:16.700
and I didn't know what to do.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.741
And I really freaked out,
and I just took my card

00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:20.810
and ran out, and
jumped on the subway,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.730
and sat next to
some random person,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.950
and just tried to
hold back tears.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.620
Because that was the
moment I was like,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.130
this New York thing sucks.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.784
I hate it.

00:13:29.784 --> 00:13:30.450
I don't like it.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.450
I don't want to be here.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.320
I just want to go home.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.120
And then I decided to
get into real estate.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.840
And that's the moment I
run from every single day.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.820
And it sounds kind of
crazy, but everyone

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.530
needs to have that wall, right?

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.140
Maybe you work at Google, but
before this you did another job

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.850
that you really
didn't like, and you

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.990
don't want to go
back to that job

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.406
because this is
now super awesome.

00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:51.620
You have free cereal.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.376
That other job is your wall.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.000
Or maybe you just
love New York so much

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.730
and you don't want to move home
to Colorado to paint fence,

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.260
or whatever your story is.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.860
That, then, is your wall.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.310
Or maybe you were bullied
in high school, like I was,

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.460
and you want to show those
people who the [POP] is boss.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.670
That's your wall.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.930
So for me, it was figuring out
that moment on that subway.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.150
And I'll run as far
away from that moment,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.699
for the rest of my
life, as possible.

00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:17.240
And the others are
really just trying

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.010
to get clear with your goals.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.504
Companies have goals.

00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:21.920
Companies have
mission statements.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.200
Why shouldn't individual
people have the same thing?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.180
Why shouldn't
individual salespeople

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.600
have the same thing?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.129
You should also have
what your win is.

00:14:30.129 --> 00:14:31.670
That's kind of the
mission statement.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.980
So, for me, my win
with doing "Sell It

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.355
Like Serhant" for Bravo
and then writing this book,

00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:38.720
I think that I'll
always do real estate,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.780
but I really have found
that my passion is helping

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.440
other people increase the
quality of their lives

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.000
through selling.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.610
Because selling is
the greatest career

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.310
you could have, because no
one will ever take it away

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.920
from you, and you will
never be unemployed,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.430
especially in a volatile work
market the way we have it now.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.590
I, right now, am unemployed.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.480
I don't get a W-2.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.540
I get a 1099.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.910
I eat what I kill
every single day.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.720
I'm a very successful,
unemployed, employed person.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.120
And that's the greatest thing,
because I get fired every week.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.240
Clients fire me all the
time, just because that's

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.660
what happens in this business.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.450
But it's OK, because
I have other clients,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.726
and they make up for it.

00:15:18.726 --> 00:15:20.600
I don't ever want to
put myself in a position

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.680
where everything in my life
could be held by one place.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.930
And as a salesperson, you
have that amazing talent

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.710
to take that anywhere, whether
it's here or somewhere else.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.790
PAUL DARRAH: So in the show, you
parlay your real estate sales

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.490
into supporting
and helping people

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.370
who are in different
stages of their life

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.250
and their state of kind of--

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.140
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.056
PAUL DARRAH: How do you
pick those candidates,

00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:47.390
and what's been your
greatest success in terms

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.355
of individuals?

00:15:50.355 --> 00:15:52.730
RYAN SERHANT: There was a
casting process that Bravo did.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.670
They sent out casting
notices everywhere

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.100
and then just got lots of
submissions from people.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.609
It was hard to cast.

00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:02.150
Because the show
only made sense if I

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.810
was working with really bad
salespeople who were literally

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.460
about to lose their jobs.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.250
And then the business had
to agree to go on camera.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.394
Their families had to
agree to go on camera.

00:16:12.394 --> 00:16:14.060
The bosses had to
agree to go on camera.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.860
So there was a
whole process to it.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.010
So it was hard to find people
that wanted to put themselves

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.390
out there like that.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.004
But I think the most
successful person--

00:16:24.004 --> 00:16:25.670
I don't know if you've
watched the show,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.380
but there is kind of two.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.630
There was one guy who sold wine.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.060
His name was Tim, in Millbrook.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.420
And he let me know that he was a
recovering addict, when I first

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.410
met him, which was really
tough, because he sold wine.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.550
But that was all
he knew how to do.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.970
He got addicted to heroin
outside Phoenix when

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.160
he was 13, meth when he was 14.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.080
Tried to kill himself
when he was 15.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.570
Cleaned himself up and
sent himself into the Army

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.060
when he, I guess, was 17.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.190
Did two tours
through Afghanistan,

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.056
and then came back,
clean, ready to go.

00:16:57.056 --> 00:16:58.430
Wouldn't go back
home to Phoenix,

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.346
because that's where all
of his triggers were.

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:03.104
Tried to get a job in New
York, couldn't get one.

00:17:03.104 --> 00:17:05.270
Put himself through the New
York Culinary Institute,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.950
but then couldn't
get a job as a chef.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.000
And then a friend
said, "Listen, I've

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.208
got this winery in Millbrook.

00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:09.980
Come work with me.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.750
Sell wine."

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.099
Had no idea what selling
was, thought salespeople

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:18.609
were the worst people in
the world, legitimately.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.770
And I helped him understand
that selling isn't taking.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.000
Selling isn't being greedy.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.445
Selling isn't, like, "Come on.

00:17:24.445 --> 00:17:24.703
Come on.

00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:24.910
Come on.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:25.470
Just do this.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.150
Do this."

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.310
Selling is assuring.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.300
It's not convincing.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.180
Selling is walking
people through options

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.850
so that they pick the best
one for them, and an option

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.740
that they otherwise
would have picked anyway,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.110
but they're just going to do it
with you and not do it online.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.068
Or they're going to do
it with you now, and not

00:17:41.068 --> 00:17:43.640
do it later, right?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.060
And so that was a good one
for me, working with him.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.940
We secretly flew his
parents in from Phoenix,

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.850
and he hadn't seen them since
he got back from Afghanistan.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.500
The whole thing was crazy.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.420
"Million Dollar Listing,"
very different show.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:56.919
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:57.890
PAUL DARRAH: Yes, yes.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.667
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah, Yeah.

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:01.250
PAUL DARRAH: So in
a recent interview,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.130
you said that one of
your core principles

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.690
is for sustaining key
relationships is actually

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.599
knowing how to give
before you take anything.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:08.390
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.470
PAUL DARRAH: And I
think you kind of

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.940
spoke to that a minute ago.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.000
But if you-- not that we're
off camera, but if you were

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.120
speaking off camera versus
on camera, what would

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.060
you like people to
know about reality TV

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.432
that they may not know?

00:18:22.432 --> 00:18:24.890
RYAN SERHANT: "Million Dollar
Listing" takes us nine months

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.240
to film an entire season, and
it airs really, really quickly.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.300
So there's a lot of stuff behind
the scenes that you don't see,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.690
just because it's boring
TV, unfortunately.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.630
Like, I always want to show
the deal stuff, the closing

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.470
cost, the taxes, all
the crazy stuff that

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.970
really drives us crazy.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.520
But it's hard TV to show.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.020
And there's three
of us on the show.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.103
It's an hour show, which
means there's 44 minutes.

00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:51.680
There's 16 minutes
of commercials,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.200
which means each
of us get, like,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.850
11 to 12 minutes of airtime.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.450
And it has to be cut down
into just those big moments.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.107
Get listing.

00:19:00.107 --> 00:19:01.190
Figure out how to sell it.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.970
Don't sell it.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.260
Maybe sell it.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.460
Little personal item.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.620
Done.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.327
But there's so much more
that goes into it, right?

00:19:09.327 --> 00:19:10.910
I start my day very,
very early, and I

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.830
try to start in the office
to prep for the day ahead.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.550
And then I end incredibly late
to clean up the previous day

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.160
and then prep for my day ahead.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.126
My day starts the night before.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.750
And that was an important thing
that I figured out when I first

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.666
got into the business.

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:26.980
Otherwise, you wake up
and you're scattered.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.160
And you look at your calendar,
and you're like, all right,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.330
what do I have to do today?

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.210
But by then, your day
has already begun,

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.620
and it's like you're
late to the race.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.450
But, yeah, reality TV is fun.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.310
It's been good for me.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.379
I mean, I got onto that show
by just, like, convincing them

00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:45.920
I was the greatest
real estate broker

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.276
in the history of the world.

00:19:47.276 --> 00:19:48.650
And I knew that
they were from LA

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.725
and they didn't know anything.

00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:52.100
And they were
like, are you sure?

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.990
And I was like, yes, I am sure.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.570
Like, really?

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.270
Because all these other brokers
that we're interviewing,

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.020
they don't know who you are.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.894
And I'm like, really?

00:19:57.894 --> 00:19:59.300
It's just because they're jelly.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.710
Right?

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.440
And they slowly whittled it
down and whittled it down.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.800
And I got to the point where
I was just getting friends

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.770
to help me with things and
trying to-- it was like,

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.920
call me 50 times a day.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.420
Call me.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:11.660
Call me.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.890
Because I'm with the
cameras right now,

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.700
and they're still interviewing
like 15 other people.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.100
And, they're like, what
am I calling you for?

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.820
So they call me.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.750
And they're like, "Hey, Ryan.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.070
You told me--" and I'd
be like, "Yeah, no.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.640
Deal's closing.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.300
I'll call you right back."

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.800
Boom.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.280
And the producers
were like, this

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.537
is the greatest real estate
broker we've ever seen!

00:20:24.537 --> 00:20:25.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.885
I've been doing it
now for eight years,

00:20:26.885 --> 00:20:29.790
so I'm comfortable
putting that out there.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.110
And then I got cast on it.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.920
And then that was
like, oh, all right.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.630
Now I got to figure this out.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.450
My whole life has been just
saying yes to everything,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.462
and then having to
just figure it out.

00:20:41.462 --> 00:20:43.170
PAUL DARRAH: Which is
a great lead-in to,

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.890
you talk about when it's
time to let the deal go

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.999
and how to fail smarter.

00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:47.790
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.300
I mean, when I first
started as a salesperson,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.540
I didn't let any deal go.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.040
Right?

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.620
Because I didn't really
have a whole lot of choice.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.350
And some of my first clients
were people I definitely

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.460
should have let go.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.460
But it's a time benefit
analysis, right?

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.960
You're never going
to close somebody

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.620
who has a great personal
relationship with someone else

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.870
who does what you do.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.870
As many apartments as
I would love to sell,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.370
there are always
going to be sellers

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.040
who grew up with a real
estate broker today,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.230
or who are married to
a real estate broker,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.330
or who have some kind
of personal connection.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.230
Those are people that I need
to really look at the time

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.500
that I would put into that
deal, and probably decide,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.130
you know what?

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.838
I'm going to leave
them for other people.

00:21:32.838 --> 00:21:33.800
It's OK, right?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.490
I'll live.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.047
I'll go find other people.

00:21:36.047 --> 00:21:37.880
And then there are
people, too, who are just

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.400
completely irrational,
unreasonable,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.310
and, those people,
you have to cut loose

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.020
when they don't really move up
that emotional ladder that I

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.370
talk about in the book.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:54.530
Like, if they just stay on
hysteric, or overemotional,

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.854
or if they're mean.

00:21:55.854 --> 00:21:57.520
There's a lot of
people in the world who

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.630
are really mean and are
belittling, especially

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.320
in my business.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.420
I don't know how
it is for you guys.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.830
But it is really easy to be mean
to a real estate agent, right?

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.930
And it's easy to take
out all your frustration

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.570
on them, which is fine,
and I'm totally OK with it.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.520
And I get yelled at every day.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.450
But if that's their
status quo, then those

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.930
are people that
I need to let go.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.330
Just to say, the
negative energy,

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.910
it's going to affect me
and all of my other deals,

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.190
and I don't want to bring
that into the rest of my life.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.100
PAUL DARRAH: So in
the book, you talk

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.230
about Client X,
which may not have

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.430
been your hardest deal you've
ever closed, but it might be.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.260
So spend a minute on
that, because I think

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.794
it's such an amazing story.

00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:39.710
RYAN SERHANT: Oh, man.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.490
In the book, I have to call him
"Client X" for fear of my life.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.660
And I say he's from Atlantis,
also for fear of my life.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.470
So Client X was a guy
who cold emailed me

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.600
when I first got
into the business

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.470
and said he'd like to invest
money into the New York City

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.750
real estate market.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.790
Would I be able to help him?

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.630
He would use real
cash dollars and would

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.090
need bank account help.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.696
And I totally replied.

00:23:09.696 --> 00:23:10.820
And I was like, absolutely.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.680
I can help you with
bank account help.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.950
And absolutely, we take
cash money dollars.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.560
And how much are you
looking to spend?

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.380
And he was like, less
than $10 million.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.800
And I was doing, like,
$2000 a month convertible,

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.297
three rentals in the West
Village to Jessica, Jessica,

00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:28.880
and her friend,
Jessica, at the time--

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:31.479 --> 00:23:33.770
--who were coming from Murray
Hill with their guarantor

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.700
father.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.350
And so a guy who,
all of a sudden,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.980
just told me $10 million
over the internet,

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.540
I was like, boom, jackpot!

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.580
This is New York
City real estate.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.954
And I got super excited.

00:23:44.954 --> 00:23:46.620
And then he wanted
to talk on the phone,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.234
so he was like a
real person, sort of.

00:23:49.234 --> 00:23:50.900
And I just sent him
a bunch of listings,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.020
because I didn't know.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.630
And he picked one at 45 West
67th Street, Apartment 15ABC.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.160
I remember every address.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.640
And he said, I
would like that one.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.210
Make offer, $8 million.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.030
And it was asking $8.5 million.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.950
And I was just like,
holy mother of--

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.649
I just-- $8 million offer.

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:09.440
This is what it is.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.523
This is-- I am now the
greatest real estate broker

00:24:11.523 --> 00:24:13.380
in the history of the world.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.455
I asked him to send me a proof
of funds, and he sent me a DHL.

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:17.330
Right, remember that?

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.420
He sent me a DHL the
next day with, like,

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.630
a photo of an
accountant with a letter

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.410
that legitimately said, "Mr.
X does not commit to things

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.210
that he does not commit to."

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.240
That was his proof of funds.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.105
And I was totally OK with it.

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.850
I was like, this
looks good to me!

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.010
Cash money dollars
in New York City.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.690
And we negotiated this deal over
the internet for $8.3 million,

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.210
and I was immediately
thinking about the commission

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.919
in my head, and thinking
about how long I

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:47.460
would be able to
stay in my apartment

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.730
with all that rent money and
everything and craziness.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.120
And taxes didn't even come
into the conversation.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.810
And then he disappeared
off the face of the Earth

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.010
for like a month.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.170
And he had had a contract,
and I had introduced him

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.320
to an attorney, and he just
never replied ever again.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.300
But I followed up,
like every day,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.520
because this was
my one big fish.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.020
No one else, in
their life, had ever

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.170
talked to me about spending
that much money on an apartment.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.260
And then he eventually writes
back, like a month later,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.309
and says, "Sorry.

00:25:16.309 --> 00:25:17.350
I've been a little busy."

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.010
I'm like, OK, no problem.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.130
And he actually
signs the contract.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.860
And then he has
to send a deposit.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.480
And then the
deposit never comes.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.070
And now I got the
seller freaking out,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.580
other brokers going crazy,
and, like, months go by.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.380
So we have the signed contract,
and it doesn't mean anything.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.806
And then the attorneys tell me
that what's basically happening

00:25:37.806 --> 00:25:39.680
is that this person
takes a signed contract--

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.480
and this happens all the
time in New York City--

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.980
and they shop it
around the world.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.930
And they say, "Listen,
this is this apartment.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.263
It's probably worth $10 million.

00:25:46.263 --> 00:25:47.360
I've got it for $8.3.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.740
Give me $20,000.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.709
Come in on it with me."

00:25:49.709 --> 00:25:51.500
And they'll sell the
contract over and over

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.820
and over to
unsuspecting victims,

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.210
and they'll steal
people's money.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.905
So it's a scam.

00:25:55.905 --> 00:25:57.530
And so, then I was
like, you know what?

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.550
This business sucks!

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.069
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:26:00.069 --> 00:26:01.610
I'm the best broker
ever, but now I'm

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.026
the worst one
because I'm involved

00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:05.840
in some money laundering scam
between some crazy person

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.530
from Atlantis.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.969
I can't believe I
responded to this guy.

00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:10.760
And I think it was,
like, two months go by,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.710
and then the attorney
calls me and says,

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.126
"You're not going
to believe this.

00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:18.710
I just got an $830,000 deposit
from Bank of Atlantis."

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.430
And I almost had a heart attack.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.350
I was like, "Are
we in contract?"

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.950
He's like, "Yeah,
you're in contract."

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.740
I was like, holy mother of God!

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.390
$8.3 million for an apartment.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.427
I sold it over the internet!

00:26:28.427 --> 00:26:30.260
And then there's this
thing in New York City

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.910
called a board package, right?

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.690
You have to do an application.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.106
And then there's
this thing called

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:37.190
closing, which you have to do.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.860
And he vanished off
the face of the Earth--

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.009
stopped responding to
everything for like six months.

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:45.800
So imagine signing a
contract for something

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.932
and then disappearing
for six months.

00:26:47.932 --> 00:26:49.640
OK, so now you've got
different attorneys

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.780
looking to sue everybody.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.624
But who do you go after, right?

00:26:52.624 --> 00:26:54.290
Now it's just about
keeping that deposit

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.790
and holding the deposit back.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.980
But I followed up.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.762
It's my whole
life, is follow-up.

00:26:58.762 --> 00:26:59.970
I wrote about it in the book.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.970
There's a whole chapter.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.240
It's really invigorating.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.230
OK?

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.160
I will follow up with you
until the day that you die.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.960
I followed up non-stop,
just checking in.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.710
Just saying, "Hey.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.043
I know you're probably getting
those documents together.

00:27:13.043 --> 00:27:14.560
Still need to do
this application."

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.720
And then I had some genius idea
to-- because I had looked him

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.520
up initially, and
I'd seen that he

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.450
might be attached to this house
that looked expensive in Paris.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.480
And so I sent him this
email that said, "Hey"--

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.100
in total desperation--

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.300
"I'll be in Paris tomorrow.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.800
If you want to
meet in person, we

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.050
can go through the documents."

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.620
And he wrote back
in like one minute,

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.925
after six months of
nothing, and said, "Sure.

00:27:35.925 --> 00:27:39.080
10:00 PM," and
gave me a location.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.804
And now I'm like, well, shit.

00:27:41.804 --> 00:27:43.220
The biggest deal
of my whole life,

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.678
that I still haven't
done, now I've

00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:46.560
got to figure out
how to do this.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.620
And so I used all the money
I had, and got an Aer Lingus

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.270
flight through Dublin.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.710
And then I think I took Ryanair,
which was super fitting for me,

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.327
to Paris to try to find
this magical person.

00:28:01.327 --> 00:28:03.410
All the while, I'm kind
of telling my parents what

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.330
I was up to, kind
of not, because it's

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.960
a little bit sketchy and
probably really dangerous.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.540
And then 10:00 PM rolled by,
and the guy doesn't show up.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.680
I'm crying in my baguette.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.069
And I think it was like 1:00
AM, because I had nowhere to go,

00:28:17.069 --> 00:28:19.110
and I didn't plan on
getting a hotel or anything.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.630
I just thought
I'd, like, wing it,

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.970
and then just go right
back to the airport.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.130
And then 1:00 AM, he shows up
with, like, a line of people.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.010
So now I know he's real.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.210
And all he really cared
about was getting me drunk.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.860
And he just wanted
to watch me drink.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.920
And I was the opposite of who
he was in every way, shape,

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.830
and form.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.020
And I drank a significant
amount of tequila.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.090
And he sort of looked at
the papers a little bit.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.006
I got him to sign two
things, and I would just

00:28:46.006 --> 00:28:47.040
fill out the rest.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.080
So I took it as a win.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.560
Went back to New
York City, very sick,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.005
and then he had to come close.

00:28:53.005 --> 00:28:55.130
And he disappeared off the
face of the Earth again.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.260
But at least now I knew
that he was a real person.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.970
And then to make a
long story short--

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.540
even though it's long--

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.710
he randomly, one day, again,
months later-- so this is,

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.454
like, a year-long process--

00:29:05.454 --> 00:29:06.620
says, "I'm in New York City.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.850
I'd like to close."

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.130
Like, are you crazy?

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.491
It's like 11:30 AM.

00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:13.615
You can't just get a closing
together-- right-- oh,

00:29:13.615 --> 00:29:14.114
but fine.

00:29:14.114 --> 00:29:14.970
We'll figure it out.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.110
Because everyone was-- they
were trying to sue for deposits.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.652
It was crazy.

00:29:17.652 --> 00:29:18.776
It was like, where are you?

00:29:18.776 --> 00:29:19.730
Mandarin Oriental.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.390
I went up there to wait for
him, doesn't come down on time.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.760
Finally comes down,
with like 15 people.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.620
And this fleet of
black Escalades

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.590
pulls up outside the Mandarin
Oriental, completely tinted out

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.215
and crazy.

00:29:31.215 --> 00:29:33.590
The minute that happens, I
text my mom and I say goodbye.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.830
This is, again, like, the
only deal that I've ever done

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.900
other than just rental
deals on Craigslist

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.350
with people that I'm
baiting and switching, OK?

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.490
The New York way.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.160
So we get in the car.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.720
He's got, like, an espresso
assistant, totally crazy.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.410
And I'm like, "Listen,
Mandarin Oriental, 45 West 67th

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.420
Street, it's right there.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.940
Do you want to go
do the walk-through?

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.100
I'm sure you're really
excited about this apartment."

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.058
He's like, "No, no, no.

00:29:58.058 --> 00:29:59.580
We go to JFK."

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.850
So we went to JFK.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.980
And we went to the back of JFK.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.920
And we pulled up, and
there was this big 747,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.900
and he got outside,
and he bought it.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.590
And he got back in the car,
and now I'm totally confused.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.340
Now I don't really
think I'm going to die.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.840
Now I'm just really--

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.550
I don't know who this person is.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.940
And then we go back into the
city, and he signs the papers,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.290
and he closes.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.020
And all he cares about is taking
a selfie with me for his BBM

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.090
profile, if you remember those.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.065
And turns out that he prints
about a billion dollars

00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:30.760
a month.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.540
And he's, like,
wealthier than Gaddafi,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.470
and just wasn't concerned
with this little apartment.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.420
And the only reason
that he moved forward

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.190
was because he
thought it was super

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.310
amusing to watch me
consistently, persistently

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.145
follow up.

00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:48.622
[LAUGHING]

00:30:48.622 --> 00:30:51.080
And the fact that I actually
went to Paris-- and he knew it

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.430
was bullshit.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.160
He knew that I wasn't
going to be in Paris--

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.060
is one of the reasons
he went through it.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.976
And since then, we've
done, like, $300 million

00:30:58.976 --> 00:31:01.700
together, just as a way to
diversify and move money

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.360
around.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.500
Every deal has
been super painful.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.900
And that's the power
of "Yes, and," right?

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.750
And it didn't take
money of mine.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.300
Going to Paris costs money,
but, other than that,

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.300
follow-up, following
up with items of value,

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.160
staying on top of
him, everything.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.020
Every deal is a deal.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.000
You're just trying to
see which salesperson

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.590
is going to quit first, right?

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.170
Just like every race.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.270
And I always equate
selling to a race.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.420
You wake up every day.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.378
That's why I say "ready,
set, go" all the time,

00:31:32.378 --> 00:31:35.150
because my dad told me to say
it every day before I leave,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.650
when I was in third grade.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.900
Before I step out of the
house, before you cross over,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.900
one foot-- "ready, set, go"--
because it sets your mindset up

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.970
for running a race.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.470
You just have no idea what kind
of race you're going to run.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.595
It's going to be
a marathon today.

00:31:46.595 --> 00:31:48.553
It might be a sprint,
and then it's a marathon.

00:31:48.553 --> 00:31:50.960
It might be hurdles, and
then it's, like, a 6k.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.890
You don't know.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.906
But as long as you're
prepared in that moment,

00:31:53.906 --> 00:31:55.280
the moment you
leave your house--

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.460
I'm going to run a race today
and I'm going to [POP] win it

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.470
in some way, shape, or form--

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.990
it just sets your
mind to be ready to go

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:07.125
for anything, to say, "yes,
and" then figure it out.

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:09.500
PAUL DARRAH: So before I ask
the next question, if anyone

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.300
wants to line up to the mics.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.877
And we'll open up for
questions in a minute.

00:32:13.877 --> 00:32:15.710
But it's a great pivot
to the next question,

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.680
which is, explain
your Get FKD theory,

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.290
and why it's one of your
most valuable secrets.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.110
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.640
You're going through, like,
the whole book right now, huh?

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.730
PAUL DARRAH: Yes.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.719
It was a great book, you guys.

00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:29.510
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:34.310
So FKD-- again, I was on
"As the World Turns" and got

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.180
killed off.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.190
OK, that's where I
made the most money

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.524
before getting to real estate,
other than hand modeling.

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:40.148
I hand modeled.

00:32:40.148 --> 00:32:42.240
I held cell phones for
AT&amp;T. They were everywhere,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.230
by the way.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.570
If you Google my name and
hand modeling, it's awesome.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.370
I held Nespresso
capsules like this.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.030
I'd have to move the
metatarsal of my pinky.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.280
I'd have to get hand
massages and everything.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.700
So that's my background
into business.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.910
So then when I got into
real estate, all I knew

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.530
was you post ads online.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.340
You meet people.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.950
You try to convince them
to sell, to buy, to rent.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.760
And I wasn't rich, and I'm
not from New York City,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.270
and I don't go to the synagogue.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.580
So I am shit out of luck.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.150
My nicest clothes were
cowboy boots and khaki pants.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.850
And so when I made that
decision of, you know what?

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.590
I'm going to figure
this out, and I'm

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.840
to move against the grain
here in New York City,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.734
and I'm going to be
the best broker ever--

00:33:28.734 --> 00:33:30.650
I've got to figure out
how I'm going to do it.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.300
I didn't know how
to structure my day.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.840
And that was the one thing that
really would get me depressed,

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.870
and would really
kind of hurt me,

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.490
was, OK, I have one
appointment at 3:00 PM.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.950
What do I do the
rest of the day?

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.120
What do I do at 9:00?

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.590
Do I cold call people?

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.750
Do I ask people for help?

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.940
Do I post ads?

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.081
How do I structure my day?

00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:52.830
And I think people are
creatures of habit.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.350
So I looked at big companies.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.240
I said, OK, every
big company out there

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.340
that's super successful has
a CEO, a CFO, and a COO.

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.200
I have no idea what they do.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.460
But for me, I think it's
important that, part of my day,

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.350
I have a CEO brain on.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.880
So that, for me,
was my finder time.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.590
Because I had looked
at CEOs and I said,

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.550
they find business for
the company to work on.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.239
All right, that's what they do.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.490
They prospect business for
the company to work on.

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.489
Yes, they deal with
problems and all that stuff.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.929
But CEOs really-- they are
there to move the ship forward

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.600
and give the company a
lot of stuff to work on.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.659
OK, so from 8:00 to
10:00 AM, every day,

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.230
I'm going to put "Finder."

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.230
And those are my hours
where, every day, now I'm

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.730
booked from 8:00 to 10:00 AM.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.130
I'm not waking up with
nothing to do until 3:00 PM.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.040
8:00 to 10:00, that's
my finder hour or two,

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.100
when I just focus on
RyanSerhantRealEstate.com,

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.719
my own, little
personal business,

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:45.290
and how I'm going to
sell more, grow more,

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.969
and brainstorm my career.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.600
And it's amazing if you just
spend some time every day

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.765
and just think about
yourself that way,

00:34:52.765 --> 00:34:54.389
and about your
business, and how you're

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:56.840
going to do better, you will
come up with ideas that you

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.215
never would have come up with,
just because your brain is

00:34:59.215 --> 00:35:03.590
capable of things that
you just don't know.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.475
Keeper was the CFO time.

00:35:05.475 --> 00:35:06.800
So that was like 12:00 to 1:00.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.300
And I would just think about
all the money I didn't have.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.984
And if I had, like, $10 to
spend that day, I would budget.

00:35:12.984 --> 00:35:14.900
Because I knew it was
important to invest back

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.608
in your business.

00:35:15.608 --> 00:35:19.220
So I would say, OK, $10,
that gets me how many stamps?

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.500
And I would send out letters
to one building that day.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.756
Or it's going to get
me an extra latte,

00:35:23.756 --> 00:35:25.130
and I'm going to
go to Starbucks,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.960
and I'm going to try
to find pregnant women

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.360
and sell them apartments
because they need more space.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.960
All right, that's
my thing today.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.560
True story.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.030
Some of my first
clients were pregnant,

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.170
and they needed more space.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.910
It's a real thing.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.824
And then my COO time was
my doer time, so FKD.

00:35:40.824 --> 00:35:41.990
That was the rest of my day.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.073
That's when you put all
of that stuff into action.

00:35:44.073 --> 00:35:45.939
So that's when I
was stamping things.

00:35:45.939 --> 00:35:47.480
That's when I was
going to Starbucks.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.310
That's when I was
doing the appointments.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.920
And I still do that to this day.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.300
Now the times are shifted.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.270
Now I spend a lot more of my
time in that finder time period

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.619
than I do in the
keeper and doer.

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:00.410
But it's important to
think about yourself,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.870
as an entrepreneur and as
an independent contractor

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.540
and as a salesperson,
as somebody

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.670
who runs a large company.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.620
Whether it's true or
it's not, the only way

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:14.320
it will be true, eventually,
is if you think to make it so.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.930
Yeah.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.130
PAUL DARRAH: Great.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.090
Go to the audience.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.410
AUDIENCE: Oh, he was
here first, but--

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.360
PAUL DARRAH: All
right, let's do--

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:20.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.468
AUDIENCE: So in "Million
Dollar Listing,"

00:36:22.468 --> 00:36:24.655
you have a lot of
one-on-one interactions.

00:36:24.655 --> 00:36:27.146
Now, obviously, it's edited,
and perhaps that's not

00:36:27.146 --> 00:36:28.395
how the rest of your day goes.

00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:31.980
But now you have a team of
several hundred brokers.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.467
How do you manage them?

00:36:33.467 --> 00:36:35.550
Do you try and spend
one-on-one time each of them?

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.590
Do you have lieutenants
or other people?

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.790
How do you structure it?

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.340
RYAN SERHANT: The team
is 62, not yet at 100.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.763
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:36:42.763 --> 00:36:44.388
RYAN SERHANT: But
it's-- but thank you.

00:36:44.388 --> 00:36:47.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:47.155 --> 00:36:50.250
I try to spend as much time
with them as I possibly can.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.580
They're all really busy,
and everyone's different.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.610
I have let all of them know
that I'm there for them all day

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.240
long.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.320
There are certain
people on my team

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.360
who need a meeting with
me every single week.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.380
There are certain
people on my team

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.850
who need to talk
to me every day.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.160
There's other people on my
team who do really well, who

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.980
I have to go after for updates.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.810
And that's just sort
of the way they work,

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.080
and so I'm not a big fan of
creating rules and then making

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.490
team members stick by them.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.620
I want people to be
able to move flexibly,

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.410
to be as successful as
they possibly can be.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.470
And then they just have
to set those expectations

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.430
for themselves.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.940
So at the end of the year,
I'll have a goal meeting.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.034
And my goal meeting, I
don't create numbers.

00:37:29.034 --> 00:37:30.450
I have them tell
me how much money

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:31.890
they want to make next year.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.390
And they have to
make the number.

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.590
It's not me.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.270
If they say, like, $5,
we have to move it up.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.259
But they have to set
the number, and then we

00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:41.550
back into that how much they
have to sell to get there.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.080
That's now their base salary.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.240
Everything else they
sell above that is bonus.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.920
If they sell under
the number they just

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.680
said they want to sell, and
they don't come talk to me

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.310
by June or July, saying,
"Listen, the year is terrible.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.935
New York City real estate market
has fallen through the floor,"

00:37:54.935 --> 00:37:57.420
something like that, then
they can't be with me.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.540
But I talk to my team more than
I talk to any other client.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.410
And I really view teams
as, like, football teams.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.570
I'm awful at every
sport known to man,

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.970
but I do know how
football teams work.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:10.890
And it's important
that everyone can

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.810
be their own
individual rock star

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.780
and be successful and be
great at what they do.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.700
But you're not all going
to win, unless you're

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.190
able to play well together
and work together and talk

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.390
to each other and figure it
out as obstacles come at you,

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.436
like the New York
Jets, you know?

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:28.810
I hope that answers
the question.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:29.384
I don't know.

00:38:29.384 --> 00:38:30.050
PAUL DARRAH: OK.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.100
AUDIENCE: First, thank
you for being here.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:32.975
RYAN SERHANT: Thanks.

00:38:32.975 --> 00:38:35.110
AUDIENCE: I think the
"Yes, and figure it out"

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.990
mentality mindset very much
resonates with most of us

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.530
in this room,
because we invented

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.260
a category 20 years ago.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.390
And I think, in some ways,
we're still doing that.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.097
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:38:45.097 --> 00:38:46.180
AUDIENCE: Personal story--

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:46.885
I met Fredrik--

00:38:46.885 --> 00:38:47.320
RYAN SERHANT: Oh.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.060
AUDIENCE: --in Starbucks,
like eight years ago--

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.520
RYAN SERHANT: I'm sorry.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.010
AUDIENCE: --and I've
been here for a while.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.700
Well, he was--

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.510
RYAN SERHANT: I'm just kidding.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.801
AUDIENCE: He seemed to be a
very different person eight

00:38:54.801 --> 00:38:56.860
years ago than he is
on the show today.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.740
So I was kind of expecting him
to be a douche, and he wasn't.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.091
He was very nice.

00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:02.590
But I've been in
sales for 20 years,

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.040
and I recounted a story to him
that I had used a line that I

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.360
heard on the show on a client--

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.960
RYAN SERHANT: Oh, wow.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.920
AUDIENCE: --and it worked.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.550
And the line was--

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.924
I was working with a very big
telecommunications company,

00:39:11.924 --> 00:39:14.260
and the line was, "If
you have $7 million,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.520
you have $8 million."

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:15.850
RYAN SERHANT: Yes.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.617
AUDIENCE: And I closed
an $8 million deal,

00:39:17.617 --> 00:39:18.700
so I owe that to you guys.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.241
So thank you.

00:39:19.241 --> 00:39:20.404
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:39:20.404 --> 00:39:22.570
AUDIENCE: I have moved out
of sales after 40 years--

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.930
PAUL DARRAH: You're welcome.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.596
AUDIENCE: --and I'm
now on a team that's

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:28.900
responsible for training
10,000 sellers at Google

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.490
on how to sell.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:31.930
And we're at this
inflection point

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.690
between being a trusted
advisor and being

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:38.110
a competitive seller, because
it's a very fine balance.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.630
What do you think are the
most important attributes

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.570
of a seller, as they balance
being a trusted advisor

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.570
and a competitive seller?

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.576
RYAN SERHANT: Endurance,
empathy, and enthusiasm.

00:39:49.576 --> 00:39:50.380
AUDIENCE: Three Es.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.190
I like that alliteration.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.731
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah,
it's in the book.

00:39:52.731 --> 00:39:55.011
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:55.011 --> 00:39:56.010
AUDIENCE: I'm buying it.

00:39:57.949 --> 00:40:00.240
RYAN SERHANT: Like, you didn't
just tee me up for that,

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.260
but you did, sort of.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.560
But it's what I look for in
every salesperson that I hire.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.370
And I do that by--

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:09.870
they have to have
enthusiasm, right?

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.400
So I ask them to tell me
the story about the greatest

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.730
day in their life.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.520
And if they tell
me, like, "Well,

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.240
Christmas when I
was 10 was great,"

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.720
they cannot work with me.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.610
They have to have empathy.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.821
So I ask them to tell me about
the worst day they've ever

00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:25.570
had in their life.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.490
And if they're
like, "My dog died,"

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.830
they cannot work with me.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.590
Because the ability to be
enthusiastic with a client

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:35.730
and the ability to
empathize with a client,

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.710
that's the only way
you get sales done.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.440
There will always be sales
that just come down to numbers.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.600
Like, there will always
be those conversations.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.530
And those are great.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.395
That's your base salary.

00:40:45.395 --> 00:40:46.770
Those are the
deals that are just

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.000
going to happen because
the numbers make

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.470
sense and the product's good.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:56.490
Everything else is empathy,
enthusiasm, energy, education.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.440
All words that
start with E. Yeah.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.925
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:01.925 --> 00:41:04.410
PAUL DARRAH: Great.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.905
Anybody else?

00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:06.780
RYAN SERHANT: Oh, no.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.440
He's going to the bathroom.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.960
Oh, psyched.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.922
Love you too.

00:41:10.922 --> 00:41:12.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:12.278 --> 00:41:13.012
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:14.220
PAUL DARRAH: Ah, there we go.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:14.990
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:16.140
RYAN SERHANT: Hi.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.800
AUDIENCE: So I'll
use this opportunity,

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.010
because I definitely
don't have the money

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.050
to ever work with you directly.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.410
So if I was an investor, and
looking for an area in New York

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.780
where I'd likely see the
most upside in the next five

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.177
to 10 years, what would
you recommend I do?

00:41:33.177 --> 00:41:34.135
RYAN SERHANT: Bushwick.

00:41:34.135 --> 00:41:35.005
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:35.005 --> 00:41:36.310
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.290
Bushwick, Bed-Stuy.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:43.970
I think that Bed-Stuy is already
kind of getting expensive,

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.230
and people are already
trying to go there.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.510
I think that Bushwick--

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.050
anyone who buys
in Bushwick today

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.890
will do incredibly
well in five years.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.842
And yeah, super simple.

00:41:54.842 --> 00:41:56.300
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any listings?

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.050
RYAN SERHANT: Yes.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.040
Listen--

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040
AUDIENCE: You really do?

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.400
RYAN SERHANT: --I am here
to sell homes to all of you.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.066
Let's not-- I don't
want to meet any--

00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:04.440
I'm going to
remember all of you.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.660
I don't want to meet
any of you on the street

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.310
or in Starbucks ever,
and you're like,

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.393
oh, I just bought a house.

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.580
But I didn't know if maybe
it was too small for you,

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.110
or I had this friend-- no.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.440
I am here for a purpose, and
it's to sell all of you homes

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.457
or help you rent homes, OK?

00:42:17.457 --> 00:42:19.540
Just, I want to make sure
that that's super clear.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.480
PAUL DARRAH: So
on the left side,

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.855
we're going to
line up for people

00:42:21.855 --> 00:42:23.210
that want to buy an apartment.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.900
On the right side, we're
doing the book signing--

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.370
RYAN SERHANT: Yes.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.834
PAUL DARRAH: --just so you know.

00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:28.000
RYAN SERHANT: Yes, yes, yes.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.660
AUDIENCE: Ryan, one
question-- given

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:35.630
the variety in your background,
how much in your career

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.330
has it been about what
you've wanted to do

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.408
versus who you want to be?

00:42:41.408 --> 00:42:43.690
RYAN SERHANT: Whoa.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.420
You Googlers.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.050
I made a decision
when I was younger--

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.450
and I think this is
important, because I

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.730
talked to a lot of people
who have this problem.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:43:00.180
They want to be a
really great X, right?

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.630
You want to grow up to be
like me, an actor, right.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.300
Or you want to grow up
to be a successful banker

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.410
or a successful
engineer or something.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.400
And then when that doesn't
happen, it's like a brick wall

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.950
to the face, and
life is over, right?

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.930
And then they go off
and do something else.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.810
There's a lot of people who run
into those situations, where

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.185
their whole life they wanted
to do something because they

00:43:20.185 --> 00:43:21.810
wanted to be that person.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:27.070
But, for me, whether it sounds
crazy or not, I always just--

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.180
I wanted to be successful.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.350
I wanted to squeeze as much out
of life as possible, because I

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.920
knew life was short
and I knew that I

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.590
didn't want to leave
potential on the floor.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.520
I didn't want to
be in the cemetery

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.790
and be one of those
people who was like, well,

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.770
if he had only just
done x, y, and z,

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.620
we might know that he did that.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.780
And so I chose success
first, career second.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.020
And that's an important
thing to put out there,

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.470
because a lot of people think
it sounds weird and crazy

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:58.807
and that it doesn't make sense.

00:43:58.807 --> 00:44:00.140
But if you choose career first--

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.370
I could've done
that with acting,

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:06.970
and I wouldn't be here today.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.210
And I'd still live in my
300 square foot apartment

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.030
at 38 West 31st Street, sharing
a bathroom with 17 people.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.280
Not that that's a bad thing.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.530
It's an honorable thing, maybe.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.394
But it wasn't what
I wanted for myself.

00:44:18.394 --> 00:44:20.310
And I wanted to have a
better quality of life,

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.980
because, again,
life is super short.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.870
So I chose success
first, career second.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.120
And I think when
people do that, then

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.800
when things don't work out--

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:33.240
like when I was killed off on
"As the World Turns," right--

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.232
it wasn't this brick wall that
I was hitting, where my life was

00:44:36.232 --> 00:44:37.440
over, and I had to move home.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.980
It was, OK, so that
career didn't work out.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.320
Let's see what else works.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.174
And real estate sounds awful,
and real estate brokers

00:44:46.174 --> 00:44:48.090
are the worst people
ever, but, you know what?

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.760
Maybe I'll try to change that
and figure it out and do it

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.090
in a different way.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.665
And does that answer
your question?

00:44:55.665 --> 00:44:56.540
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.040
Thanks.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:57.770
RYAN SERHANT: OK.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:58.120
Cut it.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.340
PAUL DARRAH: All right.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.756
RYAN SERHANT: Sometimes I just
start going off in my head.

00:45:00.756 --> 00:45:02.999
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for being here-- big fan.

00:45:02.999 --> 00:45:04.040
RYAN SERHANT: No problem.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.210
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could maybe

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:07.445
share about your
castmates on the show?

00:45:07.445 --> 00:45:10.899
I know you've had some
friendships, not friendships.

00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:11.690
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.023
AUDIENCE: Would you consider
them friends now, and maybe

00:45:14.023 --> 00:45:16.940
something unexpected about
the other brokers who

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.636
appear on the show?

00:45:18.636 --> 00:45:20.510
RYAN SERHANT: Listen,
I have been on the show

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.350
from the beginning with Fredrik.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.250
And so we have a
love/hate relationship.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.480
We're competitors.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.720
We go after the same projects,
the same listings all the time.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.380
And it took us a
while to figure out.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.130
But I think, in the
last couple of years--

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.500
maybe it's just because
we're getting older--

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:42.240
we just realized that we're a
lot more alike than we thought.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:48.180
I think I'm better, but we're
both equally competitive,

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.170
and we want to do as
best as we possibly can.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.175
But we're also in this
crazy thing together.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.130
That show, at least,
when it first came out,

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.010
it was watched by 25 million
people around the world.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:03.590
And that's crazy to us.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:08.290
You know, we get fan
mail from Korea and Iran.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.920
How those people would ever know
that I'm a real estate broker

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.002
is beyond me.

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.460
And I would never
be able to afford

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.250
that type of advertising.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:20.000
And so, listen, Fredrik
and I are friendly now,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.854
but we're still
very competitive.

00:46:22.854 --> 00:46:24.770
I haven't talked to
Michael Lorber in forever.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:26.170
He was Season 1.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.572
Luis, I talk to a lot more now
than I have in a long time.

00:46:30.572 --> 00:46:32.030
And he's actually
back in the city.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.190
And I haven't told anyone
yet, but I'll tell people

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.260
at 3:00 PM, on Instagram.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.362
He's going to moderate
my book signing

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:39.986
at Barnes &amp; Noble on
Thursday, and it's

00:46:39.986 --> 00:46:43.280
going to be his first public
appearance in like two years.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.334
And I've always
been close to Luis,

00:46:45.334 --> 00:46:47.000
and he was at my
wedding and everything.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.020
And then Steve--

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.180
Steve is new.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.582
Steve is super pretty.

00:46:50.582 --> 00:46:52.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:55.370
And so, yeah, but Steve's great.

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.950
Steve is a total sweetheart.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.300
He's great at what he does.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:04.590
He's a lot more sensitive
than people probably think.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.090
Yeah.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.310
I don't know if I have any--

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.660
AUDIENCE: Did you try and
get him to join your team?

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:08.990
RYAN SERHANT: I did.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.620
We filmed.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.020
They filmed a scene with
me, after "Town" crumbled,

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.140
of me trying to get
him to come to the team

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.320
and figure that out.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.310
Because I thought it would work.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:19.820
With Frederick,
it wouldn't work.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:21.611
But with Steve, I
thought we could probably

00:47:21.611 --> 00:47:24.170
do more together than separate.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.610
And he thought about it.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.830
And then Corcoran just made
him a really great offer,

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:31.330
and then they just
cut that whole scene.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:32.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.170
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:34.960
PAUL DARRAH: And
that's reality TV.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.650
RYAN SERHANT: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:37.700
Yes.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:41.786
PAUL DARRAH: So on behalf of
the 10,000 potential sales

00:47:41.786 --> 00:47:42.910
that are in this building--

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:43.350
RYAN SERHANT: Yes!

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.390
PAUL DARRAH: --and
the next building--

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.640
RYAN SERHANT: Let's do it.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.240
PAUL DARRAH: --thank you.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:45.640
RYAN SERHANT: Thank you.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.473
PAUL DARRAH: This has
been great having you.

00:47:47.473 --> 00:47:49.220
Definitely, we'll
have people lining up

can clearly follow

00:47:53.228 --> 00:47:55.130
Ryan on Instagram,
Facebook, Twitter,

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.350
and his YouTube channel,
which highlights

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.870
a day in the life of
Ryan, which is actually

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.360
interesting to watch, as well.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.340
