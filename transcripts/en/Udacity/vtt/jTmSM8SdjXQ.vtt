00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.230
So the answer to this question is that it's the

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.980
X chromosome. And it's likely to be recessive. Now, how do

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.120
we come up with that? Well, we're pretty sure that

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.590
it can't be the Y chromosome. Think about it. Take this

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.160
father as an example. This father up here is affected,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.500
that means he'd have a Y chromosome with the affected allele.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.970
He had two daughters. Did he give his Y chromosome

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.100
to a daughter? No, there's no way, right? Because they're daughters.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.550
Daughters are by definition XX. So if this daughter

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.619
is XX, she didn't get any affected Y from the

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.960
father. So how did she pass on the trait to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.930
her son? Right, that just doesn't make sense. It must

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.880
be the X. Here the X is affected. And

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.500
the father passes that X on to this daughter. But

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.150
because this daughter has another X from the mother that's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.010
unaffected, you don't see the trait. She's just a carrier.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.620
But when she has a son, the son is XY, the son has to get the X from

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.740
the mother, she gave him the recessive allele X.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.070
And we also suspect that this trait, this allele

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.010
causing this trait is recessive. Because as we mentioned

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.900
before in our autosomal inheritance pattern pedigrees. Recessive traits

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.240
tend to skip generations, and unaffected parents have affected

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.870
offspring. Whereas dominant traits show up in every generation.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.040
Or almost every generation, and many times affected parents have

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.030
affected offspring, and that's not the case for this pedigree.
