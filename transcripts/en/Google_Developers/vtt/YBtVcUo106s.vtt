AZA STEEL: My name's Aza,
I'm the CEO of GoGuardian.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.370
We're an educational
security startup,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.820
and I'm going to be talking
about how to find the best

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.330
engineers, and how
to attract them

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.930
to join your awesome company.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.350
I'm going to think of the
talent acquisition process

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.490
as you might think of
deal stages in a CRM.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.680
And so our deal stages are
going to be lead, to contact,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.160
to process, to close.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920
So before you even
start thinking about

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.570
that it's really important
to clarify in your head

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.450
who you're looking
for, and what you're

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.634
looking for in an engineer.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.300
So chances are you
probably want someone

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.570
that's smarter than you.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.680
You might want someone that has
particular language experience,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.740
or experience building
particular types

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.359
of applications, whether
that be mobile or web.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.150
So clarify that for
yourself because that's

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.858
going to be really
helpful in making sure

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:49.502
that you find the right person.

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:50.960
There's basically
two types of ways

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.240
that you can go after a lead.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.310
You're going to either
find a passive way,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.750
or it's going to
be an active way.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.584
So in terms of passive
ways, you're basically

00:00:58.584 --> 00:00:59.750
putting something out there.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.041
You're saying, hey I'm looking
for this type of talent.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.590
And then you may get some bites.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.420
What I've found, those bites
are usually less talented, hard

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.590
to find candidates,
than the ones

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.132
that you can find if you
find more active methods

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:15.590
and you're really
going after them.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.298
You're being proactive
and you're saying,

00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:21.010
hey I see this person, I see
this is their qualifications,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.684
and I'm going to get
them for my startup.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.100
Some of the more
passive ways that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.980
have worked for
us in the past are

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.250
things like posting to Hacker
News which is a website.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.890
Something that's worked for me
is posting on Facebook saying,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.860
hey, this is what I'm
looking for in a candidate.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.030
Does anyone know anyone?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.029
Because then you're using
your social networking

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.760
and you're using your friends'
social network to find someone.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.990
The more active ways
that I'm really a fan of,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.200
there's a website called
AngelList-- it's angel.co--

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.110
and there's a whole
recruiting section where

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830
you can go through all
these people's profiles

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.890
and do keyword searches
for particular skills

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.920
that you're looking for.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.570
So let's say you're looking
for a Node.js engineer.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.700
You can do a search for
Node.js and a search for people

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.650
that are looking in
your area for jobs,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.450
or people that have jobs
and Node.js in your area

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.180
and go about it that way.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.389
Then you need to think
about-- so you figured out

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.930
how to get in touch
with this person.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.250
You need to think about what
your message is going to be

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.640
and how it's going to
be compelling to them,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.220
so it's helpful to think about
it from their perspective.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.090
They're an engineer, they're
making a great salary,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.380
they have these great benefits,
but what don't they have?

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.880
And what they don't have is
probably a potential for really

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.690
tangible positive impact.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.894
They might not have a lot of
autonomy in their job setting.

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:37.310
They might not
have an opportunity

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.320
for a significant financial
upside, i.e., equity

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.150
if there's an exit, or
an IPO or something.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.740
So you want to play to your
strengths and their more

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.380
traditional current
businesses' weaknesses.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.040
To me, the most
important thing here

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.450
is that you actually think
about them as people.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.180
And you need to-- so when I
start writing an email to them,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.042
I won't say hi name,
I'll say hi John,

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:03.500
so I can start thinking about
this actual person in my head

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.130
that I'm trying to convince
to join my company.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.100
And so I like to go for the most
personable methods possible.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.880
So if you can find
their phone number,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.610
and you can just pick up
the phone and call them,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.510
I've had tremendous
success with doing that.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.380
Because you're usually
both so confused

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.420
that you're on the
phone with each other,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.210
that it just kind of works and
you establish a connection,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.470
and then you talk about
why they would be great

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.732
added benefit to your team
and then it goes from there.

00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:29.940
If you can't get their phone
or they aren't answering

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.530
their phone, then I would
say a personal email

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.326
is the next best.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:34.700
So an email I've
sent in the past

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.410
is like, hey, we need an
awesome Node.js engineer.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.060
So I find some
people on AngelList

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.664
that have great
Node.js experience,

00:03:40.664 --> 00:03:42.580
I mention some of that
experience in the email

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.996
and say, hey, it looks like
you did some really cool stuff

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:46.070
building these web apps.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.110
And say what we're
looking for is someone

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.060
to build these highly
scalable node applications,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.010
and this is why
you fit the bill,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.674
and this is the company
that you'll be joining in,

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:58.840
why it's an awesome company
and the amazing traction

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.579
that we've had and
why this is something

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.870
that they're going to want
to really get on board with.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.830
A lot of times people go wrong
because they don't actually

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.179
have an action item at
the end of the email.

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.470
There's no call to action,
and so it's really important

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.761
that you have a call to action.

00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:13.810
And it can either
be an email reply,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.650
or I really like
suggesting a time

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.190
to touch base on the phone.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.510
So that makes sure that
you ask them a question,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.230
there's kind of an expectation
that they're going to reply--

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.300
or you hope that
they're going to reply--

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.790
and then you can touch
base on the phone.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.790
And that's really the
goal, because that's going

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.410
to bring it to the next level.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.219
So now that you've
verified them on paper,

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.260
and you've talk to them
and verified that there's

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.964
at least some level
of interest, you

00:04:33.964 --> 00:04:36.130
need to make sure that they
can actually do the job.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.010
And chances are you're going
to be looking for someone

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.593
that has a certain
level of experience

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.100
and you need to verify that.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.610
And you need to probably
either have them do a coding

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.900
challenge, or have them
do a take-home coding

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.240
challenge, where they
can dive into a project

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.830
and you can see
some of their work.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.710
And if you're not
really someone that

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.770
should be reviewing
their code, make sure

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.370
that you have a
friend look at it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.080
or have a friend hop on
a phone call with them,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.320
and talk about some
of the technical areas

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.630
that you want to make sure
that they have expertise in.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.100
Because people can be fairly
good at convincing you on paper

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.510
that they have certain
aptitudes and skills,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.520
and you want to make
sure that they actually

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.550
have the goods to back it up.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.350
So now to actually
get them on your team,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.120
it's really important
to think about them

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.290
as a whole person, and
what about your job

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.220
is going to be really
compelling to them

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.510
and where they want
to be in their future,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.000
and how you can play a part
in getting them to that place.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.700
You're talking to top engineers.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.175
Some of these top engineers
are going to say no,

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:38.300
and it's really important
that you engage with them

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.120
and figure out why they said no.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.620
And it's important
for two reasons.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.849
One, a lot of the
time, by understanding

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.890
that, you can actually
get them back on your side

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.890
and maybe it was a, hey,
this is just bad timing

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.819
and you can engage them
on a contract basis

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.860
until it's better timing,
or something like that.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.890
Two, you need to
refine your process,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.020
and the only way you
can refine your process

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.980
is by understanding
what isn't working,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.450
and by talking to them
about what you could perhaps

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.680
have done better.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.380
These strategies
have essentially

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.140
allowed me to build this, from
what was around a year ago, me

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.300
sleeping on my friend's
couch trying to figure out

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.100
how to grow this idea into a
20-person organization, that's

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.120
growing incredibly
fast, and we're

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.349
on something like 800,000
Chrome books in education,

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.390
and protecting students
in their online activity.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.840
