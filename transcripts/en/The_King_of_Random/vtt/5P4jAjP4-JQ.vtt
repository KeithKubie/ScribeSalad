[Music playing]

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.300
So Ellie just put this together in my honor. Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream [High-Five]. He loved liquid nitrogen.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.040
[Music continues]

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.640
Do you work here at YouTube? I do, yeah. I work on like the main website Youtube.com. Sweet, how's the ice cream?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.380
It's amazing! So good!

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.470
Mmm... guys check this out I'm at

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.619
YouTube headquarters with the YouTube staff, and today

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.789
we're making Chocolate YouTube Play Buttons. Pretty sure nothing like this has ever been done before

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.139
We got Shawn here helping us out today he's got his sanitary gloves on and

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.740
all of YouTube here picked dark chocolates. That's, we're making our Chocolate Play Buttons out of today. You guys excited about making Chocolate Play Buttons?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.620
[Crowd cheers]

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.960
Give me a big "He Ha". [Ye Ha!]

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.060
Alright cool, first thing, we're gonna do Shawn

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.599
is we're going to take this chocolate and go put it in the microwave for 60 seconds, and your job is actually gonna be turning

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.890
this chocolate in the liquid form I want you to take the package out I want you to massage the chocolate, I want you to

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.540
work all of it into Itself until it gets a really nice consistency. We've got a pair of scissors standing by.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.040
What we're going to do is just snip off the very bottom corner of this bag and then

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.480
we're going to use that as a squeeze bag, to fill these molds. Sara's over here to help us with that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.760
So why don't you jump over here Sara, go ahead and snip off the corner

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.520
and we just want to fill that mold right up to the top.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.049
You grab both tabs and kind of bump it up and down a little bit

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.420
it'll help smooth it out. Right there I think you got it guys. All right let's give them a hand, first chocolate bar poured.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.060
[Clapping]

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.439
Nicely done.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.420
Alright now these are made with the vacuum-formed molds.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.060
We also have some silicone molds here and we've got enough chocolate in one bag hopefully to fill all five molds so let's go ahead and do

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.220
that same thing with the last four molds, all right cool, great job guys. [Yeah! Clapping]

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.520
Now a little side note about the vacuum former you can use them to make YouTube Play Buttons

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.200
but just for fun I molded my phone [Laugh]

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
So, we're gonna have the world's first

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.659
Galaxy S7 in chocolate here

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.178
All right so these have been sitting in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes, so we're going to start at

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.440
the edges, just peel it back let it come in its own pace. Let's see if you can get those chocolate bars out without cracking them.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.600
ooh [Laughing]

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.520
Nicely done. For your help and effort i'm gonna give that to you.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.140
Yes! [Laugh]

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.100
And that's for you.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.600
Thank you.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.260
[Clapping]

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.160
So as you can see guys the chocolate bars come out looking really, really, good and the faster you pour the chocolate.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.880
And the faster you can get it to settle the less of the pour lines you're going to see and if you want to go one step further

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.240
why not wrap it with aluminum foil?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.120
I did this on my vacuum forming machine so it looks a little bit nicer, a little bit cleaner, and the result comes out

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.610
looking really good, and the reason I did this guys is because Youtube does so much for us as creators they've created this whole platform

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.779
that's helping our dreams come true and allowing us to share the things that mean so much to us.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.899
They give us Play Buttons for a hundred thousand subscribers. Play Buttons for a million subscribers and Play Buttons now for 10 million subscribers

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080
but guys, who gives YouTube an award I thought maybe

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.600
we could be the first by giving YouTube a bonafide

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.040
chocolate Play Button made in The King of Random labs i'm pretty sure this has never been done before and so

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.299
we're going to present this with a plaque and everything which I'm still making my shop to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.600
Susan and The YouTube Team to express some of our gratitude and appreciation

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.280
for them, and for all the things that they do, so thank you guys we really, really, appreciate it.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.720
[Clapping and cheering]

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.530
