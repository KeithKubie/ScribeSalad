00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.140
Let's multiply 6 times 7,981.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.890
And the way we're going
to do it right now

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:20.780
is just to represent or expand
out 7,981 as 7,000 plus 900

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.640
plus 80 plus 1.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.850
And so multiplying 6 times
7,981 is the same thing

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.090
as multiplying 6 times 7,000
plus 6 times 900 plus 6 times

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.330
80 plus 6 times 1.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.830
You'd essentially
distribute the 6.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.350
And to help us keep
track of things,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.100
let me draw a little
grid right over here.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.820
So this is the 6,
and we're going

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.920
to have to think about what
6 times 7,000 is, 6 times

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.210
900, 6 times 80, and 6 times 1.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.840
So I'll make a little square for
our rectangle for each of them.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.370
Let me do that.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.540
So here we go.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.670
And so we just need to think
about, what is 6 times 7,000?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.450
Well 6 times 7 is 42.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.912
So 6 times 7,000 is 42,000.

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:16.750
6 times 900, well once
again, 6 times 9 is 54.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.810
So 6 times 900 is 5,400.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.500
6 times 80, well
80 is eight 10s.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.350
So 6 times 8 is 48, but since
it's six times 80 or eight 10s,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.100
this is going to
be 48 10s, or 480.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.300
And then finally, 6 times
1, of course, is equal to 6.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.200
So to find what this
product is, we just

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.010
have to take the sum of
each of these numbers.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.800
What 6 times 7,000 is plus
6 times 900 plus 6 times

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.950
80 plus 6 times 1.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.210
So let's do that
right over here.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:06.140
So it's going to be 42,000
plus 5,400 plus 480 plus 6.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.590
And we get, let's see, in the
ones place, we just have a 6.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.830
In the tens place,
we just have an 8.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.130
In the hundreds
place, 4 plus 4 is 8.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.787
In the thousands
place, 2 plus 5 is 7.

00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:19.620
And then finally, the
ten thousandths place,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.980
we still have a 4.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.300
So we get 47,886.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.256
So this Is equal to 47,886.

00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:29.630
And what I encourage
you to do is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.424
to think about
how this is really

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:33.840
underlining what
we're doing here.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.160
It's not that
different than what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.451
you might have done with the
traditional multiplication

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.276
techniques.

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:40.650
And this is a useful way of
thinking about it because now

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.172
you really understand
what's going on.

00:02:43.172 --> 00:02:44.880
And actually, when
you start doing things

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.440
like this in your head,
at least for myself,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.760
this is actually how I try
to tackle the multiplication

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.259
problem.

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.595
When someone says 6 times 7,981,
if I was just looking at this

00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:55.470
and I didn't have any
paper, I would say, OK,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.660
what's 6 times 7,000?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.030
I'd say, OK, that's 42,000.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.170
I'll try to remember that.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.110
What's 6 times 900?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.630
Oh that's 5,400.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.080
Well if I add that to
the 42,000, I get 47,400.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.961
Then, what's 6 times 80?

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:09.460
480.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.150
Have to add that to the
47,400 to get to 47,880.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.490
And then, what's 6 times 1?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.370
Well that's 6.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.770
Well add that to
the 47,880, which

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.461
I've been keeping in my brain,
and that's going to be 47,886.

00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:27.210
So this helps you
understand what's really

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.870
going on when you
multiply multiple digits,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.402
and it's a useful technique for
doing mental multiplication.
