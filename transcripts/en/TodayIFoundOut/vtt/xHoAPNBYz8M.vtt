00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:28.449
For fashion, even war is no excuse to let
standards slip, as many British women found

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.230
out during WW2.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.410
As part of doing their part for King and Country,
they were strongly encouraged to contribute

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.330
to the war effort by looking their best at
all times.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.550
In fact, one bit of British war propaganda
was literally “Beauty is your duty”…

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.600
As you might imagine, this led to some rather
ingenious solutions to solve the inevitable

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.640
shortages of cosmetics and clothing that arose
as a result of wartime rationing.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.400
On that note, clothing in UK began being rationed
in June of 1941, about a year after provisions

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.519
were put in place to ration food.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.060
Under the rules of rationing, every person
in the UK was initially given 66 coupons which

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.150
they could exchange for clothing.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.910
Different items of clothing carried a different
coupon weight decided by the time and material

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.140
that went into making them.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.250
So, for example, you might need to exchange
eleven coupons for a dress, but only two for

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.710
a pair of stockings.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.670
Each year, the allocation of coupons would
be replenished, though the amount steadily

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.670
decreased over time, with adults only receiving
24 between September of 1945 and April of

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.950
1946, for instance.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.210
Exceptions to this general rule included children
(who were allotted 10 extra coupons to account

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.700
for rapid growth) and new mothers (who were
given 50 extra coupons to buy things like

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.280
baby clothes and blankets).

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.380
Again, these amounts changed throughout the
war to reflect the ever growing scarcity of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
supplies.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.119
It’s important to point out here that most
at this time did not have closets and dressers

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.229
bursting with clothing as is common today
thanks to a much more industrialized and global

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.229
clothing industry.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.560
Thus, people generally had far fewer garments
to begin with, and now even more limited ability

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.450
to buy replacements.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.680
This all led to the “Make Do and Mend”
campaign, which was pushed hard by the British

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.760
Ministry of Information, demonstrating a variety
of ways in which to make clothes last, such

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.660
as to buy bigger clothing than needed for
children so they had room to grow.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.919
They also illustrated techniques aimed towards
modifying and repairing clothing using various

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.350
atypical materials.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.989
(More on this in a bit.)

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.299
They even setup classes to teach basic seamstress
skills, though many women of this era were

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.820
already quite good at this.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.919
It’s also important to note that the public
still had to pay for clothes; the coupons

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.040
were merely exchanged for the right to buy
them in the first place.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.699
Because of this, the fashion industry not
only survived the war, but thrived, even high-end

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.769
manufacturers (an expensive, tailored dress
still generally costing the same number of

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.050
coupons as a cheap one, since they used about
the same amount of material).

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.260
While clothing makers may have seen their
volume of civilian sales decrease with the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.880
scarcity of supplies and rationing, they simply
increased their prices accordingly.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.739
(That’s not to mention that making uniforms
and the like was extremely lucrative business.)

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.680
Unfortunately for those who couldn’t afford
the more expensive clothing, this meant either

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.180
sticking with clothes that were already well-worn,
or using precious coupons on clothing or materials

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.490
that were low quality, and thus didn’t last.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.100
This all created a major problem that needed
solved pronto if women were to continue looking

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.709
their best- something deemed important for
the country’s morale.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.470
To solve the issue, the government actually
did something somewhat innovative for once,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.380
which would ultimately have repercussions
on fashion and clothing in the UK long after

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.940
the war- they created what was dubbed “Utility
clothing” in 1942.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.290
Essentially, Utility clothing was mass-manufactured
clothing produced in a limited range of styles,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.560
fashions and colors to minimize production
costs over how clothing up until that point

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.310
was commonly made in the UK.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.799
Importantly, beyond driving the costs down,
a second goal of this fashion line was to

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.500
make the clothing extremely durable.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.370
With clothing lasting longer for everyone,
this also ensured more materials, factories,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.721
and workers in future would be available for
the war effort instead of making clothes for

00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:19.049
civilians.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.240
But making it cheap and durable wasn’t enough.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.110
After all, the overarching goal was, for women
particularly, to look good.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.310
Thus, the government managed a trifecta by
enlisting the aid of the Incorporated Society

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.160
of London Fashion Designers to provide the
nation’s best in the field to oversee the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.060
designs for both men and women’s Utility
clothing.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.890
As a result of this foresight, Utility clothing
actually became something of a hit with the

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.330
public and many of the designs would probably
still be considered fashionable today, because

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.580
things like conservative dark suits, tapered
dresses and black plimsolls never really go

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.580
out of style.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.350
In fact, they even made a relatively fashionable
air raid outfit known as a “siren suit”;

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.080
so if a woman needed to jump out of bed and
flee to a bomb shelter, while possibly literally

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.710
having bombs raining down on her, she’d
look damn good while running for her life.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.160
This all brings us to makeup.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.420
Unlike most everything else during WW2, makeup
and cosmetics were never rationed during the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.180
war, instead being subjected to a massive
luxury tax which was levied upon all items

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.620
deemed “non-essential” by the government.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.971
Of course, as that same government was very
publicly pushing women to “look your best”

00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:36.810
at all times, many of the fairer sex didn’t
consider these items “non-essential”.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.220
Big cosmetic companies weren’t helping either,
going as far as to pay for large ads in papers

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.070
and magazines informing women that “No lipstick
– ours or anyone else’s – will win the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.070
war.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.290
But it symbolises one of the reasons why we
are fighting…”

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.020
On this note, amusingly, many cosmetic brands
continued to put out adverts despite the fact

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.510
that the stock of the very things they were
advertising for were low to non-existent.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.510
So why’d they do it?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.450
In essence, it’s generally thought they
were afraid if women got used to not wearing

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.140
makeup, when the war was over, some might
just not go back to it.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.670
So the companies did everything in their power
to push women to continue to find ways to

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.840
wear some form of makeup.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.350
Paradoxically, this meant they continued to
advertise a product that it was impossible

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.560
for many women to obtain, right next to full
page ads telling them if they didn’t wear

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.510
it, they were letting Hitler win.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.500
That’s not hyperbole by the way; it was
well known at the time that Adolf had a particular

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.460
distaste for makeup and cosmetics, with the
fuhrer even known to chastise women for wearing

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.850
perfume or using hair dye.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.850
On top of this, he also saw to it that wearing
furs was out.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.850
(He, ironically, abhorred the killing of animals.)

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.572
In fact, when Hitler came to power, he established
a German Fashion Board (Deutsches Modeamt)

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:50.570
to help push his brand of fashion, emphasizing,
among other things, no make-up, natural hair,

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.670
and curves, rather than the “boyish bodies”
that Parisian fashion promoted.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.800
Important to the discussion at hand was that
the end goal, according to Hitler, was that

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.480
“Berlin women must become the best dressed
in Europe”.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.720
So what was a patriotic, Nazi hating British
woman about town to do when she wanted to

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.630
stick it to Hitler, but didn’t have the
coupons (or money) to afford a new dress,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.110
and nobody in town had cosmetics available?

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.160
In short, she improvised.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.110
Women would make new clothing out of everything
from curtains or furniture upholstery to old

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.910
parachutes, and would raid their wardrobes
to reuse, mend and alter their existing outfits

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.840
to make them more stylish.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.530
The lack of materials also allowed women to
be a little more risque in their clothing

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.720
choices and the hemlines of dresses became
noticeably shorter during the war as a result.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.320
This, however, caused a problem of another
sort- exposed bare skin, with no good way

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.810
to partially cover it thanks to a shortage
of stockings and the relatively newly invented

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.240
nylon being unavailable owing to almost exclusively
being used by the military.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.800
To get around the problem, women began staining
their legs with various things, including

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.919
gravy browning, to make it look as though
they were wearing something, even drawing

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:07.650
a seam down the back of their legs to complete
the effect.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.900
With the government seeing to it that, “every
government poster recruiting a land girl,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.199
image of a Wren or member of the Women’s
Royal Voluntary Service showed her with bright

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:20.870
red lipstick and a flash of black mascara”,
the clothing problem wasn’t the only thing

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.440
that needed solved.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.850
To get around their lack of lipstick, women
would dye their lips with beetroot and, somewhat

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.970
questionably from an eye-health standpoint,
use boot polish as makeshift mascara.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.580
They would also shove flowers and other herbs
into their pockets to get around the lack

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.930
of perfume.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.930
Some girls working in certain factories also
notably used the powder meant to protect their

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:46.350
face from heat as rouge, and would sometimes
speckle their hair in TNT powder to dye it

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.350
blonde.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.710
(Note: When it was first made in the mid-19th
century, TNT was actually originally used,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.700
not as an explosive, but as a yellow dye.)

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.240
On that note, some women couldn’t help but
go yellow, specifically those working in munitions

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240
factories.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.690
They eventually got the nickname “canary
girls” because the powdered explosive, whether

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.820
they wanted it to or not, would dye their
skin and hair bright yellow.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.760
The color eventually faded, but the powder
caused horrible skin rashes and breathing

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760
problems.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.540
Oh, and we should probably mention that prolonged
exposure to TNT can cause liver, blood, spleen,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.990
and immune system problems, among others…

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.500
But hey, when “beauty is your duty”, you
do what you have to do.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:11:03.339
Can’t let those German women look better
than you; then Hitler would win…
