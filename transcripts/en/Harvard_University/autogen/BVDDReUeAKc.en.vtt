work was really in response to a handful

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670
work was really in response to a handful
 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.740
work was really in response to a handful
of small studies in which investigators

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750
of small studies in which investigators
 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.800
of small studies in which investigators
had grown food crops in chambers and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810
had grown food crops in chambers and
 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.690

greenhouses at elevated concentrations

greenhouses at elevated concentrations
 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.220
greenhouses at elevated concentrations
of co2 and found that they lost

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230
of co2 and found that they lost
 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.270
of co2 and found that they lost
significant amounts of their nutritional

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280
significant amounts of their nutritional
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.880
significant amounts of their nutritional
value and those results were sort of

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890
value and those results were sort of
 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.830
value and those results were sort of
debated in the literature as to whether

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840
debated in the literature as to whether
 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.340
debated in the literature as to whether
they were real or whether they were

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350
they were real or whether they were
 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.360
they were real or whether they were
artefactual and the results of these

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370
artefactual and the results of these
 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.370
artefactual and the results of these
artificial growing conditions and due to

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380
artificial growing conditions and due to
 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.980
artificial growing conditions and due to
pot effects and so we put together a

pot effects and so we put together a
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.649

in that food and when you overlay those
 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.890
in that food and when you overlay those
kinds of data you can actually start to

kinds of data you can actually start to
 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.890
