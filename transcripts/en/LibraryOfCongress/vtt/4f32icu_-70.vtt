00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.590
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Good
evening, welcome everyone.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.040
Nice to see some friendly
regular faces

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.200
and also some new folks
out here tonight.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.310
My name is Nicholas Brown,
I am a music specialist

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.120
and concert producer
here at the library.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.420
I'm very pleased to introduce
to you two wonderful colleagues.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.960
On my far left is Herve
Boutry who is director general

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.700
of Ensemble Intercontemporain
[foreign language].

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.770
Yeah, I really have been
practicing it's kind of funny.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.600 position:56%
And to my immediate left is Matthias
Pintscher who is the music director

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.780
of Ensemble and also a
distinguished composer.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.870
We're very thrilled to have them
both here to share some thoughts

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.640
with you this evening before
a super exciting concert,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.730
which is the Ensemble's DC debut.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.920
So let's kick it off.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.010
Tell us a bit about your
impression of DC so far.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.580
No politics.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.020
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: Well we
arrived yesterday night

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.700
and we enjoyed fantastic acoustic
of the [inaudible] auditorium.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.500
And we are very happy
to be here because it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.150
for us also the conclusion of a
wonderful tour through the US.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.500
We started some days ago,
two weeks ago in Berkeley,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.760
we had four days residency
there and four days

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.420
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.630
And these residences we have
interactive with the universities

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.750 position:56%
and had a different focus on the
repertoire because it was of course,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.640
more contemporary on one side.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.420
We have a very contemporary
program tonight.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.780
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: We
have so classical tonight yes.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.020
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: But tonight we
have also classical repertoire

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.950
and so that's my first
impression or expression

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.060
from Washington, DC up to now.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: I mean, it's
obviously beautiful to see this city

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
and I've been to DC many,
many times, but I think never

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.410
at that time of the year where
you see the beautiful foliage

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.740
of the leaves and we're very
fortunate with the weather

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.600
and the sun, which is also kind
of irritating and confusing

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.390
because it is just not normal.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.930
And I don't really know
what you think of it.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.230
But I mean right now we just
walked over and I was going

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.380
through some manuscripts
of Beethoven and Schoenberg

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.010
and Copeland and we received
the news from what is going

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.400
on in this very moment in Paris.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.360
So it is emotionally very
how can I even put it,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.320
I'm really moved and now.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.390
But this is exactly what makes an
artist because now we may or have

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.300
to play this concert with
all these emotions that go on

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.790
and it's the only thing we can do

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.320
because we're not in
Paris right now.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.860
So what we can do is just to keep
doing exactly what we believe in,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.060
which is play the music
in the most painful way

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.900
so it brings people together.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.030
I I'm really emotional it's very
disturbing what is going on.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.330
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: You
have to explain.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.630
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
Yeah, I got the feels

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.980
that all you needed info,
so don't worry about it.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.410
There's been new within
the last couple of hours

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.880
of a major series of
attacks in Paris.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.390
And if you have people living in
Paris, please you want to check

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.680
in with them as soon as you can
and it's not clear who or why

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.640
or the extent or anything
like that yet.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.120
So it's -- tonight will
probably be a very difficult

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.290
and emotional evening for everyone
who's going to be on stage.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.590
So with that note.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.340
With a program like this evening's

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.240
where there's some very highbrow
art music that is, you know,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.900
the creme de la creme
in terms of repertoire

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.460
and then we have some
really great new repertoire.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.150
What can we gain in terms of human
experience from this type of music,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.450
particularly tonight's program?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.410
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: We
gain from it what we have

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.060
and it brings us directly to the
question that's being put out over

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.900
and over again like when
audience members ask me

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.850
or someone what should we listen
for, can you tell us something

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.120
that helps us to be
guided through a piece.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.260
And I said well you guide
yourself, you listen with your ears

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.200
and you listen with the
qualities that you have.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.410
I mean listening means to involve
yourself and with all great art

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.250
and it could be visual, it could
be sonic you find something

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.210
about yourself and it's not really,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.460
it's kind of the artist is
stepping back and hands it over.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.400
And think that is what makes
it very, very beautiful

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.710
and music describes time.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.640
So the one thing we
have to accept is

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.600
that someone else has defined
a certain span of time for us,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.070
which nowadays seem to
becoming something that's almost

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.590
uncomfortable because we are
so used to being in control

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.650
of how we define the flow of time.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.400
We zap through something, we stop
something, we turn something off

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.980
and when you listen to sound

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.610
and music you can't do
that, you have to sit there.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.250
I mean you can walk out, but
you have to listen to 13 pieces,

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.690
13 minutes or 25 minutes
or 70 minutes of music

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.170
that someone has designed
and conceived for you

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.700
because he believes or she in
how that time is happening.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.950
So it enables us to
completely let go

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.950
and I think that's a
beautiful condition.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.490
And people sometimes
feel the opposite

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.430
that they don't feel
qualified enough

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.610
because they might not know enough,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.360
but every one is the most
qualified listener anyway,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.350
there is no such thing
as a qualification.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.130
You can know more about music,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.080
but it doesn't help you
to understand music.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:59.470
So just listen and listen to
what you have and it's that easy.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Thank
you that was really great.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.430
Maybe to switch back
to regular topics now

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.220
because I guess we're going
to get pretty emotional here.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.590
But Herve, could you tell us a
bit about how your relationship

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.080
and the Ensemble's relationship
began with Matthias and how

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.780
that grew into his current
role as music director.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.080
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: I have been with
this Ensemble already 20 years

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:29.220 position:56%
and I have been very close to Pierre
Boulez when he asked me to come.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:36.860 position:56%
And I must say it is what we live at
the moment is a very fortunate time

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:44.030
because after so fantastic
years we are now getting

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.720
like any organization you
have changes, evolution

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.200
and we have the impression now
that Pierre Boulez is no longer

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.120
in the condition to be
very present with us.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.510
He's of course, in in contact with
us, but not physically present.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:11.590 position:56%
And we have the impression to become
adult and not to be the children

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.430
of Pierre Boulez and this
has been enhanced very,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.700
very strongly from the moment

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:25.260 position:56%
when Matthias Pintscher has been saw
sharing destiny because it happened

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.860
like good food or we say in French.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:36.620
In 2011, we appointed him
on June 12 and he started

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.790
with the Ensemble in 2013.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:49.230
And I say that because it is not --
I want also to make a distinction

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.410
between what an ensemble looks
like, we are not a small orchestra.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:01.450
We are a group of soloists,
a group of individuality,

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:08.450
strong personalities and what is
very important in such a group is

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:17.720
to be able to always ask yourself
why are you performing it together.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.780
And when you have somebody
like Matthias,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.120
when you have these personalities

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.410 position:56%
at this very moment I have the
impression you are on the right wave

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:35.080
to go very much further
in aesthetically,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.210
musically in the artistic
experience.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.730
That's my statement
now if you ask me

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.010
about my relationship
with the Ensemble.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.690
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Is there a
noticeable change in the focus

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.240
of the Ensemble now
and moving forward

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.610
versus in the past few
tenures of music directors?

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.260
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: Yeah,
there is a very big change

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.600
because it's not only the music
directors it's also the world

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.020
which has changed.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.410
And the music world is
changing, I mean all the time.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:23.830
And I think the 10 last years it
has been very obviously opening up.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.060
The music world is
going from a more --

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:38.790
from a quite segmented attitude in
the past where modern institution

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.680
of people were modernists.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:50.500
And now you have all classical
or [inaudible] to be authentic.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.750
And now you have a different trend
which is to try and go to the root,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.940
to the essence of the
music and to try

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.000
and find not a common denominator,
but a stronger experience,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.880
particularly in this time where
internet where one can imagine

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.030
that 15 or 20 years ago we didn't
have internet as we have it now.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:24.090
And it's absolutely
obvious with young composers

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.780
that they are writing in the
world with internet differently

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.500
than they were writing before.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.860
The relationship with
the others has changed

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.770
and that's also explaining
the evolution of the Ensemble,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:48.870
the Ensemble is an institution, a
contemporary institution and has

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:56.770
to move forward in this
environment and tries to do it

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.100
on the most pertinent way.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.940
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Do you feel
a weight on your shoulders

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.100
as a successor of Boulez
in your role?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.900
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: I
would rather, honestly I hope

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.270
that does sound arrogant because
I really don't mean it that way.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:17.000 position:56%
But I almost feel more encouragement
than weight because everything

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.800
that Boulez cared about is the
passing on and the sharing.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.180
He might be even the only one

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.410
who has been almost aggressively
curious about what we do.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:36.830
And all these encounters I
had with him and everything

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:42.280 position:56%
that built our friendship and our
connection is based on his curiosity

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.850
of hearing me what I was starting
with, what I wanted to know.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.220
And every time that goes years back

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:55.140
when I was conducting a major
new work of the repertoire

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.790
of the 20th century, I'm
talking about [inaudible].

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.180
He was so generous to share his
time with me and I most went

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.380
to Baden-Baden and we sat there
on his [inaudible] couch for hours

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.740
and hours and hours and shared.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:21.050
So I rather feel a tremendous
enlightenment than the weight.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:28.430
But of course and but he would be
really, really he is very excited

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.390
to see that we're moving things
forward whatever that means.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.860
Because the movement itself of
going forward and I'm not talking

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.190
of avant-garde, but just the
keeping, that fact the condition

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.110
of keeping walking
is way more important

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.230
than the sensation of arrival.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.700
Fulfillment puts everything
in question,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.760
we always go back to the score.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.710
And, you know, we're an institution
that is living on the basis

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.100
of all the scores that
have been conceived

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.370
and that have been
purchased right now

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.800
and hopefully will be
written in the future.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.740
This is Boulez, Boulez is look at
the score and take it from there.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.210
And it's not about me and how I
define that [inaudible] because I

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.540
like it that way or no, it
needs to come out of the score.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.060
And I'd rather take that as a
tremendous potential of inspiration

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.570
than feeling intimidated and I
hope you understand it [inaudible].

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.020
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Oh yeah, I
think it's wonderful to hear

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:33.280
that perspective because
at least people that come

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.460
up through the US system and
knowing whatever happened

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.340
with in [inaudible] there's just
this aura around him that from

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.620 position:56%
when you actually hear from someone
who knows him and interacts with him

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:50.260
on a very personal level that
sort of being isn't the reality.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.500
So it's such a treat for
us to have you all here

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.400
to give us the real honest
perspective on his legacy.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.670 position:56%
Tell us a bit about your recent
performance of [inaudible] in Paris.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.970
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher:

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:10.610
Well [inaudible] is some people
consider it as his opus maximum and

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:16.420
but he wrote many opus
maxima or maximi,

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:26.320
opi maximi is that the Latin
plural [inaudible] said that.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.420
But [inaudible] culminates
in an ingenious way

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.620
of really combining the electronics
and real sound to a level

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.240
that is maybe really unbeaten.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:45.200
It's a work that is driven
by a great sense for color

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.260
and virtuosity, which
are two aspects

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:54.720
that very much define partly
what we consider as French.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.420 position:56%
But underneath it there's is a
great level and depth of expression.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:08.830
And I always like it very much
to compare Boulez to Ravel

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.310
because they are composed of their
personalities that were very,

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.960
very conscious on how
to set up a composition,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.300
but then also to allow it to fly

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.720
and enhance the richness
that is living inside.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.460
Very controlled from the outside,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:29.410
but equally strong
emotionally on the inside.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:35.300
And so in that aspect for me as
a colleague if I may call myself

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:41.110
so it is fantastic to sit
down and be a scholar and read

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.580
and analyze those scores,
but at the same time

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.820
when I can just abandon all
that and perform the music

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.640
from the performer's angle is
equally as strong and there's not

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.380
that much repertoire that is
being written nor has been written

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.360
recently that has both
those qualities

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.030
which are extremely
appealing to me personally.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.350
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: I want
to add something which is

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:11.180
that Pierre Boulez is also a
personality who has a global vision

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:19.830
of his artistry and for him art is
not only writing music on a paper,

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:26.870
it's also conducting, it's
also working with musicians,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.730
but it's also working
with architects,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:36.940
with people from all
sorts of disciplines.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.040
And there is a very
strong [inaudible],

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.940 position:56%
which affects me very strongly of
course because it's the architecture

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.620
of the whole is a set of work
which has to be performed

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.740
with the ensemble in the middle and
the soloist around the audience.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.700
And the electronics
transforms the sound

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:04.650
and the electronic is projected in
addition to the acoustic sounds.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:11.150
And it is -- it was very obvious
this year we performed it three

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:20.320
times in very different places
and I know that it is a challenge

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:28.350
which Pierre considered
as part of his work.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.010
This challenge to find
the best conditions

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:40.680
and among these three hall we
had a hall which was very reduced

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.670
and without big interest.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.340
We had a fantastic
place in Amsterdam,

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.640
which was originally a [inaudible]
I don't know what it is, you know,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:58.510 position:56%
a tank where you put the gas and it
has been transformed in concert hall

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.670
or performance place
which was fantastic

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.770 position:56%
because it's completely symmetrical.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:10.220 position:56%
You have the ensemble in the middle,
you have 1,200 people around.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.620
But more fantastic
was the performance

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.290
at the Philharmonie de
Paris which is a new hall

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.040
which has been opened
in January this year.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.540
And I dare to say that without
Pierre Boulez this hall wouldn't

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.340
have been built.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:34.990
It is really a hall which
combines all the characteristic

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:42.270
of what somebody like
him would have dreamt

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:53.100
and it is a fantastic acoustic
even for classical music,

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.060
but it offers also extraordinary
experience to the audience

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.120 position:56%
when it is used for amplified music.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:08.480 position:56%
So it was a sort of consecration
actually of the different dimensions

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:15.850
of Pierre Boulez composer,
performer,

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:20.780
inspiratory of all sorts of people.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.080
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.780
Could you tell us a bit about
your new recording projects?

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.640
I know there was a new release
just a couple of weeks ago

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.540
and hopefully there's more to come.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.370
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: We
are obviously very excited

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.880
to sign a deal with
a recording company,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.250
but also at the same time
you realize that it is kind

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.530
of outdated to produce records.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.320
I still personally I'm
super old-fashioned anyway

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.110
because I'm still writing my
music with pencil and paper,

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:55.180 position:56%
etcetera so I also still appreciate
having a CD in my hand and I guess I

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.820
like the booklet and I take it
out and I look at the pictures.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.480
And I appreciate it,
I do appreciate it.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.870
And also I appreciate the
fact that the CD has to be put

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.830
into a CD player that is mostly
with much better acoustics

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.330
than just listening to it on
your on your Mac Book Pro.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.270
That's actually what does
happen if you download all

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:21.090
that on iTunes it's,
you know, it's just.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.230
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Yuck
was the word up here.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.450
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: So,
you know, taking the detour.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.410
Yes, we are producing
now two CDs per season

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.610
with a French label
it's called Alpha,

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.120
it's part of the [inaudible] group.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.680
And they give us --
it is not anymore?

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.750
[Inaudible] sorry, see
I'm getting it all wrong.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:52.970
And they do something with us
and to us which is wonderful.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.970
It's an institution to
have which they give us

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:02.210
like some [foreign language], they
give us a completely free hand

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.860
to choose and to present
of what we believe in.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.570 position:56%
And we both like the record
producers and us, the artistic team,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:16.050
have come to the conclusion
that it might be interesting

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:20.170 position:56%
to even compose the content of a CD.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:25.310
So because nowadays in the real
concert world where people are less

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:29.590
and less inclined to subscribe
themselves to a concert series

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.490
of their favorite philharmonic
orchestra or whatever it would be,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:40.180
but want to decide in the moment
that puts a weight on our shoulders

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.630
because we have to think
more and more carefully

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.240 position:56%
of how we compose program a program.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.490
And I think that should
naturally also reflect

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.900
on our choices of what
we put on a CD.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.850
And mostly in the past we have
been talking about monographic CDs

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:01.130
like one composes, so you pair
Beethoven five and seven on one CD.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:06.080
We do completely different because
we want to tell stories on CD

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:14.740 position:56%
that could even comprise of the most
diverse compositional personalities,

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.730 position:56%
but that in the end represent
something like a concert experience.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.890
So you can basically, you can
also go to track four and listen

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.870
to [inaudible], but also
you can listen to that CD

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.750
as if you were to go to a concert.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.020
And it is an idea and
we'll see if it translates,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.870
but we just released our
first CD and so far it seems

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.820
to be a tremendous success.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.120
But also on the base of the quality
of the playing, these players are

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.890
and you will hear it in a couple
minutes, are just phenomenal.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:55.380
And it's a metaphor, but what
they touch really turns into gold

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:03.250
because there's so much respect
and tradition, comprehension of --

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:08.400
it goes almost 40 years back now
and we have a repertoire yes,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.990
but we always built
on the repertoire.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.580
And we're basically living in three
different times at the same time,

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.700
which is the present, but we
look back at the repertoire

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.370
that we have been part of
and have also generated.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:25.220
And the foreshadowing which is we
are contemporary music orchestra,

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.690
we give out commissions,
we invest in the future,

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.330
we are investing a lot
of time in researching

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.650
of who should join our family

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.120
and who we support
and who we believe in.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.110
So it's, you know, I'll close
it's a long answer for me.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.140
But as we talk about Pierre
Boulez one of the things --

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.860
it was during our first lunch
we had 15 years back he talked

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.230
about how fascinated he
is by the architecture

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.210
of the Guggenheim Museum
in New York.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.740
Where you wind yourself
up through that spiral

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.820
and you always [inaudible]
three times because you are here

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.550
and you look at that image,
but you can always look back

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.860
and still see what you have seen.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.980
And you can already take a
sneak peek at what's coming up.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.860
And so, you know, living
and perceiving and feeling

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.320
in three different times at the
same time is an ingenious concept.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.510
And we are somewhat
trying to reflect

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.600
that in what we do with the CDs.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.290
But you can also download
them on iTunes

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.590
for the people who [inaudible].

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:31.300
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: How
has your live broadcasting

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:37.330
of concerts impacted your -- I
don't want to say name recognition,

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:42.040
but the way that your artistic sort

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:51.700
of vision is permeating beyond
your sort of core audience.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.690
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: I don't know.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.970
I think the broadcasting is
something which gives sort

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:04.130
of insider in listening,
in something happening

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.920
in the concert hall,
it's more documentation.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:13.810
Because I am not a good
radio listener personally,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:21.550
but though I believe that it is
very important for an institution

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.060
to be broadcasted for the people

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.400
who simply physically cannot
be in the concert hall.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:35.220
But it's for me it comes in a
second row in the hierarchy.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:44.460
In fact, I think we are
quite regularly supported

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:51.340
by the French public
radio, almost the majority

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.720
of our concerts are documented.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.090
I find it very interesting, more
interesting the editorial aspect

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.630
of these specialized radio because
then they can provide something

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.800
which you cannot get
in the concert hall.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.300
The conversation with the composer,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:17.280
discussion of what you
have just heard and I think

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:24.270
in this respect it is very helpful
to disseminate what we are doing.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:29.140
And I think it has really been
an important in the history

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:36.380
of the Ensemble and just n the
communication with the people.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.490
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great and
one other topic before we open

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.070
up to a couple questions.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.760
What is your funding model

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.790
like because I know it's completely
different than what we're used

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.960
to here in the United States
for any of our music ensemble?

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.210
So how the US relies on
private funds generally

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.790
and some public grant money.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:01.290
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: The
Ensemble has overall budget

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:10.580 position:56%
of 6 million Euros a year, 4 million
is coming from public subsidies,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.610
2 million are coming from
the income or from sponsors.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:20.080
Actually the sponsors are a
ridiculous part among these

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.460
2 million.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.090
And this is quite of course,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:32.220 position:56%
in comparison with American
institution it's like another planet

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.030 position:56%
because I think for you the
proportion of subsidies is very low.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:43.380
But among French or European music
institutions the Ensemble has a

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.590
quite challenging model.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.990
There are very few orchestras,
public funded orchestras which have

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:55.200
such a big amount of income

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.390
from selling the concerts
and sponsorship.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:08.170
And we are doing well, we cross our
fingers because it's always tough.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:15.230 position:56%
But the quality of the Ensemble and
the strength of our image is really,

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:21.450
I mean the core of
our economic success.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.630
We have time for maybe
one or two questions.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.180
So if you could raise your hand
and then my colleague Jay will come

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.810
to you with the microphone
in the back.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.440
It looks like we have
up here in the front.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.810
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask a question
that explores what you mean

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.850
by musical understanding.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.890
I believe your answer to that first
question pertaining more to the way

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.600
that people have their
own way of understanding.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.630
But I got the impression from
the avant-garde of the 60's

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.050
that in many cases composers
were inventing their own language

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.330
sometimes with each composition,

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:09.760
whereas in other cases listeners
might want to look for illusions

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.940
or understanding based upon
all of musical history.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.950
So any comments on that?

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:20.880
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: Well let's
maybe take this back a couple years

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.750 position:56%
more and look at what happened after
the Second World War and I'm talking

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:30.380
about what has been written and
composed in Europe after the war.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:37.260
And it seems like there was a
certain need for some objectivity

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.900
in what was composed because
everything had fallen apart

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.910
and the people were so speechless
and they didn't have the courage

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.750 position:56%
or were not feeling strong enough to
just continue to be just subjective

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.240
and they needed to
objectify themselves.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.560
And that's why that music
that was written in the 50's

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:04.230 position:56%
and even the 60's so extremely
organized because maybe the majority

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.670
of the composers in Europe felt
like they needed to be able

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.250
to argument why they
put that F sharp here

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.150
and why they don't use the double
bases in the second movement.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.540
And then all these decisions
had some argumentation handy

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.960
and ready to go.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:27.510 position:56%
And then with growing courage people
again all re-immersed themselves

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:32.010
in the pleasure of living
in diversity and then all

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:36.310
of a sudden even like the major
works of the 70's allowed again

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:45.630
that quality of physicality, color
and yes emotion to be re-included.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:52.590
And that's why I always
plead my case to the listener

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:57.940
to please not be so
strung up on the fact

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.550
that we think we can
understand a piece of art

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.310
because that's what happens
to us when we go to school.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.850
And when I was being taught how

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.010
to understand the second Viennese
school and in particular a work

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.170
by Anton Webern where, you know,
the melody is being played that way

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.550
and then is being played
backwards and then it's mirrored

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.840
and you just mark this all with
differently colored crayons

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.330
and [inaudible] and you think
you understand the piece.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.630
That's what happened to me.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:30.830
But no one was talking to us about
why that no flute with all that air

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:35.980
in the sound had this
erratic quality.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:41.150 position:56%
Why that low note on the [inaudible]
that D flat in opus 10 why

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.940
that note doesn't really --

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.720
the physically the
instrument doesn't allow

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.600 position:56%
that note is not any more brilliant,
but it contains so much emotion.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.940
And I wish and that's what
I'm doing with my students

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.900
at Julliard we do a completely
new way of analyzing a work,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.420
we doing an erratic analysis,

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.370
no more crayons we just
talk about what we hear.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.570
And I so wish that the listener
could just do exactly the same.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:13.510
Leave your crayons at home and
no, I'm serious because we are

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:19.070
so determined by thinking analogies
and then feeling accomplished

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.610
when we understand a piece of art.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.040
Like in the [inaudible] do you
understand the piece, I don't.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.950
I mean I know a lot about it, but
I don't understand it any better

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.440
than you or you and I'm
exaggerating a little bit.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.160
But I feel like it goes to
the listening and this is

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.230
where the emotions are kept.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.870
That is the vessel of music.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:47.030
And we are all emotional why
can't we allow that very naturally

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.720
to happen in that encounter
with sound

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.770
and even the sounds we
have never heard before.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.110
It's a long discussion, but also
sometimes it just feels good

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.680
to impressively not discuss
it anymore because then you're

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.250
on yourself and I'm not guiding
you and I'm not telling you what

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.790
to listen for because
you have to listen.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.860
And it's much more beautiful
if you listen to what you hear

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.560
than what I tell you what you
should hear in a piece of art.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.860
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.210
We have time for one
very short question

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:21.670
that will require a short
answer, so who's got that?

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.970
Great.

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.600
&gt;&gt; So there's a big difference
in terms of multilingualism

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.640
between Europe and America and
following on your comment just now

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:40.820
about auric training, do you have
any approach on how to train an ear

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.700
that has not grown up
listening to many sounds?

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.180
Is there a way of reprogramming
the ear?

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.680
&gt;&gt; Matthias Pintscher: [Inaudible].

00:34:51.680 --> 00:35:00.550
Well I will be short,
I mean as I have to be.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:05.320
But if as you say, if you
have little experience

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.740
or someone has little experience
or is not thoroughly trained,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.400
it's even more fantastic because
you hear everything fresh.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.930
It's like when a kid looks at the
first time at the Monet painting

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:23.880
or tastes a banana for the first
time wow, so there you are.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.680
That was a short answer.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:32.300
[ Applause ]

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.600
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.040
Well a huge thank you to
Herve and to Matthias.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:43.690
Tonight is a very -- thank you,
tonight is a very historic occasion

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:49.420
for the library series to be able
to present the DC premiere of one

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.040
of the greatest most important
musical ensembles in the world

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.600
without question, it's
an objective statement.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:36:02.120 position:56%
And, you know, for all of us to grow
up just holding this huge regard

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.190
for your ensemble and to finally
have you here is just such a thrill

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.930
that I think hopefully all
of you are feeling as well

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.200
and I think it's going to be
quite a spectacular evening

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.520
for you musically.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.370
So again, thank you
to Herve and Matthias.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.900
&gt;&gt; Herve Boutry: Thank
you to having us.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.450
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.890
of Congress, visit us at LOC.gov.
