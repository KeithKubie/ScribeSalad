00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.188
Now that we have seen the relationship
between hit time, miss time and

00:00:03.188 --> 00:00:07.050
cache performance,
let's do a quiz about them.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.130
Which of the following are true for
a well-designed cache?

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.390
Is it true that hit time
is less than miss time,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.540
that hit time is larger than the miss
penalty, that the hit time should be

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.320
equal to the miss penalty or
miss time is larger than miss penalty?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.980
Note that more than one,
possibly all of them, might be true or

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.520
maybe none of them are true.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.647
So check all of those that are true for
a well-designed cache.
