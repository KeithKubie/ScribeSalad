LAURENCE MORONEY: A couple
of weeks ago on "Coffee

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.330
with a Googler," we
met with Justin Quimby,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.730
and we spoke about Tango
and all the cool things

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.020
that are happening with Tango.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.270
So now we're in Mountain View.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.350
We're at the Tango
Summit, and Justin's here,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.320
so we're going to go upstairs
and catch up with him.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.730
We're here now at the Tango
Summit in Mountain View,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.200
and Justin's back to catch
up with us and tell us

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
what's new and exciting.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.780
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Well, what's new
and exciting is we launched.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.410
Woohoo.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.260
JUSTIN QUIMBY: So yeah,
it's really exciting.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.690
The Lenovo Phab 2
Pro went on sale

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.759
at the beginning of
November worldwide,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.499
and we've already got dozens
of apps in the Play Store

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:36.540
that people are building.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.180
And part of the reason we're
so thrilled about this event

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.986
this week is when
last we chatted,

00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:43.860
I was talking about how
this is the beginning

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
of the ecosystem for smartphone
augmented reality applications.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.610
And we're here to
help some folks spread

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.400
the word about Tango and how to
build great apps for the Phab 2

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.552
Pro and other
Tango-enabled smartphones.

00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:57.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: Super cool.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.852
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah.

00:00:57.852 --> 00:00:59.857
And one of the coolest
things is we're

00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:01.440
starting to see apps
in the Play Store

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.690
that we didn't know about.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.110
One of the really
exciting things

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.734
about this organic growth
in the app ecosystem

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.900
is it means that people are
getting excited about it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.630
with us, without us simply
saying, hey, hey, hey,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.130
built that.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.994
Build an app.

00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:16.410
Which means that
people are seeing

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.030
value in what Tango provides
to the smartphone ecosystem.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.920
I mean, we've got
apps that-- I think

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.390
I saw you fail pretty
badly at Jenga earlier.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
thought you were supposed

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.000
to knock the tower over.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.600
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah, of course.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.700
For you, you're totally
supposed to knock it down.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.480
Games are a natural place
to use augmented reality

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.050
in a smartphone form factor.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.940
But it's not just about games.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.144
Shopping is also
another fantastic area

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.560
where people are
starting to build

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.950
apps that take advantage
of the Tango stack

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.440
to really bring value and
utility to their users.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.240
So iStaging and Wayfair
and Lowe's and Amazon,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.920
and a bunch of
other folks, are all

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.530
building apps that use
the Tango technology.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.500
It's not just about the app
ecosystem and developers

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.350
getting excited about what's
happening with the hardware

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.520
and software.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
We're also starting to see
larger and larger organizations

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.290
get excited about
Tango technology.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.410
Now, earlier this
year, we actually

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.086
had a hackathon in
Shenzhen, China.

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:17.002
LAURENCE MORONEY: Aha.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.450
I've been to Shenzhen.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.200
It's a nice place.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.340
JUSTIN QUIMBY:
It's a crazy town.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, yeah.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.850
JUSTIN QUIMBY:
It's a crazy town.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.474
The reason it was
particularly exciting

00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:28.200
is there were over 200 teams
working on Tango applications.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.092
And the prime minister of
China held a Phab 2 Pro--

00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:32.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.060
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And got
a demo of some of them.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.860
So the thing that's
exciting about it is we

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.740
start to see not
just individuals

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.490
and small companies,
but bigger and bigger

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.160
companies, and
actually governments,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.850
see value in this technology.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.000
The snowball has just started
rolling down the hill.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.920
And part of the thing
that I love about events

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.380
like this week is
you get to talk

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.920
to folks who are going to go out
and spread the word about Tango

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.042
and get the developer
community excited.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.374
JUSTIN QUIMBY:
And we can't wait.

00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:02.190
We just cannot wait to see what
developers come up with with

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.630
this technology stack.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.880
Because we've built
this set of tools,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.780
and there are problems out there
that we don't even know about.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.091
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And we
can't wait for people

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.920
to use this technology in
new and interesting ways

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.060
to do things that we
haven't even thought of.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.976
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
speaking of snowballs, I

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:20.460
heard there's one app that
models the entire solar system.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.240
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Oh, yeah.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.800
So shopping, gaming, and then
there's a whole education one.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.710
Now, we actually
had an incubator

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.355
to help some
developers build apps.

00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:28.980
And one of the apps
that came out of it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.729
is just a fantastic
demonstration

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.270
of how this kind of
technology can be

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.999
used for educational purposes.

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.540
Now, I don't know
about you, but when

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.248
I went through elementary
school and they

00:03:38.248 --> 00:03:39.810
had the classes on
the solar system,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.184
and you're sort
of sitting there,

00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:44.100
and they start talking about
how many hundreds of thousands

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.244
of miles are between
Neptune and Pluto--

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:48.660
LAURENCE MORONEY:
A lot more that.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.960
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.760
And is Pluto still
a planet or not?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.780
And you know?

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.360
This app lets you, then, place
a digital model of the sun all

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.180
the way to the outer
planets, and then you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.520
see them, at scale, placed.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.020
And it really drives
home how close

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.780
Mercury, Venus,
Mars, and Earth are

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.030
to the sun compared to Neptune
and Saturn and Jupiter.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.250
And also, the vast
quantities of space

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.640
between Jupiter and Saturn.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.590
Seeing that, sort
of kinestheticall

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.900
exploring that by
walking around,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.110
has a whole different
impact as opposed

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.880
to just reading
numbers on a page

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.600
or maybe looking at a picture.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.590
And so that's the
sort of application

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.020
where-- there's
this use case where

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.160
I want to see the path
of X, Y, or Z spacecraft.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.280
Hey, maybe I want to be able
to plot my own spacecraft

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.270
and see-- what would it take
to actually get a spacecraft

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.730
to then orbit Jupiter?

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.980
And so suddenly, as opposed
to writing code on a computer,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.080
or drawing out
things, suddenly I

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.450
can start navigating through
space with this device.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.300
And this becomes a window
into a whole nother world.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.290
And it unlocks all
of this potential.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.960
And this is one app, right?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
you've got dozens already.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.910
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah,
we've already got dozens,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.010
and we expect to have
hundreds very soon.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.710
And so for us, this
is where we can't

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.040
wait to see what the developer
community comes up with.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.380
Because a diversity
of authorship,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.610
when it comes to
apps, is so important.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.640
We can't just have apps made
by folks here in San Francisco,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.040
or here in Mountain View.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.184
We need apps made worldwide.

00:05:27.184 --> 00:05:29.850
And that, for me, is part of the
exciting thing about the Lenovo

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.100
device being sold worldwide.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.500
Because we've got developers
in Shenzhen, Beijing, Seoul,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.610
Berlin, Cairo-- all over
the planet-- developing

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.174
apps for it.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.840
And I can't wait to
see what they built.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm going
to have to ask Santa for one.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.951
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yes.

00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:46.580
That's a good idea.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: So now, for
developers all over the world,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.540
now that the device
is available,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.780
what advice would you give them?

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.100
What's the best
way to get started?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.330
How can they get up and running?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.246
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Well, so
we've got a great site

00:05:56.246 --> 00:06:00.380
at developers.google.com/tango,
which I hope will be

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.210
in the comments
below on this video.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.910
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right down there.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.493
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah,
right down there.

00:06:04.493 --> 00:06:08.020
And we've got all sorts
of example applications.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.000
So whether you're a Unity
developer, or Unreal,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.830
or you actually are an
Android developer using Java,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.790
or you just want to use
the Tango APIs and see,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.890
we've got sample code
as well as documentation

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.210
for each of those paths.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.880
And then we've also
got, on GitHub,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.370
a whole bunch of example
apps that you can then

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.434
fork, tweak, play with.

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:29.850
Whenever I talk to developers,
the first thing I recommend

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.960
is-- all right.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.100
Take one of those apps.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.470
Just get it running on a device.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.510
And then pick a model, pick any
model-- perhaps a Jenga piece,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:45.140
or a model of Mars-- and then
place that digital object

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.930
in the real world.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.470
Once you've got
that up and running,

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.670
you're off to the races.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.915
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And
then you can explore

00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:55.620
all of the advanced
capabilities that Tango provides

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.110
on top of the Android stack.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.263
JUSTIN QUIMBY: So-- and that's
the other thing to think about,

00:07:00.263 --> 00:07:04.540
is that Tango is a
capability for this device.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.410
It's not just about
motion-tracking and

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.900
area-learning and depth-sensing.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.970
We're building on top of all the
other capabilities that Android

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.580
devices have today-- so
notifications, payment systems,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.664
ads, like all this stuff--

00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:20.079
LAURENCE MORONEY:
All these things

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.570
have become possible, yeah.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.670
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Those
are all layered.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.836
You can layer into your app.

00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:26.150
So really, it's start small.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.340
Get something, start
playing with it,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.020
and then start thinking about
the challenges that you face.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.990
Think about the challenges
your users face.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.590
And how could this
technology, knowing

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.490
where this device is at
any given point in time,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.430
and how it moves
through space, how

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.590
could you use that to help
solve your user's problems?

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.860
And delight and
surprise your users?

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.150
One of our favorite apps
is the Dominoes app,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.870
where you place digital
dominoes down on a board.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.070
And part of the thing
that's fantastic about that

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.170
is suddenly it's not just about
these digital objects that

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.850
are dominoes, but you can
add additional behavior

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.100
on top of them.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.420
And now imagine you're
playing a Jenga game,

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.870
but one of the pieces
is actually a bomb.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.574
And when you try to
move it, it actually

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:11.740
blows up part of that stack.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
what happened to me.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.950
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yes,
that was completely

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.741
what happened to you
in that game of Jenga.

00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.740
So suddenly, all
of the behaviors,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.460
all of these
digital objects, can

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.950
have lives of their own, can
have behaviors of their own,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.960
that make these
apps even better.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: And the
neat thing about Dominoes

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.500
is that if you do it
in the real world,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.250
you're constrained to the
physical number of dominoes

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.750
you have.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.372
If you're doing it in this, you
can continually add dominoes.

00:08:32.372 --> 00:08:33.330
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Exactly.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Or
you can change gravity,

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.659
so that sometimes
they fall that way,

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.840
sometimes they fall upwards.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.020
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.789
And there's another great
game which is a Hot Wheels

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:39.620
track-builder game.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.470
So you're placing digital track
and racing digital Hot Wheels

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.600
cars around it.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.710
And I don't know about
you, but one of the--

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.240
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Never enough track.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.990
JUSTIN QUIMBY: There's
never enough track.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.020
And also, you've never
managed to pick up

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.950
all of your Hot Wheels cars.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.410
And so at some
point later, you're

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.170
walking around your
house in your bare feet,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.030
and you step on one.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.440
And ooh, does that hurt.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.900
So now, suddenly,
you're no longer

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.270
constrained by the
physical products you have.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.590
Now you can start building
with these digital objects,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.125
and building crazy digital
worlds that interact

00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:08.250
with your real environment.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Super cool.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.280
So before we wrap up,
there was one question

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.640
that we had from a viewer
of the previous show.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.264
And that was that when you were
talking about all these things,

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.750
he was envisioning
the holographic chess

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.553
from "Star Wars."

00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:19.916
Remember that?

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:20.280
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yes.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.792
Yes.

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:23.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: So are you
working on anything like that?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.620
Or what do you think about it?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.995
JUSTIN QUIMBY: So
digital objects

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:29.600
like holographic chess--
it's a fantastic idea.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.310
And we'd love to
see you build it.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.680
We've actually had a
couple of folks come to us

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.990
and say, hey, we want to
build this kind of app.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.402
And we're like, well,
here's the sample code.

00:09:40.402 --> 00:09:41.610
And they're off to the races.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, but just
don't play it against a Wookiee

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.690
because I hear they
pull your arms out

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.960
of the sockets when they lose.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.100
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.170
Yeah.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.930
It's always wise to
let the Wookiee win.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:48.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:48.980
Sounds good.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.650
Well, thanks, Justin.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.030
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Hey, it's
great to see you again.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: It
was great catching up.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.850
Looking forward to playing
with these devices.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.440
Looking forward to seeing
how these apps work.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.231
And I'm going to start
walking from the sun

00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.400
to Pluto in augmented
reality, and I should

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.590
get there by next Tuesday.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.960
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.590
Perfect.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.310
Thanks so much.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.
