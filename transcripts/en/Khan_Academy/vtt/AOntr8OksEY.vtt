00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.950
- [Instructor] A group of
students prepare a large batch

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.880
of conductive dough,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.820
a soft substance that
can conduct electricity,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.970
and then mold the dough
into several cylinders

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.870
with various cross-sectional areas A

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.740
and lengths l.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.930
Each student applies a
potential difference, delta V,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.460
across the ends of a dough cylinder

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.950
and determines the
resistance of the cylinder.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.230
The results of their experiments are shown

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.090
in the table below.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.923
So what they're doing,

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:31.920
they're taking this material,
this conductive dough,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.080
and they're making cylinders

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.610
of different cross-sectional
areas and different lengths.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.010
So they're varying the area,
the cross-sectional area,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.430
and the length, but it's all being made

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.910
out of this same material,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.640
and then depending on how they vary that,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.590
you get different resistances.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.960
The students want to
determine the resistivity

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.150
of the dough cylinders.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.919
So just as a reminder,

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:00.720
resistivity is different than resistance.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.670
A particular shape of a given material

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.690
will have a length and
cross-sectional area,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.060
all of that, will have a given resistance.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.150
But a resistivity is a
property of the material.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.330
And the relationship between resistance

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.980
and resistivity, you could write it as

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.070
resistance is equal to resistivity,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.730
which is usually represented
with the Greek letter rho,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.000
times the length of the
thing that you're measuring

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.860
the resistance of divided
by the cross-sectional area.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890
And so if you have a higher resistivity,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.520
all else equal, that would
make a higher resistance.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.710
But if you have a higher length,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.680
that also makes a higher resistance.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.310
But if you have a higher
cross-sectional area,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.720
than that lowers the resistance.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.950
And if you were to solve for rho,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.430
you could write rho is equal to resistance

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.603
times cross-sectional area over l.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.130
So it then says indicate
below which quantities

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.870
could be graphed to determine a value

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.370
for the resistivity of
the dough cylinders.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.580
You may use the remaining
columns in the table above,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.510
as needed, to record any
quantities, including units,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.400
that are not already in the table.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.600
So pause this video and think
about how you would do that.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.280
Well I can think of two ways to do that.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.870
You could make a plot,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.740
you could make a scatter plot
where on the horizontal axis,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.260
you put l over A,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.150
and on the vertical
axis, you put resistance.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.050
And then the resistivity
would be the slope of a line

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.610
that you try to fit to those points.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.090
So that's one way to do it.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.896
Another way to do it is you
could make your horizontal axis

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:46.280
your A over l

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.280
and then you could make
your vertical axis your rho,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.350
and then you could try
to fit a horizontal line

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.510
to those points.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.970
Because your resistivity
should not be dependent

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.360
on A divided by l.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.580
I'm actually going to
pick this second option

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.040
because if I'm doing
this primarily by hand,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.170
it's at least to me easier
to fit a horizontal line

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.130
than to fit a non-horizontal line,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.760
as I would have to do there.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.910
So let's do that.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.500
So my vertical axis,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.960
I'm gonna do resistivity, resistivity,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.563
so that's resistivity.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.160
And it's going to be in ohm meters.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.270
And then in my horizontal axis,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.840
I am going to do my
area divided by length,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.110
and that's going to be in meters.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.830
And now to be able to do this,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.230
I need to calculate these things.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.490
So I wanna calculate my
area divided by length,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.590
and I also wanna calculate
my resistivity, rho.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.807
And so area divided by length,

00:03:51.807 --> 00:03:52.640
.00049

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.550
divided by .03

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.140
is equal to

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.433
0.016.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.810
So we have 0.016,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.040
two significant digits here,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.410
two significant digits in the things

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.570
that I'm dividing with.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.660
And then I can calculate rho

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.660
by multiplying my area divided
by length times resistance.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.280
Times my resistance that I measured,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.880
23.6, it's important to
realize that when you do things

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.720
experimentally things
aren't going to be perfect.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.400
There's a lot of noise in the real world.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.940
So I'll round that to,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.280
I'll round that to since I have
two significant digits here,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.700
two significant digits here, so 0.39.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.313
So this is 0.39.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.160
And then I'll keep doing that calculation,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.390
and for the sake of time,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.963
I will just speed up the video now.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.750
All right and now we can
move to this second part now.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.250
It says on the grid below,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.720
plot the appropriate
quantities to determine

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.350
the resistivity of the dough cylinders.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.750
Clearly scale and label all axes,

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.010
including units as appropriate.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.240
So as we mentioned,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.160
on our horizontal axis right over here,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.890
we want to put our

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.540
cross-sectional area divided by the length

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.020
of our resistors, and
so that's going to be,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.640
we have meters squared divided by meters,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.090
so that's going to be in meters.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.410
And then in our vertical axis,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.090
we want to plot our resistivity,

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.720
our resistivity rho,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.410
and that's going to be in ohm meters.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.340
And now we need to think about the scales.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.240
And so the scale of this vertical axis,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.680
if we go back over here,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.580
we see that all of our
calculations for rho,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.260
well it's between around
.3, .4, like that,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.760
or you could say between .30 and I guess

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.400
we have up to .41.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.940
So we could have a reasonable scale here.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.760
We have one, two, three, four, five,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.080
so we could say this is .10,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.020
which is the same thing as 1/10.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.077
This is .20, this is .30,

00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:12.630
and this is .40,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.280
for our rho scale.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.190
And then for our area
divided by length, we have,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.720
so let's see if we view
all of this in terms

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.810
of .0010,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.400
we go between .0038

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.543
all the way to .0160.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.713
So let's make this .0050,

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.603
0.0050.

00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:44.003
This would be .0100,

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:44.836
0.0100.

00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:49.679
This would be .0150, 0.0150,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.700
and this would be .0200, 0.0200.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.833
And this would be .0250.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.610
All right I think I have my scales right,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.393
so now we just plot our points.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.280
So let's see the first one

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.600
has a resistivity of 0.39,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.120
and our A divided by l is,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.880
which is this is going to be in meters,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.700
this is going to be .0160

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.280
of a meter.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.280
So we would look up 160 right over here.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.350
So this is 150,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.840
and then we would wanna go 1/5 of the way

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.870
between this and this,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.630
and it's neatly divided
into five sections here.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.220
So this would be 160,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.500
and then I would want 0.39 ohm meters

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.960
for the resistivity.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.530
So that would put us right over there.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.090
So that's my first data point.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.937
And now if I go to my second one,

00:07:51.937 --> 00:07:54.753
.0098, 0.31.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.050
So .0098 will be right around here,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.930
and then at 0.31 would
be right around there.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.450
So that's my second data point.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.450
And then I get to .0066 and 0.41.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.540
So .0066 would get us,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.910
let's see this would be 60, .0066,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.250
and then we have 0.41.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.123
So that puts us right over there.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.280
Some place like that.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.757
And then last but not least,

00:08:34.757 --> 00:08:37.603
.0038 and 0.4.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.017
So then we have

00:08:41.017 --> 00:08:44.360
.0038 so this would be
40, this would be 30,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.260
so 38 is like here,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.970
and then we go to .40.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.680
So it is like that.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.440
So those are our four data points.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.810
And then they say,

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.680
use the above graph to estimate a value

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.160
for the resistivity of
the dough cylinders.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.993
Well as we said,

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.620
the resistivity should be constant.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.310
It shouldn't depend on our
area divided by our length.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.200
And so if we wanna fit a
horizontal line to this

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.470
that gets as close as possible,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.150
ideally we would have a computer,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.670
but we're gonna hand do it.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.760
We have three of these
points that are pretty close

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.140
to .40, but then we
have this one down here,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.190
so I'd wanna get a little bit
closer to these three up there

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.530
because there are so
many data points there.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.343
So I would say a line
that looks something,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.600
something like that.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.840
And so this point right over here,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.840
this is maybe approximately 0.37.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.830
So this is 0.37 ohm meters.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.470
I would say 0.37 ohm meters.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.303
And we're done.

00:09:53.303 --> 00:09:55.760
And frankly another way
to think about this is,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.160
you could've done it potentially
even without the graph

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.410
by saying well look,

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.250
a good estimate for my
resistivity of my conductive dough

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.680
is to just take the mean of these values.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.270
But they wanted us to use a graph,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.730
and so one technique would be all right,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.820
let's try to fit a horizontal line.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.740
The other technique with
the graph would've been

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.590
plotting l over A here and
then plotting resistance

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.000
on our vertical axis,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.940
and then our estimate of the
slope of the fitted line,

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.900
that would be our estimate of rho.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.250
But that would've been
frankly harder to do

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.803
than even what we did here.
