00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.200
So before we go further, I'll just
remind you again of Bayes Rule.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.720
We looked at this last time.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.730
The straight Bayes Rule is that
we can say that p of x, given z,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.400
the p of the state given the
measurement, can be written this way.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.040
This is the likelihood.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.780
All right?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.160
This is the total probability of z.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.020
This, that's our prior
before the measurement.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.340
That's our belief, if you will,
of, of, of what the value was.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.080
Okay?

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.670
So, what's important here to realize is,
once I get the measurement.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.790
Somebody gives you the measurement.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.631
You drove to, to to,
to Measurements-R-Us, and

00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.220
you picked up your measurement.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.000
You didn't know which measurement
they were going to give you, and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.760
there's a probability that they'll
give you all these different mea.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.550
Once they give you a measurement,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.110
the probability of having got
that measurement is done.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.470
It, it, it is whatever it was.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.250
It's not going to change.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.150
So what that allows us to do
is to sort of replace that,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.460
by this, normalization factor.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.550
Right?
It's some value.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.170
Or another way of saying this,
is that p of x, given z,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.489
is proportional to p of z, given x.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.950
All right, times the prior.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.140
So if I had a whole bunch of different
possible x's, and I only had this value,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.010
okay, for p of x, given z,
they have to sum to one.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.940
So what I could do is I could just
take the sum of all of those,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.390
whatever they were, and then divide
this value by that, divide by that sum,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.900
and I would be back to a real,
renormalized probability density.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.271
All right?
That's why we write it as this Eta and

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:35.920
we talk about this proportion.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.409
And, in fact,
next time when we do particle filtering,

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.495
you'll see that what we do is, we if we
sample all these x's, we multiply them

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:49.539
by their likelihoods and we get all
these values, but they don't sum to one.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.598
So what we have to do is take this,
take all the sum, sum them up,

00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:55.800
then divide each of those by that
sum and it'll sum up to one again.
