00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:03.530
MING: So I'm a
jolly good fellow,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.670
and I'm honored to introduce
Ajahn Brahm, my fellow jolly

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.730
good fellow.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm a huge fan of Ajahn Brahm.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.420
In the part of the
world I came from,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.260
which is Southeast Asia,
and also in Australia,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.610
Ajahn Brahm is a big deal.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.860
He's like a celebrity.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.025
He's like a movie star.

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:26.030
He has to wear shades
when he goes to the mall.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.810
He is a widely admired
master, teacher of dharma,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.890
and Buddhism, and meditation.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.180
And he's known for his
wisdom, his intelligence,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.070
and great humor, and for
telling great stories.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.190
He's also very naughty.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.972
Let me give you an
example of naughty.

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:44.680
AJAHN BRAHM: Hey.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.140
No.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.040
MING: Yes, you.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.110
The last time we
were together, I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.210
brought my father
to see Ajahn Brahm.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.895
And I wanted a book
autographed for my father.

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:56.020
AJAHN BRAHM: Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.930
MING: And then I was busy.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.346
So I give it to a
friend, and say,

00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:01.170
can you get Ajahn Brahm to
autograph for Ming's father.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540
And then he put it to you.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.320
And you wrote, "To
Ming's father."

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.000
So which is why
today, I had to say,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.410
can you autograph to
my wife, Cindy, Cindy.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.695
Otherwise, he was going
to write "To Ming's wife."

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:15.530
AJAHN BRAHM: "To my wife."

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.821
MING: Yeah. "To my wife," yeah.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.860
He's also, among
other things, known

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.190
for his leading
role in advocating

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.063
for the rights of Buddhist
nuns for full ordination.

00:01:28.063 --> 00:01:28.563
Yay.

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:29.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.804
MING: And for that, he got
expelled from his order.

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:35.512
AJAHN BRAHM: Yay.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:36.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:38.390
MING: I know.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.850
The last time we were
talking about this,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.830
we were in the audience
and onstage, somebody

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.560
was talking about this.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.550
And we high-fived each other.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.410
AJAHN BRAHM: Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.840
MING: Remember?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.820
We were like, let's
do a high-five again.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.319
High-five.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.250
Yeah.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.770
He said the best thing about
being expelled from his order

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.525
is he can only be expelled once.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.750
Ajahn Brahm is also the
co-founder of Bodhinyana,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.140
the first dedicated
Buddhist monastery

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.100
in the Southern hemisphere,
hemisphere, hemisphere.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.970
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.280
MING: Yes.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.600
He's the coolest monk in at
least the Southern hemisphere,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.409
hemisphere, hemisphere.

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:08.729
AJAHN BRAHM: Yes.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.750
It's very cold in Australia.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.250
MING: Yes.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.760
Which is today also
the largest community

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.010
of Buddhist monks in Australia.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.050
He is the author
of multiple books.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.310
And in 2004, he was awarded
the John Curtain Medal

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.700
for Leadership,
Vision, and Service

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.160
to the Australian community.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.870
AJAHN BRAHM: Yes.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.130
MING: And with that,
my friends, please give

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.520
a warm welcome to Ajahn Brahm.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.186
AJAHN BRAHM: Hi.

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:37.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.780
Very good.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.500
First of all, when
Shirley-- where is she?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.590
She asked me for a
title for the talk

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.400
or at least some way
of getting people

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.080
to come in the old
bums on the seats,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.060
I did mention to everybody
that I was over 750.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.875
That's my age.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.090
Now, there we go.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.090
That's because you meditate a
lot and you're very peaceful.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.130
It means you look
only in your 60s.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.540
Well, last year,
last year in Bhutan,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.310
I celebrated my 750th birthday.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.560
And I'm a monk.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.110
I have to be honest.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.520
I cannot tell a lie.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.070
It really was 750 months.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.060
[LAUGHS]

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.270
Now, if you're a monk,
saying you're old

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.030
makes you have more cred.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.540
People actually
respect you more.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.130
So if I just said I was 62 and
1/2 and 63, that's so ordinary.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.390
But 750, that's awesome.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.930
So I'm 750-- almost 762 now.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.430
Wow.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.150
But this is one
example of learning

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.680
how to make some fun
in life and learn

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.020
how to make some fun
in your workplace,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.080
learning how to do what Meg
is trying to teach everybody,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.230
to have a more happy,
more powerful mind,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.840
learning how to see
things in a different way.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.430
Obviously, in anywhere
in our modern world,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.800
we have to see things
looking out of the box.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.830
And one of the ways the
Buddhist monks can actually

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.140
see things which
other people can't see

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.260
is we literally live
outside of the box.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
We do things which are totally
different than anybody else.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.000
And because we live
outside of the box,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.220
we can actually innovate,
and especially in what we're

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.510
teaching here, mindfulness.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.265
Mindfulness is so last decade.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.775
So we've made more
advances since that time.

00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:47.866
I was telling Bill a few moments
ago at lunch, mindfulness, OK.

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:51.910
So there was this woman,
a very wealthy woman,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.600
who went to work one day.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.970
And there was many burglaries
in the neighborhood.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.420
So she told the guard on
the front of her mansion,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.530
be mindful.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.880
There are many burglars around.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.240
And when she came
home from work,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.500
she found that her house
had been ransacked.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.260
Burglars had stolen everything.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.210
And she told the
guard at her house,

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.090
I asked you to be mindful.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.080
Why weren't you mindful?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.770
And the guard said,
I was mindful, Madam.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.350
I saw the burglars going
in, and I was mindful,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.330
burglar going in, burglar
going in, burglar going in.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.470
I saw them taking
your jewelry out.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.270
I was mindful.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.840
I noted jewelry going
out, jewelry going.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.610
I saw them going in
again with their truck.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.390
I saw your safe going out.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.560
I noted safe going out.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.630
I was mindful all the time.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.926
Would that be very helpful?

00:05:49.926 --> 00:05:52.210
No.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.270
Mindfulness is not enough.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.120
So I seen at the lunch
desk, Days of Mindfulness.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.510
Mindfully putting
food into mouth.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.770
Food going in.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.370
More food going in.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.080
More food going in.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.130
Well, that's being mindful.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.670
But it's not
sometimes being wise.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.010
So if you want to stay ahead
of the curve with mindfulness,

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.090
we add something more,
which is kindness.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.650
And if you add kindness
to mindfulness,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.890
you get the latest--
[LAUGHS] stop laughing.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.600
Putting me off.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.515
The latest buzzword in
psychology, kindfulness.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.660
So don't just be mindful.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.030
Be kindful.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.095
Now, what that really
means is yes, you're aware.

00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:56.040
But you got some
responsibilities, some duties.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.490
Be kind to what's going on.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.469
Now, you live in the tech world.

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.010
I don't know if you
heard this story.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.100
It's a true story.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.560
This was in NASA a few
years ago in Houston.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.620
And they had just installed
a new mainframe computer,

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.660
big number cruncher.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.660
And it cost millions
and millions of dollars.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.160
And after installing
the big number cruncher

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.610
in the headquarters
of NASA in Houston,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.410
they tried to boot it up.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.015
They could not get it working.

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.860
And because this was costing
millions of dollars every hour,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.964
they got every high tech guy
in the whole-- and woman--

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:36.880
in the whole of the
United States and Canada--

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.290
even Europe-- flying
them in first class.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.950
They needed them immediately
to try and fix up the problem.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.590
No one could fix up the problem.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:53.420
There was one tech guy
who was a Buddhist.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.870
He was a Thai man.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:02.360
And he said, well, if no IT
guy can fix up the problem,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.730
and if all the best experts
have tried and failed,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.850
perhaps it might be
something supernatural.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.820
And I know the guy to
fix it, because there

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.440
was a Thai monk, a
meditation monk who

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.820
just happened to be visiting
the Thai temple in Houston.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.190
The nice thing about
monks is they're cheap.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.159
I don't get anything
out of this.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.861
And what do they have to lose?

00:08:35.861 --> 00:08:36.360
Nothing.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.530
So they invited this Thai
monk into the main computer

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.205
headquarters, the
terminal of NASA.

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:46.530
And what did he do?

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.820
A little bit of
meditation, kindfulness.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.840
You check it out if you've
got any friends in NASA.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.980
After the monk
had been in there,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.470
that computer worked perfectly.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.140
It started working again.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.810
And we know that is
true because he's

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.830
visited San Fran several times.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.430
And one time when he came
here, the person receiving him

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.220
decided to look at
his passport to make

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.750
sure his visa was in order.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.510
And this monk has
got a diplomatic visa

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.450
with no expiry date so
he can come into the US

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.660
from Thailand at a moment's
notice in case NASA needs him.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.890
Now this is the power
off kindfulness.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.480
And a similar story, which I
also love-- and this is true.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.880
This is one of my
disciples-- having meditated

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.580
with me in Australia for a
year, he went back to school

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.700
in Hamburg, Germany,
at the University.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:05.200
And the first day on campus,
as he was walking past an ATM

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.530
machine, the ATM made a sound.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.920
It was like a gurgle.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:21.550
And he interpreted that this ATM
was welcoming him onto campus.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.600
Don't just think about
artificial intelligence.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.010
It already has arrived.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.690
It made a gurgling sound.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.800
And he though it's
welcoming him onto campus.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.150
So from that day on, he'd
always say hello, guten Morgen,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.730
to his favorite ATM.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.210
He'd always use that
and be kind to it.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.190
And after three months of
kindfulness to this ATM,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:53.520
he happened to be having his
lunch on a bench within sight

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.880
of the ATM machine.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.890
No one had been close to
it for at least 15 minutes

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:08.520
when it made the familiar
gurgle sound once again.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:16.420
And he looked at this machine,
and a 20 euro note came out.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.910
No one had been
close to the machine.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:24.150
No one had put any cards in
or typed in any PIN numbers.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.380
And a $20 note, or 20
euro note came out.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.290
He went over to the ATM,
picked up the euro note,

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.040
waved it around.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.520
Does this belong to anybody?

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.300
No one claimed it.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.580
So he took it away.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.760
This is what happens with
the power of kindfulness.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.670
If you're short of cash,
you don't need a card.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.030
You don't even need an account.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.350
Just go up to the ATM
machine, stroke it, and say,

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.370
may you never run
out of electricity.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.620
May no one ever hit
you when they find

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.500
they've got no credit balance.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.000
May you always be
happy and well.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.700
And who knows?

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.167
You may get $20.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.800
That's an absolutely true story.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.240
Amazing, just the power of
the mind just over machines.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.470
So this is also true.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.690
Your computer, if it's not
working, if it crashes,

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.990
what should you do?

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.920
Please don't sear at it.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.960
Please don't get angry at it.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.380
Just take your
hand and stroke it.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.550
There, there, hard drive.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.890
[LAUGHS]

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.125
You may be laughing
at me, but you try it.

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.530
At the very least,
it'll soften you.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.920
You won't get so angry.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.985
So mindfulness and
kindness together,

00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:50.110
they're very, very helpful.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.230
And they're very powerful.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.300
And they make a lot of
difference in our life.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.090
So it's not just being
aware of what you're doing.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.200
It's being kind as well.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.640
And when you're
mindful and kind,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.530
you see so many angles of this
life where when you're kind,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.130
you can actually
use mindfulness,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.640
and it makes far better
life for yourself,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.040
better health, mental health,
and physical health as well.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.320
Now, I don't know if you've
got any back problems,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.260
tummy problems, or
whatever problems.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.090
We all get problems after
a while in our body.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.000
Yeah.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.180
Exercise is good, but, as I
was telling people earlier,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.980
sometimes people look at me and
Bill and they think we're fat.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.480
We're not fat.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.750
No way.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.180
I've been a monk for
over 40 years now.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.220
I'm being honest now.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.460
Not 750.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.210
40 actual years.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.250
And every year you are monk,
practicing kindfulness,

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.090
you get more and
more compassion.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.150
Every year, my heart
gets a little bit bigger

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.550
and bigger and bigger.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.310
Now, it's so big after
40 years as a monk,

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.190
it can't push out
my rib cage anymore.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.610
So it comes down here
and pushes this out.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.180
This is not a big tummy.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:13:59.894
It's a big heart.

00:13:59.894 --> 00:14:02.060
It has to go somewhere, and
this is where it's gone.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.510
So don't go criticizing
me for being fat.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.280
This is not fat.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.930
This is just a big heart.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.870
Isn't that the case, Phil?

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.756
Correct.

00:14:09.756 --> 00:14:11.184
Yeah, big heart.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.880
But-- I'm going to
choke to death now.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.952
But the happiness part
of it is also important.

00:14:23.952 --> 00:14:29.930
As I was telling over lunch,
as I was eating my ice cream,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.010
that when you're happy, when
you laugh a lot, when you've

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.860
got a very positive
attitude towards life,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.710
actually your blood
vessels do expand.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.710
That's the basic sort of
biology of the human body.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.880
If you get negative,
angry, upset,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.680
your actual blood
vessels contract.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.220
That's been
established many times.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.170
So if you are a
little bit overweight,

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.950
and you're miserable, you get
what we call double whammy.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.790
You've got lots of guck going
through your blood vessels,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.930
and your blood
vessels are small.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.550
They're going to clog up,
and you're going to die.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.140
But if you're happy
and if you laugh a lot,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.120
like me and like Bill-- our
blood vessels are so big and so

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.210
wide, we can eat anything.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.530
Anything can pass through.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.650
Nothing ever gets clogged.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.970
No heart attacks, no strokes
because our blood vessels

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.310
are very wide.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.000
And that really
explains something

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.140
I always was concerned
about, interested in,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.990
when I was a young man.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.340
A bit of a science.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.891
Why is it that all the
fat people are happy?

00:15:31.891 --> 00:15:33.150
They are.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.160
Look at Santa Claus.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.010
Santa Claus is really fat.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.090
He's very happy.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.230
Ho, ho, ho.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.190
And look how old he is.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.660
He was an old man
when I was born.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.160
So it's the fat, happy people
that are the only ones left.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.800
The fat, miserable people,
they died a long time ago.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.914
Evolution.

00:15:54.914 --> 00:15:55.830
That's true, isn't it?

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.605
All fat people are
happy, because all

00:15:58.605 --> 00:16:00.600
the fat miserable ones died.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.520
So if you are
overweight, don't worry.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.117
Laugh more, and you compensate
for your extra weight.

00:16:05.117 --> 00:16:06.200
And you can eat much more.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.560
So that happiness and that
laughter is really important.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.350
But sometimes, you know, we
live in an age where being happy

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.900
is almost part of
corporate culture.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.124
You get people telling
you to be happy.

00:16:23.124 --> 00:16:25.540
And if you're not happy, there's
something wrong with you.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.090
And we get these big
guilt trips about not

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.520
being a jolly good fellow.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.748
You may get the sack in Google
if you're not happy enough.

00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:40.140
Now, that sucks.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.140
And this is one of the
reasons why at a retreat

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.690
I was teaching in Australia many
years ago, this woman came up,

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.650
interview time,
and she said, I'm

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.300
fed up with trying to be happy.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.860
You're telling me to be happy.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.520
Everyone else is smiling, and
that really pisses me off.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.200
I'm grumpy.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.400
I don't feel like being happy.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.980
So I understood her problem.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.510
I said, just wait
here for a moment.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.140
And I got on the computer
and very quickly printed out

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.599
on letterhead, which
I signed by hand

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.599
underneath, a grumpy license.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.470
The grumpy license on
letterhead stated something

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.920
like, I hereby grant to
the lady's name, Veronica,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.440
permission to be
grumpy at any time

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.307
for any reason or no
reason in particular

00:17:29.307 --> 00:17:30.390
for the rest of your life.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.740
Signed, Ajahn Brahm,
because she is my disciple,

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.090
so she respected me.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.250
So I gave her
permission to be grumpy.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.920
And as soon as she got that
form, she felt so relieved.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.730
She didn't feel guilty
anymore about being grumpy.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.150
She started laughing, and
then the grumpiness had gone.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.120
Problem solved.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.440
Why is it we have to be happy?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.180
Why is it we even
have to be healthy?

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.446
Sometimes if you're
not healthy these days,

00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:01.070
it's almost like a
crime in California.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.650
So I want human
rights, human freedoms.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.520
This is the United States.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.670
Not just freedom for the
pursuit of happiness,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.910
freedom for the pursuit
of misery as well.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.079
If you want to be miserable,
I will support you.

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:24.870
So what that's actually
doing, that's doing

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.620
something much more
refined about when

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.770
you're aware and mindful.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.681
You're aware and
mindful of how you are.

00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:33.930
And you're at peace with
that, no matter how you feel.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.650
If you feel in a bad mood
today, you're in a bad mood.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.110
Trying to get out of that
bad mood makes it much worse.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.760
So you give people
permission to be grumpy,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.110
to be upset, to have a bad day.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.900
And even if you are someone
like me, who's always supposed

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.860
to be the happy guy in Google.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.260
I'm sure there are times you
must go into the men's room

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.250
and go, argh.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.860
I don't want to be happy today.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.420
Because that becomes
a persona, and we

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.300
get very stressed out trying
to be something we're not,

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.360
which is the whole idea of
mindfulness and kindness

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.260
to allow yourself to be
whoever you are at this moment.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.835
Unfortunately, wherever
I go in the world,

00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:20.150
and I go to many
cities, I find it very,

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:25.070
very rare to see a human being.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.720
There are very, very few
human beings in California.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.610
There are many human
goings, many human doings,

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.690
but very few human beings.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.515
Do you understand what I mean?

00:19:38.515 --> 00:19:41.880
You're always going
somewhere, doing something,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.970
instead of just being here.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.470
And learning how to be mindful
and kindfully enough just

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.970
to be, without all these people
telling you what you should be

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.590
and how you should be,
is an enormous freedom.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.850
Allowing yourself just to be who
you are, even if you're sick.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.140
Know what one of the
problems is when you're sick?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.880
All these people trying
to make you better.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.570
And you feel so guilty
when you're sick.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.422
Somebody comes and
sees you in hospital.

00:20:12.422 --> 00:20:13.130
What do they say?

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.060
How you feeling today?

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.312
And you feel really guilty.

00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:18.270
They come all that way,
and you disappoint them

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.290
by feeling terrible.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.970
That's why people lie
when they're in hospital.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.210
You're like, I'm feeling a bit
better today, when you're not.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.850
So putting pressure on people,
that is one of the problems.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.380
Someone was telling me
about an old friend I have.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.816
And just when I saw
him, he was a monk

00:20:39.816 --> 00:20:41.190
in Thailand many,
many years ago.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.180
He got two types of
typhoid all together.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.920
There's three
strains apparently.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.710
And he got two all
at the same time.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.830
He came really close to dying.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.830
And he was a Rhodes scholar,
a champion wrestler,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.600
very brilliant guy, and
became a monk with me.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.210
And he was sick for
years after that.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.960
Had Crohn's disease
and all sorts

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.920
of other terrible diseases.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.940
And he was in the attic
of a monastery in England

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.960
for years, never been able
even to get out of bed

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.910
and get to the door.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.370
He felt terrible.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.850
And one day, one
the other monks,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.210
he had what we call really
understanding, insight.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.390
He knew what the problem was.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.430
He went to that monk's
room and said to him,

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.580
I've come up here on
behalf of all the people

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.350
who support this
monastery and all

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.880
your friends and your family,
too-- on behalf of everybody,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.500
I come up here to give
you permission to die.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.950
Don't try so hard to get well.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.350
You can die if you want to.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.120
It's fine.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.100
At which point this Rhodes
scholar from Tennessee,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.240
he burst out crying.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.620
He wept.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.490
Because for months, he'd been
trying so hard to get better.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.975
And now he could just
be, and he could die.

00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:11.350
And from that moment on, his
health started improving.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.080
And that was about 35 years ago.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.020
And now he lives
in South Africa.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.950
And he comes over to California
about once every few years

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.480
to do retreats.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.895
That was brilliant
emotional intelligence.

00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:29.830
When you're sick, you're
trying so hard to get better,

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.930
it can kill you.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.430
And as soon as it
was OK to be sick,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.870
and there was no guilt,
no stress attached to it--

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:40.370
you're sick?

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.270
Oh, just be sick.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.430
And then he started
to get better.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.080
Do you understand
how the kindfulness

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.460
and the mindfulness, it
solves these huge problems

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.295
in our lives.

00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:52.770
When we're always trying
to be something we're not,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.550
that's when we
get into problems.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.150
And when you understand
these things,

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.891
you can actually see
things in a different way.

00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:01.640
And this seeing things
in a different way,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.040
seeing things out of the box
is where we get innovation

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.050
and when we get
sort of progress.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:13.210
I was also telling Bill
and Ming during the lunch

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:20.020
we had just how I was
giving a keynote address

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.160
at a mental health
conference in Singapore.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.720
And when I was
given the keynote,

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.510
I was telling some
of the principles

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.110
I've discovered
as a Buddhist monk

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.360
doing heaps and
heaps of meditation.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.770
And this guy came
out to me afterwards

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.710
and introduced himself.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.940
He was a professor
of schizophrenia

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.670
for the whole of Singapore.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:47.420
And I asked him, how do
you treat schizophrenia

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.270
in Singapore.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.640
And he told me, just as I'd been
teaching in my presentation,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.780
I don't treat
schizophrenia in Singapore.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.560
I treat the other
part of the patient,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.600
which is not schizophrenic.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.200
And I realized that's what
I'd just been talking about.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.970
This guy had got it.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:15.430
He'd understood about
how to solve problems.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:20.050
Sometimes you have a problem in
your office, in your company,

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.280
in your health, in your life.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.530
Why is it we always focus
on the problem rather than

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.850
the other part of life?

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.600
Because by focusing
on the schizophrenia,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.910
that person is identifying
with that disease.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.860
They're literally becoming that
disease, and it gets worse.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.070
By focusing on the other part
of that person, which was not

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.440
schizophrenic, that part of
the person is being recognized,

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.740
is being embraced
and celebrated.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.700
And that part of the person
is what's going to grow.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.920
And I did ask him,
what are your results.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.650
And he said, far better than
conventional treatments.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.000
It's the same whenever I
go into a prison, which

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.610
I go into a lot.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.400
Whenever I go to do
volunteer work in prison,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.760
I always keep a log
of how many hours

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.070
I spend in jail to be used as
credit just in case something

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.655
goes wrong.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.150
But when you go into prisons,
all those prisons I've been in,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.110
so I've never yet
seen a murderer.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.570
I've never seen a
thief or a rapist.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.425
I've never seen even a
criminal inside jails.

00:25:31.425 --> 00:25:33.140
I haven't been in
jails in the US,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.570
but in many other
countries of the world.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.180
All I've ever seen is a
person who's murdered,

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:45.130
a person who's stolen,
but never a thief.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.270
And just that change of
attitude, something so simple,

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.560
meant that I could see
something inside of them which

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.180
they had been blind to for
many months, many years,

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.404
depending on how long
they'd been inside.

00:26:00.404 --> 00:26:02.070
When I could see the
other part of them,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.437
they could see it themselves.

00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:05.270
And I could talk to
that other side of them,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.700
not the person who'd murdered,
but the other part of them,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.330
which was very kind
and very beautiful.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:16.440
When I saw that, they saw that,
and basically they recovered.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.880
I don't mind praising
myself from time to time.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.530
I am a humble monk.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.586
In fact, I'm the most
humble monk in the world.

00:26:24.586 --> 00:26:26.546
And I always tell people,
if you are humble,

00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:28.920
what's the point of being
humble if you can't tell people

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.420
about it.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.220
So I got this great praise
from this prison officer.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.700
He called me.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.000
He wanted to speak to me.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.780
He got through.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.120
And I said, how can I help you?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.620
He said, can you come back
to my prison to teach?

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.550
I said, I'm too busy these days.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.320
And he said, no.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.670
I want you to come and teach.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.750
And I said, why me?

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.570
And this prison
officer then gave me

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.950
a very beautiful compliment.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.220
He said, I've been a prison
officer all my career.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.980
I'm about to retire.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.080
I've noticed
something very unique.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.660
Every prisoner who came to your
class, once released from jail,

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.910
never came back again.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.090
And that was a marvelous
thing to achieve,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.630
because many people who
go to jail, they go in,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.750
and a few months later,
they go back again.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.720
Why was that?

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.690
Because I had
pointed out to them--

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.430
I'd seen in them the
other side of them,

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.409
which was not a criminal.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:25.700
They could see that themselves.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.210
And that was the
part which grew.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.480
The same with faults.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.270
With being mindful, you've
got a choice of being mindful

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.260
to the dark side or to the
light side of yourself,

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.180
of your partner, or
even your career.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.380
You've got that choice.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.310
With kindfulness, you're
mindful of the good part.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.780
Let's say you have
a relationship.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.550
Why is it you make a
mistake with your boyfriend,

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.930
girlfriend, and you
think about that,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.460
and she reminds you about
that days and days and days.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.010
Why do you always
focus on faults?

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.800
Because we think that
we learn from mistakes.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.660
No way.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.280
You learn from successes
much more than you'll ever

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.280
learn from mistakes.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.680
So you have a good
day out together.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.800
Reflect upon that.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.670
Look over that.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.950
Why was it a wonderful
day we had together?

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.140
Learn from successes.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.950
Because when you realize
the secret of success,

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.660
you can repeat it and have
a wonderful time together.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.990
It's much more fun
remembering what works

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.750
and what's successful.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.545
And it's the same
with whatever project

00:28:37.545 --> 00:28:40.380
you are doing in this company.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.420
Many of those
projects will fail.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.580
Forget about them.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.280
When something works,
think about it.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.350
Reflect upon it.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.210
Find out why it works.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.030
You learn from successes
much more than you ever

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.040
learn from mistakes.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.820
That's why all the
mistakes I've ever made,

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.230
I've totally
forgotten about them.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.717
That's why I'm happy.

00:29:07.717 --> 00:29:09.300
All the times you
did something right,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.770
that's what you remember.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.460
And you learn.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.500
You learn from successes,
not from mistakes.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.270
Simple things, which, as a
monk, you know are so powerful.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.870
And it's, again,
like kindfulness.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.580
So it's not only just
kindfulness at work

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.210
and kindfulness
with relationships,

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.620
it's also kindness with your
health and your energy levels.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.070
What gets you lots of energy?

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.370
What gets you lots of strength?

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:41.870
Yeah.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.890
It is mindfulness.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:49.230
But one thing which I noticed
is the more calm you are,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:53.080
the stronger your
mindfulness becomes.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.500
Mindfulness is not some
quality which is just there all

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.080
the time the same intensity.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:07.040
Because you can train yourself
to be super-mindful, really,

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.560
incredibly, powerfully
mindful, which literally means

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.650
that what you see, what
you feel, what you know,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.340
it's like you've turned
the lights up in your mind.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.300
It's not twilight anymore.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.790
It's the middle of the day, with
a full sun shining over things.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.010
Now this is just
a simple training

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.940
we do with some meditation.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.090
When you really get
still and peaceful,

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.440
your mindfulness
goes to other levels.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.840
After you've meditated,
you can go outside,

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.560
you can look at a leaf,
and there's so much

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.420
going on in that leaf.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.660
The colors stand out.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.370
They're like fluorescent.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.840
That's a sign, not that you've
taken some illegal substances,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.070
just that your
mindfulness is now strong.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:00.040
Your mind is getting some power.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.830
I like to tell this
story because somebody

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.810
asked made to repeat this
story, which I told yesterday.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:11.290
I was getting some really
good meditation one day.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.710
And after the
meditation was finished,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.460
I had to go to the toilet
like every other human being

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.200
to do what we call a number two.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.130
And as I went to the
toilet and did my business,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.560
I made a big mistake.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.210
My mistake was after
you got some really

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.950
powerful mindfulness
running, was

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:37.016
to look inside the toilet bowl.

00:31:37.016 --> 00:31:42.430
And what I saw floating in
that water blew my mind.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.800
I'd never, ever in
my whole life seen

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.580
such a beautiful piece of shit.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.689
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.188 --> 00:31:54.180
Now you may laugh, but the way
those balls and globules were

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.410
arranged together, it was
like they were put together

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.370
by a Michelangelo or a Rodin.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.760
Just the way, the shape
of them, and the way

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.450
that they interacted
with each other

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.410
was actually a matter of genius.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.140
And the colors.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.820
It wasn't just brown.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.260
It was hundreds of
different shades of brown.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.810
And the way they
were all distributed

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.190
over this beautiful
sort of shape

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.080
was actually incredible,
how they could do this.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.890
And because there is always a
little bit of mucus on shit,

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.100
it meant that it
sparkled like diamonds

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.860
in the bottom of the bowl.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.660
And now we go on
to the fragrance.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.510
The fragrance was rich.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:45.160
It filled your nostrils
and filled your whole mind

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.210
with an explosion of
these different scents.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.260
Not just one.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:49.830
It was full.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.870
It was amazing.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.760
And I was just so
taken by this turd

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.330
in the bottom of the toilet bowl
that I was there for about five

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.570
or ten minutes saying, wow.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.370
Look at that.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.440
That's incredible.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.750
That is amazing.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.370
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:16.795
And I really thought of taking
it out to show my friends.

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:20.490
But you know that I'm
a monk, and monks know

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:24.950
how to let go and renounce.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.020
It was a very, very-- one of the
toughest things I've ever done.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.090
Giving up sex, that's easy.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.750
Giving up drink, giving
up-- that was easy.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.260
Giving up the most beautiful
piece of shit in the world,

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.410
that was tough.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.105
But I did it.

00:33:39.105 --> 00:33:39.820
I did it.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.850
I pressed the button,
and looked the other way.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.011
Ah, that was so hard.

00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:47.295
But I tell that story
because it's fun.

00:33:47.295 --> 00:33:48.890
But it's also true.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.190
It actually shows you just how
powerful mindfulness can be.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.890
When you're very still,
it gets powerful.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.230
And then you can see things
which other people can't see.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:04.200
You can taste flavors,
which are so rich,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.540
and fragrances which
have always been there,

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.870
but you've been too
dull to really pick up.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.224
And knowledge, which has
always been in front of you,

00:34:14.224 --> 00:34:18.514
but which you've been too dark,
too dull, too much in twilight

00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:20.989
to really see.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:27.810
So enhancing mindfulness with
stillness and giving it power

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.580
is an incredible ability.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.719
And any wisdom
which I get always

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:38.659
comes from that stillness,
empowering mindfulness

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.670
and getting your
mental faculties up

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.280
to a different level,
a higher level.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.199
And if you want to
achieve in life, of course

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.420
you realize you have a brain.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.800
But how well are you using it?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.679
Yeah, you're mindful
up to a point.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:00.120
But how much are
you being mindful?

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.610
There's an old
little simile, which

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.440
has worked its way from me
to Harvard Business School.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.320
How heavy is a cup of water?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.790
I haven't got a
cup of water now.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.030
Can I borrow.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.721
Oh I have.

00:35:13.721 --> 00:35:14.220
This'll do.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.060
How heavy is this cup of tea?

00:35:21.772 --> 00:35:25.220
The longer I hold it,
the heavier it feels.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.882
After one minute,
my arm is aching.

00:35:28.882 --> 00:35:31.970
After a minute and
a half, I'm in pain.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:37.040
After two minutes, I'm in
agony and a very stupid monk.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.630
What should I do when it starts
to get too heavy to hold?

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.150
Put it down and rest.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.720
If you don't believe me,
you can try this at home.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.840
Just rest for 30 seconds.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.900
And after 30 seconds, you
pick up the cup of water,

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.430
and it feels lighter.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.580
I've taught this
at the-- I think

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.020
it was the International
Computer Conference of Brisbane

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.520
about two or three years ago.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.830
You get to do some great
gigs as a Buddhist monk.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.410
You manage to get to places
where even men can't go.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.470
I saw your wall.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.310
You haven't got a picture
of Queen Elizabeth.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.750
Yeah, I have.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.830
(Teasing) Da da da da da.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.790
Because a couple of years
ago, Queen Elizabeth

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.410
was visiting Australia.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.830
And as a leader of the
Buddhist community,

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.280
I got an invitation
for a state dinner

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.510
with the prime
minister of Australia

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.034
and Queen Elizabeth
and Prince Philip.

00:36:42.034 --> 00:36:43.711
Wow.

00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:44.710
But there was a problem.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.570
There was a problem,
big problem.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.830
Because when I got
the invitation,

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:53.390
they had something
called dress code.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.756
And the first item on the
dress code was black tie.

00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:57.567
Now I'm a monk.

00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:58.650
I don't know these things.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.940
I thought, is that all you
wear for a state dinner.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.626
Black-- it didn't
say anything else.

00:37:05.626 --> 00:37:06.440
And they said, no.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.410
Actually you need
trousers as well,

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.320
and a shirt, and a
jacket, and shoes.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.390
So anyway, we don't have
a tie in a monastery.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.830
So what was the second option?

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.030
The second option was
worse, military uniform.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.590
Imagine a monk, a pacifist,
going in a military--

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.940
I can't do that.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.170
I looked at the third option.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.800
And when I looked at
it, my eyes widened.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.790
Yeah, I can do that.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.875
The third option was long dress.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.490
So I went in long dress.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.860
Soon as I got in there,
security stopped me.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.995
But I flashed my
invitation card,

00:37:41.995 --> 00:37:45.040
so I got in, which
was really good.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.750
So you get to do interesting
things as a monk.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:52.060
And so at the National Computer
Conference, I taught this.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.200
Actually, International.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.680
They had the Computer Society's
conferences in Brisbane

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.870
that year.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.790
And when I actually did
this, they were so impressed.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.950
This is what stress is.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.630
Stress has got
nothing to do with how

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.940
much work, responsibility,
duties you have in life.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.610
It doesn't matter
how heavy the cup is.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.980
It's when it gets
heavy, do you know

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.000
how to put it down and rest?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.800
You don't have to rest for very
long, 30 seconds, a minute.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.390
If you're stressed in life,
maybe 15 minutes, half an hour

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.280
at most.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.440
If you can just put the
job down for a few minutes,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.930
and you're rested.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.350
When you go back to work, when
you go back to the computer

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.890
screen, you have ideas.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:38.900
Now you can write.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.520
You can do the code,
whatever you're up to.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.070
Ideas come to you because
your brain has rested.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:50.640
And half an hour, or a quarter
of an hour of just rest, you

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.450
make that up afterwards
with greater productivity,

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.649
less stress.

00:38:58.649 --> 00:39:00.440
That is a problem with
stress in our lives.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.090
That's why Harvard Business
School took it on board.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.266
And they call that an
investment in the afternoon.

00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:10.100
Half an hour of doing nothing
means in the afternoon,

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.680
you get four hours'
work done in three.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.340
And when you go home, you're
not so angry and tired.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.760
Simple things which
a monk can see.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.900
So this to how we learn
how to-- when you're tired,

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.490
you know your brain is not
working very well, then let

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:28.634
go, have a rest, and go
back to it afterwards.

00:39:28.634 --> 00:39:30.050
If you don't know
how to meditate,

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.190
what I have been
asking people to do

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.540
and suggesting in
Google-- remember

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.340
when you were at school,
had a playground, swings,

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.505
'round abouts?

00:39:39.505 --> 00:39:41.099
Do you have that
in Google campus?

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:42.390
Yeah, you do have a playground.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:45.800
Adult-sized.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.810
Yeah, you got that because
I saw this great photograph

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.110
in Montreal, Canada.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.360
When you're waiting
for a bus, instead

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.234
of actually sitting on
benches, they have the swings.

00:39:57.234 --> 00:39:58.650
So if people want
to wait, they've

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.700
got these swings like in
the playgrounds of recess

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.200
at school.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.870
So they swing
backwards and forwards,

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.460
have all these executives
and all these secretaries

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.970
on the swings,
waiting for the bus,

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.950
having a wonderful
time chilling out.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.810
What a wonderful thing to do.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.070
So have that time when you can
rest, because if you do rest

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.830
and you give yourself that
time, your efficiency grows up.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.140
You're more productive.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.780
Ideas come.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.820
But sometimes we
need, number one,

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.360
to see the importance of
relaxing, and then, number two,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.450
find out how to relax.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.480
And that's where we can learn
how to realize its importance

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.710
and let go of all
the past and future,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.900
because now is the
only time you have.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.629
And now is the place your
future is being made.

00:40:42.629 --> 00:40:45.170
Now is the only time you can't
do anything about your future,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.292
right now.

00:40:46.292 --> 00:40:50.760
So if you're mindful enough,
and let go, put down the cup--

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.390
I'm being a hypocrite because
I'm still holding the cup--

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.300
then you can have a
nice, peaceful time.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.200
Very good.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.700
So I've been talking
for 40 minutes,

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.550
and that's the amount
of time I was given.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.980
So now we have questions,
answers, comments,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.850
and complaints.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:05.950
MING: Yes.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.636
By the way, round of applause.

00:41:09.636 --> 00:41:13.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.780
Ajahn Brahm's official
title is Mahathera.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.190
Thera means elder.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.220
Maha means big, because
he has a big heart.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.620
Questions?

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.830
Yes, Bill?

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:32.170
AUDIENCE: So recently, Google
released its diversity numbers

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.320
about who works here.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:33.750
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.330
AUDIENCE: And they're different
than what we want them to be.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:36.690
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.606
AUDIENCE: And they're
different than the story

00:41:38.606 --> 00:41:40.830
we tell ourselves about
who we want to be.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:45.040
With your experience in fighting
for ordination for women,

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.410
what advice do you have
for us on two levels,

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.850
as individuals in our
practice about what

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.550
we can do in our practice
and our non-practice life,

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.480
and then also as part
of an organization?

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.230
What have you found
that's been successful

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:00.380
for you as you've done this
very easy task that you've

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.460
been doing.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:01.870
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:02.810
AUDIENCE: You're done, right?

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:03.000
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.430
Done it.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.660
Yeah.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.159
But look.

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:07.140
This is the case in many
religions in our world.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.300
There is no equity.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.510
You see the priests.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.630
You see the imams.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.680
You see the gurus,
and they're all male.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.060
Does that mean that
females are suddenly

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.125
spiritually inadequate?

00:42:19.125 --> 00:42:21.680
That you can't have them as
our teachers and leaders?

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.450
We have the Dalai Lama,
a male, the pope, a male,

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.390
the ayatollah's male.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.560
They're all male.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.620
Where are the females?

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.120
And one other thing
about Buddhism.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.120
In the earliest time,
when the Buddha was alive,

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.120
there was equity.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.240
We did have bhikkunis.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.350
They're the female monks.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.690
And we have the male monks.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:43.800
We had equality there
from 2,500 years ago.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.514
We lost it somehow.

00:42:45.514 --> 00:42:47.180
And so now we sort
of start it up again.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.620
So to start it up
again, you have

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.360
to go against the hierarchy,
against the bosses.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.080
If anyone has the
opportunity to hire,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.950
you just hire, no
matter what they say.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.560
That's what I had to do,
to stand up and say, look.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.720
I don't care what my bosses say.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720
This needs to be done.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.550
I'm going to do it.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:10.340
So you just go ahead and do
it for the state of equity.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.010
There are always ways of
having affirmative action.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:17.000
But for goodness' sake,
stop all the bullshit

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.810
of talking about it.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:19.790
You have to do it.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.830
Too many talking about it,
too many conferences, too

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.780
many papers written about
the necessity of this.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.720
But somehow you've got to do it.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.790
And one of the stories
which inspired me.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.840
In my home country
of Australia, there

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.810
was an equity for the gay
community, gay, lesbian,

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.380
transgenders.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.620
And one of the last
outposts of stupidity

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:46.330
was the state of Tasmania,
where until very recently,

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:51.290
it was illegal, against the
law, with a custodial penalty,

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:55.470
for gay people to
have consensual sex.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:59.290
And the gay community
in Tasmania, for years,

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:03.350
they were trying to get the
government to overturn this.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.350
And the government
said, don't worry.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.160
We'll not prosecute anybody.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.750
But that was just
so patronizing,

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:13.156
to say there's no
problem when there is.

00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:16.042
The men can't see the problem.

00:44:16.042 --> 00:44:17.690
The females can.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.680
It is a problem.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.850
So don't be patronizing and
think there's not a problem.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.460
So what these people did--
they were really smart.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:29.420
Those 50 gay couples
decided one night

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.530
they would have as
much sex as possible.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:37.440
And they wrote it all down in
detail, what they had done.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.670
And afterwards, the
following morning,

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.730
they handed themselves
in to the cops.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.180
They said, we confess.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.210
We committed a crime.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.300
We did this sex.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.610
And we signed it.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.850
This is what we did.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:54.050
And 50 couples, with all the
media in tow-- and the police

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.390
had no choice.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.770
They had to arrest these people.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.200
And these were good people
who committed a crime.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.040
And they confessed-- we did
it-- and were put in jail.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.960
And of course, only two
or three days later,

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.400
the state parliament
overturned that law

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.050
because they were
so embarrassed.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:21.370
So embarrassment is a
way to get things done.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.130
That's why I was
excommunicated, because I

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:29.410
embarrassed my bosses so badly,
they wanted to get rid of me.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.025
So please, embarrass
your bosses.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:37.890
One way of doing that, just
what comes to my head-- OK.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.290
Those people who support
gender equity in Google--

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:45.631
how many support gender
equity in Google?

00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:46.130
OK.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:51.500
All of you males, maybe next
Monday, please come to work

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.930
dressed as a woman.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.340
Say, well, there's not
enough women in Google.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.600
So we're going to
pretend we're girls.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.910
And if enough people actually
do that-- how many people

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.295
work on this campus?

00:46:07.295 --> 00:46:08.720
AUDIENCE: Too many.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.670
AJAHN BRAHM: Too many.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.480
OK.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.510
Well, if I a couple
hundred of you

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.450
come dressed as
women next Monday,

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:18.880
that is going to make
a statement, which

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.909
no one can really ignore.

00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:22.950
And when you make a
statement, which no one can--

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.030
so how many of you
are going to volunteer

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.650
to come as women on Monday?

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:30.750
You all put your hand
up you supported it.

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.529
So do it.

00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:35.320
I don't mean the girls
to put your hand up.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:35.819
Yes.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.650
So do something like that.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.850
And you'll get some great
cred with the other girls

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:45.242
in the office.

00:46:45.242 --> 00:46:48.170
And it's making a statement.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.950
Because sometimes there's too
much talk, not enough action.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.300
That doesn't get you anywhere.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.206
So that's my suggestion for you.

00:46:54.206 --> 00:46:56.080
Next Monday, or you can
make it another week,

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.380
come dressed as a woman.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.390
Get as many people on board.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:00.020
100, 200.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.570
You won't be so embarrassed.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:02.660
And you make a statement.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.118
There's not enough
women in Google.

00:47:04.118 --> 00:47:06.501
So we're going to
pretend to be women.

00:47:06.501 --> 00:47:07.000
OK.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.890
Does that make any-- yeah.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:10.769
Go on.

00:47:10.769 --> 00:47:12.560
AUDIENCE: When did you
decide to be a monk,

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.679
and why did you
decide to be a monk?

00:47:14.679 --> 00:47:16.970
AJAHN BRAHM: It's because I
used to be a school teacher

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.470
in high school for one year.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.340
And that would make anyone
think of leaving the world.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.215
Have you ever had-- teaching
high school kids all day?

00:47:28.215 --> 00:47:29.120
So, anyway, no.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.330
The main reason was I always
wanted a job in my life

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:33.930
which would give
happiness to others

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.626
and which would give
happiness to myself.

00:47:36.626 --> 00:47:38.000
And by being a
spiritual teacher,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.730
you get huge
amounts of happiness

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:43.080
through meditation,
leading a very simple life.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.970
You never have to worry about
money and possessions and stuff

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.280
like that.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.070
And you have such
an easy, free life.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:50.820
So you get so much
happiness for yourself.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.170
And now in my life,
I have opportunities

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.990
to go and teach others and
really help them big-time.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.670
And amazing, the
power you can get as a

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:02.970
monk actually to help
people in the social level.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.100
The last couple of talks
I gave, sometime ago,

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.160
always on YouTube.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.900
Many of you have
seen me on YouTube.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:14.430
We have questions coming
about the talk from Syria.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:19.170
So these teachings, these
talks can go all over the world

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.810
and go to a place like
Syria, which is probably

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.650
the country with the most
suffering at this moment,

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:25.910
the most problems and trouble.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:28.070
And you give one
talk, it's streamed,

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:29.690
and people actually
know about it.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:30.530
They can log in.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:31.840
And they can listen
to the talk, and they

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.173
can ask questions in all these
other parts of the world.

00:48:34.173 --> 00:48:35.860
That gives me a
lot of happiness.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.580
And you can find
ways-- psychologists,

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.650
they come and learn their
stuff from monks like me.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.850
This mindfulness stuff,
that came from Buddhism.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.360
There's so much
psychology, which

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.350
I've seen psychologists using.

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:51.750
And I know where they came from.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.620
Me.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.820
Because you see these
things, you spread it around,

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.970
and it really helps big-time.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.680
Little things like
my story of opening

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.990
the door of your heart,
where my father taught me

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.540
what the meaning of
unconditional love was.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.540
He took me aside when
I was only about 13.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.080
And he said to me,
son, wherever you

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.320
go in your life, whatever
you do, however you turn out,

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.030
the door of my house will
always be open to you.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.970
That's what he said.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.640
But his house was so
small and so poor,

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.730
he'd never locked the door.

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.969
He wasn't afraid of burglars.

00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:27.260
In fact, he was hoping a
burglar would come in one day,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.280
take pity on us, and
leave us something.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.450
But that's actually pretty true.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:38.065
But I realized later on in my
life, he didn't mean his house.

00:49:38.065 --> 00:49:40.700
He meant his heart.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.800
He man, you're my son.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.600
Whatever you turn out
like, wherever you go,

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.200
whatever you do, you're my
son, and the door of my heart

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.080
I will never close against you.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.460
The door of my heart's
always open to you.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.640
That meant so much to me.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.180
And I've taught that to
so many other people.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.970
And the next step is to
say to yourself, no matter

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:09.790
who you are, one day in some
quiet moment of your life,

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.860
whoever I am,
whatever I have done,

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:19.010
even the abuse I've given out
or received in my life so far,

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:22.660
the door of my heart is
open to all of that as well.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.760
Come in.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.520
It's an incredible,
powerful moment,

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.970
because in the
extreme cases I've

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:33.600
been teaching in an organization
called Assets in Australia,

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.330
Australian Society of Survivors
of Torture and Trauma,

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.450
people who have been in
these really dark places

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:43.790
in the world-- tortured,
multiple rape-- survive

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.700
and come to places like
Australia's refugees--

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.610
physically, they're free.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:52.560
Emotionally, they're still in
those dark dungeons underground

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.500
being tortured.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:59.400
How on earth can you give
them the emotional freedom?

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.200
And the people
there say, the story

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.500
which works the best is
what I've just taught you.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.940
There comes a time
when these survivors

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.970
imagine their little heart
and two doors opening.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.860
Just like in the
old aircraft, little

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.930
steps coming down to the ground.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.030
And on the ground
outside of their heart

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:27.310
is those little girls who
were raped, who were tortured.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:32.830
Parts of themselves, it's very
hard to embrace and bring in.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.460
Kept outside for years.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.320
And inviting those little
beings up the staircase

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.060
into your heart, not to only get
rid of them but embracing them.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.756
They're part of you.

00:51:47.756 --> 00:51:49.756
And these people imagine
that, these people that

00:51:49.756 --> 00:51:53.480
have been tortured,
beaten, half killed,

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.190
walking timidly up the steps.

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.725
And the other part of you, the
part of you which you like,

00:51:58.725 --> 00:52:02.980
which you're proud of,
embracing these people,

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:07.360
bringing them in,
and being one again.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.470
That is powerful.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.310
That comes from me.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.300
And that works.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.840
So when I can do
stuff like that,

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.770
that gives me
enormous happiness.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.390
That is why I'm a monk.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Ajahn, for your talk.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.100
I heard you speaking very
clearly about kindness.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.810
And last night
with Eugene Cash, I

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.510
asked the question of
caring for or transforming

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.750
habitual reactions.

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.990
And he expressed regret that I
had missed your talk on Sunday

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.780
there last week.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.570
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah.

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:39.070
AUDIENCE: And I hoped if there
was some seed more of that you

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:40.560
care to share with us.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.470
AJAHN BRAHM: OK.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:45.860
When you care for
something, it gets less.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.150
There's a classic story
in Buddhism, which I also

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:54.020
use in psychology, which is
the story of the monster who

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.840
came into the emperor's palace.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.060
So a long time ago, there
was a monster, a demon.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.640
It was so ugly and
so frightening.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.020
And he came into
an emperor's palace

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.830
when she was away
on some business.

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:15.890
And this monster was so ugly and
frightening that all the guards

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.580
and soldiers and security
which was supposed

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.950
to guard the place, they hid.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:23.210
They went under the
tables, through the doors.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.880
They hid because they were
terrified of this monster.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.000
And that allowed the monster to
go right into the central hall

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.350
and sit on the empress's throne.

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:36.830
And that was going too far.

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.740
So the soldiers, the
ministers, even the cooks,

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.440
everybody who worked in
the palace, they said,

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.500
get out of here.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.370
You don't belong.

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.840
Who do you think you are?

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.920
And at those few unkind
words, unkind deeds,

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:56.020
and unkind thoughts, the monster
grew an inch bigger, more ugly,

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.250
more smelly, more offensive.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.260
That made them mad.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.480
They threatened.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.490
They cursed.

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.700
But every unkind word,
deed, or thought,

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:09.290
the monster just grew an inch
bigger, more ugly, more smelly,

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:10.690
more offensive.

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:15.390
By the time the empress came
back, this monster was huge.

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:21.070
It was so frightening, it makes
Alien look like pussycats.

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:26.780
And was so smelly that
even the maggots crawling

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.090
on the monster's
skin, they barfed.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.120
They threw up.

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.730
Not even maggots could
stand the stench.

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:40.722
And the empress, she was in
that job because she was smart.

00:54:40.722 --> 00:54:42.370
Not like Google.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.960
They get empresses on
the basis of ability,

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.580
not the basis of gender.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:51.920
[LAUGHS]

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:56.120
And she knew what to do.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.450
She said, welcome, monster.

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:02.780
Thank you so much
for dropping in.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.820
Has anyone got you
a cup of tea yet?

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.470
We've got green tea.

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:09.760
We've got black tea.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.970
We've got peppermint tea.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.865
It's good for your health.

00:55:12.865 --> 00:55:16.540
And was really sincere
with her kindness.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:20.320
And they noticed every kind
word or thought or deed,

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.080
the monster grew an
inch smaller, less ugly,

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.805
less smelly, less offensive.

00:55:24.805 --> 00:55:27.660
So everyone realized
their mistake.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.670
They were now kind
to the monster.

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.250
Someone rang out for a
pizza, because now it

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:37.220
comes monster-size.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.940
Another five people
gave him a foot massage.

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.850
Have you ever had reflexology?

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:45.955
Really rare for a monster to
get his big feet massaged.

00:55:45.955 --> 00:55:47.547
And he was just
really enjoying it.

00:55:47.547 --> 00:55:48.630
He goes, over there a bit.

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:49.130
Oh, yeah.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:50.620
Ooh, that's nice.

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:53.067
At every kind word,
kind act, kind thought,

00:55:53.067 --> 00:55:55.400
the monster just shrank a
little bit smaller, less ugly,

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.466
less smelly, less offensive,
until the monster soon

00:55:58.466 --> 00:56:00.590
got to the size that he
first came into the palace.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.700
But they never stopped
with their kindness.

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.410
They carried on being
kind to the monster

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.960
until one more act of
kindness, and the monster

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.760
shrank completely away.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:16.810
And the Buddha said we call
those anger-eating monsters.

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.330
You give them anger, and
they get bigger, more

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:22.530
of a problem, more trouble.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:26.150
How many anger-eating
monsters can you see?

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.454
Even an addiction.

00:56:27.454 --> 00:56:28.620
I don't want this addiction.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:30.551
Get out of here.

00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:33.700
It can get worse.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.730
So that's what I
mean by kindness.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:42.140
Kindness makes many problems
get smaller, more tractable,

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.000
more possible to fix.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
But when you get angry
at them, get out of here.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.380
You don't belong.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.390
One of the greatest, most
common anger-eating monsters

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.830
which we have is cancer.

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:56.790
Tumor, get out of here.

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:59.350
You don't belong.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:03.510
I've been going to the cancer
support groups in Australia

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:05.866
for over 25 years now.

00:57:05.866 --> 00:57:07.360
And I keep going back there.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.690
They keep inviting me,
because what I say works.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:13.420
Any of you who follow
that stupid tradition

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.844
of fighting your cancer--
some people manage to win.

00:57:17.844 --> 00:57:19.260
But a lot of people
lose who could

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:26.090
have won if they were kind,
relaxed, instead of fighting.

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:28.070
Fighting, you get more tense.

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:31.210
The very reason those cancers
began in the first place,

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:34.700
you're encouraging
them to continue.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.110
This is powerful stuff.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.120
Because I don't if
you've had any people

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.740
you really love die of cancer
or anyone who's got cancer now

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.260
or will get cancer.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.730
It's a stress-related disease.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.730
You give it more
stress-- get out here.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:53.320
I don't want you-- it
gets worse, bigger.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.040
Yeah?

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.940
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a lot about sort

00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:00.940
of managing anger, managing
problems, and accomplishing

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.710
things by putting things down.

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:05.460
Can you speak a little bit
about the subject of doubt?

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.137
Because as we
proceed through life

00:58:08.137 --> 00:58:09.720
and as we try to
accomplish the things

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.220
that we set out for ourselves,
the goals we've set,

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.820
there's always this
underlying doubt

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:18.740
about whether the direction
we're taking ourselves in

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.080
is the correct one.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.380
And in an uncertain world,
this is almost impossible

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:28.760
to sort of, I
guess, make go away.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.020
So how do you address
this question?

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:31.850
AJAHN BRAHM: OK.

00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:33.680
Doubt, the Buddha
used to say, is

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.105
like being lost in the desert.

00:58:35.105 --> 00:58:36.736
There's this guy
lost in the desert

00:58:36.736 --> 00:58:37.860
for days and days and days.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.870
He was crawling on
his hands and knees.

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:43.540
Heat stroke, sun stroke,
everything stroke.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.340
Maybe a few minutes,
and he would die.

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.940
And in the distance, he
saw a mirage, he thought.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.792
Because he saw someone
coming towards him.

00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.250
But he hadn't seen
anyone for days.

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:52.166
The middle of nowhere.

00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:54.150
He thought, this can't be true.

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:58.340
And as he looked,
it looked as if it

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.770
was an Eskimo, an
Inuit with a dog sled

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.125
and eight husky dogs in front.

00:59:05.125 --> 00:59:08.680
And he thought, the
sun is making me crazy.

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.400
It must be a mirage.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.250
But as it came closer, he
could make out the sound

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:14.750
of the husky dogs barking.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:18.250
And he could see the
furs of the Eskimo.

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.150
And he thought, my goodness.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:21.270
I'm actually saved.

00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:23.540
It's not a mirage after all.

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:28.020
And soon, he could feel the
huskies licking his face,

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.190
and he could see
the Eskimo there,

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:32.000
standing right before him.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.040
It's a miracle.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.670
I'm saved, he said.

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.480
I've been lost in the desert
for days, he said to the Eskimo.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.350
And the Eskimo said, and
you think you're lost.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:53.860
But going back-- going
back to the story,

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.110
it's being lost in the desert.

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.230
And there happened to be
a case when I was young.

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:00.560
I was lost in the mist in
the mountains of Scotland,

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.190
way up in the mountains.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:04.860
I was lost, didn't
know which way to go.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:08.320
And I was told stories of these
people who'd been going around

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.750
and round in the mist for
days, and they never came out.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.830
Some people died.

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:14.920
This was really dangerous.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.253
You didn't know which way to go.

01:00:16.253 --> 01:00:18.700
You had no sense of
direction at all.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.399
So I was really
scared because I could

01:00:21.399 --> 01:00:23.440
have been up there for a
long time without water,

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.310
without food.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:30.980
But then I got back to my
basic science, gravity.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.480
Water always goes downhill.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.580
So I found a little
stream, a tiny stream,

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.669
and decided to follow that,
whichever way it went.

01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:39.710
And I followed it and
followed it and followed it

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:40.376
and followed it.

01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:42.240
It always went further
and further down.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.230
Because I knew if you
went down far enough,

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:46.964
you go below the
clouds, below the mist,

01:00:46.964 --> 01:00:48.380
and you can actually
see your way.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.580
And that's what I did.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.160
Soon I was below the mist.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.420
And I could say the way home.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.186
And that's a simile
I use for doubt.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:59.680
Yeah, you can't see
the big picture.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.102
You're not below the mist yet.

01:01:02.102 --> 01:01:06.040
But at least you know
that water goes downhill.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.860
You know that whatever you're
doing, saying, however you're

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.420
living, if it is creating
better good, happiness,

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.710
peace, whatever qualities
you want to grow,

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.230
if those qualities
are increasing,

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:19.780
you're going in the
right direction.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.640
Carry on.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.710
You can't see the big
picture, the big goal,

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.650
but you know that what
you're doing in your life

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.135
is creating a little bit
more peace, a little bit

01:01:29.135 --> 01:01:31.960
more happiness, a little bit
more harmony, whatever it is.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.880
You know you're going
in the right direction.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.340
That is the only way
you can overcome doubt

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.960
until the time comes
you're below the mist

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.120
and you can see exactly
which way you need to go.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.592
MING: Thank you.

01:01:44.592 --> 01:01:45.550
AJAHN BRAHM: Very good.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:48.000
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.230
MING: Thank you.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:50.802
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah, sure.

01:01:50.802 --> 01:01:53.010
MING: So Ajahn Brahm will
be available to sign books.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:56.370

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:05.750
And my friends, we have my wise,
kind, and very funny friend

and teacher, Ajahn Brahm.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.110
AJAHN BRAHM: Yeah.

01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:08.220
With the beautiful ship.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.070
MING: Thank you.
