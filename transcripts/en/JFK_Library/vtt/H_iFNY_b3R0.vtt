STEVEN ROTHSTEIN: Welcome.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.960
Welcome to everyone, this
first night after last night.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.181
I was so--

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:21.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.810
We are so thrilled that
all of you are here.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.945
My name is Steve Rothstein.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.320
I'm the executive director of
the John F. Kennedy Library

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.460
Foundation.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.920
And on behalf of all of
the library employees,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.420
and the foundation
employees, we are thrilled.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420
And we're so thrilled
actually, not just are you

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.470
filled this room, but there's
an overflow room that's filled.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.755
And there are many
people watching online.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.130
So we're thrilled
that all of you

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.280
are here for this special
guest and this special evening.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.950
Before I introduce them, there
are a few other quick things

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.000
I do want to say.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.980
First, I want to
thank our sponsors,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.740
the Bank of America,
the Lowell Institute,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.490
and our media sponsors, the
Boston Globe, Xfinity, WBUR

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.360
is here.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.640
And tonight we also
want to recognize

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.980
Frank Islam and Debbie
Driesman who's here,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.480
and Boston Magazine.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.910
So join me to thank all of them.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.250
Our amazing host and guests
are going to speak for a bit.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.770
And then there'll be a chance
for question and answers.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.380
Then if you're interested,
there are two microphones

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.510
in the aisles.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.680
Line up at that time.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.600
And Robin will tell
you when that is.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.090
If you're in the
overflow room, our team

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.480
can help you come on in
here and get in line as well

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.220
for those questions.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.710
At the end, Doris Kearns
Goodwin has graciously

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.673
agreed to sign books.

00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:40.590
They are also, if you
don't already have them,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.412
they're available
in the bookstore.

00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:43.620
And there'll be a line there.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.162
So if you're interested
in the books,

00:01:45.162 --> 00:01:47.070
you can go out my
left, your right.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
If you're not, then you go out
that way just to keep it going.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.050
I also want to say, for those
who haven't read this yet,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.672
this is a brilliant,
brilliant piece of work.

00:01:58.672 --> 00:02:00.630
One of things I try to
do is read all the books

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.040
from our authors who come here.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.740
And this one was
just incredible.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.520
To take these four
presidents and weave

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.533
through elements of their
lives is just majestic.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.950
But The New York Times, when
they were talking about this,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.860
they said quote,
"We can only hope

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.900
that a few of
Goodwin's many readers

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.710
will find in her subject
examples, a margin

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.220
of inspiration and resolve to
steer the country to a better

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.060
place."

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.620
end quote.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.415
I also want to recognize
in the audience,

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:33.570
and I'm not sure where
they are, but we have--

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.310
one of the four
presidents this is about

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.190
is, Theodore Roosevelt.
That Theodore Roosevelt's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.220
great grandson and his
son is with us tonight.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.387
So we're thrilled that
they're with us tonight.

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:45.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.120
You know, when you do
these kind of events

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.252
and you sometimes say someone
needs no introduction, well,

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:56.460
literally, if you looked in
a dictionary Doris Kearns

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.490
Goodwin's picture would be there
in the need no introduction.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.770
So having realizing
that, I am going

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.250
to say a little bit about this
Pulitzer Prize winning New York

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.030
Times best seller author.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210
This is her seventh
book and it draws

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.160
on her five decades of amazing
scholarship that she's done.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.830
And her awards and
recognitions, I'm

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.580
not going to list them
all because we have

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.960
an important forum to get to.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.170
But a few of them include
a Pulitzer Prize for a book

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.980
on FDR, the best selling memoir
on Fitzgerald and Kennedy,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.520
which became a mini
series, a Carnegie medal,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.670
working with Steven
Spielberg on Lincoln, which

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.340
was so much based on her
writings, the Frankel

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.350
prize, the New England book
prize, and so much more.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.220
Speaking of award
winning Robin Young

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.890
has won so many
distinguished awards

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.980
during her 25
years in journalism

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.890
both at PUR and at
NPR Here and Now.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.100
She's won a Peabody
and several Emmys.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.790
She has previously done work
with NBC and CBS and the Today

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.320
show.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.320
Again, it's a long list.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.752
So join, me when I
say it's a real honor

00:04:00.752 --> 00:04:02.460
to have both of these
women here tonight.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.960
Thank you.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.910
ROBIN YOUNG: So, there was
nothing going on today.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.642
I just got out of the
studio a few minutes ago

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:18.100
and raced over here because we
had some extraordinary press

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.540
conferences today we're
going to talk about.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.100
I just want to make one note.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.340
I just shrink and wince
when anything I've done

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.570
is mentioned next to my fellow
New Yorker here, Doris Kearns

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.130
Goodwin.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.180
But I have to change
the website, Steve.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.690
Because I think I
wrote that 25 years

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.100
in broadcasting 15 years ago.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.900
I kind of like it.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.350
Doris, we spoke about
your extraordinary book

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.890
a couple of months ago at your
beautiful home in Concord.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.990
And at the time, I mean, who's
read the book so we know.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.240
Plenty of people have read it.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.330
Oh, but plenty are
still in for a treat.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.830
And what you do
throughout the book

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.780
is talk about the things
that shape these four

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.280
extraordinary leaders, LBJ, FDR,
Teddy Roosevelt, and Lincoln.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.700
And they included things like
suffering loss, but being

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.660
burnished by it,
humility, an ability

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.550
to have empathy for others.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.030
And the list goes
on, controlling

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.880
impulses of negative emotions.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.830
And we have a president
today, who I mean,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.400
I'm going to say out loud
what he kind of said today

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.640
in his press comments,
does none of these things,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.310
does not acknowledge
mistakes or losses.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.230
Today he said that
the midterms were

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.820
complete victory,
almost complete

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.440
victory for the Republicans.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.610
They did quite well but
not a complete victory.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.070
The empathy, he was asked
during the press conference

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.990
today about mentioning a
caravan that's 800 miles away

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.230
and a, divisive language, and
he literally said, well, we won.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.100
He and his supporters
would say, hogwash.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.130
My way is working.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.030
His way is not this
way and it is working.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.470
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Whoa.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.260
You know I think it's
working in the short term.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.250
Because what he was able
to do during the election

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.940
and then it stayed true in
the people who supported him

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.760
this time is to
speak to people who

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.250
had felt much like
the people felt

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.550
at the turn of the 20th century,
that they'd been left out

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.610
of the America that is here
today, and worried about where

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.937
the America is going.

00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.520
I mean at the turn
of the 20th century

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.455
it was so much of an echo
to what's happening now.

00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:40.080
The Industrial
Revolution had shaken up

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.300
the economy much
like tech revolution

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.860
and globalization
have done today.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.270
For the first
time, there's a gap

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.790
between the rich and the poor.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.190
The working class feel cut off
from the plenty of the country.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.140
There's a fear of immigration.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.170
And there's a sense in the
turn of the 20th century

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.920
that a revolution was coming.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.303
But we had a leader
then in Teddy Roosevelt,

00:06:59.303 --> 00:07:01.470
who was able to channel
that populist emotion, which

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.150
was anti-immigrant, anti-elite,
into reform, the Square

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.940
Deal for the rich and
the poor, the wage

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.560
worker and the capitalist.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.480
And what's happened
with President Trump

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.090
is he got those people to feel
that he was on their side.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.800
And the polarization in this
country is really at a height,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.150
I mean longer than
in my lifetime.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.570
I mean, maybe not as long as
in the lifetime of the people

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.408
that I've lived with, because
it's not as bad as the 1850s.

00:07:27.408 --> 00:07:28.950
And I think it's
important for people

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.510
to feel, everybody
keeps asking me,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.280
are these the worst of times?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.320
And they feel like an
unmoored time right

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.190
now, because of the lack of a
discernible political truth,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.960
because of lies and fake news
and a fight with the press that

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.710
is unprecedented, the
enemy of the people,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.260
even as this press
conference happened today.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.570
But we have lived through
worse times before.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.910
And I think it's important
to get that perspective,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.060
so that we don't feel like we
can't get out of these times.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.060
I mean, if you lived
with Lincoln at the time

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.832
when he comes into
office in 1861,

00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:00.540
there's going to be
a civil war that will

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.520
kill more than 600,000 people.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.990
He never thought,
he said, he could

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.907
have lived through the
anxiety if he had known

00:08:05.907 --> 00:08:07.290
what would be ahead of time.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.630
And Teddy Roosevelt's time
was even more tumultuous

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.990
than this one is for
some of the same reasons.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.790
And the early days of the
Depression, if you're there

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.200
and you're not sure
that the banks are even

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.038
going to continue, because
they've taken your money

00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:21.330
and put it in the stock market.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.040
And some of them have money
but they don't believe they do.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.690
So there's a sense of not being
able to deal with your money.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.510
There's loss of jobs and
people who are hungry.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.860
And yet we got through that.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.088
And even when LBJ comes in,
it's the assassination of JFK,

00:08:36.088 --> 00:08:38.380
and there's not a clear idea
of where it's coming from.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.020
So the country was in shock.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.789
And yet we had the
right leaders and we

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.250
had citizens who
were awakened, who

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.930
became part of the
struggle, which

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.330
is what is the hopeful thing
to me about this election

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.610
yesterday.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.970
In each one of the
cases that I've studied,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.920
it was the citizens who
created a movement that allowed

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.150
the leaders to go forward.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.880
The antislavery
movement, Lincoln said,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.180
was more important
than what he did.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.722
Without them.

00:09:00.722 --> 00:09:01.830
He couldn't have done it.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.410
The progressive movement
was essential for both Teddy

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.350
and Franklin and the civil
rights movement for LBJ.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.940
We saw an awakening yesterday.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.130
We saw people standing
on long lines.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.090
We saw hosts of new
women coming into office

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.150
for the first time who had not
been in public life before.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.930
We all saw a host of veterans
coming into office too.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.410
And I think what that means
is that somethings, there's

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.450
a fever that has to be
broken and something's

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.390
been really wrong in Washington
for a long period of time.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.400
And people coming
into public life now

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.560
means they still
believe in politics.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.810
They still believe that politics
can be as JFK wanted it to be,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.290
an honorable profession, so
that's a really good sign.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:49.570
So I think as polarizing as the
election was and how it still

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.930
is going to produce a
divided House and a Senate,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.690
if the citizens are awakened
and if the people are

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.300
the ultimate check on what's
going on right now, if they

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.110
exercise their power, not just
to vote but to be citizens that

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.830
are active instead
of spectators,

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.900
we're going to be OK.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.150
ROBIN YOUNG: Well, and I'm
glad you mentioned the word

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.950
compassion and people
having genuine fear.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.100
Because having been
out in places outside

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.650
of Massachusetts, we
are in a blue bubble.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.450
There are people who
are genuinely afraid.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.592
They feel that the world
is passing them by.

00:10:18.592 --> 00:10:20.050
The Progressive
Movement has been--

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.708
[AUDIO OUT]

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.700
I mention sometimes-- refer
back to that 25 plus 15 years.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.800
You know I'll mention to
my younger colleagues,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.018
they'll talk about how awful
things are and I'll say,

00:10:33.018 --> 00:10:33.810
are you kidding me?

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.393
Never would have
thought of recycling.

00:10:35.393 --> 00:10:38.360
We had to fly on airplanes
where you die of cancer just

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.430
from the smoking
that was happening.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.810
It never would've occurred to
women to be in broadcasting.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.960
That's just a very
small list, you know.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.410
So there has been
so much change.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.130
And there are people
who are genuinely very

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.200
frightened by that.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.860
There are also
deplorables, hate mongers,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.150
who, are hearing the
words of the president.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.750
And this isn't just
me saying this,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.110
these are right wing
websites saying,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.290
that after hearing some
words from the president

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.470
about sending troops to
the border and an invasion

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.170
of immigrants, they
are saying things

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.340
like that recent ad, that was
complete fear mongering, so

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.570
bad that Fox News had to pull
the ad, the Willie Horton-esque

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.530
ad.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.695
The right wing
websites while crowing

00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:31.820
about how we couldn't have
written better ourselves

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.695
and couldn't have done
this better ourselves.

00:11:33.695 --> 00:11:35.870
So that is happening.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.630
Frightening time
for a lot of people.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.243
So let's go through some
of these leadership things.

00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:43.160
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
They're going to help us

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.560
if we remember these guys.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.890
They'll give us perspective.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.890
They'll show us that--

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.130
ROBIN YOUNG: These guys,
you mean these presidents.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.507
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: My guys.

00:11:50.507 --> 00:11:52.340
ROBIN YOUNG: She refers
to them as her guys.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.890
They have rooms in her home.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.710
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: They do.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.870
ROBIN YOUNG: This
is Teddy's room.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.180
Let's talk about the
guys, because these people

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.800
who are so afraid, many of
them that I've spoken to,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.520
they just see President
Trump's boisterousness,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.180
as they would call it, as
Teddy Roosevelt. You know,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.410
why isn't it the same?

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.940
Why isn't it the
same as somebody

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.240
who was slightly
imperialistic for a while,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.310
and kind of carried that
big-- why isn't it the same?

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.310
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well, I think in some ways

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.620
if we needed somebody
to come back today

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.900
to take on President
Trump, it would

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.960
be Teddy Roosevelt. I mean
he had that fiery spirit.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.140
He understood how to have
short phrases, so that he'd

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.850
be great with
Twitter I think, you

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.970
know speak softly, speak
softly and carry a big stick.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.315
Don't hit until you have
to and then hit hard.

00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:41.690
You know, even
gave Maxwell House

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.970
the slogan, good to
the very last drop,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.610
he could command attention.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.110
He'd be the center of
colorful attention.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.630
I mean he liked that as well
as President Trump does.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.980
They said about him that he--

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.480
his daughter actually
said about him

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.760
that he wanted to be
the baby at the baptism

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.330
and the bride at the wedding
and the corpse at the funeral.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.060
However, there's
huge differences.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.610
I mean the first difference is
humility, the quality that we

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.110
mentioned, which
means the ability

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.660
to acknowledge errors and
learn from your mistakes.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.550
When he was in the
state legislature,

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.710
he admittedly said he
grew a swelled head.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.770
At first he was so
blistering in his language

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.050
against his opponents,
he would pound his desk

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.030
and he would say terrible
things about them.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.310
And he made headlines all
around New York State.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.420
And then he realized
he couldn't get

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.280
anything done because
the Democrats wouldn't

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.863
listen to him.

00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:27.590
And even his fellow
Republicans were

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.560
upset with the kind of
language that he was using.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.120
So he said, I had
a swelled head.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.080
I rose like a rocket.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.430
I came down like a rocket.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.050
And he learned to
soften his language

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.750
and to compromise
and to collaborate.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.460
He also developed
something that I'm

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.070
afraid President Trump,
I haven't seen develop,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.248
which was empathy.

00:13:44.248 --> 00:13:46.790
I mean he acknowledged that when
he first went into politics,

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.830
it wasn't to help other people,
that it was just an adventure.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.350
He wanted to go into politics.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.250
But then as he went through
the political experience,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.915
and he went into
decrepit tenements

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:57.290
and he was a police
commissioner,

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.240
he saw what the slums
were like at night,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.560
and he saw child labor.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.742
He said, I began to feel what
a fellow feeling, he said.

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.200
I had fellow feeling that may
have been conscious at first,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.650
but then became real.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.650
And I wanted to do things
to make things better.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.820
ROBIN YOUNG: Could
you expound on this?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.070
He was police commissioner
in New York at a time

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.290
when, they were
called tenements,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.518
and they were a horror.

00:14:17.518 --> 00:14:19.310
What did he see what
are some of the things

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.570
that he saw that shocked him?

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.380
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well amazingly,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.330
what happened is
he decided that he

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.580
had to see whether the
policemen were doing their job.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.580
Because the police
department was pretty corrupt

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.280
at that time.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.980
The political bosses were
making deals with them.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.660
And some of the
policemen were very good

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.660
and others were corrupt.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.480
So he want to see who
was doing their job.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.600
So between midnight and
5:00 AM, he put on a coat.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.430
He put on a slouch
hat and he went

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.870
wandering through the streets.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.000
And they couldn't
recognize him he thought.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.180
And they didn't actually.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.805
At a certain point, he comes on
a policeman who was with a girl

00:14:47.805 --> 00:14:49.350
and he's not doing his duty.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.350
And so it says to him,
what are you doing?

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.030
The guy says, what's
it to you, guy?

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.140
You know he doesn't know.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.570
The other guy next to him says,
don't you see who that is?

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.610
And then there were
cartoons all over the place

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.070
of policemen terrified
of big teeth and glasses.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.410
But what he saw was when
he saw the slums at night,

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.760
he saw the lack of light.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.780
He saw the stairwells
that you couldn't get up.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.020
And you begin to feel then, when
you do that, and then of course

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.690
he became a soldier in
the Spanish American War.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.670
So he's with his
fellow soldiers.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.010
And through each one
of those situations,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.110
he developed an
increasing empathy.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.880
And he said, fellow
feeling for that.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.440
And the thing that he said,
which is a warning to us today.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.840
He wrote an essay in which he
said that the rock of democracy

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.100
will founder at the point
when people of other regions

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.350
and classes and
parties and religions

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.480
see each other as the
other, rather than

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.380
as common American citizens.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.430
So what he did as a leader
was, when he's president here's

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.570
a difference again
with President Trump.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.170
He wasn't just stoking his base.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.280
He wanted to expand it.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.420
So he went to states that
he lost as well as states

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:54.920
that he won.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.010
He went to the West as well
as the East on a train.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.980
And he went weeks in the
fall and weeks in the spring.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.140
And he would, and
it was wonderful.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.020
What would have he would meet
with everybody in the city

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.808
and he'd hear the
complaints of the press.

00:16:07.808 --> 00:16:09.350
He was very close
to the press, which

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.210
is another difference
between the two.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.160
They were his
partners in many ways.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.260
And he would then go and
continue on the train.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.230
And he would wave
to people who were

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.140
in there, standing in
their small road crossings

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.063
along the way.

00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:24.230
And there was one point
when he's waving frantically

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.813
at a group, and
they're not responding

00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:27.548
they're rather cold,
until he's told

00:16:27.548 --> 00:16:29.840
because of his nearsightedness,
he's waving frantically

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.050
at a herd of cows.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:33.680
But again, there's
another point.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.527
His Square Deal, he said, a good
deal is when both sides win.

00:16:38.527 --> 00:16:40.610
So it's for the rich and
the poor, the capitalists

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.170
and the wage workers, I said.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.140
What President Trump has
said is that that's crap,

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.810
to say that there's something
about both sides winning.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.730
All that matters
is my side wins.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.650
I mean, literally he wrote that.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.720
So that's the whole
difference in the idea

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.520
of what you're
doing in government

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.510
and what your leadership
responsibilities are.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.140
ROBIN YOUNG: But when you
talk about him saying,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.780
Teddy Roosevelt saying we will--

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.410
who did you say said if
we see the others as--

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.720
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
That's Teddy, yes.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.262
ROBIN YOUNG: But when you talk
about Teddy Roosevelt wanting,

00:17:11.262 --> 00:17:14.930
if we see another American
as the other, we will fail,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:20.030
do you think the Left has
become as guilty as Trump

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.117
and his supporters of seeing
other Americans as the other?

00:17:23.117 --> 00:17:24.950
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well I think certainly

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.480
during Hillary's campaign,
that was a problem.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.680
When she was able to
talk about these people

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.110
as a whole in a negative way.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.710
Yes, I do.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.960
I mean it's not just the left.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.580
But I think Americans
themselves right now

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.460
have to understand other
people's points of view

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.550
and why some people feel
that America hasn't been good

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.130
for them.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.160
I mean my husband
was writing columns,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.180
Richard Goodwin in the 1980s,
in which he said that democracy

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.820
is teetering on the edge of
middle class being squeezed,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.270
and that the Democratic
Party he said then,

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.890
was losing goods
sold because it was

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.910
too connected to the people
in power, too connected

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.970
to the money interests, that it
wasn't worrying about the fact

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.970
that plenty of the country
was not being distributed

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.030
through the lack of mobility,
through the lack of education,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.950
through the lack of a
progressive politics

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.400
reaching down to a whole group
of people who felt they weren't

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.490
able to make it through the
system with their discipline

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.540
and their energy.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.420
And that was what Lincoln had
always said, that you rise--

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.630
what a democracy depends on
its everybody's discipline

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.120
and talent can be
used to the extent

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.363
that it can rise to the system
as well as they're able to.

00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:34.280
And the system wasn't
allowing that to happen.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.790
Yes.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.165
YOUNG: I just want to mention,
when you mentioned Hillary

00:18:37.165 --> 00:18:38.740
Clinton, linguists had said--

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.670
and this really stuck
with me-- you probably

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.650
know this as an observer of
human nature and such a writer.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.430
Linguists have said, she made
a fatal error of saying--

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.533
speaking of the basket
of deplorables first.

00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:52.700
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Right.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.700
ROBIN YOUNG: And then
she said, of course,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.620
there are wonderful
people who are

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.245
truly afraid of their future in
the changing world around them.

00:18:57.245 --> 00:19:00.440
And linguists say that
what you frontload with

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.760
is all people here.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.430
And if she had
just reversed that,

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.450
we might not have had
the reaction that we had.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.400
And you also mentioned
a couple of the things

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.790
I want to bring up later.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:17.470
But talk about how
each of these four men

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.160
survived the thing
that burnished them.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.160
It was such
depression for Lincoln

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.280
that his friends
removed sharp objects.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.940
It was depression for LBJ
after he lost his first run,

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.820
when he went, again,
into a severe depression.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.220
Polio for FDR.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.948
For Ted, it was--

00:19:36.948 --> 00:19:39.365
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Well,
Teddy is the loss of his-- no,

00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:40.870
I'd be glad-- wife
and his mother

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.790
on the same day
in the same house.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.840
No, you're so right.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.810
I think one of the traits of
a leader that's so important

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.660
is resilience and the ability
to come through adversity

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.870
and through loss.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.410
And again, if we just talk
about President Trump,

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.570
during the campaign,
he said he would

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.880
have the very, very best
temperament of anyone who'd

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.120
ever run for President
because he had never lost.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.155
He had always won.

00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:03.280
Now, of course he had lost.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.920
There'd been bankruptcies,
and if he'd reflected on that,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.420
there might have
been a happy thing.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.650
But in my case-- in my case.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.885
My guys-- so just
going through them,

00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:13.480
and here's the interesting
thing about Lincoln.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.460
When he runs for office
the very first time,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.240
he's only 23 years
old and he gives out

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.470
this remarkable statement.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.020
He said, every man has
his peculiar ambition.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.015
Even then, he's saying,
mine is to be esteemed

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.770
of up by my fellow man--

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.180
to be worthy of their esteem.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.450
Amazing that a 23 year old--
most people go into politics

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.468
when they're young--

00:20:32.468 --> 00:20:34.510
it's for themselves, and
then at a certain point,

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.910
it transfers into
for the greater good.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.380
He already had that, right?

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.260
Then he says, I don't know
whether I'll win this election.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.810
I'm young and unknown
to many of you.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.168
And if I lose, I've been so
familiar with disappointment,

00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:48.460
I won't be very much chagrined.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.070
But then he says,
but if I lose, I

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.490
want you to know I'm going to
try five or six more times,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.373
until it will be
too humiliating,

00:20:56.373 --> 00:20:57.790
and then I promise
you, I'll never

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.370
try again, which means
perseverance was there

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.750
from the start with him.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.580
And then as you
suggested, what happens

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.870
is he does win the
second time around.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.990
He's in the state
legislature, but his gap

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.910
between what his
big ambitions are

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.520
and what's happening to him
in the state legislature

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.600
are so large that he begins
to feel this melancholy.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.740
And then he breaks his
engagement with Mary Todd

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.810
and he feels like he's
broken his word to her.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.380
And he does cycle into the most
serious depression of his life,

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.300
where his friends are
so worried, as you say,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.760
that they took all knives
and razors and scissors

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.750
from his room.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.270
And his best friend comes
to his side and says,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.190
Lincoln, you must
rally, or you will die.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.460
And he says, I know that, and
I'd just as soon die right now,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.050
but I've not yet
accomplished anything

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.600
to make any human being
remember that I have lived.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.340
So that worthy
ambition carried him

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.310
through-- that carried him
through two senate losses,

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.350
until he finally
wins the presidency.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.580
So that's our Abraham Lincoln.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.730
And then Teddy, as you say--

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.340
he was doing well in
the state legislature.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.290
Finally, he'd come
down from realizing

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.240
that he had to
change his approach,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.850
and he gets a telegram that
his young wife has given birth

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.350
to their first child.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.960
And they celebrate with
cigars, and then he

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.390
gets another telegram not
long thereafter saying,

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.023
your wife is dying
and your mother,

00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:10.690
who'd come to take
care of his wife, who

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.190
was only 49 and contracted
typhoid fever, was dying, too.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.790
He goes home.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.870
His mother dies first.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.270
His wife dies the same
day in the same house.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.000
But the incredible thing is
he goes into a depression,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.170
but he goes out to the Badlands
to physically try and recover,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.110
and in the Badlands, he
becomes a westerner-- a cowboy,

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.520
as well as an easterner.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.812
And he said he probably never
would have been President

00:22:32.812 --> 00:22:33.980
if that hadn't happened.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.890
And so it broadens
his experience.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.990
He's learning about
new ways of life.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.140
When he comes back to politics,
he's a much different man.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.110
And of course, FDR's
resilience through the polio

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.700
changed him in lots of ways.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.880
He was an interesting
young man before that.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.960
He had had success.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.400
He was a natural politician.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.730
He found, when he first went to
the state legislature himself--

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.440
he said, William
James, the philosopher,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.260
said, every now and then,
your character is defined

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.410
when you find that voice
within you that says,

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.850
this is the real me.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.560
He found that when
he was barnstorming

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.590
the very first time when he went
out for the state legislature,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.245
he wasn't a great
speaker at the time.

00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:11.620
Eleanor said they
were so worried

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.380
that he would pause so
often between his sentences,

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.790
they thought he'd never go on.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.290
But then by the end
of the campaign,

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.580
they thought he'd never stop.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.050
He was up there too long.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.910
But then what happens to him,
obviously-- he's in his 30s

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:23.410
still.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.540
He gets stricken with polio.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.550
He's paralyzed from
the waist down,

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.530
and he cycles into
a depression, too,

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.023
but comes out of it
by just deciding,

00:23:32.023 --> 00:23:33.940
I'm going to do everything
I can to strengthen

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.510
my back and my chest so that I
can manipulate the wheelchair

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.990
and do whatever I can to try
to walk on my own power again.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.590
So every day, he's asked to
be taken from his wheelchair

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.900
onto the carpet of
the library floor

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.140
so he can crawl for hours,
just to strengthen his chest

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.190
and back.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.410
And then, of course,
he goes to Warm Springs

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.150
and he allows his
vulnerability to be

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.730
seen by the fellow
polios, as they call them,

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.740
that he invited
them to come, not

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.050
just to heal in
the giant waters,

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.810
but to learn to have
fun in life again.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.650
So he plays water polo and tag
and they have wheelchair dances

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.900
and they have cocktail
parties at night.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.020
And they wrote-- I read their
oral histories that he changed

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.390
their life because he made
them feel they could live

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.450
a full life, but he then emerges
much more warmhearted, much

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.120
more empathetic to other
people to whom fate

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.070
had dealt an unkind hand.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.010
And then, as you say,
LBJ loses a senate race

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.750
and goes in the
opposite direction.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.410
Sometimes, adversity
can send you backwards.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.200
He had had much empathy
as a young person before,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.120
but then he turned his
back on the New Deal.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.790
He became more conservative
to win the Senate race,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.650
and then he accumulates
power and he

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.510
becomes the majority
leader of the Senate--

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.330
the most powerful, youngest
majority leader of the Senate.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.460
But then he has a
massive heart attack,

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.350
and then in his
depression, he comes out

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.840
and he asks himself,
what if I died now?

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.940
What would I be remembered for?

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.220
And then even in the Senate,
he goes for civil rights,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.500
gets the first civil rights
bill since reconstruction

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.660
through the Senate, and
then, in the presidency,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.360
civil rights becomes
what he cares most about.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:11.200
So-- Afterwards, some--

00:25:15.463 --> 00:25:16.880
ROBIN YOUNG: A
story that you tell

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.440
is one I wasn't
as familiar with--

00:25:22.478 --> 00:25:24.020
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Yes, of course.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.240
ROBIN YOUNG: I'm sorry.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.030
Not JFK, sorry.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.675
We're in the library.

00:25:25.675 --> 00:25:26.860
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: We
get our guys confused.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.200
I did that on television today.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.950
ROBIN YOUNG: These
are not my guys.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.620
I don't have that honor, but
you tell the story of LBJ

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.190
as a school superintendent
and a teacher,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.587
and buying supplies
for these kids.

00:25:38.587 --> 00:25:39.670
Tell that story, because--

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:39.940
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: No.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.410
I mean, it really shows.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.220
When you are able to feel
other people's points of view,

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.690
it changes you inside.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.180
So he was in college, and
he had to take a year off

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.140
to make money.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.990
So he went to a small
Mexican-American school.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.560
And he said, he saw the pain of
prejudice on these kids' faces.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.760
And he wanted to do
something about it.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.140
So he uses his salary to
buy them sporting equipment.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.330
He's the principal,
the debate coach.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.940
He's the band leader.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.670
He's everything.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.790
ROBIN YOUNG: You almost
feel sorry for them.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.166
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: No.

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:09.770
I don't.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.420
Well, they said
he walked so fast,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.570
it was like a blur
going past him.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.880
And, of course, he just
poured that energy into them.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.350
But the really
interesting thing is

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.710
so it made him feel-- then he
becomes a young New Dealer.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.380
He brings electricity
to the rural area.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.900
And as I said, until
that first senate loss.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.480
But the amazing thing is,
he returns to that Cotulla

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.040
experience in 1965 when the
Selma demonstrations have

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.450
brought about the
decision on LBJ's part

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.540
to give a speech to a
joint session of Congress.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.790
So on a Sunday night he
decides to give a speech.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.260
Cotulla's going to
be part of this.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.850
And then on Monday
night he's going--

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.440
and my husband is
part of this too.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.165
My husband was
working then for LBJ,

00:26:50.165 --> 00:26:51.790
doing all of his
civil rights speeches.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.990
And he had to write that
speech, that day, on Monday.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.570
And so Johnson knew not
to bother him all day.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.950
It's the most amazing speech.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.450
"Every now and then
history and fate

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.760
meet at a certain time
in a certain place.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.260
So it was at Appomattox.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.210
So it was at
Lexington and Concord.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.250
So it was in Selma, Alabama."

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.460
And think about this today.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.800
"This is not a northern problem.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.210
This is not a southern problem.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.290
It's not a white problem.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.640
It's not a negro problem.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.440
It is an American problem.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.340
And we shall overcome."

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.490
He took the anthem of
the civil rights movement

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.790
and made it theirs, which was
when the outside movement meets

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.330
the inside.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.988
That's when real change happens.

00:27:26.988 --> 00:27:28.780
But then the only time
he called my husband

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.400
not to bother him
that day was, I'd

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.020
like you to talk about Cotulla.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.240
And he'd told my
husband this experience.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.970
So Johnson, again,
he said, "I never

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.330
thought in 1928 when I
was there with these kids

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.970
that I would be able to do
something and have the power

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.753
to do something for the sons
and daughters of those kids,

00:27:45.753 --> 00:27:47.920
and do something about the
prejudice that they faced

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.630
and people are still facing now.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.210
But let me let you
in on a secret.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.180
I have that power now,
and I mean to use it."

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.893
It was an incredible moment.

00:27:56.893 --> 00:27:57.560
Love that story.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:06.730
ROBIN YOUNG: And back
to Donald J. Trump,

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:13.570
because his many supporters
may feel that he is exerting

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.570
that same power for them.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.970
They certainly have expressed
that, protecting them

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.110
at the border, bringing
back their jobs.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.550
He said today, the
steel industry is back.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.840
And coal miners are working.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.930
Well, of course, we know the
steel industry is not back

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.790
and coal miners are not working.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.790
In fact, they're coming
down with black lung again.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:39.830
But his supporters
strongly feel he is that.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.730
You said something before
about being surprised

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.320
that he didn't mention the
losses that his family has had,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.830
the bankruptcies, but also the
lawsuits when his family was

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.070
found to actively not
allow African-Americans

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.720
to live in their building.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.650
I also think all the time about
the loss of a brother, who

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.070
was said to have been the most
charismatic in the family,

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.430
and somebody who decided they
wanted to live their own life,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.030
and just charmed the
pants off of every one,

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.270
and had all this potential,
and became an alcoholic,

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.010
and died of alcoholism.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:19.750
And here we have a president
who does not drink, but exhibits

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.180
a lot of behavior-- tweeting at
2:00 and 3:00 in the morning.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.260
And the loss of a sibling
to me, and as someone

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.860
who is familiar with
alcoholism in a family, that

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.120
would have burnished me.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.100
That would have shaped me.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.430
As an historian, is that
something that you want?

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.525
I know if I ever
interview him, that's

00:29:39.525 --> 00:29:41.150
something I've wanted
to ask him about.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:41.390
DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN: I mean, you

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.950
would hope that
that would bring out

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.530
in him that sense
of vulnerability,

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.290
the sense of loss, the
sense of self reflection.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.757
And whether it's there and
he doesn't talk about it,

00:29:50.757 --> 00:29:53.090
because maybe he'll think
that'll be a sign of weakness,

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.638
or whether he just has
shut himself down from it,

00:29:55.638 --> 00:29:56.180
I don't know.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.655
Somebody would have to know him.

00:29:57.655 --> 00:29:59.030
But I think the
interesting thing

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.270
that people feel
he's on their side,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.930
he has certainly mastered
the new form of communication

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:09.393
today, in the social media,
and through his tweets.

00:30:09.393 --> 00:30:10.560
It broke through everything.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.590
It makes news wherever he goes.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.567
And each one of my
presidents were able--

00:30:14.567 --> 00:30:16.400
I don't really mean to
be calling them "my."

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.235
It's just that I've
lived with them so long.

00:30:18.235 --> 00:30:19.860
And I wake up with
them in the morning.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.027
I think about them at night.

00:30:21.027 --> 00:30:21.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.110
And my only fear
is in the afterlife

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.370
there's going to be a
panel of all of these guys.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.828
And they're going to tell me
every single thing I got wrong

00:30:28.828 --> 00:30:29.360
about them.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.777
And the first
person to scream out

00:30:30.777 --> 00:30:32.210
will be Lyndon
Johnson, of course.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.130
How come those damn
books on the Roosevelts

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.213
were twice as long as the
book you wrote about me?

00:30:36.213 --> 00:30:36.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.580
But anyway.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.510
ROBIN YOUNG: He is
the one that you

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.590
could say was your president.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.130
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Yeah.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.170
ROBIN YOUNG: Because
you worked for him.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:41.870
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Yeah.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.590
Exactly.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.650
But even so, so Lincoln
understood at the time

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.300
when he was giving
his speeches that,

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.510
luckily, his gift for
language was perfectly suited,

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.400
because each one of
the speeches would

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.850
be printed in full in the
newspaper, and then read aloud,

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.090
and reread in country
homes and city homes.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.920
At the time Teddy
comes along, it's

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.440
the national newspapers
have just come out.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.417
And so there's a sense
that his colorful language

00:31:06.417 --> 00:31:08.000
and his short
statements were perfect.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.680
He made headlines everywhere.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.800
Of course, when FDR is there,
the voice for the radio.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.170
But more than the voice,
it was the intimacy

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.910
of his conversational style.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.910
He starts off, "My friends,"
in those fireside chats.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.760
And people feel that he's
really talking to them directly.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.700
There's a story of Saul
Bellow walking down

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.370
the street on a hot
Chicago night and watching.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.130
8 out of 10 radios would be
tuned in, more than anything,

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.320
more than the entertainment,
the sporting events,

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.973
to listen to these
fireside chats.

00:31:34.973 --> 00:31:37.640
And he could see people in their
living rooms and their kitchens

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.090
looking at their radio.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.280
And he could hear
Roosevelt's voice coming out.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.710
And he said you could keep
walking down the street

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.600
and not miss a word
of what he said.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.850
And then there's a construction
worker running home.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.600
And the partner says,
where are you going?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.780
And said, my president's
coming to my living room

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.010
to speak to me tonight.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.230
It's only right I be there
to greet him when he comes.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.698
And there was a
sense when he died

00:31:56.698 --> 00:31:58.490
that strangers were
huddling around saying,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.200
my friend is gone.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.390
And somebody said,
how incredible

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.240
it is that one person dies
and millions feel lonely.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.270
That was the bond that he
established with the people.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.550
And then, of course, you
get JFK and Ronald Reagan

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.750
with television.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.480
And LBJ, in those joint
session of Congress,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.800
was able to do that.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.130
And then you get Donald
Trump with social media.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.680
And the difference
is that social media

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.420
worked when he was campaigning.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.660
But at some point those tweets
that you do at 2:00 and 3:00

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.120
in the morning, those
extemporaneous things

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.030
that are not filtered
in any way become

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.460
a problem for the country,
cause they're angry.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.840
There's no controlling emotions.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.090
If only he had been able
to do what Lincoln did.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.950
Lincoln, when he
got mad at somebody,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.567
had this ritual where he'd write
a hot letter to the person.

00:32:42.567 --> 00:32:44.150
Then he'd put the
letter aside, hoping

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.650
he would cool down
psychologically

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.420
and never need to send it.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.328
If only he had a hot
tweets and cool tweets,

00:32:49.328 --> 00:32:51.620
and he didn't send them out
in the middle of the night.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.890
But because of not making
that gap between campaigning

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.750
and governing, not
for some people,

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.580
but for all the people--

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.640
it's as if Lincoln understood
when he was president that even

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.560
though he was able to fight--

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.715
he could have had the best
jibes at other politicians.

00:33:08.715 --> 00:33:10.340
There's a moment when
somebody yells up

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.798
at him in a Stephen
Douglas debate.

00:33:11.798 --> 00:33:12.710
"You're two faced!"

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.330
And he was able to say,
"If I had two faces,

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.955
do you think I'd be
wearing this face?"

00:33:15.955 --> 00:33:17.580
He was that quick.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.540
But he said once he became
president he never wanted

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.130
to speak extemporaneously.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.410
He wanted to prepare
his words, because he

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.060
knew that words matter.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.960
Words inspire.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.770
Words can hurt.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.940
Words can bully.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.340
Words are the
stuff of democracy.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.650
And it's that worries
me the most about now,

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.800
that there's no shared
political truth.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.807
But again, I mean--

00:33:37.807 --> 00:33:39.140
ROBIN YOUNG: And there are lies.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.920
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
And there are lies.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.880
And there is fake news.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.760
I understand.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.970
ROBIN YOUNG: It's
been very awkward.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.930
Because the press, and I'm
sure historians debated

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.170
for a long time, a lie is
when somebody knowingly

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:51.830
says something.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.460
You can misspeak, or you
could be misinformed.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.260
But when you know that somebody
knows something, it's a lie.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.850
It's very hard to have to say.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.940
But I know you want to
talk about your guys.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.640
But what would you want?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.070
How would you conduct an
interview with Donald Trump?

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.929
What would you want to ask him?

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:12.440
DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN: I think what

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.510
I'd do is bring my four
people back and have

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.839
them conduct the interview.

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:16.210
ROBIN YOUNG: No.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:16.360
No.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:16.580
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: No.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.204
I'm serious.

00:34:17.204 --> 00:34:17.719
ROBIN YOUNG: What would you say?

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.440
What would you say?

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:18.690
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: No.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.280
I mean it.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.150
Just think.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.989
Just think if Lincoln came back.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:24.360
And he suggested to
him, why don't you

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.190
read my second inaugural.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.190
Why don't you read the words
that say, "The sin of slavery

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.190
was shared by both sides,"
just on the moment of triumph.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.870
How many times has
President Trump

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.370
been on a moment
of triumph when you

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.210
hope that the joy of the triumph
will allow him to reach out

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.489
to everybody else and not
just this group of people

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.600
that elected him?

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.830
His inaugural speech
was filled with carnage.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.580
Even at the time of
the Kavanaugh hearings

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.679
when he was
triumphant-- he got what

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.080
the Republicans wanted, a
Conservative on the Supreme

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.889
Court.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.590
And instead of saying,
well, now let's try and heal

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.868
these divisions, instead he
said the Republicans were

00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:02.160
the good people, and the
Democrats were horrible people

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.870
because they'd made this hoax.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.580
At the time of the
bombing plot, I

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.930
kept thinking maybe now
he'll be able to say--

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.880
and he talked about
unity for a minute.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.400
And then the next
day he was talking

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.650
in the opposite direction
that it's the press's fault.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.010
ROBIN YOUNG: Do you mean about
the mail bombing threats?

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.080
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
The mail bombings.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.320
Yeah.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.695
I mean, that was
the biggest plot

00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:21.150
against the country leadership
since Abraham Lincoln.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.288
ROBIN YOUNG: We could have
seen two assassinations.

00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:24.330
Of two former presidents.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.620
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Just that it didn't happen

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.110
doesn't mean that it
wasn't scary to happen.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.110
But I think, to
a certain extent,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.850
the important thing is that--

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.320
so if you brought
back Lincoln, he

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.050
could talk about reconciliation.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.800
What does he say in
that second inaugural?

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.487
He could say to President Trump,
why don't you talk like this?

00:35:40.487 --> 00:35:42.570
That "with malice toward
none and charity for all,

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.130
let us bind up the
nation's wounds."

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.470
The overwhelming number
of people in this country

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.030
want these divisions
to be healed.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.570
Right?

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.520
If Teddy comes back
he can teach him,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.490
I think, about a deal that's
square for both sides.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.260
If FDR comes back
he can talk to him

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.420
about the importance of
establishing a true bond

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.820
with all the people
through talking

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.650
to them in honest language.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.240
And if LBJ came
back he could say,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.810
let's get the whole Congress
in living in the White House.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.810
And I'm not letting them
out until they come out

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.470
with legislation
on infrastructure

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.070
or whatever we need.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.960
I mean, LBJ's ability--

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.650
what makes me sad is when I
think about what bipartisanship

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.930
was like in the 1960s and '70s.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.550
And I think part of
it was, and that's

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.700
why I feel somewhat
comfort about the idea

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.560
that veterans are
going into Congress,

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.530
the reason I think we had such
good bipartisanship in part

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.570
was because we had
so many veterans who

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.382
had been in World War
II or the Korean War.

00:36:33.382 --> 00:36:35.340
And they populated the
Congress and the Senate.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.080
They knew what it was like
to have a common mission

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.240
against a common purpose.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:38.740
No.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.570
A common purpose, and a common
mission across party lines.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.070
And they also lived
in Washington.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.270
They weren't racing
home to make money.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.300
I mean, the money is the
poison in the system.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.750
We can do something about it.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.030
This is what's so important.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.270
FDR said, "Problems created
by man can be solved by man."

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.910
There are states
that are now having

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.500
a constitutional
amendment started

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.480
to reverse Citizens United.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.000
There are states that are
trying, four states now,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.820
to have nonpartisan commissions
draw the congressional lines

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.620
instead of the gerrymandering.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.810
I personally have a feeling
that a national service

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.432
program would be such a great
binder for us right now.

00:37:12.432 --> 00:37:14.390
There are generals that
are talking about that.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.740
What if kids from the
city and the rural area

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.230
had host families, and
they worked for a year

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.823
in some missions,
disaster relief.

00:37:20.823 --> 00:37:23.490
There's so many more people that
want to be in the teacher corps

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.870
than the applicants can take.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.910
If we'd spent billions
of dollars on that,

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.080
to teach people
to work together--

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.750
there are things we can do.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.630
And the reason why I keep
going back to these people

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.328
before is because they were
able to accomplish these things.

00:37:37.328 --> 00:37:38.120
We have to believe.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.740
If we don't believe we
can change the situation

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.410
we're not going to
be able to change it.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:44.220
We are, though.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.220
I really believe we are.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:45.720
We're going to.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.512
And this is the beginning
of the awakening.

00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:49.890
We have to see this
positive side of what

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.190
happened in this election.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.732
ROBIN YOUNG: Well,
and some have said

00:37:52.732 --> 00:37:55.560
that some of those
marquee races,

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.860
with Beto O'Rourke in Texas,
or the race for the Senate,

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.940
or the race for the
governorship in Florida,

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.120
it's unbelievable that
the progressives did

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.860
as well as they did
in these red states.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.930
And Democrats should
take heart with that.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.880
But your guys are not back.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.620
And I would just die
to be a fly on the wall

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.770
if you were able to sit
down with President Trump.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.215
Just one question you'd
want to ask him yourself.

00:38:26.453 --> 00:38:28.370
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: I
mean, the thing that's

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.177
so surprising about
him, but I don't

00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:31.760
think it'd be the
question to ask him,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.430
is that I think every
president who's really

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:39.900
been a good president has found
fulfillment in the thought

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.260
that what they were doing
was for the greater good,

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.447
and that it would be
remembered over time.

00:38:45.447 --> 00:38:46.530
I mean, that's what I say.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.570
That's that transition between
the self and the greater good.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:55.650
And I suppose you'd want to
ask him, what is it that you're

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.990
doing that you think
will be remembered

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.390
by history in a good way?

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:04.260
And then tell him
in every case it's

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.910
the increasing of social
justice or economic opportunity.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.270
Now, he might say
that the economy has

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.980
increased economic opportunity.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.410
But it's a short term thing.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:14.940
And even today he
said, if Obama had

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.670
stayed in power we would have
gone downhill economically.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.850
We were already going
uphill at that time.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.540
ROBIN YOUNG: This is a trend.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.680
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I guess I don't know

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.930
what I'd say to him, honestly.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.950
I'd love to be able to
just talk to him about what

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.817
it was that these other leaders
had, what were these qualities,

00:39:31.817 --> 00:39:33.900
and to think about whether
he has these qualities.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.660
Ask him, where is the humility?

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.010
What kind of mistakes?

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.930
He was asked today
about something,

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.990
about what did he learn from
the experience of the midterms,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.600
assuming that it was the
House of Representatives,

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.338
yes, went Democratic,
and that wasn't so great.

00:39:48.338 --> 00:39:50.130
But he said, I learned
that people like me.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.580
That's what his answer was.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:56.280
But I guess, so when
I think about it,

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.550
humility, empathy, resilience,
controlling emotions.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.200
I mean, what I'm
hoping in some ways,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.340
through reading this book, is
that people, through my having

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.950
spent so much time with
him, will just remember

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.370
what it takes to be a leader.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:14.340
My favorite leadership,
unheralded trait actually,

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.880
is that they all were able
to find time to think,

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.280
and to relax, and
replenish their energies.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.630
I mean, we think we can't
do it in today's world.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.560
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.050
it was so helpful
that people came out,

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.675
as citizens, because
we feel like we're

00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:27.873
so busy with everything.

00:40:27.873 --> 00:40:29.040
These guys were pretty busy.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.610
Right?

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.630
They had a civil war.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.470
They had World War II.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.990
And yet, they all found time.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.265
Lincoln actually went to
the theater 100 times.

00:40:37.265 --> 00:40:38.640
He said when the
lights went down

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.490
and a Shakespeare play came
on, for a few precious hours

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.070
he could imagine himself
back in the War of the Roses

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.050
and forget the war
that was raging.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.180
And, of course, his
greatest form of relaxation

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.540
was his extraordinary sense
of humor and his storytelling

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.890
ability.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:55.590
And he was able to make
cabinet meetings that

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:59.730
were really tense and anxious,
undo that tension by telling

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:00.930
a funny story.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.270
Somehow that that's
the way it worked.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.910
I mean, my favorite story that
he always told again and again

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.550
that I was able to persuade
Daniel Day Lewis and Steven

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.440
Spielberg to put in
the movie Lincoln

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.440
had to do with the Revolutionary
War hero, Ethan Allen, who

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.140
went to England after the
war to a dinner party.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.880
They decided to
embarrass him by putting

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.150
a huge picture of General
Washington in the only outhouse

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.220
where he'd have to encounter
it sooner or later.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.560
So they figured he'd be
very irritated at the idea

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.270
that George was
hanging in an outhouse.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.807
But he came out
not upset at all.

00:41:28.807 --> 00:41:31.140
They said, well, didn't you
see George Washington there?

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:31.890
Oh, yes, he said.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.182
I think it was the perfectly
appropriate place for him.

00:41:34.182 --> 00:41:35.363
What do you mean, they said?

00:41:35.363 --> 00:41:37.530
Well, he said, there's
nothing to make an Englishman

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.780
shit faster than the sight
of General George Washington.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.976
And he had hundreds,
hundreds of these stories.

00:41:44.976 --> 00:41:47.310
And as he said, a
good story could

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.560
make him whistle off sadness.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.800
Teddy Roosevelt was able
to exercise every afternoon

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.680
for a couple hours.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.920
He had had asthma as a child.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.670
So he had to build up his body.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.670
And he took time off to have
a wrestling match, or a boxing

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:03.150
match, or his favorite was
a hike in the wooded cliffs

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.410
of Rock Creek Park.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.910
And he used to
take people along.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.940
And the rule was you couldn't
go around any obstacle.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.040
If you came to a rock,
you had to climb it.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.140
If you came to a precipice,
you had to go down.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.940
So people are falling
by the wayside

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.190
as they're trying to be in
the wooded cliffs with him.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:20.160
But the best story was told
by the French ambassador.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.600
He came in his silk outfit.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.130
He thought they'd be walking
in the Champs Elysee.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.710
And he finds himself
in the woods.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.090
And he's falling down.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.862
And thank god they
reach a stream.

00:42:28.862 --> 00:42:29.820
And he said, it's over.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.900
We'll go back.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.520
Then he said, judge
of my horror when

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.292
I saw the president unbutton
his clothes, and heard him say,

00:42:35.292 --> 00:42:36.000
it's an obstacle.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.990
We can't go around it.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.670
So no sense in getting wet.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:41.910
So I too, for the honor of
France, took off my apparel.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.790
However, I left on my
lavender kid gloves.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.100
It would be most embarrassing
if we should meet ladies

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.870
on the other side.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:48.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.130
So I love these stories.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.160
So then FDR, his is
in some ways the best.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.690
So in the middle
of World War II he

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.610
has a cocktail
party every night.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.220
And the rule is that you
can't talk about the war.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.350
You can talk about books
you've read, movies

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.933
you've seen, gossip, as long as
the war doesn't get mentioned,

00:43:05.933 --> 00:43:09.080
so he, like Lincoln, can
imagine himself in another era.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.800
So after a while this cocktail
party was so important to him

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.300
that he wanted the people who
would be going to the cocktail

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.467
party to live on the second
floor of the White House

00:43:16.467 --> 00:43:18.170
to be ready for
the cocktail party.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.050
So it becomes the most
exclusive residential hotel.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.150
His foreign policy
advisor Harry Hopkins

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.460
comes for dinner one night,
sleeps over, and never

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.560
leaves until the
war comes to an end.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.840
His secretary, Missy LeHand,
lives with the family

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.892
in the White House.

00:43:30.892 --> 00:43:32.600
Lorena Hickok, a friend
of Eleanor's, has

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.490
a bedroom next to Eleanor.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.400
Princess Martha from
Norway, in exile

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.900
in America during the wars,
with the family on the weekends.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.670
And the great Winston
Churchill spends

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.800
weeks at a time in
a bedroom diagonally

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.903
across from Roosevelt.

00:43:43.903 --> 00:43:46.320
So when I was writing the book
about Franklin and Eleanor,

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.080
I became obsessed
with the thought.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.660
All these people are
together in their bathrobes

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.210
on the corridor that surrounds
the six and seven bedroom

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.810
suites.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.477
And just wishing,
when I'd been up there

00:43:55.477 --> 00:43:58.097
with LBJ when I was 24
that I thought of asking,

00:43:58.097 --> 00:43:59.180
where did Churchill sleep?

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.500
Where was Roosevelt?

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.490
Where was Eleanor?

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.920
But, of course, I wasn't
thinking in those terms then.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.758
So I mentioned this on a
radio program in Washington.

00:44:06.758 --> 00:44:09.050
And it happened that Hillary
Clinton, then in the White

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.027
House, was listening.

00:44:10.027 --> 00:44:12.110
So she promptly called me
up at the radio station,

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.140
invited me to sleep
overnight in the White House

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.910
so we could wander
the corridor together,

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:18.410
and figure out
through the sleepover

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.730
where everyone had slept.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.890
So two weeks later she
invited my husband and me

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.980
to a state dinner, after which
between midnight and 2:00 AM

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.770
the president, Mrs. Clinton, my
husband and I, my map in hand,

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.040
figured out, yes, Harry Hopkins
slept where Chelsea Clinton is

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.090
now sleeping.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:34.340
The Clintons are
sleeping where FDR was.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.920
And we'd been given Winston
Churchill's bedroom.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.338
There was no way I could sleep.

00:44:38.338 --> 00:44:40.130
I was certain he was
sitting in the corner,

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.490
drinking his brandy, and
smoking his ever present cigar.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.230
But LBJ could not relax.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.490
And that was a problem.

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:48.442
When I was with him
in the ranch later,

00:44:48.442 --> 00:44:50.150
when he was still
president actually-- he

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.740
had a pool at the ranch.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.500
And you're supposedly swimming
and exercising in the pool.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.070
But it was so filled with
floating rafts, with floating

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.820
notepads, and floating
telephones that you

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.260
couldn't move in the pool.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.030
Now, he does go play golf.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.975
Whether he's able
to fully relax--

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.600
I mean, he said he
would only play golf

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.180
if he could persuade somebody
of somebody when he does it.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.550
But I don't see the
joy in this man.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:16.760
Even when he's had these
moments of triumph,

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.513
they turn into fighting
moments about somebody else.

00:45:19.513 --> 00:45:21.180
ROBIN YOUNG: You're
talking about Trump.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.680
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: I'm now
talking about President Trump.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.930
So I don't see that he truly is
able to find the time to think,

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:28.280
to find the time to really--

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.060
ROBIN YOUNG: To reflect.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.435
DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN: To reflect.

00:45:30.435 --> 00:45:32.880
I mean, self reflection is
key, not just for a leader.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.330
For all of us.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.080
And I don't see that in him.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.070
These guys had it.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.260
I mean, FDR took a
fishing trip one day

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.810
for 10 days in the
middle of England

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.690
being bombed by Germany
before we were in the war.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.190
And while he was
on the fishing trip

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.220
he came up himself with
the whole Lend Lease idea,

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.852
because he was away from the
bureaucracy in Washington.

00:45:51.852 --> 00:45:53.060
And he came up with the idea.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.230
We lend our weapons to them.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.522
We're not allowed to sell them.

00:45:55.522 --> 00:45:56.895
We can't give them to them.

00:45:56.895 --> 00:45:57.770
But we can lend them.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.933
And then they'll give them
back the end of the war.

00:46:00.933 --> 00:46:03.350
ROBIN YOUNG: You're going to
be able to ask your questions

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:04.183
in about 10 minutes.

00:46:04.183 --> 00:46:05.510
So be thinking of them.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.780
Another in your list, your
great list of the leadership

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.850
traits of these
great four presidents

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:13.130
is the confidence
to surround yourself

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.620
with strong-minded people
who can argue and question

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.060
assumptions.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:21.230
And today the president
fired his attorney general.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.307
Well, Jeff Sessions
resigned, as he

00:46:23.307 --> 00:46:24.890
said in the letter,
"at your request."

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:25.290
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: I know.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.915
ROBIN YOUNG: Which
I think is a firing.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.860
Of course, this isn't the
first day after the midterms

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.840
where there's been a shakeup.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.570
But your sense of
another moment in time.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.160
There's nervousness now.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.970
Outside of the Saturday night
massacre in the Nixon era

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.690
investigations, your sense
of another time where people

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.370
were so worried that
a president might

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.640
try to derail the part
of government that

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.068
might be investigating him?

00:46:51.068 --> 00:46:52.610
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I mean, I think

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.560
the Nixon parallel is
the only one that I

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.900
know in our lifetime, again.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.500
But then again, when you think
about where the country was

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.280
at when Lincoln came
in, I mean, when

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.370
he got elected that first
night, he couldn't sleep.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.890
And he thought, I don't
have enough experience.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:13.010
I need people around me
who are stronger than me.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.920
And so he put his three chief
rivals into that cabinet,

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.080
knowing that they would
all think they should have

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.580
been president instead of him.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.200
So that's shoring yourself up.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.940
You have enough
confidence to know

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.050
you can put Sewards, Bates,
and Chase in, each one of whom

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.203
was better educated,
more celebrated than you.

00:47:29.203 --> 00:47:31.370
People said, you're going
to look like a figurehead.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:35.000
And he said, that's
not a problem, he said.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.010
The country is in peril.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.260
These are the strongest,
most able men in the country.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.830
I need them by my side.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:41.450
When President Trump
came in, he too

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.280
had little political experience.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.770
And there were lots of people
in the Republican Party

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.410
who had much more
experience than he had.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:50.630
But if they had been
never Trump people,

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.880
if they had said anything
against him before,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.500
he wasn't willing
to have them there.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.200
So it meant that there's been a
lot of shakeup in the cabinet,

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.780
in part because they haven't
had the experience either.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.610
But that's just the
opposite of Lincoln

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.050
being able to say,
I want these people,

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.480
even though they
were against me,

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.340
even though they've
said things against me.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.870
I will somehow forge
them into a team.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.300
And he was able to do that.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.515
ROBIN YOUNG: Yeah.

00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:15.990
Again, we're almost to the
questions from the audience.

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:21.860
You have mentioned your fabulous
late husband several times.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.820
And I know a lot of
people probably here--

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.040
we're a small town--
probably knew the two of you.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.150
Richard Goodwin.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.130
Extraordinary speechwriter.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:31.180
You had an incredible
life together.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.357
How are you doing?

00:48:32.357 --> 00:48:34.440
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Well,
it's really been hard.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.790
But the great thing is that
my kids have surrounded me.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.580
And I know that I had
42 years of marriage

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.440
with him and 45
years of knowing him.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.570
It was the adventure of a
lifetime to be with him.

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.450
He really was an
extraordinary person.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.880
And I can't imagine being
married to somebody else.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.640
And he handled the
last year of his life

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.388
so incredibly magnificently.

00:48:55.388 --> 00:48:57.180
It made me less afraid
of death, because he

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.680
kept wanting to live.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.330
There's no better
sign for somebody.

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.390
He was older than I am.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.610
He was 86 years old.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.110
And every day he
fought the cancer,

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:05.190
because he had a book to write.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.420
Because he loved his family.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.070
And he wanted to keep living.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.530
And it's the best tribute,
you can say, to a marriage,

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.500
and to him, that he wanted that.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.520
And I will finish his book.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.830
I mean, his book was
about his love affair

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.230
with America, the
ideals that he had

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:21.780
wanted to go into public
service with from the time he

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.740
was young.

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.830
So here he is graduating
from Harvard Law School,

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.235
first in his class,
has president

00:49:27.235 --> 00:49:29.360
of the law review, clerks
for justice, Frankfurter,

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.020
but decides I don't
want to go into law

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.780
and just move things around
from one place to another.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.680
He wanted to go
into public service.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.790
So at first he does the quiz
show investigation, which

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.810
undoes the $64,000 question.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.960
And then young John
Kennedy is looking

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.520
for a second speechwriter.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.320
And he becomes that
second speechwriter.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.840
And the adventure
of a lifetime to be

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.990
on that plane with John Kennedy
and Sorensen, and have Kennedy

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:53.170
win the election.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:55.380
And then he works on the
Alliance for Progress.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.720
And then eventually
he works for LBJ.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.300
And probably that was
the pinnacle of his life,

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.820
to be able to really not just
write speeches about the Great

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.570
Society, and about civil
rights, but to be helping

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.610
to plan those great programs.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.315
But then he has the courage,
when the Vietnam War was

00:50:11.315 --> 00:50:12.690
heating up, and
he saw the energy

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:14.970
being taken away from
the domestic program

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.300
to leave Lyndon Johnson.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.800
Lyndon Johnson said he would
draft him if he tried to leave.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.870
But, of course, he
was able to leave.

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.610
And it's very
important for us today

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.510
to see the contrast
between this and what's

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.510
happening with people who
know something's wrong

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.660
going on, when he left people
inside the administration

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.120
said, you know, Dick,
you're hurting your career.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.070
And at least if you leave
you should be quiet.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.180
Don't say anything.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.060
Because you'd be a traitor to
the administration if you did.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.430
But he became active in
the anti-war movement.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:42.270
And he said things.

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:45.998
And then some of the people in
the administration of LBJ said,

00:50:45.998 --> 00:50:47.040
you're cutting your ties.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.027
You're biting the
hand that feeds you.

00:50:49.027 --> 00:50:50.610
And then he said,
they didn't feed me.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.490
I fed myself.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.500
I mean, he had such
a sense of humor.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.490
And anyway, then he ends up
working with Bobby Kennedy,

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:59.250
and actually helped Bobby
Kennedy on his Ripples

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.410
for Hope speech, the
great South Africa speech.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.650
He was with Bobby Kennedy
when he died, and still

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:07.890
didn't give up on what politics
and public service meant.

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:11.370
With all of those sadnesses of
watching JFK, Bobby Kennedy,

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.200
Martin Luther King,
the book he was

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.842
writing talked about
the fact that he'd

00:51:14.842 --> 00:51:16.050
lived through the Depression.

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:17.820
He'd lived through World War II.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.560
He had lived through
all these events

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.060
that happened in the '60s.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:24.210
And yet, he still believed that
the ups and downs of America

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:26.220
was such that we would
get through this.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.620
One of the last lines was,
"America's not as fragile

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.580
as we think."

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.520
So it's that hope, I think,
that he gave to me, that I

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.980
think he gives to all of us.

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.760
And he was the best.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.830
And my son Joey is here.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:39.330
Oh, Joey.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.850
I'm supposed to
call you Joseph now.

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:41.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.965
Sorry.

00:51:43.965 --> 00:51:47.460
And Joe carried out that
tradition of public service.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.160
He graduated from
Harvard in '01.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.570
And when September
11th happened,

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:52.740
he volunteered for the army.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.470
And he was a platoon
leader in Baghdad,

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.360
and then went back
to Afghanistan.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.500
He earned a bronze star.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.358
And he would say,
and I would say too,

00:52:00.358 --> 00:52:02.400
that those were the proudest
moments of his life,

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.525
that he was able to bring
a combat troop to safety.

00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:07.411
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.490
So I've got Joe.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:15.940
And he and his wife had
a child this August,

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.040
a boy, which is being named
Alexander Richard Goodwin.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.590
So he's living on.

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.900
And my son Michael is a teacher
in our high school in Concord

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.550
where he and Joe went.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.100
And he and his two
children, who are 8 and 10,

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.500
have moved into my
house to live with me.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.880
So there's a whole
generation of the future.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.962
So my husband's alive still.

00:52:35.962 --> 00:52:37.670
ROBIN YOUNG: Well
Doris Kearns Goodwin, I

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:40.400
can't wait till you
finish Dick's book, A.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.010
And I wish I had been a
fly on the wall seeing him

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.380
in the past.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:52.910
After 2016 you said that Donald
Trump, as these other men did,

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.270
took advantage of
the media of the day.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.190
But I just wish I
could have been there

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.520
to see Dick saying, no,
the grammar's wrong.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.440
And it's just not--
responding to those tweets.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.470
Doris Kearns Goodwin.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:08.708
The book is Leadership.

00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:18.388
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:18.388 --> 00:53:21.958
And now, we have microphones
in the aisles as usual.

00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:24.000
And we're going to have
time for a few questions.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.720
If you have one, please make
your way to the microphone.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.460
I know it's intimidating.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:30.960
Yep.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.568
We have one over here.

00:53:32.568 --> 00:53:34.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Doris,
for all you've done for us.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:35.560
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Thank you.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.260
AUDIENCE: I still think your
best book is about the Brooklyn

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:37.760
Dodgers.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.637
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:41.037 --> 00:53:42.870
You've mentioned a
couple of the things that

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:44.760
have happened, unfortunately
in this country

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.050
the last couple of months.

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:50.880
But every week is a new
crisis made by the president.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.860
How do we avoid
forgetting about what

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.750
happened two weeks
ago when these

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:56.650
are such important events?

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:56.880
DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN: You know, I

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.963
think that's a really
important point you've made.

00:53:58.963 --> 00:54:01.650
Because of breaking news--

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:05.310
and think about what happened
three weeks ago with, not only

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.700
the bombing plot, but the
Jewish synagogue killings,

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.080
and what that meant about
anti-Semitism, the rise of it

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.050
in the country, and what we
have to do to combat that.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:16.950
We were mobilized.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:18.910
We were thinking we
were going to do that.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.790
And then the next thing happens.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.960
And now it's in the past.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.260
Or the killing of the
journalist, Khashoggi.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.760
And that was such
an important thing

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.850
that here's somebody who
represents the press.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.800
And the president's
able to talk about how

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.260
it's OK because Saudi
Arabia's giving us

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.810
money for the weapons.

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:37.440
And we have to
remember these things.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.840
We can't let the
breaking news let

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.150
us forget that there are
really tough moments that

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.180
are happening right
now in our country.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.920
And again, only we
can make it better.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.480
Only the citizens
can deal with this.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.897
ROBIN YOUNG: Well,
I was thinking,

00:54:49.897 --> 00:54:51.780
I mean, as a journalist
this is overwhelming.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.560
As an historian I hope you
have cards up everywhere,

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:56.250
three by fives.

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.190
But I was thinking of
the anonymous letter

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:03.810
to The New York Times about
how the president was being

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.240
controlled by people
who understood

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.360
that he could possibly run the
government into the ground.

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.740
Who mentions that anymore?

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.530
And we don't really
even know who that was.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:16.697
And it's probably forgotten.

00:55:16.697 --> 00:55:18.822
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: I
mean, I think you're right.

00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:20.100
There's an overload right now.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.030
And so one event just collapses
the memory of the other one.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.790
And we just have
to talk about than.

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.740
The most important
thing to talk about

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.557
is what it's saying about
some of the feelings that

00:55:32.557 --> 00:55:34.890
are in the country at large
right now, which we have to,

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.840
through education, begin.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.882
I mean, education
is still the key.

00:55:39.882 --> 00:55:42.090
And I know that it's so
important here at the Kennedy

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.610
Library to have civic education.

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:48.480
And we have to be able to
make citizens again feel

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.360
a sense of what the
ideals of the country are.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.960
Lincoln gave a speech
when he was 29 years old,

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.090
called the Lyceum speech.

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.013
And it's an extraordinary
speech in which

00:55:58.013 --> 00:55:59.430
he was worried
then that there was

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:00.840
mob violence in the country.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.790
The antislavery editors
were being killed.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.413
There were lynchings
in the south.

00:56:04.413 --> 00:56:06.205
And the rule of law
was not being followed.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.420
This is when we'll arise.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:15.290
Somebody who will be turning
America upside down who

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.920
might be a dictator in like a
Napoleon or a Julius Caesar.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.440
And the answer to
that in a democracy

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.330
is we have to make people
read about the ideals

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:25.080
of the Revolution.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.460
He said, he was afraid they were
fading because the Revolution

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.407
was now in the past.

00:56:30.407 --> 00:56:32.240
And unless those ideals
could be remembered,

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.030
what are we going to fight about
this authoritarian figure who's

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.990
rising with?

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:37.790
So he said, every
mother should be reading

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.070
the ideals of the
Revolution to their kids,

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:41.720
as if they were
reading the Bible.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:46.530
So again, that's my hope of
what history is, of memory is.

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:48.837
I mean, it's what the whole
Holocaust thing is about.

00:56:48.837 --> 00:56:50.420
When people talk
about the importance,

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.250
you have to remember
what happened.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.410
We have to remember
what's been happening.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.780
And we have to talk about
how that's not where

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.370
the ideals of this country are.

00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:59.300
And where is that gap?

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.460
And what can we do in education?

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.810
What can we do as citizens
to begin to close that gap?

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:06.422
ROBIN YOUNG: Another question.

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.880
AUDIENCE: Thank
you so much, Doris,

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.310
for your wonderful
insights tonight.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:13.550
You've accomplished
so much in your life.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:18.548
Could you share with us
the plans for your future?

00:57:18.548 --> 00:57:20.090
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
If I knew them,

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:22.760
boy, I'd tell you immediately.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.530
I'm not so sure, to be honest.

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.470
What I'm working on for a
little bit of time right now

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:29.630
is some movies.

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:31.130
Because it was such
an extraordinary

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:34.550
experience to work with
Steven Spielberg on the movie.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:36.230
There's something
about the camaraderie

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.840
of working on a movie, and
it happens somewhat quicker

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.580
than these long books do.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.130
So hopefully there's
a movie being made.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.470
It's in the early stages,
about Ida Tarbell,

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:48.740
the great female
journalist who was

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.470
able to bring down
Standard Oil, and to talk

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.557
about the corruption
of Standard Oil

00:57:53.557 --> 00:57:54.890
at the turn of the 20th century.

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:56.570
And she's a wonderful figure.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:58.970
And there's a possibility
I'm working with the History

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:02.168
Channel on a documentary on
George Washington, about which

00:58:02.168 --> 00:58:02.960
I know very little.

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.210
But that's why it'll be so
much fun to be a consultant

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:06.560
so I can learn about that.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.002
But I'd love to find a woman
that I could write about.

00:58:10.002 --> 00:58:11.960
It may not be a woman
president, given that I'm

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.310
getting older and older.

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:16.550
But I loved working
on Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.560
I mean, that was
such a great pleasure

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.127
of the book on
Franklin and Eleanor,

00:58:20.127 --> 00:58:22.460
that if I could find another
woman to write about, maybe

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:25.700
not in politics, but in some
field, it would give me,

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.200
as a woman, I think,
such pleasure.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.790
I mean, just
knowing what Eleanor

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:31.010
was able to do during that
period of time, I mean,

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:34.010
she really spoke
truth to her husband.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.620
I mean, he said she was a
welcome thorn in his side,

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.460
always willing to
question his assumptions.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.890
In fact, much like
we said, she's

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:43.220
the strong-minded person who
was able to argue with him.

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.230
She sent so many memos
to General Marshall

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.540
about discrimination
in the army that he

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.060
had to assign a separate general
whose only task was to deal

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.310
with Eleanor Roosevelt's memos.

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:53.690
She had a weekly
press conference

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:55.430
where only female
reporters could come.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:56.960
So all over the
country, publishers

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.020
had to hire their
first female reporters.

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.800
An entire generation
gets their start

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.570
because of Eleanor
Roosevelt. I'd

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:05.090
love to find that kind of woman
and write a biography that's

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:07.110
not 1,000 pages long.

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:10.130
The Bully Pulpit was so long
that a woman told me that,

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:13.020
in fact, that she was reading it
when she went to bed at night.

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.840
And she fell asleep
and it broke her nose.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:19.802
So somewhere along the way, I'll
find that woman to write about.

00:59:19.802 --> 00:59:21.260
AUDIENCE: Thank
you so much, Doris.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.030
We'll be looking forward to
those future accomplishments.

00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.363
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Thank you.

00:59:24.363 --> 00:59:26.200
ROBIN YOUNG: A
question over here.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:33.720
AUDIENCE: You suggested
that people who are Trumpers

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.020
support him because
they have lost something

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.000
or they fear for the future.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.240
But I can't find it
in my heart to think

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.170
that those people who believe
in him and who support him

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:50.730
are worth talking to, that
we have anything in common,

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:55.860
that there's anything that could
bridge the divide between us.

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.140
Could you give me
some inspiration

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.500
to want to become friends
again with people I've

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.870
walked away from because of it?

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:06.000
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: I
mean, I think we have to.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.250
We have to understand
that people

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.220
who saw their livelihood
going away because the coal

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:17.520
mines were collapsing, or
the globalization of the tech

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.190
revolution had taken
away safe jobs that they

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.570
had in machinery.

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.190
They've seen their
kids not having

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.200
an educational
system that's really

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.380
been able to support them.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.797
They've seen a lot of their
kids, and not just their kids,

01:00:28.797 --> 01:00:30.870
but going into
opioids as a result.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.900
They've watched communities
that have diminished

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.830
in their flourishing vitality
because the jobs have

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:39.630
moved somewhere else.

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:41.520
And when you're
in that situation,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.330
the sad thing is, the answer
is not to do what's being done,

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.880
to scapegoat other people
for your problems, which

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.560
is the voice that
Trump has given them.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.310
It's the immigrants
that are the problems.

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:53.460
It's these people abroad.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.590
Instead of really
talking about the fact

01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:57.370
the educational system
has failed them.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.680
Mobility has failed them.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.820
That plenty of America has not
been distributed fairly to them

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.430
in terms of what they
get out of the system.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.400
And I think we have to
feel empathy for them.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.760
There's a reason why they are
feeling what they're feeling.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.370
And they're human
beings, like us.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.990
And there's no other
hope than to think.

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:18.990
I mean, that's why that
book Hillbilly Elegy was

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:22.950
so well read, I think, because
it made people understand.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.240
And we have to understand.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.490
Just like you had
to understand--

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:30.110
I mean, the scary thing
that's happening right now--

01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.860
this will go against
what I'm just saying,

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.430
but it's different from it.

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:36.660
I saw a statistic the other
day that more people now

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.220
are worried about
their kid marrying

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.640
outside the party
than about religion.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.920
AUDIENCE: I would be.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.110
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
But that's why I think,

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:50.880
if only we could figure
out ways for these people

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.190
and what they're feeling
to be understood.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.670
And I think that's where
journalism has to come in.

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.230
It's where television
has to come in,

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.120
where movies have to
come in, and where

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.980
people have to go to these
places and talk to people.

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.860
I mean, I was in West
Virginia the other day,

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.900
and was talking to a
person whose father was

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.820
in the coal mining
industry, and who

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.830
felt that that was their life.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.460
They loved it.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.400
Whatever was happening
to their black lungs,

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.380
it was their way of life
that was taken away.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.153
And they believed somehow that
it was going to come back.

01:02:22.153 --> 01:02:23.820
And I said, but it
hasn't come back yet.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.750
He said, oh, no.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:26.160
There's a coal plant over there.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.600
And there's machine shops
that are building around it.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.850
And I don't think that's true.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.100
But that desire
to have it becomes

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.390
reality for some people.

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.380
ROBIN YOUNG: Well, I think, too,
if I might just add just some

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.030
of my observations.

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:36.144
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Sure.

01:02:36.144 --> 01:02:36.570
Please do.

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.195
ROBIN YOUNG: Out on
the campaign trail.

01:02:38.195 --> 01:02:40.320
We all know that
there are people

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.620
who very much support Donald
Trump who fit that profile.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.665
And I've met them on the trail.

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:50.040
But there are also
people who are

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.680
very well off who are
doing quite well who

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.520
also support Donald Trump.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.930
And that's where I feel-- and
this is in my conversations--

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:01.410
that this is the
other thing that you

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.470
can have some empathy
for, but also progressives

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.790
can have some pride with.

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.320
It is because there has
been so much change.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.270
There are a lot of people who
it's just almost it's a lot.

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:16.740
And they just either
can't accept it,

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.920
or don't know how they
fit in, feel outside of,

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.042
don't feel like they're in that
cool crowd of progressives,

01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:26.250
however that looks to them,
on late night television.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:30.390
And all of our culture is
occupied, you'd have to say,

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.738
by largely progressives.

01:03:31.738 --> 01:03:34.030
And there are people, it's
not that they're in poverty.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:36.150
It's not that they're
losing their jobs.

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:39.570
It's that they're afraid they
don't know where they fit.

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:40.910
I have felt that a lot.

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:44.760
And yes, I think we
have to be empathic.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.790
I think we have to
start conversations

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.340
across the divide.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.872
But that is kind of a tribute
to how much change there's been.

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.080
And they're anxious about it.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.420
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I think that's right.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:56.500
ROBIN YOUNG: Yes.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.480
Over here.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you both
you ladies for being here.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.050
Doris, put aside a
second the question

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.270
of what you would
ask President Trump.

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:11.861
If you had a chance what would
you ask each of your four guys?

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:22.120
Maybe in regards to how
they shaped our lives today,

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.525
or maybe making
it better for us.

01:04:25.525 --> 01:04:26.650
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Yeah.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.650
I think if I just take Lyndon
Johnson then, for example,

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:32.530
I mean, I had the chance to be
with him in those last years

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:33.640
of his life.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.980
So I was able to
talk to him even then

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.960
about the war in Vietnam.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.340
And even though he wasn't
able to acknowledge

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:45.070
that he had made a mistake,
because it was too hard to say

01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:47.980
you made a mistake and
50,000 people have died,

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:51.220
he understood that the war had
undercut the thing he cared

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.510
about most, the Great Society.

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:56.290
And he knew that I'd been
involved against the war.

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:59.260
In fact, when I won the
White House fellowship

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.090
we had a dance at
the White House.

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:02.260
And he did dance with me.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.130
Not that peculiar.

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:05.830
There were only three women out
of the 16 White House fellows.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.668
But it turned out
that prior to my

01:05:08.668 --> 01:05:10.210
being chosen as a
White House fellow,

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.752
I'd been active as
a graduate student

01:05:11.752 --> 01:05:13.820
at Harvard in the
anti-war movement,

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.820
and had written an article
with a friend of mine

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.362
that we'd sent into
The New Republic,

01:05:17.362 --> 01:05:19.030
hearing nothing
until it came out

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.640
two days after the dance in
the White House with the title,

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.660
"How to Remove Lyndon
Johnson From Power."

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.105
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:25.105 --> 01:05:26.980
But instead of kicking
me out of the program,

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.813
he said I'll bring her
down here for a year.

01:05:28.813 --> 01:05:30.640
And if I can't win
her over, no one can.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.470
So I did have that
chance to talk

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.668
to him about why he thought
the war was so important.

01:05:35.668 --> 01:05:37.210
It was different
from what I thought.

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:39.910
He thought really the domino
theory meant something.

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:41.770
But it meant a lot
to at least hear

01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:43.888
his point of view about that.

01:05:43.888 --> 01:05:45.430
So that's what I
would have asked him

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.230
if I hadn't been able to
talk to him about the war.

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:50.260
And there was such
a sense of knowing

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.850
that if ever he were
to be remembered,

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.620
it would be for civil rights.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.510
And I think I'd
like him to know now

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.030
when you say what would
you want him to know,

01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:00.280
I'd like him to know now
which his children know

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.310
but he never got to know that
the foundations of so much

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:07.665
of our modern life were set in
those years in 1964 and '65.

01:06:07.665 --> 01:06:08.290
Think about it.

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:09.880
Medicare.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.050
Medicare.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:11.620
Medicaid.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.120
Aid to education.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:13.840
Civil rights.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.560
Voting rights.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.430
Fair housing.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.630
Immigration reform.

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:17.170
NPR.

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:18.055
PBS.

01:06:18.055 --> 01:06:18.805
It's unbelievable.

01:06:18.805 --> 01:06:19.860
Head Start.

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.150
What a part of our lives
those programs are.

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:24.940
And he deserves to
have that remembered.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.590
And it finally is
being remembered,

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:29.470
even though the war will
always be a challenge to him.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:30.970
AUDIENCE: And what about the
other three, just quickly?

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:31.810
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well, I think with Lincoln,

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:33.727
I know I'm supposed to
ask him if I were going

01:06:33.727 --> 01:06:35.977
to meet with him, what would
you have done differently

01:06:35.977 --> 01:06:36.940
about Reconstruction?

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.703
That's the great
historian's question.

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.870
But I think if I met with
him, I'd just say, please,

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:42.400
tell me a story Mr. Lincoln.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.630
Cause then you'll come alive.

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.090
Your whole face will come alive.

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:45.640
AUDIENCE: That's good.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.300
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
With Teddy, I

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.310
think I'd probably
want to ask him,

01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.350
if you had to do it
over again, would you

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:53.050
decide not to run against your
great friend, William Howard

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:56.500
Taft, in 1912, which splits
the Progressive Party in two

01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.100
and allows Woodrow Wilson
to win the election?

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.830
And then if you hadn't
run against Taft then,

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:04.930
if you'd only been
able to wait longer,

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.390
you probably would have
been able to run in 1916,

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.160
and probably would
have been elected.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.610
And how do you feel
about that now?

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.390
And I suppose with
FDR, you'd want

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.400
to still ask about
the two things that

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.610
are the hardest part of his
legacy, the incarceration

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:20.920
of the Japanese-Americans,
and not bringing more

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.050
Jewish refugees into the
country before Hitler

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:24.610
closed the door forever.

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:27.040
And you'd want to
try and understand

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.433
why were those failures there?

01:07:29.433 --> 01:07:31.600
But then, on the other hand,
you'd want him to know,

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.490
the New Deal still exists.

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:36.040
So I'd balance it if I
was going to talk to them.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.660
First I'd talk about
the bad things.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:37.870
No!

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.412
First I'd talk about
the good things.

01:07:39.412 --> 01:07:41.050
And then I'd talk
about the bad things.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:42.340
AUDIENCE: Thank
you so much, Doris.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.562
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Thank
you for that question.

01:07:43.562 --> 01:07:44.895
ROBIN YOUNG: Question over here.

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:46.328
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:46.870
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:47.810
Thank you very much.

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.480
It's an honor to hear you speak.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.060
So given the climate
that we're in today,

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.740
I don't want to ask
you who you think

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.540
has the best chance to
challenge President Trump.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.000
But what are the
qualities that you

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.680
think have to come
through, based

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.700
on your research as a historian?

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.170
And how would you advise
candidates to best present

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.470
those qualities?

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:07.928
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well, I think

01:08:07.928 --> 01:08:10.750
there's a good reason why
the campaign of Beto O'Rourke

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:13.330
captured the imagination
of the country.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:18.279
Because he decided to go to
every single district in Texas.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:19.630
He had a progressive message.

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:20.979
He didn't change it.

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.979
He got money from small amounts
of money at the beginning.

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:26.800
And there was something
about his authenticity

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.470
that captured the
imagination of the people.

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:31.390
And I keep thinking
about the fact

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:35.680
that there was a person in
another midterm election

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.840
who lost a senate race.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.029
And that was Abraham
Lincoln in 1858.

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:43.330
But because of the debates
with Stephen Douglas,

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:46.000
he too had captured the
imagination of the country.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.390
He had shown that he could hold
his own more than anything.

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:50.640
Those debates were amazing.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.229
I mean, you think about them,
they were six hours long.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.642
There would be thousands
of people there.

01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:57.100
They would be part
of the audience.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.677
They'd be yelling
in, hit him again!

01:08:58.677 --> 01:08:59.260
Hit him again!

01:08:59.260 --> 01:08:59.740
Harder!

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.240
Harder!

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.510
They'd be all part of it.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:03.362
And the debates
got pamphletized.

01:09:03.362 --> 01:09:04.779
They were sent
around the country.

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:06.970
So he became a figure,
even though he'd

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.350
lost that senate race.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.300
So I don't know whether
it's Beto O'Rourke.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.810
All I know is that
nobody knew in 1858 yet

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.029
that Lincoln would
become Abraham Lincoln.

01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:17.380
There's somebody out there.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.190
It may be a mayor.

01:09:18.190 --> 01:09:19.720
It may be a city councilman.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.475
It may be some young
person who's lost the race.

01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:24.100
Some of the people
who lost these races

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.670
were extraordinary people.

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:27.490
And as you said
earlier, Robin, they

01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:29.590
ran really close
races in red states

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:31.210
where it wasn't seen to be.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:33.279
So the unexpected may happen.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.640
And that person will be there.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.029
But I think those
qualities of believing

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:40.180
in what you're saying,
and what Johnson would say

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.279
is, what convinces
is conviction.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.548
So he believed in that
cause of progressivism.

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:46.840
He didn't have to change it
when he went from one place

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.740
to another.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.620
And that people respected
that, I think, as it happened.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:55.000
And he worked like hell to
make this thing possible.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.640
And so whether it's
him or somebody else

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.250
out there, whether it's one
of the new people coming in.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:04.000
There's a teacher of the year,
just for the long future, who

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.560
is coming in from Connecticut.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.140
First time running.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.940
There's so many
people first time

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.350
running who made it this time.

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:14.560
And I think we may
have to just look

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.082
for a new generation
of people coming

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.540
in for the long
term that are going

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.250
to break this fever that's
in Washington right now.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.458
ROBIN YOUNG: I was going to
make a lame Massachusetts

01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:24.875
joke that some
people in this room

01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:26.500
were hoping you would
say the qualities

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.160
of a presidential candidate
would be, she's a senator--

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.117
You set with your--

01:10:37.117 --> 01:10:37.700
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.130
Very much.

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.088
ROBIN YOUNG: Thank you.

01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:39.620
Over here.

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:42.080
AUDIENCE: My question
is somewhat like hers.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.880
This country's been
blessed over the years

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.130
to have extraordinary
people come along

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.380
during very troubled times.

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:51.335
And I'm wondering under
the circumstances of today,

01:10:51.335 --> 01:10:56.840
the extreme diversity, the
way politics runs itself,

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.700
is there someone out
there that could do this?

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.030
Or do you think
something else might

01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:07.020
be the spark that
brings us back more

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.660
towards where we used to be?

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.077
DORIS KEARNS
GOODWIN: Well, we got

01:11:10.077 --> 01:11:12.280
to hope that the spark is
not some military crisis.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.910
Cause crises from abroad
sometimes do bring us together.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:18.460
But that's why I keep
thinking that somehow we

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.320
do have a crisis right
now in the country.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.690
The crisis is that our
political system is not working.

01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:26.800
I mean, it's not working
to produce any kind

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.290
of collaboration in Washington.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:30.190
It's not working to
solve the problems that

01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:32.380
are real problems
that are out there.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.930
And to the extent
that it's a crisis,

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:36.980
that usually does
produce people.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.440
So far we've seen that happen.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.910
You're right.

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:43.030
And the interesting thing
is, each one of these four

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:44.890
presidents that I've
studied might not

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:47.320
have been the right
person for the other time.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.817
And when you have a crisis
and you have an opportunity,

01:11:49.817 --> 01:11:51.400
it doesn't mean
you're going to always

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.810
have the right person there.

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.910
I mean, Buchanan was
there before Lincoln

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:57.230
when the country was
already splitting apart.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.110
And yet, he escalated
the divisions

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:00.470
before Lincoln came along.

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:02.620
In fact, Buchanan
used to be the lowest

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.020
on the presidential
historians' polls.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.150
And in the latest
presidential historian poll

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:09.730
a few months ago, he
was no longer the last,

01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:11.660
because President Trump
was at the bottom.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.480
So there was a story
in the newspapers

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.500
that the Buchanan family
ancestors were celebrating.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.800
He was no longer at the bottom.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:21.280
Or think about Herbert
Hoover, the president

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.740
was there when the
Depression had started.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.240
And he was a decent, good man.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.500
But his ideology could
not allow himself

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.250
to believe that the
federal government had

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:34.780
to step in to deal with the
jobs, to unrig the system.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:37.400
And so he was then undone.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.020
And FDR was the right person
with that contagious optimism.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.200
So we have had those
people at the right times

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.515
at the right places.

01:12:45.515 --> 01:12:46.390
And it's interesting.

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:48.280
Teddy Roosevelt
said it one time.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.053
"Can you really be a great
president without a war?"

01:12:51.053 --> 01:12:53.470
Thinking that you needed what
your question is suggesting,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.720
a crisis to mobilize
people around.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.030
But he understood
the hidden crisis

01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:00.465
of the time, which was
the inequalities created

01:13:00.465 --> 01:13:02.590
by the Industrial Revolution,
and the big companies

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.042
swallowing up small companies.

01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:05.000
And he dealt with that.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.140
And that's why he's in the top
of those presidential ranks.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.130
So yes.

01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.350
I do still think there's
got to be somebody

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:12.880
who can bridge those gaps.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.480
It's not somebody, whether
the person's black, or white,

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.150
or Native American, or
whatever they come from.

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:22.780
It's that human quality that
they can contain other people

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.480
within themselves, and that
they can empathetically

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.030
look at the country, and
somehow make the country

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.700
feel that we want to be
common citizens again.

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.280
We want to believe that
we're moving forward.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.780
And there's lots
of stuff that still

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.030
has to happen in this country.

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:37.390
As I say, education.

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:41.548
I mean one of the great
things that's happening--

01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:45.790
our teachers more.

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:47.912
The fact that we don't
give them higher salaries.

01:13:47.912 --> 01:13:49.870
The fact that we don't
value what they're doing

01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:51.880
with our citizens is crazy.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.980
And the educational
system is at the bottom.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:57.230
That's what Lincoln believed,
that the educational system was

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.410
critical toward a democracy.

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:01.120
So we have so much
to do in education.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.150
We have so much to
do in economics.

01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:05.680
There's problems
that are out there.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.170
We have so much to do to
bring the immigrant situation

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.710
to a citizenship
that we need to do.

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.260
Those real problems,
somebody's going

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.218
to talk about the real
problems in a way that's

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:17.440
authentic, and unexpected.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.970
So someone's out there.

01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:19.630
I promise.

01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:20.500
Maybe they're here.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.413
Maybe it's one of you guys.

01:14:22.413 --> 01:14:24.580
ROBIN YOUNG: I think we
have time for the last three

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.010
questioners, who are
here, if we're concise.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.950
AUDIENCE: I will be concise.

01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:30.790
Thank you so much.

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:32.650
In my opinion, you're
an icon in terms

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:34.345
of historical perspective.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:35.470
I mean, you write about it.

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:36.200
You've lived it.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.367
And thank you for giving
us some hope in a time that

01:14:38.367 --> 01:14:41.080
sometimes seems like despair.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.650
The first question's
an easy one.

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:43.150
I have two.

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:44.462
They'll be quick.

01:14:44.462 --> 01:14:45.670
I know you're a baseball fan.

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:46.962
So how do you like our Red Sox?

01:14:46.962 --> 01:14:49.630
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Oh, I'll tell you.

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:52.180
It made this summer
so extraordinary.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:56.700
I mean, again, look
at what sports does.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.590
Sports combines people
across party lines,

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:01.960
across racial lines.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.910
It's a common thing
that people can

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:06.340
talk about that connects them.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.500
It combines people in families.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.510
Certainly my own love
of sports occurred

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.730
because my father
taught me to keep score

01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:14.728
when I was only six years
old so I could record

01:15:14.728 --> 01:15:17.020
for him the history of that
afternoon's Brooklyn Dodger

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:17.710
game.

01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:19.330
So when this World
Series came, it

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:21.940
was my first love, the
Brooklyn Dodgers, and then

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.680
my enduring love, the Red Sox.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.650
So the only thing it
made me think about was I

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:28.330
sort of felt empathy
for the people

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:31.510
in Los Angeles who hadn't
had a World Series victory,

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:34.270
only to the point where I
hoped it would go seven games,

01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:36.880
and then the Red Sox would
win in the ninth inning

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.020
of the seventh game.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.450
But what an extraordinary
thing it is.

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:41.660
I mean, that team.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.670
I still haven't gotten into my
head that in the 21st century

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.590
we've won four championships.

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:50.267
There's still that old
lingering feeling of we're

01:15:50.267 --> 01:15:52.350
going to screw it up in
the end, because we always

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:53.120
did that before.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.745
And that's what I
was beginning to feel

01:15:54.745 --> 01:15:55.960
in September and October.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.870
I don't know that anything
will ever counter, however,

01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:00.970
what it felt like in 2004.

01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:02.195
After all those years.

01:16:02.195 --> 01:16:03.820
I remember in one of
the playoff games,

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.230
when we lost the year before,
and some old guy stood up.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.360
And we're all so desolate.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.153
And he just says, year,
after year, after year.

01:16:10.153 --> 01:16:11.320
And we all started laughing.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.570
We felt this sense
of connection.

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.098
But it's a nicer
thing when you win,

01:16:15.098 --> 01:16:17.140
rather than when you lose
to feel the connection.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.480
So it's great, the Red Sox,
what they've done for us.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.647
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.450
This question's a
little bit deeper.

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:27.850
We are going through,
as we've all mentioned,

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:29.080
some very difficult times.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.270
We have a president that, after
the shootings in Pittsburgh

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:38.890
where 11 people were massacred,
and then 14 bombs were

01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:42.760
distributed, which could have
killed two former presidents,

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.890
as well as several
people around them,

01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:46.600
we have a president
that was upset

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.165
because it broke his
momentum during the election.

01:16:49.165 --> 01:16:51.040
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
And he said that aloud.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.855
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:16:52.855 --> 01:16:55.500
He also considers
himself a nationalist.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:58.030
And we are also facing,
I think, in the world--

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.130
we have countries like
Italy that are going

01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:03.330
through populist revolutions.

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:05.860
And, again, I've, of course,
read all of your books.

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:08.290
But I just finished
Madeleine Albright's book,

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.940
Beware of Fascism.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.910
And it appears that
not only domestically,

01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:14.800
because our president
has alienated

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.170
so many of our partners
around the world,

01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:19.810
but internationally
there are undercurrents

01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:23.950
of what might have happened
before World War II.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:25.570
What do you think,
or how close do

01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:29.890
you think we are, as
a world, approaching

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:31.420
a catastrophic event?

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.790
And what has to happen
in the United States

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:38.305
for us to pull back our civility
and come to the middle again?

01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:39.430
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Yeah.

01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:43.300
I mean, I do think that when
you see echoes of what's

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.640
happening here in
other countries,

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.780
there's some awareness that
there hasn't been attention

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:54.280
in any of those other
countries to distributing

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.740
the wealth and the
power of the country

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.450
to large numbers of people.

01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:00.580
Again, all those countries
have these huge gaps

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.607
between the rich and the poor.

01:18:02.607 --> 01:18:04.690
And I just keep thinking
about, there was a moment

01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.820
after the wall fell
when I remember

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.370
there was an article in Time
magazine about how democracy is

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:10.890
spreading all around the world.

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:12.730
It was one of those
halcyon moments,

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:16.000
where you felt that somehow
democracy was on the rise,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.190
and that authoritarian
governments like the Soviet

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:19.970
Union were breaking apart.

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:21.790
And now it feels
the opposite way

01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:23.860
through the world as a whole.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.330
And maybe it does have something
to do with globalization.

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:28.330
Maybe it does have something
with big companies.

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:31.540
Maybe it does have something
to do with that the people have

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.240
not been able to get the
fruits of the prosperity

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.400
of their nation.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.420
But I guess in the
end, the ultimate check

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:43.060
on any of that are the people.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.610
I mean, we were
worried about where's

01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:47.560
the check for the
Congress, and the Supreme

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.030
Court, and the presidency?

01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:50.890
Well, now there is a
check that's in place.

01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:53.890
We've made the first check with
the House of Representatives.

01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:56.500
And, in the end, if
the people themselves

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.870
begin to really think
through what we've all

01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:02.200
been talking about tonight, I
think the overwhelming majority

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.950
of the people, they don't
want to see immigrants undone.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.480
They don't want
to see the things

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.650
that we're talking about.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:11.920
They really want to have a
solution to these problems.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.598
They want to see
healing division.

01:19:13.598 --> 01:19:15.140
They don't want this
to be happening,

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.110
this increasing polarization.

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:18.970
So we just have to find answers.

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:20.320
And maybe the answers are small.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.300
And maybe it's going
to start in the states

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.340
before it goes to the
federal government.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:27.070
I mean, the states used to be
the laboratories of democracy

01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:28.240
in the progressive era.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.640
So now they're going
to have to be fighting

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.720
against what's going on.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.272
And they have to
be changing laws

01:19:33.272 --> 01:19:34.480
in the cities and the states.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.280
There's problems in
each one of those areas.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.200
That somehow there's
less divisiveness in some

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.740
of those local areas.

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.470
But we just have to just
take it one step at a time.

01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:44.980
And one step was taken.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.590
Or maybe many steps
were taken yesterday,

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:49.910
not only in the House,
but I think, as I say,

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:51.893
in people still willing
to enter public life,

01:19:51.893 --> 01:19:54.310
knowing what it's about, knowing
that your private life is

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:55.030
going to be exposed.

01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:56.447
You don't even
have to raise money

01:19:56.447 --> 01:19:58.630
too much, knowing that
it hasn't been very

01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:59.950
fulfilling for many people.

01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:01.690
But they still
wanted to come in,

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:03.040
and they wanted to change it.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.680
So those are the moments
that we have to take.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.070
There's no other choice but us
to take the sense of positivity

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.632
and move it forward
step by step.

01:20:10.632 --> 01:20:12.340
And hopefully people
in other countries--

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:12.880
Brexit.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.673
All these things
are echoing here.

01:20:14.673 --> 01:20:16.840
They've got to do it in
their own countries as well.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.452
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

01:20:18.452 --> 01:20:21.946
ROBIN YOUNG: And we
have two last questions.

01:20:21.946 --> 01:20:25.690
AUDIENCE: It's just a follow
up question on the Vietnam War.

01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:27.350
I've watched the
Ken Burns series,

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:32.530
and also read the John Lawrence
book, The Cat From Hue.

01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:34.990
But at so many junctions
LBJ could have pulled us out

01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.660
of that war.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.755
And it was so evident it
was an unwinnable war.

01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:40.630
What do you think was
going through his mind?

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:46.780
And why didn't he exit us
from that terrible tragedy

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.740
when he had so many
opportunities to do it?

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:48.960
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: Yeah.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.668
I mean, the really
sad thing is that when

01:20:50.668 --> 01:20:53.570
you hear the tapes, those
tapes that are now published

01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:57.620
of his conversations
in early '63, '64, he

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.960
himself was wondering what
are we doing over there?

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.970
It wasn't that he
was a person who

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:05.840
saw a vision of our
being able to succeed

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.830
in any way over there.

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:10.070
It was that he didn't want to
fail, so that he's presented

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:13.400
with a situation, if you
don't send this many troops,

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.180
then it looks like
it's going to be lost.

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.360
And that'll mean the
Democratic Party has lost,

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.680
just like they lost China.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.930
And it's going to be a
terrible thing for the country.

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:22.460
It'll be a failure for you.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:26.090
So when your whole leadership
is based on not losing,

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:27.640
rather than what
are we doing there?

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.430
What's the vision?

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:30.500
What could be the victory there?

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.990
Then you just keep escalating
the troops, little by little,

01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.950
as he did.

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:36.500
And worse than that, you
don't tell the public

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.880
exactly what you're doing.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.100
So you put in the
extra appropriations.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.620
You don't have a new tax
that you should have.

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:44.360
You don't call up the reserves.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.945
But then there were
consequences then.

01:21:45.945 --> 01:21:47.570
I mean, the fact that
he wasn't telling

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:50.960
the truth about the war, that
he was presenting it as better

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:55.170
than it really was, that's what
led to his loss of credibility,

01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:56.300
the credibility gap.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.610
It led to his having to
resign from the decision

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:00.573
to run again in 1968.

01:22:00.573 --> 01:22:02.990
So there were consequences for
that kind of action before.

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:04.910
That's what's the
contrast with today.

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:07.670
There have to be consequences
for what's going on.

01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:10.500
But I think all it was just
an epic failure of leadership.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.750
He was so good domestically.

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:13.998
He wasn't comfortable
in foreign policy.

01:22:13.998 --> 01:22:16.040
He thought if he could
bring a Mekong River Delta

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.960
project to Ho Chi Minh that he'd
be willing to bargain his way,

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.590
and somehow end the war
because of the goodness

01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:26.530
that we'd bring, like he brought
electricity to rural Texas.

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:28.160
He just wasn't suited for that.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.620
And then put in
a situation where

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.860
it meant possible failure,
he kept going forward.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:36.020
It would have been hard
for anybody to pull out.

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.437
I mean, that has
to be understood.

01:22:37.437 --> 01:22:39.620
I mean, it would
have meant possibly

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.680
a lot of recriminations, because
we would have seemed to be--

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.540
But it might not have even
meant a loss earlier on,

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.917
like it finally became anyway.

01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:47.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.730
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: So it's a
very sad moment in our history.

01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:51.397
And it's important
to remember that too,

01:22:51.397 --> 01:22:54.860
just to teach us what we're
doing in foreign policy

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.273
right now.

01:22:56.273 --> 01:22:57.940
AUDIENCE: And we have
one last question.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.150
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
The final question.

01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:01.360
Dum da dum dum.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.210
AUDIENCE: I just want to take
you away from Donald Trump,

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:07.738
and go back to 1947 where you
were a young girl in Brooklyn.

01:23:07.738 --> 01:23:08.780
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN: OK!

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.835
AUDIENCE: And you
wrote your first book,

01:23:10.835 --> 01:23:13.460
and told your dad that you were
going out with your girlfriends

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.570
for the night.

01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:15.610
And you got home late.

01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:17.745
And your dad says,
where were you?

01:23:17.745 --> 01:23:21.230
And you say, dad, I've
got a confession to make.

01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:23.500
I know I'm not supposed to
go to a Protestant Church.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.160
But he says Jackie Robinson
and Roy Campanella were down

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.580
at the Baptist
church and I went.

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:30.760
And he says, why the
hell didn't you tell me?

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.598
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:32.598 --> 01:23:34.015
ROBIN YOUNG: That's
a great story.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.210
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
In fact, let me end.

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:44.080
I'm so glad you let us end on
a note other than Mr. Trump

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.080
right now, because
we need to just enjoy

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.990
something else about ourselves.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.820
So the fact that I was
brought up as a Catholic

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:54.760
did conflict with my love
for the Brooklyn Dodgers,

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.250
not only because I had to go
into this Protestant Church

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.800
and was afraid that
I might be giving up

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.920
the life of my everlasting
soul for this one night

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.600
to see a Brooklyn Dodger person.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.480
And as I crossed
the threshold, I

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.430
thought maybe this
is what I'm doing.

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:10.990
So I thought I had
to confess this

01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:14.468
in my first holy confession
when I went to get my communion.

01:24:14.468 --> 01:24:16.510
So I told the priest that
I'd done this, that I'd

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.390
gone to this Protestant Church.

01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:20.250
And it wasn't a problem.

01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:21.840
We were sitting
on folding chairs.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.702
It was talking
about sportsmanship.

01:24:23.702 --> 01:24:25.160
It had nothing to
do with religion.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.680
So it's not a sin, he tells me.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.767
But then he said, and
what else, my child?

01:24:28.767 --> 01:24:30.850
And then I had to confess
another sin that related

01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:32.380
to the Brooklyn Dodgers.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.260
So I tried to hide it in between
talking too much in church,

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.683
wishing harm on others,
being mean to my sister.

01:24:37.683 --> 01:24:39.100
And unfortunately
the priest said,

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.540
to whom did you wish harm?

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.240
And I had to admit that I wished
that various New York Yankee

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.550
players could break their
arms, legs, and ankles

01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:47.950
so that the Brooklyn Dodgers
could win their first World

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:48.670
Series.

01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:51.280
So he said, how often do you
make these horrible wishes?

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.670
Every night, I said,
when I say my prayer.

01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:55.930
So he said, look, let
me tell you something.

01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:57.320
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers too.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.470
And I promise you, you don't
need to wish harm on others

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:00.220
to make it happen.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.385
It will happen someday.

01:25:01.385 --> 01:25:03.010
Then he made me say
a bunch of prayers.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.135
And then as I left the
confessional booth, he said,

01:25:05.135 --> 01:25:07.240
say a special prayer for
our Brooklyn Dodgers.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.920
How lucky that my
first confession was

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.087
to a baseball loving priest.

01:25:10.087 --> 01:25:12.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:18.560
ROBIN YOUNG: Look, I
will only add to that.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.350
I'm looking at this list of
all the leadership traits.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:23.420
And they are an ability
to go through loss.

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:23.930
Empathy.

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:24.640
Resilience.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.180
A confidence to
surround yourself

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.950
with people who
will question you.

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:30.920
Controlling impulses
and negative emotions.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.200
Ambition for self ambition
for the greater good.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.200
And I'm thinking, this
can apply to all of us.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.370
We don't wait for a leader.

01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:40.540
I think, as Americans,
we have to reach a--
