00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.820
When I make a video, I normally ask a question and have a pretty good idea -

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.620
- of where that question is going to take me.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.140
This one is way different.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.420
We're going to start in a weight room and we are going to end up deep in the bowels

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.860
of Johnson Space Center, where we meet a lady who literally burns astronaut pee.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.560
We all know in space if an astronaut sits around he is going to lose muscle mass

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.300
But Earth is different
When I lift this weight, it's actually weight

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.120
So here is my question, how do astronauts lift weights in space?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.820
To learn the answer to this, lets go talk to astronauts Don Pettit and Mike Hopkins

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.580
It doesn't look like you've been lifting quite as much as this man over here

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.980
I'm Destin
Hi Destin, I'm Mike
Mike, nice to meet you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.860
And Mike, you're an expert at working out in space right?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.760
Well I've spent some time working out here on Earth, and, ah, I just took that to space with me

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.320
You take people like Mike and I
(Destin) Studs, lets be clear, studs right?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.880
People like Mike and I
(Destin laughs)

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.720
And, you know, we're in the middle of life, we're healthy, and we go to station

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.520
And we get disease like symptoms instilled in our bodies, from any number of venues, physiological venues

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.460
And it's a great way to study the effect of these things and what's causing them and how to prevent them

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.320
Some of these diseases we're talking about take years to manifest here on Earth, but up in space we'll see them in months -

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.500
(Destin) Right
- or weeks, so that's another advantage to doing it up in orbit

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.020
(Destin) Oh that makes sense
And we're working right now this machine which I like to call 'The Beast'

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.800
- everybody calls it the ARED
(Destin) Which stands for what?

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.840
- ah you know...

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.960
(Dr Bob) Advanced Resistive Exercise Device
(Destin) Advanced resistive
(Don) This is Dr Bob
(Mike) He is the expert

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.640
(Destin) Dr Bob...you got to keep these astronauts straight

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.080
It takes some special engineering thinking to make a machine that allows you to weight lift in a weightless environment

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.920
Before Dr Bob explains how ARED works I wanted to see if I could figure this out

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.620
My first thought was to use a spring, but the more you compress a spring the more force is required

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.460
Weight is a constant force, so that doesn't work

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.860
I thought about the same thing with elastic bands, but the more you stretch them, the more force is required, so that doesn't work either

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.640
My final thought was to use an air cylinder

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.800
If you plug one end of the air cylinder and you compressed it that would work up to a point, but as the volume decreases, pressure increases requiring more force

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.000
So how did they do it?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.920
The heart of the system are these two canisters right here
(Destin) Okay

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.800
These two canisters contain a vacuum
Now if we could look inside the canister you would see a piston that would slide

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.120
(Destin) OH! Wait a second! Because a vacuum never changes

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.800
Yeah the vacuum is always the same, its always a vacuum

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.020
(Destin) So instead of pressurizing air and pushing against something you're just going to pull it

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.460
The volume of your vacuum is right here between the piston and the top of the chamber
(Destin) Okay

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.640
Now you pan down, attached to the piston is a rod that comes on down here and attaches here and here

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.020
(Destin) Okay
So the vacuum always wants to pull those rods up

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.380
(Destin) Like a syringe
Like a syringe, exactly like a syringe

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.740
(Destin) Okay this is really clever, think about it
You got a cylinder, a piston and the atmospheric pressure all around

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.840
If you push the piston in all the way and you close the valve at the end, and you pull, you're going to create a vacuum

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.400
- because the normal air pressure on the inside of the station is pushing on the backside of the piston it creates a force

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.280
More importantly, a constant force
This is super simple and super clever

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:40.840
So as the vacuum pulls the pistons up, it forces this arm down
So pistons go up, arm goes down and that is constant

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.160
And so right now the vacuum is holding this arm to this upper stop
When Mike stands up it will release

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.840
And now he is holding that 50 pounds in this example on his shoulders

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.980
(Destin) Okay, it's way more complicated than I thought it was
Okay one more time please Mike?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.980
(Mike) Okay, here we go
(Destin) Going down
(Mike) Going down

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.960
(Dr Bob) Vacuum is pressing him down, and now he is standing up against the force of the vacuum

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.560
(Don) Destin, this is just simple levers
(Destin) This is Archimedes

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.160
(Don) First class, second class

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.300
Don's right, it's just a lever
If the vacuum is pulling up on one side of the bar, it's going to be pushing down with a constant force on the other

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.500
Another cool thing is if you vary the position of the fulcrum, you can vary the weight

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.180
In fact, they've got an easy way to adjust that, so a guy like me can work out with guys like Mike and Don

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.320
(Destin) Okay...wow feels like weight

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.280
- it feels exactly like weight

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.780
(Don) That's how it was designed

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.840
(Destin) Okay, so here's a question, so is this all about muscle?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.640
It's all about muscle -
(Destin) Okay
- its about bones

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.180
(Destin) What do you mean?
Ah bone density, loading your skeletal system

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.460
(Destin) I though when you work out, you're working out because of your muscles
(Dr Bob) You are...ah, you're also putting loads on your skeletal system -

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.620
- most notably the hip area, the spine area...everything kind of below the waist you don't use in space

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.200
(Destin) So what does loading the bone do for you, you said bone density?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.860
(Dr Bob) Yes, ah, loading the bone stimulates bone growth -
(Destin) Okay

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.720
- so we want to minimize any losses by stimulating the bones as much as we can
(Destin) Okay, is that a big deal in space?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.020
It's a huge deal
(Destin) What do you mean it's a huge deal?

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.900
Well, without that, you can stand to loose -

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.140
- two to two and a half percent of your bone density per month

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.540
Did you hear what he said?
2 to 2.5% per MONTH!
That's crazy if you extrapolate that out -

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.200
- your bones are going to be gone

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.820
(Destin) So after 30 months you have half your bone density?

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.160
Possibly, but no ones ever
I mean we don't send people to the space station and NOT have them exercise

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.880
Okay if it takes three years to get to Mars and back, a certain percentage of your bone mineral density lost every month is a huge deal!

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.500
So I started poring through the data and I learned that the bulk of that bone mineral density loss is lost in the lower back, in the hip and in the femur -

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.440
- and if you think about it, that makes sense, because where do the elderly most often break a bone?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.760
So to understand this even better I went to the Nutritional Biochemistry Lab there at Johnson Space Centre -

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.800
- and I learned, that the majority of those minerals are being pee-d out of the astronauts bodies

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:22.860
I'm with Doctor Scott Smith and you are part of the Nutritional Biochemistry team here at NASA Johnson Space Centre...that's a really nice logo, I like that

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.160
So I noticed that you have pee on the counter here

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.940
- Why is this so important?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.260
We'll we're a nutritional biochemistry lab so we look at biochemistry, um, a lot of the work that we do is focused on bone -

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.200
- because there is a lot of things in your body, um, there's a lot of things in your diet that relate to your bones -

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.780
- so things like calcium and other factors all effect your bones, so we're very interested in looking at those things -

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.460
- and the easiest way to do that is by looking at blood samples and urine samples

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.720
Your body is pretty smart, and it maintains the skeleton that you need to do what you're doing -

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.720
- what that means is that you're forming as much bone as you're breaking down

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:09.920
(Destin) It's like this cycle and you're making bone and you're loosing it at the same time
(Scott) Right, and as long as you're doing those two things at the same rate, then all is good

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.100
(Destin) Okay
(Scott) When you start doing more of one than the other is when you get out of balance

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:23.680
This is one -80F freezer and we got another dozen or so upstairs, we've got another dozen or so two hours away in a bunker that we protect them -

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.220
- so that if a hurricane hits here and the power goes off, we don't loose those samples

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.720
Are you serious? So you gotta protect the astronaut pee?
Yes, like you wouldn't believe

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.480
It is considered a National Treasure

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:42.480
That's my goal in life, is for my pee to be considered a National Treasure
It's not quite what the moon rocks are...

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.300
You're being serious, because I mean if you think about it like, you can't reproduce it, because the amount of money and tax-payer dollars that went into creating -

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.420
- that specific controlled astronaut pee, is irreplaceable
That's correct

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.760
If you want, Anna's here...Anna's running urine calcium's right now

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.680
(Destin) Really

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.260
(Destin) So Ann, you're taking the urine and you're putting it into the machine?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.480
Yes, I'm diluting it, 1:100

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.420
(Destin) How does it feel to know that a National Treasure is in your hands? That National Treasure being astronaut urine...

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.220
It's really something special

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.680
(Destin laughing) What a great way to answer that question!

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.420
This instrument is looking at urinary calcium

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:30.840
(Destin) So you're saying that this is where the bone mass goes? They pee out their bones
(Scott) That is correct, they pee out their bones

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.200
(Destin) WOAH

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.000
(Destin) There's a fire going on in here! You didn't tell me that!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.540
No, I didn't tell you
(Destin) What's up with the fire?

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.600
(Scott) The machine injects a sample into that flame
(Destin) Okay

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:53.320
And then as it burns, what happens is the machine measures the absorption of light and based on standards and curves, um -

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:59.980
- you're looking at...its absorbs different wavelengths from that heat and tells you where the calcium is

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.520
There's a lot of big words happening right here, but I want us to stop and think about what's actually happening

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.480
We're taking astronaut pee, and we're burning it, and we're looking at the colour of burnt astronaut pee -

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.720
- is that correct?
That's correct

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.820
In crew members with the ARED, when they came back, when we looked at their X-Rays -

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.080
- their bone mineral density was the same as it was before flight

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.080
(Destin) And that's never happened before?
(Scott) And that's never happened before, with good diet and hard exercise

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.760
(Scott) This is the percent change, per month, in whole body bone mineral density
(Destin) Okay

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.720
(Scott) In crew members in the MIR, where they didn't have any resistive exercise -

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.480
In crew members early on station where they had the iRED, and crew members with the ARED

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.160
(Destin) BOOM, can't go to Mars, can't go to Mars, you can go to Mars

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.540
(Scott) Theoretically yes
(Destin) Because of ARED

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.280
(Scott) And again, there is still questions about strength and the core

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.980
(Destin) I get it, but let's go to Mars
Seriously! That's, like, that data is very very clear

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.180
(Scott) That's what we thought

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.340
(Destin) Another thing that is really cool about this research is that all these papers that are being cranked out by the biochemistry lab at NASA -

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:10.940
- are not just applicable to space
In the future these lessons about diet and skeletal loading will also help people like my granny -

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.280
- who is currently recovering from a broken hip, and to me, that's a huge deal

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.180
Okay, I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.160
Smarter Every Day is sponsored by Audible.com, and this is the book I want you to get

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.120
It's called Packing for Mars by Mary Roach, and I listened to this thing on the way out to Houston

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.280
It's a really really good book, I enjoyed it a lot, it's about the weird things that the human body does when you put it in space

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:40.700
What happens to all the stuff that your skin excretes, how does your body detect blood pressure, how is that effected by the gravity vector, all kinds of weird stuff

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.820
Human bodies do, you know, crude things, so you're not going to want to listen to this around the kids

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.820
I cannot recommend this enough: Packing for Mars by Mary Roach

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.260

Anyway, thank you so much for watching

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.640
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day
Have a good one

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.460
(Destin) Wow, feels like weight, it feels exactly like weight

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.960
(Don) That's how it was designed

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.960
(Destin) So I can feel the inertia from those flywheels

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.060
(Don) Those little details are really important when you get in a weightless environment

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.560
(Destin) Holy cow, it feels like I've got weight on my shoulders

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:44.180
(Don) And it just shows that what engineers can do when they're given, ah, a challenging project and you give them free reign to come up with a design

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.080
(Destin) Like I don't like lifting weights and I'm already sad
That's amazing
