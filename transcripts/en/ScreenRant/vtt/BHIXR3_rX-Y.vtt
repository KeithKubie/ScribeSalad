00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.710
The term “comic book movie” typically
means superhero, but publishers have featured

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.490
much more than capes and cowls in their graphic
novels.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.250
The medium has been used to tell stories in
several genres, many of which are then translated

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.720
to film with great effect.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.800
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 best comic book
movies of all-time.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.669
Superman: The Movie

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.800
It may have been an easy sell, but the first
Superman showed that there was a bright future

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.420
for comic book films in the decades to follow.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.820
Sporting an instantly iconic cast and well-crafted
thrills that delighted crowds around the world,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.590
the movie was both a critical and commercial
success.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.379
Director Richard Donner found the right tone
to showcase the Man of Steel, encapsulating

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.310
a sense of joy and awe at being able to watch
a man fly.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.230
And even after several recastings, Christopher
Reeve is still Superman to entire generations,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.059
and the standard by which all others are measured.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.059
Men in Black

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.790
Based on a Marvel Comic, this film brilliantly
paired the hip Will Smith with the curmudgeonly

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.210
Tommy Lee Jones to gut-busting results.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
Featuring a script that was equal parts creative
and humorous, the movie was a clever spin

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
on the buddy cop concept, mixing it up with
sci-fi elements and the aliens secretly living

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.000
among human society.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.250
Not only that, the film surprisingly had a
strong heart, which gave the product, and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.410
the leads’ touching farewell, some emotional
pull to suck viewers in.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.650
That aspect made Men in Black the complete
package, and a world worth visiting in multiple

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.470
sequels.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.470
Road to Perdition

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.080
A somber tale of a father and son on the run,
Road to Perdition delivered suspense and drama

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080
in spades.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.500
The film featured a different kind of turn
for star Tom Hanks, playing a stoic, Depression-era

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.580
hitman to perfection.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.180
Dealing with emotional themes of guilt, damnation,
and protecting childhood innocence, the narrative

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.140
was instantly relatable and gave viewers plenty
of substance to go along with its style.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.410
It may not be the easiest watch with its many
heart-wrenching twists, but Road to Perdition

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.860
represents filmmaking at its best, and is
one of the better gangster films thanks to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.959
its complex story and characters.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:09.959
Spider-Man 2

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.480
Long before the MCU had to save his cinematic
reputation, Spider-Man was at the top of the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.500
superhero movie totem pole.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.940
Building off of the original movie’s humor
and heart, Sam Raimi used this sequel to expand

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.500
on the same ideas and further strengthen character
dynamics, Peter and Harry Osborn’s relationship

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.500
chief among them.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.100
The film showed why Spider-Man is a hero for
the everyman, dedicating nearly as much time

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.160
to Peter’s personal arc to make the lead
a well-rounded character.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.930
Dr. Otto Octavius was the perfect comic villain,
equal parts sinister and selfless, with unforgettable

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.200
action thrown in as well.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.670
A History of Violence

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.560
A title with many meanings, this film served
up plenty of food for thought throughout its

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560
running time.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.900
Director David Cronenberg used the movie to
explore the nature of the human condition

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.890
- and violence in particular – in captivating
fashion.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.069
Critics applauded his direction, as he displayed
he was at the top of his craft with well-constructed

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.180
scenes and sequences that hammered home the
script’s themes.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.790
The cast was top-notch too.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.280
William Hurt may have been the only one to
get an Oscar nomination, but everyone from

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.120
Viggo Mortensen to Ed Harris were at the top
of their games.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.410
V for Vendetta

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.480
Pulling off the tricky task of adapting Alan
Moore’s work to film, this Wachowski production

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.050
blew audiences away with everything from the
visual style to the heady concepts and commentary.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.130
As you might expect, the set pieces were stunning
to witness, showcasing a grand spectacle that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.530
demands to be seen on the largest of screens.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.819
But what made V for Vendetta stand out was
its story, which explored the restlessness

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.480
of a political rebellion, and just how far
activists would go to ensure justice for all.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.560
In the end, the impressive work – and its
masked star – succeeded on multiple levels

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.810
and broke new ground for the genre.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.810
300

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.700
Zack Snyder is best known for his unique flair
and filmmaking style, and much of that reputation

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.700
is owed to 300.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.700
Combining an old school underdog story with
revolutionary modern technology, the adaptation

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.349
of Frank Miller’s comic was an incredible
technical achievement, which more than made

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.660
up for any narrative shortcomings.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.530
Breathtaking action sequences that redefined
the concept, and popularizing a new form of

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.620
speed-ramping slo-mo were just two small impacts.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.540
And leading the way was Gerard Butler, whose
take on King Leonidas made the hero, and the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.540
actor, a fan-favorite.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.560
Not to mention immortalizing one of his very
best one-liners.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
The Dark Knight

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.569
Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed crime drama
became one of the crowning moments of 21st

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:26.210
century blockbuster cinema thanks to its complex
portrayal of heroism, mirroring real-world

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.639
dilemmas to a chilling effect.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.030
The director’s brand of “dark” and “gritty”
filmmaking has proven extremely influential,

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.370
inspiring countless imitators looking to recapture
Nolan’s magic.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.590
The Dark Knight also works as a character
study alone, led by the crazed anarchy of

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.449
Heath Ledger’s Joker and Christian Bale’s
focused Batman.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.319
Aaron Eckhart’s Two-Face was a welcome addition,
adding yet another twist to give the story

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.139
one final push into greatness.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.300
The Avengers

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.300
One time accused of being overly-ambitious,
Marvel Studios showed that the shared universe

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.259
model of franchise building could work in
exciting ways.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.520
Bringing together a collection of their most
popular heroes, The Avengers set box office

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.490
records and earned much critical acclaim due
to the chemistry between actors and sharp

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.490
wit.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.830
But it wasn’t just the heroes who made this
a marvelous adventure.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.930
Tom Hiddleston cemented his status as the
MCU’s best evildoer with another captivating

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.039
turn as Loki, serving as the ideal foil for
Earth’s Mightiest in their first mission

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.039
together.

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.400
Joss Whedon was seen as a risky choice for
crafting the MCU, but these days, every studio

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.089
looks to copy the Avengers’ shared universe
success.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.089
Snowpiercer

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.650
A breath of fresh air for those jaded by overproduced
summer blockbusters, Snowpiercer delivered

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.630
thrills and suspense that rival those of a
tentpole.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.499
Using a single train to explore class separation
and equality, the film didn’t pull any punches

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.569
and gave audiences plenty to think about long
after the ride was over.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.210
Grounded by captivating performances by actors
like Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton, Snowpiercer

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.719
didn’t short on character development either,
creating a rich environment populated by colorful,

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.569
and often freakish people and concepts.

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.270
It’d be nice if all summer movies could
be this headstrong, but the pleasant surprise

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.990
is what made Snowpiercer a treat.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.189
Those are our picks for the best comic book
movies of all-time.

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.770
