00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.570
That got me thinking about,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.530
or an article that I read about Anthony Bourdain and Anthony Bordain.

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.650
Obviously he was about as successful as as anyone could be.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.170
I mean,
he was a successful guy in so many aspects and yet,

5
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.920
and yet he killed himself

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.930
and I didn't know him personally,
but you know,

7
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.120
he knew people that I know,
you know,
he was,
he was friends with Joe Rogan.

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.400
He was,
he was friends with Harley Flanagan.
He was friends with guys that,

9
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.640
guys that are really good guys.

10
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.370
And so in that way I kind of felt like I knew what kind of a guy who was at

11
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:57.670
least,
and even from the outside,

12
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.790
even without having any connections to them at all,

13
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.870
he was the kind of guy that had just about everything that,
that,

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.420
that most people would want.

15
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.070
And
even still,
I mean,
obviously that wasn't enough.

16
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.850
Well,
in the article that I read,

17
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:27.851
there was a quote from one of Anthony Bourdain's books in the book was called a

18
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.840
cook's tour.
He said,
in this book,

19
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.070
I wanted adventure.

20
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.810
I wanted to go up the known river to the heart of darkness.

21
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.980
In Cambodia.

22
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.450
I wanted to ride out into a desert on camelback sand and dunes in every

23
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:51.674
direction.

24
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.850
Eat whole roasted lamb with my fingers.

25
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.060
I wanted to kick snow off my boots in a Mafia nightclub in Russia.

26
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.150
I wanted to play with automatic weapons in Phnom Penh.

27
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.830
Recapture the past in a small oyster village in France.

28
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.050
Step into a CD,
neon lit pool,

29
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.360
Korea in rural Mexico.

30
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.780
I want it to run roadblocks in the middle of the night.

31
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.990
Blowing past angry militia with a hand full of hurled marble packs.

32
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.420
<v 0>Experience.
Fear,
excitement,
wonder.
I wanted kicks.</v>

34
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.140
The kind of melodramatic thrills and chills I yearned for since childhood

35
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.180
kind of adventure I'd found as a little boy in the pages of my tin,

36
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:50.560
tin comic books.

37
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.850
I wanted to see the world and I wanted the world to be just like the movies.

38
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.730
That's what Anthony Bourdain said.
Just like the movies.

39
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.640
<v 1>Okay.
Hmm.</v>

40
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.300
<v 0>But you know what?
To me,</v>

41
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.333
<v 1>cool</v>

42
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.070
<v 0>old is not like the movies.</v>

43
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.600
The movies aren't real.
They don't exist,

44
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.060
but you do.

45
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.950
And life,
this life is,

46
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.400
it's better than any movie there is.

47
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.700
Movies are supposed to provoke emotion.

48
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.250
They're supposed to make you feel something,

49
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.230
but I have a better idea.

50
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.030
Go out into the world and actually feel it.

51
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.010
Go feel joy and love and triumph and rapture and ecstasy and glory.

52
00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.260
Go feel those things.

53
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.580
And you know with those feelings,

54
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.120
there will be other feelings as well.

55
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.560
There'll be sorrow and pain and sadness and desolation and suffering.

56
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.170
There'd be a whole those feelings too.
But you know what?

57
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.953
<v 1>That's okay.</v>

58
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.320
<v 0>That's okay.
Take both sides.
Feel all of it.</v>

59
00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:59.180
That's what life is.
Those feelings,
those emotions,

60
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.030
those highs and vose,
Lowe's,

61
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.490
those are life

62
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.850
and those emotions and those feelings are better than any movie because they are

63
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.963
real.

64
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.630
So make your own
comic book,

65
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.500
Make Your Life,
your own movie.

66
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.930
Actually make it better than a movie.
Not,

67
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.440
not better because it's more adventurous or more romantic or more melodramatic.

68
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.930
Make it better
because it's real.

69
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.530
It's real.
So it is better.
And you know what?

70
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.850
Real combs with some downsides

71
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.400
where you comms with some darkness.

72
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.643
<v 1>Okay,</v>

73
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.420
<v 0>but that's okay.
It's okay.</v>

74
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.670
Because when you know the darkness,

75
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.850
<v 1>yeah,</v>

76
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.380
<v 0>the light becomes even brighter.</v>

77
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.200
So go out there,
move toward the light move.

78
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.973
<v 0>Toward</v>

80
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.230
<v 1>the light
and live,</v>

81
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.690
live.
