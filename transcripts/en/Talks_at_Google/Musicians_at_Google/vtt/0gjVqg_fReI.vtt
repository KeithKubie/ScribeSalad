ERIC ROBERSON: How many of you
have ever dealt with somebody

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.160
you shouldn't have been
dealing with?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.160
ERIC ROBERSON: Why'd
you look at her?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.440
He, like, turned and said,
[SILENT CLAPPING].

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.799
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:11.705
ERIC ROBERSON: What was that?

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:15.033
Like, I mean, first of all,
she's sitting, like, high, and

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.690
you're sitting low,
which makes it a

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.626
very awkward situation.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.982
But when I asked the question,
he shifted his--

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:23.950
[PATTING THE MICROPHONE]

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.200
ERIC ROBERSON: But you
can start that one.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.790
You can start that one.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.685
But if you were in that
situation, I want to dedicate

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:32.680
it to this guy right
here who--

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.190
ERIC ROBERSON: What's
your name, man?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.600
What's your name?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.606
AUDIENCE: Howard.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:37.850
ERIC ROBERSON: Howard.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.374
I went to Howard, so,
you know, yes, yes.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.440
You went to Howard as well?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.020
Your name is Howard.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.074
She went to Howard.

00:00:46.074 --> 00:00:47.130
Are you guys together, though?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.010
Are you guys?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.730
Hmm, yeah.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.660
I understand.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.000
Shouldn't have been dealing.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.345
ERIC ROBERSON: OK.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:56.730
It's OK.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.180
It's cool.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.630
It's cool.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.020
It's only on tape.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.045
It's only on tape.

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:04.320
Are you single?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.260
Wow!

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.670
Howard.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.020
Howard.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.690
You thinking, you know, if I
bring her but sit on another

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.906
level, I might could
get away with this.

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:15.580
What about you?

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.348
What's your name, sweetheart?

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:16.570
What's your name?

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.390
AUDIENCE: Karen.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.170
ERIC ROBERSON: All right,
Karen, are you single?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.680
OK.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.210
So Karen is single.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.512
Howard is ha, ha,
ha, ha, ah, ha.

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:29.800
All right.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.050
Howard and Karen.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.910
There are no accidents.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.200
There are no accidents.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.020
I'm going to dedicate this
song to Howard and Carol.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.390
Karen.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.320
Karen or Carol?

AUDIENCE: Karen.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.840
ERIC ROBERSON: Karen.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.760
My goal is, by the end of this
song, Howard is licking

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.430
Karen's face.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.840
That's my goal.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.660
