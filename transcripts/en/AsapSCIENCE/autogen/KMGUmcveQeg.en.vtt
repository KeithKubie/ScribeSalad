00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.900
 We were told to eat healthy, and to pay attention to our consumption of calories during the day 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.340
 But do you stop how it can be a calorie form? 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.520
 For example this amount of 200 calories of apples 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.000
 On the other hand, if we take 200 kilos of heat from cheese, they are never the same size 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 And add 200 calories of wine to the group for a wonderful blend of wine and cheese 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.940
 Thus you will have 3 different forms of 200 calories 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.200
 Now compare that wine with beer and jam and you'll have 3 different festive evenings for your stomach 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.180
 Or what about the eggs you eat in breakfast? 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.200
 Compare them with the 200 calories of the cereal you eat the next day, or even some oatmeal 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 Thus they must be different 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.440
 But if you compare it with the sausage sandwich with eggs for breakfast, you will get less 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.700
 cauliflower? You will be surprised at how much you can eat before it reaches 200 calories 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.740
 Not to mention that this stuff is packed with food and an important source of fiber 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 Pizza piece? Less than a slice if it does not have a pepperoni 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.940
 What about the traditional Big Mac sandwich? Try the small Mac sandwich with 200 prices 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.120
 Since calories are simply power units, you can charge 217 Big Mac sandwiches 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.980
 Provide the car with a 35 km drive card 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 So wait. What is calorie? 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.940
 Specifically, the calorie is the amount of energy needed, or the temperature needed to heat one gram of water one degree Celsius 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940
 We need energy to live, and we get it from food 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.600
 Starches, proteins and fats are building blocks of our taste, each of which provides our bodies with a certain amount of energy 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.520
 Normal humans need between 2000 and 2700 calories a day 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.620
 Depending on factors such as height, weight, gender and age 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.580
 Some foods, such as peanut butter, are high in calories, making them quickly supplement those needs 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.880
 Or like the rich ones you ate as a snack, which is likely to contain more calories than you'd expect 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.760
 And the attractive Doritos chips? Do not lie, I ate a whole bag 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.720
 Unlike celery, which contains a few calories, it gives you a lot to bite 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.860
 Or islands 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.440
 Not a lot of Harshi granules 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.200
 If you eat salad to reduce calories, beware of creamy sauces 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.340
 Especially French 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.120
 Coffee itself has few calories 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.340
 You can drink a lot before you reach 200 calories 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.200
 But the moment of adding sugar and cream will double those calories quickly 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.600
 And to go for specialty drinks such as frozen moccasins 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.680
 You may be surprised by the amount left 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.940
 But that does not necessarily mean that it is a little calorie thing 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.780
 It is more healthy or better for you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 Take, for example, 200 calories of cola against 200 calories of milk 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.760
 Although the prices of cola are less per liter 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.300
 But do not forget the benefits of rich milk and healthy fats 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.380
 Or like baking asparagus against white bread 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.660
 Yes, whole grain bread contains higher prices for the slice, but also contains plenty of food and fiber 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.640
 So, calculating calories is not the goal 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060
 But think that what you are dealing with is what will make a difference 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.360
 In the end, all moderately and healthily 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.460

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.120
 Where more food is considered
