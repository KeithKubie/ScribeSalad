00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
- I'm gonna slice up a
piece from the side here.

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.372
The texture is smooth and
disintegrating on my tongue.

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:16.636
(upbeat drums music)

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:19.925
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:23.783
with migrationology.com,
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:25.845
We have just come
downstairs to the restaurant

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:29.025
for breakfast this morning,
it's called Bjork Restaurant,

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:31.414
and this is an amazing breakfast buffet.

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.785
I especially like to go heavy
on the protein and vegetables,

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:37.359
so I got some hard-boiled eggs,

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.867
actually, they're slightly soft with the,

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.256
the yolk looks perfect, some sausages,

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:44.262
some tomatoes and cucumbers.

00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:46.513
And then over on this side of my plate,

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.263
I got what is a Swedish delicacy.

00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:54.263
And it said it was
herring in mustard sauce,

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.930
so I gotta try this.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:04.119
Mm.

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:08.602
The pickled herring kind
of has a gummy texture,

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:11.680
and very, very soft,
and actually, it's like,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.108
it's almost like fish
spread, you could spread that

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:17.775
with a knife, it's so
soft and, like, gummy.

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:23.802
I don't eat sausage very often, but,

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:25.535
these look delicious.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.535
Especially with mustard.

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:33.184
Mm!

00:01:33.184 --> 00:01:35.334
Yeah, it's like a breakfast sausage.

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:36.840
And then with that spicy mustard.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.819
Hard-boiled eggs.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.319
And I already put a bit of pepper on them.

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:47.242
The yolk is just perfect.

00:01:47.242 --> 00:01:48.962
They have a good selection
of vegetables as well,

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:53.275
nice-looking tomatoes and
peppers and cucumbers.

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.404
I also got a plate of mixed nuts.

00:01:55.404 --> 00:01:57.317
I think these are
pumpkin seeds, hazelnuts,

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.067
and sunflowers seeds.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.753
What I've read is that
Sweden is one of the highest

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:09.083
per capita drinkers of coffee,

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:12.074
people drink a lot of coffee, and so,

00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:13.815
I don't mind just trying it all,

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:14.824
I'm gonna sit here and eat coffee,

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:17.955
and even at the buffet,
they have takeaway cups,

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:21.538
so you can drink coffee
throughout the day.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:24.787
Ah!

00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:26.505
I'm gonna take this back up to the room.

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:30.365
If you ever come to
Courtyard, say hello to Karen.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:31.427
- Welcome!

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:32.806
Welcome to Sweden!

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:34.237
- Thank you very much.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.888
Nice to meet you.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:39.805
(uplifting instrumental music)

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:44.077
Hello, duck!

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:47.314
(imitates quacking)

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:51.177
Stockholm in the summer right
now is absolutely beautiful!

00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:53.936
In the middle of the
city, but it feels like

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:56.650
you're in the countryside here.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.159
Just completely clear water,
beautiful trees and parks.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.974
I'm squatting on the beach,
literally just a couple meters

00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:06.274
from lots and lots of ducks.

00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:08.691
This is absolutely beautiful!

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.971
There are some people a little
bit down the beach, swimming.

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.329
I wonder how cold the water is, though.

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.162
Oh, it's not too cold!

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:24.990
It would actually be really refreshing.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.611
I could definitely swim.

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:28.528
And it's so clear, too!

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:36.564
Just being here in Stockholm
for a few hours now,

00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:38.200
I've just noticed how beautiful it is,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.255
and one of the reasons
that it's so beautiful,

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:41.696
nice to meet you!

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:45.328
Is that, it is a city that
is made up of islands,

00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:48.827
and so Stockholm is spread
out over 14 different islands,

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:52.894
and I think I read, 57 bridges
that connect the islands,

00:03:52.894 --> 00:03:55.329
and so you're always surrounded by water.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.508
We're only here for two full days,

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.078
and we are here on the
weekend, Saturday and Sunday.

00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:04.247
Today is Saturday, and
there are two kinda heritage

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:07.747
food markets that I want
to check out and eat at,

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:12.111
and both of which are closed
on Sunday, so that means

00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.151
that we need to go to two
food markets right now,

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:17.984
we're on our way to the first one.

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:35.039
I thoroughly enjoyed that
walk along the water's edge,

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.144
and now we are passing by
the Stockholm City Hall,

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:41.214
which is one of the most iconic buildings

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.076
and landmarks in Stockholm.

00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:46.278
We are just walking past,
though, not gonna stop here,

00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:49.664
but just admiring the
beauty of the structure,

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:53.497
and just the views of
Stockholm and the water.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:04.987
I'm gonna try to pronounce
it to my best ability,

00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:07.766
but I think it's somewhere
along the lines of

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.960
Hotorgshallen market, and
we're about to head inside

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.877
to find something to eat for lunch.

00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:22.094
This is a basement food market,
and there are some wonderful

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:26.354
artisan vendors here,
selling everything from meat,

00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:28.228
to different Swedish products,

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.108
and there are also some
restaurants and cafes

00:05:30.108 --> 00:05:32.762
that you can sit down at eat at.

00:05:32.762 --> 00:05:34.455
There's so many good-looking things here.

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:38.692
It's like an entire
underground deli and market,

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:41.956
there are wine shops, and
you can buy coffee here,

00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:44.118
you can even buy fresh vegetables,

00:05:44.118 --> 00:05:46.839
lots of seafood and meat products,

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.520
a Swedish marketplace all
in one basement floor.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.518
And the seafood in particular
looks extremely good.

00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.739
I think we're gonna head
straight to eat some seafood.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:01.563
A couple of you recommended to
try a place called Melanders

00:06:01.563 --> 00:06:04.511
at the market, and so we are gonna,

00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:06.819
it's a takeaway, they
have a lot of seafood,

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.909
but they also have a
couple of bar stools here

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.238
where you can sit down.

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:14.289
I think I'm gonna have to
go with the cured salmon.

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.952
Can I have poached salmon,
and also the cured salmon

00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:19.785
with dill.

00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:20.992
Thank you.

00:06:20.992 --> 00:06:24.492
This is kind of a seafood bar, deli-style,

00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:29.032
and so it's within the
market, that basement market,

00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:30.868
you grab stools, and you can sit down,

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:32.772
I think a lot of people also get takeaway,

00:06:32.772 --> 00:06:34.943
so they can order all of
these dishes takeaway,

00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:38.111
or seafood takeaway, but
it's nice to sit here,

00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:39.844
and I ordered some salmon.

00:06:39.844 --> 00:06:40.677
Hi, Ying.

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:44.408
- [Employee] Salmon.

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:45.241
- [Mark] Okay.

00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:46.766
- [Employee] With dill potato.

00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:48.573
- [Mark] Oh, dill potatoes.

00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:49.939
- [Employee] Spoon for those.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:51.080
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.312
- [Employee] This is toast skagen.

00:06:54.312 --> 00:06:55.858
(Ying chuckles)

00:06:55.858 --> 00:06:57.099
- [Mark] Toast skagen.

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.679
- Toast skagen, and
here is poached salmon.

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:01.723
- Alright, thank you very much.

00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:02.862
So all the food is pre-prepared,

00:07:02.862 --> 00:07:04.812
they have the different salads already,

00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:07.384
but then she really
beautifully prepared them all

00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:09.296
onto the plates, and served them,

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:11.743
and decorated them quite nicely as well.

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:13.954
And we're gonna share everything,

00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:17.821
this one is poached salmon,
and it came with some salad

00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:21.767
and some pickles, and then, I
think these are dill potatoes.

00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:26.414
And then, the one right in
the middle is toast skagen,

00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:29.140
and this is, it's like a shrimp,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.224
there's shrimp, there's roe
on top, there's some dill,

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:34.167
and it's in, kind of a creamy dressing,

00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:35.000
I'm not sure exactly.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.917
Finally, I could not miss
the cured salmon, so,

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:42.849
that is just beautiful,
like, bouquet formation

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.438
of cured salmon, and the salmon came also

00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:47.345
with a side of potatoes.

00:07:47.345 --> 00:07:50.998
I will kinda reach in with
my spoon, let me put that,

00:07:50.998 --> 00:07:52.882
oh, that dill will make it amazing.

00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:55.226
Okay, I'm just gonna kinda reach in,

00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:58.061
grabbing some of the shrimp salad,

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:01.478
and some of that roe, put it on top here.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:06.003
Oh, that piece of dill that
came with it, let me add it.

00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:08.420
Oh, oh no, I lost the shrimp.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.673
Alright.

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.981
That is ridiculously good.

00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:30.649
Oh, the shrimp are
amazing, and they're coated

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.522
in a really, like, creamy, I'm
not sure if it's mayonnaise,

00:08:33.522 --> 00:08:36.396
or it's, it's like a
really, really creamy sauce.

00:08:36.396 --> 00:08:38.407
And I love that dill touch, that gives it

00:08:38.407 --> 00:08:41.799
such a little refreshing,
a refreshing flavor.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.917
This is a stunner, actually.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:45.000
It's so good.

00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:55.041
The shrimp are little, but they have

00:08:55.041 --> 00:08:57.148
just an amazing freshness, and you can,

00:08:57.148 --> 00:09:00.357
the texture, also, of them,
they're a little bit chewy,

00:09:00.357 --> 00:09:04.390
and not mushy at all,
but just incredibly good,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.487
they're like little muscular shrimp.

00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:11.654
Next up I'm gonna try some
of this poached salmon.

00:09:12.873 --> 00:09:15.290
With some of that dill sauce.

00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:26.241
That is served cold, but
you can taste the quality

00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:28.315
of that salmon.

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:29.148
Wow.

00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:31.487
Just flakes apart in your mouth,

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.596
and then, I think the potatoes,
I got some of that sauce,

00:09:34.596 --> 00:09:38.151
it's nicely dill-flavored,
and very creamy as well.

00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:40.889
Let me taste this other
potato while I'm at it.

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:45.056
I'm not sure if that's cheese
sauce, or just cream sauce.

00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.166
Mm!

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:50.274
Yeah, that's very creamy.

00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:51.985
But not cheesy.

00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:53.706
And again, those potatoes are really good,

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:57.156
they have an amazing
texture, and then that's just

00:09:57.156 --> 00:09:58.671
like a white, creamy gravy.

00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:01.311
It is time for my bouquet of salmon.

00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:06.062
Oh, I'm not even sure if
this is a single slice,

00:10:06.062 --> 00:10:08.151
or how I should go about
eating this, I'll just,

00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:11.984
I'm gonna slice up a
piece from the side here.

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:14.162
Ugh!

00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:15.245
Cured salmon.

00:10:24.664 --> 00:10:26.997
That is melting in my mouth.

00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:29.566
And it's not too salty!

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:33.733
The texture is smooth, and
disintegrating on my tongue.

00:10:35.283 --> 00:10:38.033
Squeeze on a little bit of lemon.

00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:46.536
Slice off a piece, and get
some of that dill on this bite.

00:10:47.615 --> 00:10:50.282
And some of that pepper as well.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:59.019
It's just an amazingly
pure and delicious thing.

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:00.999
Another thing I've loved
since coming to Sweden

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:02.625
is the pepper.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:05.003
The pepper is so good, and
it's available everywhere,

00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:07.565
and I love how they
leave it on coarse grind,

00:11:07.565 --> 00:11:09.051
on the pepper grinder, so that you can get

00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.468
some wonderful pepper flavor.

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:16.099
And I am a little bit of a pepper fanatic,

00:11:17.384 --> 00:11:20.166
or any kind of spice fanatic, so,

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:25.055
I do like to coat things
heavily, when it comes to pepper.

00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:29.222
And take that piece of salmon,
dip it into that pepper,

00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:32.515
give it a full crust.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.040
The pepper compliments the salmon so well.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.207
It's a little bit spicy, and
it contrasts the saltiness.

00:11:45.608 --> 00:11:46.978
You can really taste the difference

00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:48.620
between a good-quality salmon,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.368
and one that's not so good quality.

00:11:51.368 --> 00:11:54.070
This one literally just,
sort of melts in your mouth.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.042
And let me just demonstrate
how soft this salmon is,

00:11:57.042 --> 00:11:58.942
you don't need the knife to cut it,

00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:01.560
you just literally, just let your fork

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.179
slice right through it.

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:05.012
Oh!

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.870
It's just...

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:17.658
We just finished with that
salmon experience at the market,

00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:21.805
it wasn't cheap, but
that was incredibly good,

00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:24.843
and we are now walking on
our to the next market.

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:29.010
(upbeat electronic instrumental music)

00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:34.379
The next market that
we're walking to is called

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:38.448
Ostermalmshallen, and this
is more of a heritage,

00:12:38.448 --> 00:12:40.868
traditional market in Stockholm.

00:12:40.868 --> 00:12:43.007
And unfortunately right
now, they are renovating

00:12:43.007 --> 00:12:45.690
the original structure,
so they have set up

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.679
a temporary, but pretty permanent stall

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:52.603
which houses all of the stores
and stalls in the market

00:12:52.603 --> 00:12:53.436
and restaurants.

00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:55.471
I read on the Visit Stockholm website,

00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:58.671
that the original market will be completed

00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.865
sometime in the year 2018,
so if you're watching

00:13:00.865 --> 00:13:03.167
this video then, you might
get to go into the real,

00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:08.034
authentic market, but for now,
this is the new market area.

00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:10.554
This market is quite similar to the market

00:13:10.554 --> 00:13:11.979
we were just visiting.

00:13:11.979 --> 00:13:14.943
Lots and lots of meat vendors,
you can buy fish here,

00:13:14.943 --> 00:13:17.257
you can buy fresh produce.

00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:20.913
A lot of artisan, really
good quality things here,

00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:22.374
and there are also some
places to sit down,

00:13:22.374 --> 00:13:26.291
some restaurants, some
cafes, some more salmon,

00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:30.791
so many good things in
this market as well.

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:37.057
- [Employee] This is reindeer.

00:13:37.057 --> 00:13:38.023
- Oh, reindeer.
- Yeah.

00:13:38.023 --> 00:13:39.831
And this is moose, or elk.

00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:41.872
- [Mark] Moose or elk.

00:13:41.872 --> 00:13:42.705
Thank you.

00:13:43.754 --> 00:13:44.587
- Moose.

00:13:44.587 --> 00:13:46.061
- This one is moose.

00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:46.961
Okay.

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:50.711
This is some moose,
cured moose, like salami.

00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:54.644
Mm.

00:13:55.755 --> 00:13:57.620
It's really, really dark meat.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.866
- [Employee] This is a Rudolph.

00:13:59.866 --> 00:14:01.908
- Rudolph reindeer.

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:04.575
And this one is reindeer salami.

00:14:08.271 --> 00:14:09.486
Mm!

00:14:09.486 --> 00:14:13.141
That one has a little more of a smoother,

00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:16.241
maybe lightly liver-ier taste to it.

00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:17.074
- [Employee] You liked it?

00:14:17.074 --> 00:14:18.574
- Yeah, very good.

00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:21.908
Can I just have a small piece of the elk?

00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:22.741
- [Employee] Of course!

00:14:22.741 --> 00:14:25.324
- Maybe like, 50 kroner, or so?

00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:29.388
- Yeah, 51.

00:14:29.388 --> 00:14:30.221
- [Mark] Okay, perfect.

00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:31.471
- Or, 50, even.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.406
50 kroner.

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:34.326
Thank you.

00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:37.534
- I didn't realize this, but
there's also a Melanders,

00:14:37.534 --> 00:14:39.984
the same restaurant that we
just did at the other market,

00:14:39.984 --> 00:14:41.972
located here as well, and there's also

00:14:41.972 --> 00:14:44.431
another couple of famous
seafood restaurants

00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:46.736
serving similar things
to what we just ate,

00:14:46.736 --> 00:14:50.903
so, I'm just walking around
enjoying these cabinets of meat,

00:14:52.012 --> 00:14:53.945
are incredibly beautiful.

00:14:53.945 --> 00:14:55.823
This moose salami would be really good

00:14:55.823 --> 00:14:58.331
to take it to the park
and then eat it leisurely,

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:00.573
but I gotta have another
taste of it right now.

00:15:00.573 --> 00:15:02.427
It's a pretty good chunk.

00:15:02.427 --> 00:15:03.804
It's very solid.

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:05.106
And get a closeup look at that,

00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:08.189
you can see the ratio of fat to meat,

00:15:09.036 --> 00:15:11.453
and how dark of a meat it is.

00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:20.571
Yeah, the taste's just like salami,

00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:24.897
but with a more, like, a
little bit of a stronger

00:15:24.897 --> 00:15:26.259
meat taste to it.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.676
And it's salty, it's just densely-packed,

00:15:30.714 --> 00:15:32.717
but it definitely would
be good with some crackers

00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:33.572
or some bread.

00:15:33.572 --> 00:15:36.616
That's a pretty small and
very manageable market,

00:15:36.616 --> 00:15:38.124
but the stalls that they do have,

00:15:38.124 --> 00:15:40.945
the meat, the seafood, the produce,

00:15:40.945 --> 00:15:44.446
is all really, really good
quality, very gourmet,

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:46.811
and I'm pretty happy with that moose,

00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:48.664
little piece of moose sausage I bought.

00:15:48.664 --> 00:15:52.065
There is a famous hot dog
stand just down the road,

00:15:52.065 --> 00:15:53.742
and I don't wanna leave this neighborhood

00:15:53.742 --> 00:15:56.831
without having a hot dog
there, so that's the next stop.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.825
Which one is you specialty?

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.862
- [Employee] Kabanos is our bestseller.

00:16:00.862 --> 00:16:02.099
- Kabanos.
- Real popular.

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:04.066
- [Mark] Okay, that's what I'll have.

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:05.891
One of them, please.

00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:06.724
Thank you.
- There you go.

00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:09.126
Thank you very much, enjoy.

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:11.837
- This place is a sausage specialist,

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:14.284
and it's actually housed in, kind of a,

00:16:14.284 --> 00:16:16.384
it's kind of a hot dog container,

00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:19.020
in a very, very quiet street in Stockholm,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.047
just down the road from that market,

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:23.126
and I ordered what is their specialty,

00:16:23.126 --> 00:16:26.968
their most popular sausage,
which is called kabanos,

00:16:26.968 --> 00:16:29.636
and this version comes
stuffed into a baguette,

00:16:29.636 --> 00:16:32.439
and the baguette is not cut,
but it's kinda hollowed out,

00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:34.882
and then he grilled the
sausage, he cut it in half,

00:16:34.882 --> 00:16:37.131
it's actually a really long,
like, foot-long sausage,

00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:40.900
he cut it in half, stuffed it
into the pocket of baguette,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.557
and grilled the baguette, and
then I think it's sauerkraut

00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:45.620
stuffed inside of there, and then,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.357
I was thinking, there's some ketchup,

00:16:47.357 --> 00:16:49.377
oh, ketchup and mustard, I think that's,

00:16:49.377 --> 00:16:51.105
I don't know what kind
of sauce that is, but,

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:54.238
this is the specialty sauce to go with it,

00:16:54.238 --> 00:16:56.821
and it is hot and pretty solid.

00:17:05.747 --> 00:17:06.580
Wow!

00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:11.636
That is everything you want, in a sausage.

00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:14.209
I'm actually like, blown
away how good that is.

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:17.296
The bread is nice and nice and crispy.

00:17:17.296 --> 00:17:21.354
Then the sausage, it is kind
of like a spicy sausage,

00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:24.771
and then there's the sauerkraut, which is

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:28.203
a little bit crispy and
then a little bit sour,

00:17:28.203 --> 00:17:30.554
and then that mustard
on top is kinda sweet,

00:17:30.554 --> 00:17:34.137
but that contrasts the
whole salty sausage.

00:17:40.303 --> 00:17:42.015
That's a seriously good sausage.

00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:44.596
And the bread, I was thinking
the bread was gonna more

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.689
kinda heavy, but it's
actually really light,

00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:48.939
and just completely crusty.

00:17:51.436 --> 00:17:53.517
Another thing I like is that
the baguette is not cut,

00:17:53.517 --> 00:17:55.820
it's just hollowed out,
so you don't run the risk

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.817
of anything falling out,
and I think even on the,

00:17:57.817 --> 00:17:58.928
let me pull it out.

00:17:58.928 --> 00:18:00.830
Oh yeah, you see, even on the bottom,

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.987
there's no holes in this baguette,

00:18:02.987 --> 00:18:05.349
except at the top, where
it was stuffed from.

00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:08.516
So there's no risk in losing anything.

00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:12.466
Thank you man, that was really good.

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:13.458
- [Employee] Did you like it?

00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:15.516
- Very good, loved it.
- Thank you.

00:18:15.516 --> 00:18:16.474
- Thank you.

00:18:16.474 --> 00:18:21.128
That was just a next-level
sausage container experience.

00:18:21.128 --> 00:18:23.809
From here, we're gonna take
the metro to Gamla Stan,

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:25.548
which is the old area of Stockholm,

00:18:25.548 --> 00:18:28.172
and we're gonna walk around
that area for a while next.

00:18:28.172 --> 00:18:32.089
(uplifting instrumental music)

00:18:43.796 --> 00:18:47.505
We just got off the metro
at Gamla Stan station,

00:18:47.505 --> 00:18:50.256
and this is the old area of Stockholm

00:18:50.256 --> 00:18:52.837
that dates back to the 13th century,

00:18:52.837 --> 00:18:56.152
it is beautiful with
its cobblestone streets,

00:18:56.152 --> 00:18:58.681
and also with its medieval alleyways,

00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:02.764
some iconic traditional
heritage buildings,

00:19:02.764 --> 00:19:05.334
there are lots and lots
of restaurants and cafes,

00:19:05.334 --> 00:19:07.751
churches within this area,
and it's a very nice place

00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:10.311
just to walk around and leisurely stroll.

00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:12.543
What's really nice is that
the roads in this area

00:19:12.543 --> 00:19:14.568
are blocked off to
traffic, so they are all

00:19:14.568 --> 00:19:18.735
just walking streets, and
we are approaching a church.

00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:22.185
The first place that we've stumbled into

00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:24.575
is the old German Church,
so we're gonna just

00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:25.993
take a quick look inside.

00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:28.910
(soft piano music)

00:19:33.736 --> 00:19:36.807
I'm sitting down on one of the
pews within the church now,

00:19:36.807 --> 00:19:38.848
and what's really
impressive about this church

00:19:38.848 --> 00:19:41.192
are the stained glass windows.

00:19:41.192 --> 00:19:42.275
Look at that!

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.644
It's so colorful and so detailed.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.311
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:19:58.423 --> 00:20:01.468
Made it to one of the most iconic, scenic,

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:05.112
and the oldest public
squares in Gamla Stan,

00:20:05.112 --> 00:20:08.502
this was the historic center of Stockholm,

00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:11.876
and what I love so much is
all of these old buildings,

00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:13.680
and the way they are just contrasting

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.739
the really blue sky, the
sky is so blue, and then

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:19.886
the buildings are brown and
red and orange in color,

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:23.219
to just that contrast that intense blue.

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:35.398
That's some amazing water.

00:20:35.398 --> 00:20:38.093
Straight well water, that's way better

00:20:38.093 --> 00:20:40.010
than the bottled water.

00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:42.991
I was just reading about that well

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:44.622
where I just filled up my battle,

00:20:44.622 --> 00:20:46.561
and it's actually not a well anymore,

00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:48.665
it used to be a well but then it dried up,

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:52.695
now it is public water
that's coming through, and,

00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:55.184
but they had me fooled,
that's some really good water,

00:20:55.184 --> 00:20:57.249
it's fresh, and that being said,

00:20:57.249 --> 00:21:00.079
the water from the tap in Sweden is,

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:03.079
it tastes good, and it's very fresh.

00:21:05.142 --> 00:21:09.142
(bells tolling in the distance)

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.274
We caught a little bit of
the changing of the guards

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:17.588
at The Royal Palace.

00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:21.255
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:37.275
That was very pleasant, to
walk around the old streets

00:21:37.275 --> 00:21:39.942
of Stockholm, we're now crossing a bridge

00:21:39.942 --> 00:21:42.079
to the next island, and
there's a food truck

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:45.829
that I'm really looking
forward to eating at.

00:21:52.094 --> 00:21:55.251
When I asked you all
where to eat in Stockholm,

00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:57.511
this was one of the
number-one recommendations,

00:21:57.511 --> 00:21:59.204
so I am happy to be here.

00:21:59.204 --> 00:22:01.872
This is a little food stall
that's within a plaza,

00:22:01.872 --> 00:22:04.358
and they specialize in stromming,

00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:08.168
which is a type of fermented sea herring,

00:22:08.168 --> 00:22:11.007
and then I ordered, they have
a number of different plates

00:22:11.007 --> 00:22:13.736
that include the herring,
and you can get it

00:22:13.736 --> 00:22:15.923
with a full plate with mashed potatoes,

00:22:15.923 --> 00:22:18.605
but I decided to get the snack version,

00:22:18.605 --> 00:22:20.961
and so I got one with dark rye bread,

00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:24.616
and then he put on two
pieces of the fried herring,

00:22:24.616 --> 00:22:26.224
and then topped it with some mustard,

00:22:26.224 --> 00:22:28.584
and then topped it with
some onions and some dill.

00:22:28.584 --> 00:22:31.812
Stromming is a type of Baltic sea herring,

00:22:31.812 --> 00:22:36.257
and it is a very common
specialty in Swedish cuisine.

00:22:36.257 --> 00:22:38.153
This has then been, I
think it's been breaded

00:22:38.153 --> 00:22:42.153
and then deep-fried, and then
he topped it with some mustard

00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:44.211
and then some onions and some dill.

00:22:44.211 --> 00:22:48.084
I think the correct way to do
this is with a knife and fork.

00:22:48.084 --> 00:22:49.501
I'm gonna dig in.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.907
And then there's rye bread on the bottom.

00:22:55.028 --> 00:22:59.195
Oh, onions are missing, I
need some onions on this bite.

00:23:01.785 --> 00:23:05.035
Oh, and I got that whole piece of dill.

00:23:11.392 --> 00:23:12.225
Mm.

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:15.485
I just met up with Otto,
who is from Stockholm,

00:23:15.485 --> 00:23:16.664
nice to meet you, so good to see you--

00:23:16.664 --> 00:23:17.951
- Haven't come in years.

00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:19.284
- [Mark] Yes.

00:23:19.284 --> 00:23:21.635
So this one is not fermented.

00:23:21.635 --> 00:23:24.960
- No, it's not fermented,
it's just normal.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.793
- [Mark] It would be fresh.

00:23:25.793 --> 00:23:29.139
- [Otto] More fresh, yeah,
if you try the surstromming.

00:23:29.139 --> 00:23:30.577
- Okay, so then it's just stromming.

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:32.352
- Stromming, just regular stromming.

00:23:32.352 --> 00:23:34.335
- [Mark] It doesn't even
really have a fishy taste,

00:23:34.335 --> 00:23:36.080
it's actually very neutral-tasting,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.749
but the texture is really
good, it's nice and soft,

00:23:38.749 --> 00:23:41.605
it almost has a spreadable texture,

00:23:41.605 --> 00:23:43.045
and then because it's been deep-fried,

00:23:43.045 --> 00:23:45.044
it has a little bit of a crispy texture

00:23:45.044 --> 00:23:48.346
and edge around the crust around it,

00:23:48.346 --> 00:23:52.346
and then also, it's like
a sweet mustard on top,

00:23:53.299 --> 00:23:56.161
really good with the pickled onions,

00:23:56.161 --> 00:23:58.626
and just that little
bit of dill to give it

00:23:58.626 --> 00:24:00.078
a nice touch as well.

00:24:00.078 --> 00:24:03.991
And then also the bread
just makes the base of it.

00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:06.104
Let me take one more bite,
and making sure to get

00:24:06.104 --> 00:24:08.314
some of those onions.

00:24:08.314 --> 00:24:11.407
And we had a little bit of a chat,

00:24:11.407 --> 00:24:16.345
but they also have a fermented
version of the herring,

00:24:16.345 --> 00:24:17.778
but this one is more of the fresh version,

00:24:17.778 --> 00:24:20.441
and so that's why it has the actual very,

00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:23.160
a neutral taste, as opposed
to the fermented version,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.991
which I'm sure has a more of a,

00:24:24.991 --> 00:24:29.035
oh, my bread just fell
out, which has more of a,

00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:33.202
I'm sure has more of a
ripened strong flavor to it.

00:24:39.001 --> 00:24:40.284
Yeah.

00:24:40.284 --> 00:24:41.367
It's so good.

00:24:42.624 --> 00:24:45.541
The fish is just so soft, and then,

00:24:46.398 --> 00:24:49.195
complimented by that sweet
mustard and those pickled onions.

00:24:49.195 --> 00:24:52.997
We are now walking over
to a street that is,

00:24:52.997 --> 00:24:55.753
I think it's famous for
shopping in Stockholm.

00:24:55.753 --> 00:24:56.586
Gotgatan.

00:24:58.755 --> 00:25:01.168
- [Otto] It's like (speaks
off-mic), but street.

00:25:01.168 --> 00:25:02.668
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:06.778
- When are you recording?

00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:07.823
- [Mark] We are on!

00:25:07.823 --> 00:25:09.829
You guys can say whatever
you want on the video.

00:25:09.829 --> 00:25:11.624
- Alright, this is Otto, and Victor,

00:25:11.624 --> 00:25:13.431
here from Stockholm, Sweden.

00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:16.356
I've been traveling the
world to meet Mark Wiens--

00:25:16.356 --> 00:25:19.048
- And it was the coolest experience ever.

00:25:19.048 --> 00:25:22.279
- When I saw Mark Wiens
would come to my hometown,

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:24.300
I cried of happiness.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.638
To meet Mr. Tender in our
hometown is a dream come true.

00:25:28.638 --> 00:25:30.353
Thank you so much for coming here, Mark.

00:25:30.353 --> 00:25:31.342
- Thank you so much.

00:25:31.342 --> 00:25:32.175
- Last handshake of the day.

00:25:32.175 --> 00:25:33.139
- Nice to meet you.

00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:34.806
Awesome to meet you.

00:25:35.981 --> 00:25:37.506
Bye bye, guys.

00:25:37.506 --> 00:25:39.288
We are back at the metro station,

00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:42.506
and we are going to back
home, to Fridhemsplan.

00:25:42.506 --> 00:25:46.173
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:25:50.338 --> 00:25:52.246
We made it back to Fridhemsplan,

00:25:52.246 --> 00:25:54.364
we are gonna walk back now to our hotel.

00:25:54.364 --> 00:25:55.398
Now, on the way back to our hotel,

00:25:55.398 --> 00:25:59.264
we can see across the
intersection, some fruit stalls.

00:25:59.264 --> 00:26:03.431
(employee speaking foreign language)

00:26:07.377 --> 00:26:09.254
We ended up buying two
boxes of strawberries

00:26:09.254 --> 00:26:11.320
right as they were closing.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.796
And these are the last two boxes.

00:26:12.796 --> 00:26:15.410
And I think right now during
summer is strawberry season

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.774
in Sweden, so the strawberries
should be nice and fresh

00:26:18.774 --> 00:26:20.638
and ripe, and sweet.

00:26:20.638 --> 00:26:24.805
I will test them as soon
as we get back to our room.

00:26:27.372 --> 00:26:28.205
Mm!

00:26:30.427 --> 00:26:32.419
It's so juicy and so sweet.

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:34.193
This is my very first trip to Sweden,

00:26:34.193 --> 00:26:37.278
and today has been my
full day in Stockholm,

00:26:37.278 --> 00:26:40.489
and today has been just
absolutely beautiful weather,

00:26:40.489 --> 00:26:43.662
and I know the winter can be
extremely harsh in Stockholm,

00:26:43.662 --> 00:26:46.915
in the wintertime, but
this time in the summer

00:26:46.915 --> 00:26:48.186
is so beautiful.

00:26:48.186 --> 00:26:49.761
I'm gonna end the video for today now,

00:26:49.761 --> 00:26:51.896
thank you all very much for watching,

00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:54.235
please remember to give
this video a thumbs up,

00:26:54.235 --> 00:26:55.550
and also make sure you subscribe

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.662
if you're not already subscribed,

00:26:57.662 --> 00:26:59.493
and I will see you on the next video,

00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:01.024
thank you again for watching.

00:27:01.024 --> 00:27:01.857
(beep)

00:27:01.857 --> 00:27:03.331
And those pickled onions.

00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:07.498
Oh, and I didn't even
realize, I'm using two forks!

00:27:09.951 --> 00:27:11.916
It would definitely help to have a knife,

00:27:11.916 --> 00:27:14.294
but I will try to--

00:27:14.294 --> 00:27:15.702
- [Ying] Just bite it, Mark.

00:27:15.702 --> 00:27:16.556
- Just bite it?

00:27:16.556 --> 00:27:20.789
Okay, Ying says, I'm just
gonna take a bite out of it.

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:23.228
The next market that we
are walking to is called

00:27:23.228 --> 00:27:26.424
Ostermalmshallen, and I
believe that this is more

00:27:26.424 --> 00:27:29.404
of a heritage, traditional market,

00:27:29.404 --> 00:27:32.345
kind of a legendary market in Is,

00:27:32.345 --> 00:27:33.731
Istanbul.

00:27:33.731 --> 00:27:36.731
(upbeat drum music)
