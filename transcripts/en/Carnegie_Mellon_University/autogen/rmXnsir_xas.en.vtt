in particular the broader issues of
Sudan are issues of marginalization and

Sudan are issues of marginalization and
 

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.490
Sudan are issues of marginalization and
exclusion and that has to be dealt with

general Grayson may have more to say
about this but I'm very very skeptical

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:04.990
about this but I'm very very skeptical
 

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.650
about this but I'm very very skeptical
that the elections that are scheduled

that the elections that are scheduled
 

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.999
that the elections that are scheduled

for next month will go very far towards
 

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:13.929
for next month will go very far towards
addressing these issues

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:13.939
addressing these issues

most of Darfur today this offensive in
jebel marra by all accounts was

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:18.529
jebel marra by all accounts was
 

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:20.810
jebel marra by all accounts was
incredibly intense and incredibly

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820
incredibly intense and incredibly
 

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.350
incredibly intense and incredibly
violent and particularly had

a very negative effect on civilians and
 

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.060
a very negative effect on civilians and
I think the most disturbing part of that

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.070
I think the most disturbing part of that
 

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.880
I think the most disturbing part of that

apart from the immediate cost to
 

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.449
apart from the immediate cost to
civilians is what that says about the

00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:37.459
civilians is what that says about the
 

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.699
civilians is what that says about the
government's commitment to the safety of

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:39.709
government's commitment to the safety of
 

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:41.680
government's commitment to the safety of
civilians which is to say they don't

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:41.690
civilians which is to say they don't
 

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.910

have a commitment to the safety of

00:17:28.299 --> 00:17:28.309
political foundation for peace which has
 

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:31.600
political foundation for peace which has
not been built I referenced the fact

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:31.610
not been built I referenced the fact
 

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.780
not been built I referenced the fact
that for the elections that are

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:34.790
that for the elections that are
 

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.180
that for the elections that are
scheduled for next month that the IDPs

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:37.190
scheduled for next month that the IDPs
 

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.240
scheduled for next month that the IDPs
primarily will more or less will be

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.250
primarily will more or less will be
 

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.919
primarily will more or less will be
disenfranchised because they've not

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:41.929
disenfranchised because they've not
 

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:44.409
disenfranchised because they've not
participated in the process and in

00:17:44.409 --> 00:17:44.419
participated in the process and in
 

00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:46.090
participated in the process and in
general quite apart from their

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.100
general quite apart from their
 

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.919
general quite apart from their
participation in the electoral process

00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:47.929
participation in the electoral process
 

00:17:47.929 --> 00:17:50.740
participation in the electoral process
what we found in talking to a DPS was a

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:50.750
what we found in talking to a DPS was a
 

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.240
what we found in talking to a DPS was a
tremendous amount of alienation from the

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.250
tremendous amount of alienation from the
 

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.340
tremendous amount of alienation from the
government not surprisingly because it

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:57.350
government not surprisingly because it
 

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.140
government not surprisingly because it
was the government and militias allied

00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.150
was the government and militias allied
 

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.940
was the government and militias allied
with the government that displaced them

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:00.950
with the government that displaced them
 

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.370
with the government that displaced them
in the first place and we could find

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:03.380
in the first place and we could find
 

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.820
in the first place and we could find
very little evidence of any efforts

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:05.830
very little evidence of any efforts
 

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.620
very little evidence of any efforts
serious efforts by the government to

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:10.630
serious efforts by the government to
 

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:17.430
serious efforts by the government to
reach out to IDPs to create any kind of

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440
reach out to IDPs to create any kind of
 

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.830
reach out to IDPs to create any kind of
dialogue or communication people were

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840
dialogue or communication people were
 

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.400
dialogue or communication people were
fearful they were distrustful and they

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.410
fearful they were distrustful and they
 

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:31.900
fearful they were distrustful and they
were there marginalization which was the

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:31.910
were there marginalization which was the
 

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.220
were there marginalization which was the
cause of the violence in the first place

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.230
cause of the violence in the first place
 

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.190
cause of the violence in the first place
only deepened other issues in terms of a

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200
only deepened other issues in terms of a
 

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.990
only deepened other issues in terms of a
political foundation for peace that will

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000
political foundation for peace that will
 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
political foundation for peace that will
have to be addressed our conflict among

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.010
have to be addressed our conflict among
 

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.549
have to be addressed our conflict among
communities in Darfur again this is the

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559
communities in Darfur again this is the
 

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.289
communities in Darfur again this is the
type of role that the government should

00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299
type of role that the government should
 

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:47.720
type of role that the government should
be playing but in Darfur it historically

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:47.730
be playing but in Darfur it historically
 

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.789
be playing but in Darfur it historically
has not played and in fact has done the

has not played and in fact has done the
 

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:51.860
has not played and in fact has done the
opposite successor baited conflict among

final issue politically which also leads
 

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.700
final issue politically which also leads
into the next issue which is economic

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:04.710
into the next issue which is economic
 

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.850
into the next issue which is economic
foundation is the issue of land the

foundation is the issue of land the
 

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.650
foundation is the issue of land the
issue of land obviously was part of the

local conflict in Darfur those issues
 

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.940
local conflict in Darfur those issues
have only become more complicated in the

have only become more complicated in the
 

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.010
have only become more complicated in the
last few years people who have been

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020
last few years people who have been
 

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.840
last few years people who have been
displaced from the land still have a

displaced from the land still have a
 

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.659
displaced from the land still have a
claim to it and in some cases that lands

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:20.669
claim to it and in some cases that lands
 

00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:23.810
claim to it and in some cases that lands
been occupied by outsiders that's got to

been occupied by outsiders that's got to
 

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.610
been occupied by outsiders that's got to
be dealt with and in general the

be dealt with and in general the
 

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.240
be dealt with and in general the
availability of land and land tenure has

availability of land and land tenure has
 

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.799
availability of land and land tenure has
to be addressed in order for there to be

to be addressed in order for there to be
 

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:33.080
to be addressed in order for there to be
a political foundation for peace it will

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.090
a political foundation for peace it will
 

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.940
a political foundation for peace it will
also have to be addressed in order for

also have to be addressed in order for
 

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.530
also have to be addressed in order for
there to be an economic foundation of

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:36.540
there to be an economic foundation of
 

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.110
there to be an economic foundation of
for peace and on the economic question

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120
for peace and on the economic question
 

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.060
for peace and on the economic question
the two things that I would just

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.070
the two things that I would just
 

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.960
the two things that I would just
highlight our number one that in the

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:44.970
highlight our number one that in the
 

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.460
highlight our number one that in the
immediate sense there needs to be

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:46.470
immediate sense there needs to be
 

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.549
immediate sense there needs to be
unemployed herion access to the civilian

unemployed herion access to the civilian
 

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:53.500
unemployed herion access to the civilian
population in Darfur although the worst

population in Darfur although the worst
 

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.390
population in Darfur although the worst
potential for disaster that that could

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400
potential for disaster that that could
 

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.419
potential for disaster that that could
have happened with the expulsion a year

00:19:59.419 --> 00:19:59.429
have happened with the expulsion a year
 

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:01.370
have happened with the expulsion a year
ago of humanitarian organizations has

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380
ago of humanitarian organizations has
 

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.549
ago of humanitarian organizations has
not happened in part because of heroic

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559
not happened in part because of heroic
 

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:07.460
not happened in part because of heroic
efforts by UN agencies and by the egg

groups that were still there the

groups that were still there the

groups that were still there the
humanitarian operation providing

humanitarian operation providing
 

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.480
humanitarian operation providing
immediate relief still seems quite

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:14.490
immediate relief still seems quite
 

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:21.350
immediate relief still seems quite
rickety and that's in part exacerbated

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360
rickety and that's in part exacerbated
 

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.650
rickety and that's in part exacerbated
by by difficulties of access in some

by by difficulties of access in some
 

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.280
by by difficulties of access in some
ways the government has reduced some of

ways the government has reduced some of
 

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.740
ways the government has reduced some of
the obstacles to humanitarian access but

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:30.750
the obstacles to humanitarian access but
 

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.390
the obstacles to humanitarian access but
there's not unimpeded humanitarian

the foundation for development and to

the foundation for development and to
use resources in order to

use resources in order to
to create as I said economic foundation

economic foundation cannot be separated
 

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.680
economic foundation cannot be separated
from creating the political foundation

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:00.690
from creating the political foundation

from creating the political foundation
it's not something that can be figured

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000
it's not something that can be figured
 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.750
it's not something that can be figured
out in cartoon or figured out in Cairo

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760
out in cartoon or figured out in Cairo
 

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.640
out in cartoon or figured out in Cairo
where there's a donors conference that's

where there's a donors conference that's
 

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.110
where there's a donors conference that's
happening I guess starting tomorrow but

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120
happening I guess starting tomorrow but
 

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.799
happening I guess starting tomorrow but
it's got to be at to include

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:17.809
it's got to be at to include
 

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:21.530
it's got to be at to include
consultation and involvement from the

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:21.540
consultation and involvement from the
 

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.289
consultation and involvement from the
population that's on the ground and so

00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299
population that's on the ground and so
 

00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:26.210

hand-in-hand the political and the

hand-in-hand the political and the
economic foundations for peace have to

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:28.890
economic foundations for peace have to
 

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.710
economic foundations for peace have to
be constructed the final thing I'll

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720
be constructed the final thing I'll
 

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.789
be constructed the final thing I'll
touch on very briefly is an

00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799
touch on very briefly is an
 

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:33.770
touch on very briefly is an
international role I think it's very

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780
international role I think it's very
 

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.470
international role I think it's very
important to be clear that there is an

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480
important to be clear that there is an
 

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.750
important to be clear that there is an
international role in Sudan and what it

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760
international role in Sudan and what it
 

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.780
international role in Sudan and what it
is is to help create a space for

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:41.790
is is to help create a space for
 

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.860
is is to help create a space for
Sudanese to resolve the issues of Sudan

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:44.870
Sudanese to resolve the issues of Sudan
 

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.120
Sudanese to resolve the issues of Sudan
without the use of extreme violence

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.130
without the use of extreme violence
 

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.299
