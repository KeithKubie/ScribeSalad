00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.459
 Whether Pixar's short-term memory loss or the saying "he owns 

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:09.620
 Golden fish brain "we are constantly told that fish are simple and have weak memories 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.009
 But are they more complex than we think? 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.510
 This is the illusion of rotating snakes - when you move your eyes, the snakes will appear to be moving 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.460
 In a circle but in fact the picture is static. It turns out that fish sees this illusion 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.140
 In a similar way to you and me. Although the fish is different from wild vertebrates, it has since 450 million 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.190
 One year, the two developed a vision similar to hunting, escaping predators and avoiding collisions. 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.800
 The researchers hypothesized that we see the same motor illusion as a result of "evolution 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.710
 Convergent "organism, where non-living organisms that are associated with each other develop independently similar traits 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.820
 As a result of their need to adapt to a similar environment. 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 Which of these red circles is the largest? Often your eyes will tell you that they are falling 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.190
 On the right, the fish will think so too. But they turned out to be the same size. 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.780
 In a study at the Sprintfins' Redtail, the fish were trained to distinguish between the tablets 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.009
 Different sizes and preference for larger disks. And when they display similar illusion they choose 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.929
 The largest is imaginary. 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.149
 What about the duration of attention? In a special report they found that the length of human attention 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.999
 Less than 12 seconds in 2000, to 8 seconds today. Our use of the Internet 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.859
 The instruments explain that he plays a role but - whatever - the goldfish has 9 seconds duration 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.299
 Attention, beyond my human rights 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.960
 When it comes to forgetting, a study done using African tilapia gave fish a diet as a reward 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.030
 A certain area of ​​the aquarium for 3 consecutive days. Then they gave the fish 12 days 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.909
 Take a break before starting to re-apply in the aquarium. Using the motion tracking software 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.829
 Tilapia showed a special preference for the area in the basin where 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.359
 They previously received the reward. Studies have also shown that golden fish can remember things 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.619
 At least for 3 months; distinguish between shapes, colors, sounds, and even discrimination 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.069
 The labyrinths. Above all, the golden fish can identify its owner. In the end, the fish showed 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.249
 They have a good memory for them - after all they need to remember prey and avoid predators 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.189
 And also avoid our traps after they were caught in the past. 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.220
 But when it comes to pain we really disagree with fish. When you hurt 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.040
 Yourself, your body has sensory receptors called "nussi sputose" that send signals to the cortex where sensation 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.350
 The pain is treated there. But a lot of fish lacks sensory receptors and all the fish lacks cortex, so this is pain 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.820
 Not tested the same way. 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.050
 When "Finding Nemo" was published, hundreds of fish were released 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.020
 But in fact these fish often die because of a blow or exposure to fresh water. In addition to that 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.070
 Researchers are concerned that the launch of "cyclical finding" will further decrease the population of aquariums 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.480
 Where many people would like to take the Royal Blue Tang as a pet 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.840
 So we decided to do a video of 8 other amazing marine animals in "AsapTHOUGHT", where we visited 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.540
 Aquarium for personal inspection. Our lakes and oceans are full of some beautiful wildlife 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.690
