afternoon, I am thrilled to be here

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.580
and doubly thrilled to have
those two amazing introductions.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.290
As you've now heard twice,
there was a film that came

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.270
out in 2013 called The Girl Rising
and I went to that film just

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.480
as a regular moviegoer in my
downtown theater in Burlington,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.270
Vermont with my teenagers
and some of their friends.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.210
And it's a remarkable film and I'm
going to give you a small taste

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.780
of what that film is now and
when that couple of minutes is

somewhat backward story

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.720
of how a film became a book.

up now that would be wonderful.

[ Applause ]

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:43.580
So, like I said, in 2013, I
went to see this film and it was

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.010
about as perfect as a
film could be really.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.670
It's mostly a documentary about why
there are 62 million girls globally

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.610
not being educated.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.280
And as I said, I was
with a group of teenagers

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.960
and we had an amazing conversation
that night after the film

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.900
and they were very impacted
by the powerful stories

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.630
and the girls themselves and could
speak after the film a little bit

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.070
about what these major obstacles
to education are, which was great.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.370 position:56%
Because the whole time I was sitting

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.080
in the movie my book
brain was going nuts.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.980
I was thinking okay great,
this is about nine girls,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.170
how many more girls must these
filmmakers have met in order

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.030
to have been able to
narrow it down to nine girls

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.790
and how many more are there and in
what other countries did they visit

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.660
and what kind of wealth of archival
information must these filmmakers

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.320
have had.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.840 position:56%
So, we had this great conversation
and a couple of weeks later I talked

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.450
to those same teenagers again

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.790
and they still really remembered
the girls and their stories

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.390
and the emotional takeaway.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.340
But when I asked them what the
obstacles to education were really

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.000
like they could name them, what
are they, why do they occur,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.300
where do they happen

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.640
that information hadn't
really been retained.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.690
And so, that really confirmed what
I had been thinking that night

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.450
in the theater that here was
this incredibly powerful tool,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.620
but wouldn't it be amazing to be
able to sit down and have a book

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.620
that you could open and go
slowly through and kind of pour

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.190 position:56%
over that maybe had some
infographics and maps and statistics

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.350
and really unpacked
all of these obstacles.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.550
And I just thought I really,
really want to do this.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.770
And so, I did something
a little bit nervy,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.350
but people know me won't think
that's too much out of my nature

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.330
and I sent an e-mail
to info@girlrising

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.950
and I very brazenly just
said like this is who I am

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.280
and this is what I do for a
living and this is what I think.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.530
I really think that this movie
should be turned into a book,

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.570
does anybody there
want to talk to me.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.170
And in remarkably short
order I was put on the phone

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.170
with Kayce Freed Jennings, who
is in the audience tonight.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.080
And we had this incredible
first conversation

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.240
where we were finishing
each other's sentences

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.610
and our visions were the
same for what this could be.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.640
And lo and behold she had wanted
to make a book out of this film,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.870
but they weren't bookmakers
they were filmmakers right.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.570
And so, it was kind
of a perfect marriage

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.660
that just unfolded and here we are.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.720
So, how the collaboration worked
is that I did not use the script

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.420
of the film because it's as
I said not a true documentary

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.450
for many reasons, some of which
are that some of the girls needed

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.640 position:56%
to be identity protected and some of
the scenes needed to be reimagined

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.150
and recreated for the film right.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.180
So, instead what I decided to do
was completely start from scratch

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.350
and use all of their raw video
footage of all of the interviews

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.890
that they did with every girl
they met and their photographic,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.720 position:56%
there still photographic archive
and they very generously sent me all

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.430
of this on like a trilobite
hard drive and I started pouring

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.150
through it with headphones on my
head and just you know listening

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.250
to the girls speak in
their native languages

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.990 position:56%
and the translators translating them
and really starting to get to know

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.430
who some of these girls were.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.330
So, we'll talk more about
that as I go through this

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.830
and you can ask questions about
it if you have them as we go.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.340
But what I decided to do was to
tackle the book in three parts,

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.630
the stakes, the stories
and the solutions.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.600
And the stories still remain
the bulk of the project,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.120
it's about two thirds of the book.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.500
The stories are the
girls' stories themselves.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.300
In the stakes in part one I
really just wanted to kind of slow

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.720
down like I said and be able

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.460
to really unpack what are these
obstacles to education, poverty

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.410
and gender discrimination
are the big umbrellas,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.600
but underneath those umbrellas are
modern-day slavery, child marriage

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.540
and no access or limited
access to education.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.540
And really kind of slow down and
talk about why those things happen,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.290
what factors affect those things
from happening, and you know kind

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.720
of ease people into it with
a historical larger context

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.000 position:56%
that they could then have while they
move on to reading about the girls.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.590
And this is just one example
of an infographic that's

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.810
in the book, there are several.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:36.540
So part two, part two is the
heart of the book as it is heart

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.630
of the film, it's the stories.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.450
And one thing that was
really important to me to do

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.520 position:56%
in the book was to add as many girls
as possible since the film focused

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.480
on the nine girls from nine
different countries I wanted to get

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.020 position:56%
in as many girls as I could, even
if it might be in just a photograph.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.580 position:56%
And in fact, this particular chapter
opener of this beautiful girl,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.960
this is Roxanna's older
sister, Rose.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.770
So, Roxanne is covered in the film
and also she's featured in the book

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.620
and I didn't have enough
information to write about Rose,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.390
so instead we get to see her in
the book and that was one way

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.140
that I added even more
girls than the ones

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.380
that I was able to write about.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.520 position:56%
So many girls from so many different
places and one way to fit more

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.760
of them in was then in the stories
instead of going country by country

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.690
to go by obstacle to education.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.000
So, within the bulk of the book
that's called the stories there are

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.090
smaller chapters on modern-day
slavery, on child marriage

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.810
and on limited or no
access to education.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:44.560
And that is Suma who's
also our cover girl.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:52.740
In all of these chapters I start
out again sort of slowing down

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.280
and talking about what
is modern-day slavery,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.700
what is considered slavery,
where is it happening.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.450
And one of the things
that I was most struck

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.250
by during this process
was in the slavery section

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:14.870
that slavery is illegal
everywhere and happens everywhere.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.960
And that is just sort of a shocking
thing to kind of let sink in

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.000
and to understand what some people
are going through in the world.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.460
And slavery can happen
for a number of reasons,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.180
it can happen for generational
and cultural reasons in places

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.690
in the world that it's been
happening for a long time

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.160
like in Nepal with the
Kumari girls or it can happen

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.620
in refugee situations or
it can happen in areas

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.890
where there are natural
disasters like in Haiti

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.390
after the big earthquake.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:48.630 position:56%
This is when [inaudible] and there's
forced labor that's still existing

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.050
in all over the world today
which is kind of heartbreaking.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.480
But the thing that we
keep coming back to in all

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.850
of these stories is
education being the key,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.490
that education is the single
most powerful tool that we have,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.320
investing in a girl's education

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.650
to literally changing the
way the world functions.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.150
And look at those beautiful faces.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.630
One of the things that also struck
me as I was going through this

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.990
that I actually stopped
and kind of reconciled

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.920
and we had some conversations
about is if you flip

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.750
through this book you will
notice how beautiful it is

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.130
and how beautiful the girls are and
you see these smiling, joyful faces

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.450
and you sort of think, but wait a
minute this is really dark tough

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.780
material about very terrible
things that are happening

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.840
in the world why are
all these girls smiling.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.580
Well, these girls are all
smiling because we met them

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.310
after they had been rescued from
the situations that they were

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.680
in and they were in school.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.220
And it was really poignant to sort
of stop and remember that and kind

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.370
of wrestle with that and think it's
okay that this book is as beautiful

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:00.920
as it is because these are
the faces of resilient people.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.640 position:56%
The child marriage section also goes
through what that sordid details are

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.150
of why child marriage
happens, where it happens.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.520
This map, I'm very proud of this
map, it took a very long time

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.130
to make and the thing I want
to point out the most to you is

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.560
that the gray areas are not areas

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.390
in which child marriage does
not happen they are areas

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.640
in which we don't have enough
data to show you where it happens

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.590
and you'll notice that the
United States is included

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.000
in that gray area.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.750
So, child marriage does happen
everywhere and it's something

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.100
that we need to pay
attention to globally.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.540
All over the world
this is happening.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:49.130
And I included this picture here
to sort of make a point about one

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.190
of the things that we were
able to do in the book.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.740
Some of the girls in the
film were portrayed by actors

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.330
and this is an example of that.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.040 position:56%
And Yasmine, which is not her real
name, was very adamant about wanting

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.660
to be included in the book, which
is another thing that we kind

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.450 position:56%
of all talked about and wrestled
with and came to a conclusion about.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.000
And the reason that we agreed
to let her be in the book

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.330
and show her picture is A,
it was her choice and B,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.850
she's certain that by only
showing her eyes she would not

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.150
be recognized.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.210 position:56%
And it was just one more opportunity
for us to honor the bravery

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.280
and the resilience of all of
these girls that are dealing

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.740
with these issues in their lives.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.480
Another thing that was kind of
incredible for me to take away is

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.920
that we tend, we in the developed
more privileged world we tend

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.930
to look at some of these
issues around the world

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:55.660
and get a little maybe
judgmental thinking

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.320
that we know what's
best for other people.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.520
And so, there's a big difference
between becoming educated

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.560
and becoming aware of what's
happening in the world and helping

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.650
and being activists versus
thinking that we know what's best

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.070
for any particular group of
people or person frankly.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.700
So, one of the things
that I remembered very,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.400
very often while I was researching

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.310
and writing this book was what
a privilege it was to be able

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.440
to be doing this work and to
remember that I was doing it

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.610 position:56%
from the comfort of my heated home
with clean water and plenty of food,

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.480
and school that is free for
my kids in this country.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.860
Because yes, poverty and gender
discrimination happens everywhere

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.080
and America isn't included in
this book and neither is Europe.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.870
But the main difference is
because we have school that is free

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.430
and in all of these other
countries grappling with all

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.870
of these other problems
school is not free and so

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.170
that becomes a huge barrier.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:53.060
If a family is struggling with
being able to put food on the table

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.670
or having enough clothing or having
enough shelter adding the fees

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.220
that a school is going to require
makes it that much more difficult.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.950
And when families are able
to handle some school fees

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.290
and they have multiple children
it's generally speaking the boys

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.780
that are going to get that
chance to go to school

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.660
because the girls are going
to be kept home help care

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.820
for the siblings, carry water
gather firewood, etcetera.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.600
And so, those are some of
the reasons that explain kind

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.190
of why these things are happening

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.450
and why they've been
happening for so long.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:30.450
But what I started to learn and
see is that our sort of reaction

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.700
to let's say a mother who is going

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.300
to marry her child off early
our reaction is oh my gosh,

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.630
how terrible is that, what a
terrible mother that must be.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.770
Well no, that's our
opinion being imposed

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.870
on another culture that's
doing things the best they can

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.280
under the circumstances
that they're dealing with.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.140
And so, Azmera's story in the
film is a perfect example of that.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.680
Azmera's mother is the farthest
thing from a terrible mother

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.030
that you could find, she's a
loving mother, she's a mother

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.470
who is certain that marrying
her daughter is the best way

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.830
to have her have a successful and
a positive and a healthy life.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.500 position:56%
And what's starting to happen that's

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:18.000
so amazing is this next
generation is starting to stand up

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.790
and say there is a different
way, there is a better way.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.570
And so, the stories like Azmera's
are very hopeful and inspiring

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.590
because there we have Azmera's
brother kind of running

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.610
in from the field to talk to her
mother who's about to hand her off

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.410
in marriage and say no,
there's another way,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.180
which then in turn gives
Azmera the courage to stand up

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.660
and say I don't want to be
married let's find a better way.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.930
In general, we need these
father figures around the world

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.860
to help stand up for
girls and women.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.380
Their energy is needed, their
input is needed and we see more

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.420
of those stories and I was
sort of getting that theme

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.180
as I was watching the film
that that might be the case

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.560
and that there might
be more information

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.280
about that and in fact that's true.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.600
And so, one of the
things I wanted to include

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.550
in the book was a feature
called father figures to sort

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.750
of highlight some of the
men who are doing this

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.230
and get that message across.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.840
Access to education in general
is also a very huge problem

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.990
if you just even think
about it a little bit.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:29.310
Even if there's a school nearby
there might not be enough teachers

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.880
or there may not be enough desks
or books or facility in general,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.820
there also might not
be transportation,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.150
a means of getting there.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.430
If your school is 10 miles
away from your village

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.840
and your family doesn't have a
car or even a horse or a donkey,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.190
then you're a girl you have to walk
that 10 miles to and from school

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.690
and it's not particularly
safe in some cases.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:54.420
So, these are all things that
kind of increase the problems

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.480 position:56%
that are happening in the countries.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.980
But again and again and
again, we come across girls

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.430
who are being helped and what
Girl Rising did was they partnered

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.240
with nongovernmental
organizations, NGOs on the ground

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.200
who are already working
with successful groups

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.300
to get successful plans that
were getting girls into school.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.930
So, over and over again we
see girls, look at this girl,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.890
look at her face she is
just determined to walk

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.970
through where she has to walk
through to get to school.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.450
Now Sohka is an excellent
example of a girl

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:38.450
who was literally five years
ago living and working in a dump

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.640
in Cambodia and now she is just
starting her sophomore year

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.630
in college in Chicago.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:51.370
Think about that, I mean that's
astonishing to me and we have

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:56.770
to remember that these
stories are stories of girls,

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.330
they are not stories of
particularly extraordinary girls,

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.190
some of them are, some
of them aren't.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.970 position:56%
But what we can't do is look at this

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.410
and think oh well these are just
extraordinary girls who went

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.470
from a dump to a college
in five years, no.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.370
And that's sort of the major
point that we want to remember.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.930
These are just regular girls
living out their lives just

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.450
like girls here, girls thinking
about clothes, girls thinking

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.460
about boys, girls thinking
about family and friends.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.320
And if you can educate
them and get them

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.590
into school their entire
lives change.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.070
They're not other girls in
other places they're just girls

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.870
who need an education.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.740
And there she is holding
the Girl Rising book,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.690
pretty happy to be included in it

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.860
and we're pretty happy
to be in touch with her.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.710
Sohka and I are Facebook friends,

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.890
which is just mind-boggling
you know, I mean I can tweet

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.070
about this later on in and
chat with her on Facebook

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.640
and there she is just a little
brilliant girl now getting an

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.040
education in Chicago.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.240
So, the third part of the
book is all about you,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.490
it's all about activism, what
can we do to help effect change.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.950
And that can seem very
overwhelming, can't it?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.850
I mean we're talking about
gender, discrimination and poverty

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.100
and slavery and child marriage,
and no access to education.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.520
So, what can you do?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.050
And the reason I wanted to take
the whole third part of the book

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.310
and really talk about that is

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.160
because you can do a lot,
you can do a whole lot.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.960
And the best way to kind of
get a handle on what you can do

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.810
and how you can help is to think
about what are your passions just

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.170
as a human being in the world.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:50.090
Do you love to bike, you could
put together a fundraiser biking

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.380
and raise money for a group
like Pink Bike in Cambodia

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.780
which buys bikes for girls
in Cambodia to bike to school

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.670
and that's just one tiny example?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.020
So, in the third part of the
book I talk about different ways

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.590
that you can become activists

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.220
and I also give you some
starting ideas not only in terms

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.900
of linking it to your passions like
writing or art, but actual lists

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.260
of organizations that are
doing this kind of good work.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.130
And the list of organizations
isn't meant to sort of direct

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.340
where you send your help it's
just a way to get you started.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.400
And I say that in the back
of the book and we also have

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.520
that information on the
girlrising.com website.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.210
And so, really finding out how
to help and finding out how

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.060
to be an active person in
the world, an active citizen

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.360
of the world is what I'm after
in this section and I hope

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.970
that you find that inviting
and inspiring to do.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.110
That's Azmera actually, look
at that face, that is the face

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.350
of a girl ready for anything.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:07.900
And that's what we hope for
every girl who has an education

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.610
to dream big, to follow their
dreams and to have possibility.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:18.190
So, I would love to
answer questions now.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.510
Thank you.

come to, to ask questions.

etcetera, etcetera.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.060
You also point mentioned some

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.610
of it is a cultural bias I just
want to ask you about this.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.000
Obviously, we've seen
in a lot of countries

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.620
which have very strong male
dominated culture it's almost

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:27.830
like culturally it tends to deprive
girls and women of certain rights

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.970
that we in the west accept.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:35.670
And sometimes even in trying
to do well it can lead

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.510
to [inaudible] consequences where
for example in China when they used

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.960 position:56%
to do the one child policy there's
becomes this disproportionate number

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.690
of boys because of either.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.990
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Right.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.610
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] or just
scattered on the roadways.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.820
Do you have any thoughts
about the general

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.080
of that male-dominated
cultures and what influence

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.460
that has and any comments on it?

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.760
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone:
Well there's no question

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.770
that there are male-dominated
cultures in the world.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.270
There's also no question that
there are males in those countries

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.570
that don't feel that way.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:14.660
And I think, you know, anyone
from one country isn't going

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.690
to change how an entire culture
in another country works.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:23.220
But there are a lot of
nongovernmental organizations

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.060
in a lot of places where the
culture is dominated by males

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.810
and that's one way of women
getting help in those countries.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.410
And another way is what I was
talking about in terms of brothers,

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.110
cousins, grandfathers, uncles.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.120
If you start looking for those
stories you will find a lot of them

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.260
and you know I can't
pretend that there's any way

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.390 position:56%
to change how another culture works.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.300 position:56%
But I think there is hope in some
of the ways that things are starting

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.630
to be handled differently
now than they were before.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:57.930
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.220
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Hi.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.990
&gt;&gt; Because you spent quite a bit
of time on section one and two

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.530
of your beautiful book could you
please enumerate a little bit more

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:12.730
besides the pink bicycle idea how
we here because we're all here

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.630
and can be immediately activated
before we even read your book what

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.180
else you have suggested in
section three of your book,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.490
just a few more ideas please.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.790
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Sure.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.360
&gt;&gt; In summary.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.240
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: There are some
groups in Afghanistan that work

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.990
with women writers, teen writers

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.040
and adult writers they
have mentoring programs

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.920
so that you can help women writers

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.520
in that country be
heard, have their voice.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.830
Learn how to use computers.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.670
Oh gosh, there are so many.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:54.530
Room to Read has programs and
Plan International and UNICEF,

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:59.390 position:56%
there are so many programs
happening that I'm actually blanking

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.250
on the details of some of them.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.380
But do you remember any offhand?

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.680
&gt;&gt; I haven't read your book yet.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.510
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: No Kayce.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:27.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.050 position:56%
Holding screenings of the film
itself yeah, it gets massive amounts

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.480
of kids together to do that.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.850
&gt;&gt; I see all right, thank you.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:40.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was curious about your plan
going forward, are you going to stay

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.170
in touch with the girls
and have a follow-up

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.560
on how they're doing in the future?

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Yeah, one of the
great things about this organization

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.740
and this global movement for
girls is that Girl Rising

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.590 position:56%
and through the help of their
sponsors is helping all of the girls

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.700
who are featured and their siblings

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.980
through secondary school
with funding.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.540
And we're keeping track of
as many of them as we can.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.280
And the other thing that's
in the third section other

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.210
than activism are actually updates
on a lot of the girls who we know

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.680
about and what they're doing.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.720
So, we follow them as best we can.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.100
It's really actually so much
fun to get updates on them

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.520
and find out what they're doing.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.410
&gt;&gt; Are there any girls from the
archives that you didn't include?

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.710
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Oh, yes.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.010
I mean there are a lot of
girls from the archives

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.470
that I wasn't able to include.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.330
I couldn't literally
couldn't fit everybody in,

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.340
but what I did do was I tried
to fit in as many of them.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.320 position:56%
And so, if there was then I included
a little bit about them if I could

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.090
and if there wasn't in some cases,
I included their photograph.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.430
But just the sheer volume of
the number of girls and limited

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.290
by the number of pages
in a book not all

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.150
of them could be in
there unfortunately.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.740
There are actually though more of
them on the Girl Rising website

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.480
that aren't in the book or
in the film, some of them are

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.510
on the Girl Rising website.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.590
So, we actually have a
couple of different ways

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.600
to present these girls to the world

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.310
and have more information
out there about them.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.610
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.030
&gt;&gt; I was just curious to know
if you have personally met

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.020
or spent any time with the
girls who you profiled?

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.460
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone:
Unfortunately, I haven't been able

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.400
to spend any face-to-face
time with them.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.250
As I said, Sohka and I chat online.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.000
The timing of it if you just think

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.050
about the timing of
any media projects.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.600
The film came out in 2013,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.440
which means that the Girl Rising
folks were meeting these girls

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:46.120
in like 2011 and then I came along
2013, but it was really 2014, 2015,

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.510
2016 that we were working
on the book

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.960 position:56%
and it just wasn't feasible just
you know from a travel point of view

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.880
and where the girls were and how
old they had gotten in some cases.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.180
&gt;&gt; I understand.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.480
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Yeah,
that would've been amazing.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.370
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was wondering if having
been involved with this kind

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.820
of changed the way you think about
like western schools in a way

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.890 position:56%
because even just after hearing your
presentation it seems so callous

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.640
to complain about math
homework or something

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.370
when so many girls would jump
at a chance to have that.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.020
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Yeah,
no it's totally true.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.380
It actually changed
me in so many ways,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.370
including not just math homework,

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:27.200
but you know the school
bus ride right.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.320
Like our kids complain about
not wanting to take the bus

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.250
because for whatever
reason, it's noisy,

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.580
it's stressful, it
takes a long time.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.270
But then you think about these
girls in all of these places

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.450
that have no way at all
to even get to school,

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.080
let alone complain
about math homework.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:49.070
And one of the things that I
was really tickled by was a lot

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.210
of the girls talking about what
their favorite parts of school were

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:57.610
in the videos, in their interview
videos and one girl said recess,

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.140
which was pretty adorable,
she was very young.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.770
But most of the girls liked science
and they liked math and they were

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.610
so excited about all of these
things that we take for granted

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.930 position:56%
and they wanted to be doctors and
they want to be judges and they want

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.950
to do all of these
incredible things you know

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.000
because they don't
take it for granted.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.990
And it would be lovely if we could
figure out a way to have some

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.250
of that spill over since we
do take things for granted

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.170
because we don't have to think
about it because school is free

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.120
and because school bus
transportation is free

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.420
in most instances.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:37.320
It would be a great way if we
could find -- if somebody like you,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.510
if some young person could find
a way to have that spill over so

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:46.970
that our kids in school today have
a little taste of that and are sort

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.040
of more grateful, I
mean it's not really

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.470
in the nature of the beast you now.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.500
I mean, I complained about
school too when I was a kid,

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.400
but it is really eye-opening and it
is horizon broadening to just sort

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.270 position:56%
of immerse yourself in some of this
even for the smallest amount of time

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:12.210
and be grateful and be happy for
what we are privileged to have.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.800
&gt;&gt; Hi, so my question is
about you say girls rise

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.150
when they get education, what
does that education look like?

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.850
Here you see the emphasis on
STEM for girls getting ahead,

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.990
but in other cultures we may
not understand does that look

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.870
like giving them technical skills,

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.180
does it look like a typical
secondary education you get

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.650
in the United States like
what does it look like?

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.540
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Your microphone
is cutting in and out a little bit,

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.300
but I think you're asking me what
does getting an education mean

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.600
in some of these other countries.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.920
&gt;&gt; What does it look like?

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.220
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone:
What does it look like.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.360
&gt;&gt; Is it STEM focused,
is it technical focused.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.510
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: It can
be in some places it can be,

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.980
but in a lot of places where
we're talking about we're talking

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.920
about the basic fundamentals
of education

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.030
that aren't happening otherwise.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:05.760
So, literacy and math and basic
science and history and literature,

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.120
you know the roots of an education.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.460
And in many cases, there can be
more than that and there are more

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.300
than that, more programs than that.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.960
But what we're really hoping to do
is expand the general foundation

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.720
of education for everyone,
girls and boys.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.070
&gt;&gt; Hi, did the documentary and
book force any of the governments

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.930
to change their attitudes
in these countries?

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.820
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Are you asking
if the documentary was responsible

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.580
for any governmental changes?

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like policy change
or anything like that.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.510
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone: Kayce,
do you know if that's true?

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.560
&gt;&gt; All right, thank you both.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.320
&gt;&gt; Hello, so the other
individual who was talking

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.690 position:56%
about how she complains about math
and how it seems trivial to complain

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.460
about math homework now kind of
made me think about my own career.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.330
I teach EASL students, so
students who speak English

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.370
as a second language and so I
teach a lot of immigrant students

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.980
and the reason why I love
this movie so much is

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.600
because my students
feel the same way

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.690
about education as
these young women do.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.900
So, I was wondering if you
ever thought about doing a book

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.670
about interviewing immigrant
students here and kind of thinking

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:16.610
about what their thoughts are on
education and how excited they are

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.470
to be here because that's the
thing I see in my classroom

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.660
like they're really
excited to be here?

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.960
&gt;&gt; Tanya Lee Stone:
That's a really great point

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.150
and a really interesting question
and I actually would love to talk

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.450
to you more about that,
so if you want

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:30.400
to find me later we
can we talk about that.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.260
Well I have been given
the wrap it up sign.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.340
And so, I wanted to just
thank you all for coming

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.340
and your great questions and
thank the National Book Festival

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.940
for having me and I'm so glad

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.420
that you have this
introduction to Girl Rising.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.940 position:56%
If you haven't seen the film please
do, it's an amazingly powerful tool.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.380
The book is hopefully
inspiring and useful and helpful

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.580
and there's also free
curriculum guides for any teachers

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.060
and librarians out there.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.860
Thank you so much.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:10.500
[ Applause ]

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.700

presentation of the Library

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.140
