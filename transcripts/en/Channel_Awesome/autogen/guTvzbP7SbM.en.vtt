argue a little bit for it because
 

00:10:56.529 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%
argue a little bit for it because

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
I think the shot visually does show that
 

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
I think the shot visually does show that
because<00:11:06.790><c> it</c><00:11:06.940><c> is</c><00:11:07.120><c> off-kilter</c><00:11:07.540><c> it</c><00:11:07.870><c> is</c><00:11:08.200><c> awkward</c>

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:08.830 align:start position:0%
because it is off-kilter it is awkward
 

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.949 align:start position:0%
because it is off-kilter it is awkward
it<00:11:09.040><c> is</c><00:11:09.220><c> strange</c><00:11:09.730><c> I</c><00:11:10.089><c> think</c><00:11:10.300><c> it's</c><00:11:10.600><c> very</c><00:11:10.720><c> much</c>

00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
it is strange I think it's very much
 

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:12.570 align:start position:0%
it is strange I think it's very much
like<00:11:10.990><c> a</c><00:11:11.230><c> photograph</c><00:11:11.770><c> a</c><00:11:11.800><c> lot</c><00:11:12.010><c> of</c><00:11:12.070><c> photography</c>

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:12.580 align:start position:0%
like a photograph a lot of photography
 

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.250 align:start position:0%
like a photograph a lot of photography
yeah<00:11:12.700><c> but</c><00:11:12.850><c> then</c><00:11:13.000><c> you</c><00:11:13.180><c> shot</c><00:11:13.540><c> yeah</c><00:11:13.930><c> but</c><00:11:14.140><c> then</c>

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:14.260 align:start position:0%
yeah but then you shot yeah but then
 

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but then you shot yeah but then
you're<00:11:14.410><c> shot</c><00:11:14.740><c> after</c><00:11:15.010><c> that</c><00:11:15.550><c> doesn't</c><00:11:16.300><c> match</c>

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:16.570 align:start position:0%
you're shot after that doesn't match
 

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.269 align:start position:0%
you're shot after that doesn't match
that<00:11:16.900><c> then</c><00:11:17.230><c> I</c><00:11:17.260><c> will</c><00:11:17.529><c> look</c><00:11:17.650><c> at</c><00:11:17.830><c> in</c><00:11:17.950><c> the</c><00:11:18.040><c> video</c>

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
that then I will look at in the video
 

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:19.530 align:start position:0%
that then I will look at in the video
it's<00:11:18.400><c> not</c><00:11:18.550><c> focusing</c><00:11:18.940><c> on</c><00:11:19.029><c> that</c><00:11:19.209><c> versus</c>

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:19.540 align:start position:0%
it's not focusing on that versus
 

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
it's not focusing on that versus

just can't tell what you're looking at
and<00:13:21.850><c> again</c><00:13:22.089><c> like</c><00:13:22.360><c> John</c><00:13:22.810><c> Adams</c><00:13:23.020><c> I</c><00:13:23.290><c> think</c><00:13:23.470><c> works</c>

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
and again like John Adams I think works
 

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.699 align:start position:0%

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:26.709 align:start position:0%
because you can take breaks you can
 

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
