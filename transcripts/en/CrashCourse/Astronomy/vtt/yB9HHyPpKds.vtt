00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, Phil Plait here and this is Crash Course
Astronomy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.320
Since humans have been human we’ve looked
to the skies for portents of the future.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.620
The Sun, the Moon, the planets, the stars;
they’ve all been used for prognostication.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.800
And so have comets.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.340
A fuzzy blob, moving slowly across the stars?
How could soothsayers resist?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.920
But now we know a lot more about comets.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.740
They’re beautiful, fascinating, and can bring
both life and death upon our little world.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.940
Comets have been seen the sky since antiquity.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.680
Comet Halley, for example, is shown in the
Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.580
invasion of the British Isles in the year
1066.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.260
It was seen by ancient Chinese and Greeks, too.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.080
In general, and like everything else in the
sky, comets were considered omens or

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.880
harbingers of human events.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.500
Sometimes they were good omens —

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.129
William the Conqueror liked his chances in
1066 after seeing one —

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.900
and sometimes bad — that same comet didn’t
do so well for King Harold II.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.580
A comet bright enough to see with the naked
eye shows up in the heavens

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.380
every few years or so, and some can get spectacularly
bright.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.260
In 2007, I saw Comet McNaught very near the
Sun in broad daylight!

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.420
When you think of a comet, you probably picture a
fuzzy blob and a long tail stretching away from it.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.260
Fair enough. But there’s a bit more to them
than that.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.700
Comets are in many ways similar to asteroids.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.840
They’re roughly hewn chunks of stuff left
over from the formation of the solar system.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.800
Unlike asteroids, which are mostly rock with
a dash of ice and maybe metal,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.620
comets are a more balanced mixture of ice
and rock.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.320
And by “ice” I mean frozen water -- but
also frozen carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.529
methane, ammonia -- things we normally think
of as gases on Earth.

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:54.129
And by “rock” I do mean rocks, but also
gravel and dust.

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:59.169
In fact, astronomers sometimes call comets
“dirty snowballs,” which isn’t a half-bad term.

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.420
It’s that ice that makes comets, well, comets.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.360
When they’re way out in deep space they’re so cold
that they’re basically inert lumps of ice and rock.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.780
But many are on elliptical orbits that take
them from those sub-freezing

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.370
depths into our neck of the woods, where the
Sun can warm them.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.070
As they heat up the ice turns directly into
a gas — a process called “sublimation.”

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.610
The gas then flows away from the comet, creating
a cloud around it.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.440
This makes the comet look fuzzy, and actually
in the past they’ve been called “hairy stars.”

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.220
I like that term too, and in a sense we still
use it.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.311
The solid part of the comet is called the
nucleus, and the gaseous cloud around it is

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.800
called the coma — Latin for “hair.” In fact,
that’s why we called them “comets.”

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.540
As the ice sublimates, the bits of rock and
gravel and dust embedded in it can be freed

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.000
and leave the nucleus as well.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.360
This material is what forms the comet’s
tail, but how that happens depends on which

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.000
material you’re talking about.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.740
The gas and the dust from comets form two
different tails.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.940
Gas molecules emitted by the comet get ionized
by the Sun’s ultraviolet light.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.460
That means they lose electrons, becoming charged,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.700
and charged particles are highly susceptible
to magnetic fields.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.940
The solar wind is a stream of charged particles blown
out by the Sun, and carries a magnetic field with it.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.780
As the wind hits the ionized gas from the
comet, it picks up those particles

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.830
and carries them downstream, away from the
Sun.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.519
The solar wind is usually moving far, far
faster than

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.899
the comet, so this “ion tail” winds up
pointing directly away from the Sun.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.240
The dust, on the other hand, is influenced
more by sunlight.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.920
Light from the Sun exerts a small but inexorable
pressure, and this pushes on the dust particles.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.720
The dust streams away, but because the pressure
isn’t as intense as the solar wind is on the gas tail,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.480
the dust tail blows away more lazily, and
tends to lag behind the comet in its orbit.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.300
That means the two tails usually point in
two different directions!

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.000
In some comets, like 1997’s incredibly bright
and gorgeous Comet Hale-Bopp,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.360
this is pretty obvious. The dust tails look white
or a teeny bit yellowish, due to reflected sunlight,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.860
while the ion tail glows blue or green, depending
on the primary constituents of the gas.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.300
Carbon monoxide tends to emit blue light,
while carbon molecules glow a ghostly green.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.890
A comet’s tail can stretch for tens of millions
of kilometers.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.030
But, despite their length, tails are incredibly
low density, as low as a few hundred

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.130
atoms per cubic centimeter. The air you breathe
is a million billion times denser!

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.350
In 1910, Earth passed through the tail of
Comet Halley.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.430
This caused some public fear because cyanogen,
a deadly gas, had been detected in the tail!

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.860
But of course nothing happened; it turns out getting a
gazillionth of the toxic dose isn’t that a big of a problem.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.820
Broadly speaking, comets are classified by
their orbits.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.560
If they have orbital period less than 200
years they’re called short-period comets.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.320
These tend to orbit the Sun in the same plane
as the planets,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
and go around the Sun in the same direction
as well. From Earth,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.560
we see them sticking near the ecliptic, the line across
the sky that marks the annual path of the Sun.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.080
Comets that take longer than two centuries to
go around the Sun are called long-term comets,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.810
and have orbits that are tilted every which-way.
That means they can appear anywhere in the sky.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.290
But this raises an interesting point: Comets
go away.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.090
Every time they get near the Sun and start
outgassing, they lose mass.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.670
Over time they get smaller. Eventually, they
should… evaporate. Pfffft!

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.080
Some do this all at once because they dive
into the Sun, skimming our star’s surface.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.070
We call those Sundivers or Sungrazers. Many
of those may actually be

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.360
pieces from a bigger comet that broke up in
space nearly a thousand years ago.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.039
But besides those, we know of some comets
with orbits that can be short,

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.180
some with periods of just a few years. Even
a century is like

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.480
a single flap of a mosquito’s wing compared
to the lifetime of the solar system!

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.860
How can comets be billions of years old if their
orbits bring them close to the Sun all the time?

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.440
Astronomers wondered about this very thing.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.280
Over the years they came up with an idea: Maybe,
out past Neptune, there’s a repository of comets.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.540
Chunks of dirty ice, millions of them, billions,
orbiting the Sun where it’s perpetually cold.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.380
They could have orbits that last for millennia
or more.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.220
But then something tweaks them, makes them
fall toward the Sun.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.380
In fact, there may be two such regions, since
we have both short period and long term comets.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.860
Turns out: this idea is correct! We now know
enough about those distant regions of

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.140
the solar system that they deserves their own
episode, so we’ll dive into that topic later.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.500
So. What do comets look like up close? Like,
really close?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.340
Studying them from Earth is hard.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.480
The coma obscures the nucleus, making it nearly
impossible to see it directly.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.120
Ahhh, “from Earth”. If you instead send
your telescope to a comet, things change.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.440
We first did that in the 1980s, the last time
Comet Halley came around.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.200
Several nations sent spacecraft to fly past
the comet, and the Soviet mission Vega 1

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.130
was the first to successfully get pictures of the
nucleus. The low-resolution images revealed

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.300
a dark lump highlighted with two bright spots,
later determined to be jets of gas streaming away.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.220
These images were used to better determine
the position of the nucleus,

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.099
and a few days later the European probe Giotto
zipped past the nucleus

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.699
at an incredibly close distance of just 600
kilometers.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.780
Those pictures were more detailed, and showed
us a flying mountain,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.000
an irregular chunk 15 x 8 kilometers in size.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.860
And it was dark, reflecting only 4% of the
light that hit it.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.501
That makes the nucleus as black as asphalt!

00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:16.021
You might think that all that ice would be
shiny, but it’s not that simple.

00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:20.641
Most of Halley’s nucleus is covered in thick
dust laced with darker molecules,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.830
with only a few spots emitting gas. Most likely,
there are deposits of ice under the surface,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.490
and only some of them receive enough heat
from the Sun to sublimate and blow out gas.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.730
This has been seen with other comets as well;

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.860
the gas is emitted from specific spots on the comet,
venting out from cracks in the crusty surface.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.280
The surfaces of comets must be inhomogeneous,
different in different places.

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:46.409
That fact was brought home magnificently in
2014 by another European mission, Rosetta.

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:52.529
It went into orbit around the comet 67P/Churyumov-
Gerasimenko, and found it to be a bizarre little object.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:57.949
Measuring about 4 kilometers end-to-end, 67P
has two lobes connected by a narrow neck,

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.600
looking very much like a cosmic rubber ducky.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.940
The surface is completely devoid of craters;
clearly the surface is very young.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.260
Images show jets of gas emitted from very
specific places on the surface,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.120
and there are wide circular pits here and
there which may be gas vents,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.160
growing wider over time as the ice below is
depleted.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.700
Surprisingly, the surface is fairly tough and hard,
when some scientists expected it to be fluffier.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.580
The comet has a very low density, similar
to rubble-pile asteroids,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.319
so it was expected that the surface would
be soft.

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.399
Rosetta sent down a lander named Philae to set down
on the surface, using harpoons to anchor itself,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.780
but instead the lander bounced, unable to
penetrate the tougher-than-expected material.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.280
One idea to explain this is that the ice is
porous and fluffier inside the comet,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.780
but as it nears the Sun the ice at the surface warms
and changes its structure, forming that harder crust.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.339
As for the double-lobed thing, well that’s a bit baffling.
We see some asteroids shaped that way as well.

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:58.979
It’s possible 67P used to be two separate comets
that had a low speed collision and stuck together.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.260
Or maybe it used to be one big lump, but over
the eons the ice in the middle sublimated

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
more, leaving behind the two lobes.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.040
Rosetta is the first time in human history
we’ve had a probe orbiting a comet,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.200
studying it up close and long-term. We’re
still learning, still figuring this stuff out.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.180
Incidentally, I mentioned earlier that a)
comets have lots of ice in them,

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.340
and 2) they also get really close to Earth
sometimes. In fact, they can hit us!

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.820
Now not to get all technical and scientificy,
but that is what we would call “bad,”

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.820
as we’ll discuss in an upcoming episode.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.940
But billions of years ago lots of comets hit
the Earth not long after our planet formed.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.280
Together with asteroids — many of which
are also rich in water ice —

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.240
they may have brought a significant amount
of water to Earth! Scientists are still wrestling

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.430
over the details of this,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.960
and it may be a while before the actual numbers
are nailed down, but it’s an intriguing thought.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.980
Even more interesting? In 2004, NASA’s Stardust
space probe physically passed through

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.880
the coma of comet Wild 2, collecting samples
that were returned to Earth.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.740
Careful analysis of the material found the presence
of organic, carbon based molecules in them.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.880
And not just any random molecules, but complex
ones, including amino acids!

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:14.180
These are the building blocks of all life on Earth;
amino acids are what our bodies use to create proteins.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.240
It’s possible that the ingredients of life on Earth
didn’t start here, but instead were brought to

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.339
our planet from comet impacts. Or, at least,
there was a mix of the two.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.960
If that’s the case, then in a sense, all
life on Earth is part alien. How about that?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.940
But what gets me are the philosophical ramifications
of this. When we look into space,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.540
when we examine our celestial neighbors, when
we send probes to comets and survey what we find,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:45.880
we’re looking at our own origins. Comets are like
time machines, allowing us to investigate our past,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.120
four billion years back, hinting at the secrets
of the origin of life itself.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.640
And you thought astronomy was just lying out
in a field and looking up.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.560
Well, it is, but if you let it, it’s also
a whole lot more.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.420
Today you learned that comets are chunks of
ice and rock that orbit the Sun.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.640
When they get near the Sun the ice turns into
gas, forming the long tail,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.459
and also releases dust that forms a different
tail. We’ve visited comets up close and

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:12.640
found them to be lumpy,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.980
with vents in the surface that release the
gas as ice sublimates.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.040
Eons ago, comets (and asteroids) may have
brought a lot of water to Earth -- as well

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.860
