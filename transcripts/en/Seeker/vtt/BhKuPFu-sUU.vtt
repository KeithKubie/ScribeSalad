This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Real-tour dot com.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.289
Remember the last time you got super excited
about that new thing and you ran out and bought

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:08.289
it!

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:09.930
Then, a month later you regretted it?

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.390
Why do we suck at shopping?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.529
Hey consumers, thanks for watching DNews,
I'm Trace!

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.259
And research shows that all too often we make
irrational buying decisions, no matter how

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.789
big or small the purchase is.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.329
In other words, your emotions are costing
you dearly!

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.880
American thinker and educator John Dewey studied
basic consumer psychology WAAAY back in 1910,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.250
and came up with five stages -- you identify
a problem, search for information to solve

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.640
it and then look for alternatives, weigh the
convenience, value, whether it meets your

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.210
needs and so on and then you buy it!

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.840
That's not all though, you also evaluate your
decision AFTER buying and eventually dispose

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.840
of the product.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.160
This behavior has been studied extensively
over the last century and companies have gotten

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.930
so good at learning our behavior they sometimes
know what we want BEFORE WE DO.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.200
It's freaky.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.000
They paint things the right color, play the
right music and place it JUST right to get

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you to LOVE it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.670
The question is, aside from covering basic
needs like food or warm clothes, why do we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.130
decide to buy stuff at all?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.250
Well, apparently we like buying stuff because
it makes us feel better.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.370
According to market research paid for by an
online rebate site, 64% of women and 40 percent

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.450
of men in the U.S. shop because it improved
their moods.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.080
Retail therapy is real, y'all.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.270
But it's a short-lived mood booster obviously,
because eventually the novelty of those new

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.550
shoes wears off.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.460
On top of that, researchers at Bangor University
scanned the brains of shoppers and found that

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.119
we have about 23 minutes of shopping before
our logic is exhausted and we start making

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.840
decisions emotionally.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.830
After 40 minutes of shopping, the brain's
emotional center is fully in control and we're

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.880
not making ANY rational decisions whatsoever.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.130
Functional MRIs of people evaluating brands
found we make decisions based on feeling and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.900
experiences rather than facts.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.080
And the Journal of Advertising Research has
found emotions can be two to three times as

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.240
influential to a purchase, even a big one!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.270
Which means buying cars or houses or big vacations
involve the same logical/emotional breakdown

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.140
as buying a nice new shirt.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.890
However, if you're trying to save some money,
here's a secret tip: according to the Journal

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.760
of Consumer Research[a], sometimes you don't
actually have to BUY ANYTHING to get that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.500
feel-good boost, or what they call "hedonic
elevation."

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.040
Sometimes you'll feel better just by browsing.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.620
In the end, we ALL follow the same stages
of purchasing, and we ALL ignore those stages

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.879
once we become mentally exhausted and go with
our emotional biases, but because our ancient,

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.950
still evolving brains try and protect our
egos we all THINK we make perfectly logical,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.430
rational decisions.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.430
We don't.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
We so stupid.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.380
Fortunately there are tools out there to help
you make better decisions when it comes to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.700
big purchases - like real estate.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.250
For instance, Real-tour-dot-com uses data
and personal experience from the National

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.770
Association of Realtors.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.160
They update their listings every 15 minutes
and specialize in getting people in their

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.270
perfect home.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.629
Let them do the hard work so you can just
make the final decision, that should save

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:05.629
your brain and keep you logical.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.620

their app.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.410
Meantime, What's the largest thing you've
ever bought?

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.410
Was it tough?

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.750
