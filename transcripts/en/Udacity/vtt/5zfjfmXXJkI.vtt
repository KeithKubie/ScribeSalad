00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.780
In this session we're
going to talk about classes,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.550
a concept at the heart of
object oriented programming.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.955
Classes are similar to structs,

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:09.274
in that they bring together
related data and methods.

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:13.248
In the upcoming session, we'll compare
and contrast classes and structs, and

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:15.950
talk about how to choose
the right type for your needs.
