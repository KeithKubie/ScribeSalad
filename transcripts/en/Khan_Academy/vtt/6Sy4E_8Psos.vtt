00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.760
Problem 28.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.930
Which equation best represents
the part of

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.540
the graph shown below?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.210
So we have a bunch of
equations here.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.960
Let's see.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.940
This one is just a linear
equation, so this is just some

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.020
number times x.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.230
So that graph in general would
be a straight line.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.910
This one and this one
are straight lines.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.680
This one would be a straight
line with a positive slope,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280
maybe look something
like that.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.630
This choice C right here would
be a straight line with a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.550
negative slope, like that.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.540
They would both go through the
origin, because they don't

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.380
have any y-intercept
right there.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.220
So neither of these
are the answer.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.450
So let's look at these two--
I guess we could call them

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.540
quadratics.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.840
So here we have 1.75x squared.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.530
So the graph of x squared--
let me do it in a better

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.710
color-- the graph of x squared
looks like this.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a parabola.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.350
You've seen that before.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.790
And they're drawing it in the
first quadrant right there,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.020
and that looks about right.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.550
And you're like, hey, but
what about the 1.75?

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.940
Well, that's just a
scaling factor.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.860
If you throw a larger number
there, it'll curve up a little

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.460
bit faster.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.930
If you throw a smaller number
there, it'll curve up a little

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.210
bit slower.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.010
But the general idea is that
they all have the general

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.200
shape of a parabola.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.570
So this one looks pretty good.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.880
It's an upward opening
parabola.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.400
It's kind of an upright U.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.320
So this looks like a pretty
good solution.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.090
If we were to draw the whole
graph, it would continue on

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.770
this side like that.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.230
Then choice D, it's just like
choice B, except they have a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.680
minus here.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.780
And the reason why I know that's
not going to work is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.590
that the graph of minus x
squared, or minus anything

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.950
times x squared is going
to look like this.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.790
It's going to be downward
opening.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.630
So this is the graph of minus x
squared, the graph of minus

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.530
1.75x squared, might
open up or go down

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.040
a little bit faster.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.820
So it's going to have the
same general shape.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.240
So we know that this is also
not the right answer.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.110
So our choice is B.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.830
Next question.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.140
29.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.180
Lisa typed a 1,000-word essay
at the average rate of 20

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.430
words per minute.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.660
If she started typing at 6:20
PM and did not take any

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.560
breaks, at what time did Lisa
finish typing the essay?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.860
So she had a 1,000-word essay
and she was typing at 20 words

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.430
per minute.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.140
So let me write that down.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.790
So she had 1,000 words
and she's typing at

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.030
20 words per minute.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.280
So if you're writing 1,000 words
and you're doing 20 per

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.010
minute, how many minutes
is it going to take?

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.330
Well, what's 1,000
divided by 20?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.410
You could do this
in your head.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.920
You say 100 divided
by 20 is 5.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.480
1,000 is 10 hundreds.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.010
So it's going to be 50.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.770
But if you don't want to do it
in your head, you can just say

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.940
20 goes into 1,000-- 20 goes
into 10 zero times.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.190
20 goes into 100 five times.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.480
5 times 20 is 100, and then
you bring down the 0.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.460
20 goes into 0 zero times, and
then 0 times 20 is 0, and then

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.240
you are done.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.760
20 goes into 1,000
fifty times.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.830
Or you could say 2 goes
into 100 five times.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.700
All the same thing.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.550
Just 20-- and then--
sorry, 50.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.775
Want to be careful.

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:31.610
So it'll take her 50 minutes,
and actually

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.620
the units work out.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.890
You have words divided by words
per minute, or that's

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.540
the same thing as words times
minutes per word.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.910
They cancel out, and you
end up with 50 minutes.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.960
If that confuses you, don't
worry about it too much.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.750
The intuition is what's
important.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.120
You had a 1,000-word essay, you
did 20 words per minute.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.490
So it was going to take
you 50 minutes.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.640
50 minutes times 20 words
per minute is

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.380
equal to 1,000 words.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.830
So you're going to
have 50 minutes.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.580
So she starts at 6:20 PM.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.960
So at 7:00 PM, she's worked
for 40 minutes.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.290
Because there's 60 minutes
in an hour.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.640
But she works for 50
minutes, so she

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.829
does another 10 minutes.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.019
So that gets her to 7:10.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.800
So the choice is D.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.900
Problem 30.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.530
What does-- let me
do it in red.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.080
What does x to the fifth equal
when x is equal to minus 2?

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.760
So it's minus 2 times minus 2
times minus 2 times minus 2

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.490
times minus 2.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.180
Now we can just multiply
it all out.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.670
Let's just do that,
just for fun.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.570
Minus 2 times minus
2 is positive 4.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.760
Then positive 4 times
minus 2 is minus 8.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.910
Minus 8 times minus
2 is positive 16.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.590
Positive 16 times minus
2 is minus 32.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.570
So our answer is A.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.560
Now, if you wanted to do that
really fast, you might

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.400
recognize, well, 2 to
the fifth is 32.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.120
So it's either going to be that
choice or that choice.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.520
And then we have
a odd exponent.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.650
So we're going to be multiplying
a negative times

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.690
itself an even time, and
then one more negative.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.860
So you're going to get
a negative number.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.730
When you have an odd exponent,
you're going to

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.490
end up with a negative.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.140
You have an even exponent,
you'll end up with a positive.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.570
So that would have been the fast
way to do it, but even if

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.000
you didn't do that, you could
have just multiplied it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.140
straight out like we just did.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.080
And just remember a negative
times a negative is a

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.140
positive, and then a
positive times the

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.315
negative is a negative.

00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:44.420
It's minus 32.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.380
31.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.250
The graph below compares the
weight of an object on Earth

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.310
to its weight on the Moon.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.260
Interesting.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.890
An object's weight on the Moon,
OK, so this is the Moon

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.190
weight, this is the
Earth weight.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.870
So something that-- let's say--
well, I actually do

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.090
weigh 150 pounds.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.580
So I weigh 150 pounds on Earth,
and according to this

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.040
chart, I would weigh 25
pounds on the Moon.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.150
Or I would weigh essentially
1/6 my weight

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.890
that I am on Earth.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.170
What is it asking me?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.800
What is the approximate weight
on the Moon of an astronaut

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.410
who weighs 120 pounds
on Earth?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.660
Well, I just said, essentially
this thing is just taking 1/6.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.570
You can look at any point.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.310
When you weigh 10 pounds on
the Moon, you're weighing

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.170
roughly 60 pounds on Earth,
or vice versa.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.710
So you just take 1/6,
or we could actually

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.340
just look at the chart.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.370
120 pounds-- so if we go
halfway, that's about 125,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.550
between 100 and 150.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.590
120 pounds would
be right there.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.890
You go up the graph,
just like that.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.870
And you go there, and it looks
like 18 or 19 pounds.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.490
And they say, what is the
approximate weight?

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.510
So the closest thing we are
here, let's see, the

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.220
choice of 15 and 20.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.730
We're definitely closer to
20 than we are to 15.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.870
So I will go with
20 right here.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.990
And you know, if we really
wanted to look at it, this is

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.710
actually the point that we
should have looked at, this

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.180
point right here would
have been 120 pounds.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.160
But you just approximate where
120 is, you read the graph,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.610
you say, oh, it's closer
to 20 than any

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.000
of these other choices.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.620
So that'll be our answer.
