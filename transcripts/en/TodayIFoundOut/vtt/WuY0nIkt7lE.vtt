00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.000
The first paragraph of US patent 6469 reveals
nothing that would give the reader any thought

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.231
to the future greatness of the inventor.

00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:04.231
The patent is for an improvement to help boats
pass over sandbars by adding “adjustable

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.231
buoyant air chambers” to the bottom of the
boat.

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:06.231
Though uncomplicated and rather simplified,
the patent seems like it was written by a

00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.231
ship merchant or an engineer – not a lawyer
and politician who would become the President

00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:08.231
of the United States.

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:09.231
On March 10, 1849, 12 years before he was
elected US Commander-in-Chief, Abraham Lincoln

00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:10.231
submitted this patent, which he called “Buoying
Vessels Over Shoals,” with the design and

00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.231
idea for the invention having its roots in
his voyages as a young man along the Mississippi

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:12.231
River.

00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:13.231
He’s the only US President to ever submit
a patent.

00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.170
In 1828, at the age of 19, Lincoln was offered
a job by a wealthy Indiana landowner, James

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.279
Gentry, to help take a flatboat full of produce
and cured meat along the Mississippi to New

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.279
Orleans.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.660
At eight dollars a month (a little under $200
today), it certainly wasn’t a high-paying

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.259
job, but it did give the teen a chance for
an adventure.

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.750
Prior to his trip, he had spent his entire
life on farms and homesteads in Kentucky,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.690
Illinois and Indiana, knowing nothing of life
beyond those borders.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.640
Gentry offered him the job simply due to happenstance.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.960
He owned a store, of which the Lincoln family
were patrons.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.530
Knowing that Abe was close to the same age
as his own son, Allen – who was to captain

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.930
the boat, and capable of the tasks needed
to be done, Gentry asked Abe.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.930
While, very unfortunately, neither Gentry
nor Lincoln took notes or kept a diary during

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.210
the trip, there are a few known events that
happened during the voyage.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830
For one, the small flatboat had a real problem
with sandbars.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.140
When in shallow waters and weighed down by
its cargo, the ship often got stuck, which

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.899
meant cargo had to be unloaded to make it
lighter and the craft pushed out and then

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:10.899
re-loaded.

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.469
This was a tedious, hard, time-sucking and
a potentially dangerous task.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.429
Another thing that’s known is that the ship
was attacked near Baton Rouge by a group that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.680
could be best described as river pirates.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.179
Looking for cargo and money, the ship was
nearly overtaken by this group of men who

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.530
had the intent of robbing and, perhaps, killing
Lincoln and his companion if need be.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.539
Gentry and Lincoln were able to fight them
off long enough to cut anchor and barely escape.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.520
The last specific detail known from this trip
is the stuff of legend.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.240
Years later, Allen Gentry would continue telling
this story, stating that Lincoln’s future

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.700
as the “Great Emancipator” was sown on
that trip South.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.369
According to Gentry, upon landing in New Orleans,
Lincoln saw the notorious slave markets of

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.159
the city and was disgusted.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.000
Supposedly he said to Gentry at the time,
“Allen, this is a disgrace.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.889
If I ever get a lick at this thing, I’ll
hit it hard.”

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.880
Whether he actually said those specific words
as Gentry claimed, 35 years later, he did

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.860
exactly that – issuing the Emancipation
Proclamation, which freed slaves from all

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.170
Southern territories.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.840
Three years later, in 1831, Lincoln journeyed
along the Mississippi again while experiencing

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.959
many of the same things he did the first time.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.739
In fact, it seems the issue with sandbars
became even more pronounced, with written

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.250
records stating that Lincoln and his crew
lost time and cargo dealing with the matter

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.400
of the ship being stuck on a sandbar.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.400
There’s a prophetic story from even before
leaving Illinois in 1831, with the ship getting

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.239
stuck along the Sangamon River on a dam and
taking on water.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.099
Lincoln rushed to the nearby cooper shop (a
place where wooden barrels &amp; casks were made),

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.000
got an auger, drilled a hole in the side of
the ship and proceeded to let the water run

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
out.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.900
Then, he pushed the ship by himself off the
dam.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.021
A year later, when running for the Illinois
General Assembly from Sangamon County, one

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:56.110
of his key platform points was improving the
navigation of the river to bring more trade

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.459
to the county.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.720
Said Lincoln in a 1832 speech, “I believe
the improvement of the Sangamon River, to

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.329
be vastly important and highly desirable to
the people of this county.”

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.100
While he was defeated in his 1832 run for
political office, Lincoln was ultimately successful

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.700
two years later when he was elected to the
Illinois General Assembly.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.200
While he didn’t achieve much in regards
to improving the navigation of the river while

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.140
in the General Assembly, this issue still
nagged him.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.629
After two years there, he moved on to the
Illinois House of Representative and then

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.939
into the US Capitol as a Congressman in 1847.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.920
Constantly traveling the Sangamon River and
often getting stuck, this finally pushed him

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.300
to do something about it.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.431
Working on the patent in between Congressional
sessions, he finally completed and submitted

00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:41.400
it days after finishing out his term as Congressmen.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.730
Submitted on March 10, 1849, it revealed his
interest and knowledge in better water transportation.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.280
As a lawyer, he understood that patents allowed
for certain protections in terms of intellectual

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280
property.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.909
In fact, ten years later, he delivered a speech
in which he championed patents by saying they

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.220
are the “fuel of interest to the fire of
genius, in the discovery and production of

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.220
new and useful things.”

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.150
He also understood that, at the time, patents
needed to be accompanied by a model.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.110
Working with a Springfield mechanic, he whittled
a model of a ship with his buoying device.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.099
Said his law partner at the time, “Occasionally
he would bring the model in the office, and

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.370
while whittling on it would descant on its
merits and the revolution it was destined

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.440
to work in steamboat navigation.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.609
Although I regarded the thing as impracticable
I said nothing, probably out of respect for

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.389
Lincoln’s well-known reputation as a boatman.”

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.410
Today, that model and patent application is
at the National Museum of American History,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.430
but there’s some dispute over exactly what
the Museum has in its collection.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.600
While a curator told Smithsonian Magazine
in 2006 that the model is “one of the half

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.600
dozen or so most valuable things in our collection,”
it is possible that what they have is in fact

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600
a replica.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.030
The nameplate on top of the model reads “Abram
Lincoln,” a misspelling that has led some

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.650
to believe that it’s a fake because Lincoln
would have never misspelled his own name.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.020
It is also possible that the plate was added
after Lincoln submitted it, but that may never

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.120
be known – while his signature could be
on the model, it is buried underneath centuries-old

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120
varnish.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.669
As for the patent itself, there’s little
doubt that this is authentic and in the hand-writing

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.669
of Lincoln.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.780
But there’s one crucial part missing – his
signature, which was likely cut out and taken

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.930
by a collector who had access to the patent
in the 19th century.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.210
The 30th Vice President of the United States,
Charles Gates Dawes, won a Nobel Peace Prize

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.310
in 1925 and was a self-taught pianist and
composer who composed the 1912 hit song, “Melody

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.900
in A Major,” which was eventually used in
Tommy Edwards’ 1958 #1 hit (for a then record

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.789
six weeks) “It’s All in the Game.”

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.680
It has since become a pop standard, having
been performed and covered by artists like

00:05:34.680 --> 00:06:13.969
The Four Tops, Isaac Hayes, Van Morrison,
Elton John, the Osmonds, and Barry Manilow.
