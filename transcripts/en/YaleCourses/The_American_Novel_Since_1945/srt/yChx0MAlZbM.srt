1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,090
It is the seventh week of term. And
in this class, if you've kept up,

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:08,820
you have red nine novels in seven weeks.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,000
So if you kept up, I want you right
now to pat yourself on the back.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,500
Oh, I don't see a lot of padding. Okay.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,960
If you just missed one novel,
yeah.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,840
Okay. I don't want to look
do your padding later. Um,

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,330
let me say that you have
broken the back of the course.

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,770
Not to use too violent metaphor.
It's the seventh week.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,690
We have six weeks left.

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,670
In those six weeks we have five
count them, five novels. That's it.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,550
And one of them you get to choose.

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,950
So instead of doing two novels in a week,

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,280
you'll have a week and a
half for one novel. Uh,

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,960
this is a much more humane pace.

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,210
Why are you laughing? It's not funny. Um,

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,590
you also of course have spring break.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,760
If you use spring break wisely reading
somewhat leisurely way and myrtle beach

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,880
as you're relaxing on the beach blood
meridian, excellent beach novel,

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,830
you'll be in great shape. You'll be
riding high through the rest of the term.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,240
Easy peasy.
Okay.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,360
Why did I do that to you these last
three weeks? Why did I do that?

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,950
Well, one reason, as I said
at the beginning of class, uh,

23
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,951
at the beginning of the term is that
I did not want you to be crushed after

24
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:52,360
spring break. I want you
to be crushed now. Um,

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,340
so it'll be better later.
But there's another reason.

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,900
So why did my disc draw
point of those novels? Well,

27
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,430
my lecture today is in part
an answer to that question.

28
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,690
A syllabus is not a parade.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,200
It's not a succession of
novels that passes by and we
wave and we catch whatever

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,330
candy or beads they throw at us.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,840
And then we go home at the end of the day
with sore feet from standing too long.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,720
It's not like that.
A syllabus,

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,180
at least in this kind of class.

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,330
And with me teaching it is an argument.

35
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,910
It's an argument about a
whole historical period.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,940
It's an argument about a chunk
of literary historical history.

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,380
It's an argument about the evolution
of an art form in a particular place in

38
00:02:58,021 --> 00:02:58,854
time.

39
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,950
In order to preserve that
quality of a syllabus,

40
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,170
you have to read quite a bit.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Reading quite a bit means that you can
begin to see the lineaments of larger

42
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,730
trends and movements in
that historical period.

43
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,420
It allows you to amass enough evidence
to build an intellectual understanding of

44
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:33,460
what's going on in this period.
If I had dropped a novel,

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,760
there are certain kinds of arguments I
would not have been able to make and the

46
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:43,840
argument that I'm going to make for you
today would not be as compelling as I

47
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,370
hope it will be.

48
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,500
Okay,

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,260
so as in the Franny and Zooey lecture,

50
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,860
I tried to demonstrate for you in a
very self conscious way how literary

51
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:02,311
scholars make local arguments that
take into account an entire novel,

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,460
its major features and use
the evidence of detail,

53
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,540
the level of text to support
those kinds of claims.

54
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Today I'm going to make a much broader
argument of the kind that literary

55
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,090
scholars are often interested in making.

56
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,050
I'm going to make an argument
about a major trend in this period.

57
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,680
Okay.

58
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,850
And to do that,

59
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,910
I will use evidence and I'm going to
call on you to help me put together the

60
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:41,921
evidence for broader claims that cross
novels and argument of this kind has a

61
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:49,280
different quality from those more local
arguments about individual novels that

62
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:50,480
I've made each week.

63
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,510
Okay.

64
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,510
It's different in the sense that I want
and most literary scholars want such

65
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:04,441
arguments not to be totally
counterintuitive in the
way that you can sometimes

66
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:10,030
take pleasure in making a
reading of a local novel,

67
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,210
counterintuitive for the big arguments
you want to be able to account for what

68
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,920
is obvious about the period,

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,520
but perhaps has not been justified
as an analysis of the period.

70
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,540
So you want a sense of inevitability
that this argument you're making explains

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,860
all kinds of things that people have
always noticed about that period.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,090
In the same way that when I
lectured on Franny and Zooey,

73
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:47,830
I asked you what was obvious to you
about the novel and then my argument went

74
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:52,420
around and spoke back to those
things at different points.

75
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,980
So this general argument aims
to speak to those obvious parts,

76
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,650
but it speaks more strongly
to those obvious perceptions.

77
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,780
And so, uh, I, I'm launching into
a different kind of argument.

78
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,720
What I want to talk to you about today
is a particular narrative form and

79
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,680
convention.
And I'm calling it the identity plot.

80
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,230
Certainly I am not the first scholar
to think about identity as a form of

81
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,880
narrative in this period.

82
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,060
And it's precisely because I am not the
first that I can give it this sort of

83
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,904
name.

84
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,150
There's so much work that's been done
excavating how identity works in the novel

85
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:40,580
in this period that it has become
something we know a lot about.

86
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,790
What hasn't been said before is
that it has this particular name,

87
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,180
and I use this name because
for me the identity plot,

88
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,520
which I will explain in a few moments,

89
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,930
fulfills much the same function in fiction
of this period as the marriage plot

90
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,130
did for the Victorian novel.

91
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,210
So any of you who have taken the
Victorian novel class professor used,

92
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:13,211
sells a course or have studied or
just read a lot of Jane Austin novels,

93
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,050
uh,
Dickens' novels and so on,

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,890
you will know what the marriage plot is.

95
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,460
The marriage plot is that engine of
storytelling that makes novels hang on a

96
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:35,381
structure of a couple and the question
of whether they will get together or not.

97
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,650
Now, there are all kinds of
stages in that development,

98
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,840
the development of that narrative.

99
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,340
Are the couples from
the same social class?

100
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,950
Are they from geographically, uh, uh,

101
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,480
contiguous places?

102
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,120
Do they have personalities that match?
Did their parents agree?

103
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,740
Are they related to each other secretly,
always a problem.

104
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,540
There are all kinds of things that can
go wrong for a couple trying to get

105
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:14,541
together and the Victorian novel was very
good at generating narrative from all

106
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:17,400
those kinds of complications.

107
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Then there are different kinds of
outcomes that you can have in the novel

108
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,750
governed by the marriage
plot. One is the, the comedy.

109
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,220
That's when you get married at the end,
the couple gets married.

110
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,310
Then there's the tragedy. They don't
and they should have and we all know it.

111
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,500
So pride and prejudice would be an
example of the former kind Anna Karenina,

112
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:48,340
perhaps an example of the latter kind.
Even though that's a,

113
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,140
a novel really about adultery,

114
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,780
it totally depends on the
conventions of the marriage plot.

115
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,020
The plot works in much the same way.

116
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:02,490
So what is the identity pot?
I am going to give you a, uh,

117
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,900
an unusual sight in my class now,
and that is PowerPoint.

118
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,290
I think I'm sort of surprised
and delighted by this myself.

119
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,970
So we'll see how it works.
So if you're taking notes,

120
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,760
which I encourage you to do,
you will find your,

121
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,070
are bolded words that you can copy down

122
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,190
the identity plot, narrative form and
post 1945 fiction. Isn't that snazzy?

123
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,030
Okay. Whoops. I've already made my first
technological mistake. There we go.

124
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,390
Six elements of the identity plot.

125
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,430
Make sure you capitalize identity
and plot please. And also,

126
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,443
uh,

127
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,710
give me credit in the footnote
of your notes for that phrase.

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,120
The narrative of the identity plot novel
revolves around the question of how to

129
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:59,730
define and understand a character's
identity. Big surprise there.

130
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,283
Number two,

131
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,390
the character needs to be a member of
a minority within a larger society.

132
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,080
I am not going to ask you to volunteer
examples of these because it's just too

133
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:20,914
obvious

134
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,400
that our last three or four novels each
feature one of these characteristics or

135
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,044
all of them.

136
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,020
Yeah.

137
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,020
The third one is absolutely crucial to
the development of the identity plot and

138
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:44,621
that is that the character is also at
odds with the minority group of which he

139
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:46,760
or she is a part.

140
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,450
This is important because without it,

141
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,700
the identity plot gets really boring.

142
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,060
It doesn't have a lot of complication.

143
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,500
If all you have to do is realize

144
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,150
as you're going about your life,
wow,

145
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,890
I am a member of x or y group,

146
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,840
great,
and I know who I am now

147
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,350
done. That's, it's a really
short story actually, and it's a,

148
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:28,940
it's not a good short story either.

149
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,620
There's just not enough resistance
to the evolution of the plot,

150
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,320
so it's really important.

151
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,250
The drama of the identity
plot depends upon this.

152
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,663
Furthermore,

153
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,700
the character in question needs to be
conflicted about his or her difference

154
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,170
from the majority and about his or her
difference from the minority group.

155
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,990
Can anyone think of an example of this?

156
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,650
Anyone think of an example?
Yes.

157
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:14,200
Eli Kingspan

158
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,470
is conflicted about that kind of heritage
limits of women in Chinese culture but

159
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:25,630
also kind of latches onto
it and the more [inaudible]

160
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,810
absolutely. Yeah. So in case you
didn't hear you, I, uh, women warriors,

161
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:34,140
a great example of this,
Maxine,

162
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,600
that's what I'll call her when
I'm talking about the character.

163
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,550
Maxine Hong Kingston. Maxine is, uh,

164
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,120
feels alienated from Chinese
culture because of the
massage any she perceives in

165
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:45,954
that culture.

166
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,040
But she also turns to Chinese culture
as a way to identify herself and to give

167
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,140
her a positive self image.

168
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,670
As in that story of the woman warrior,
which I actually didn't ask you to read,

169
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:02,940
but there are other examples
in the stories that I did
ask you to read chapters

170
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:07,380
that I did ask you to read,
um, to give her that sense of,

171
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,500
of grounding as a person.

172
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,570
Other examples,

173
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,690
how about in the bluest
eye? Yes, that's okay.

174
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,530
Strangely minority,
but I think in French and Zoe,

175
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,810
they're a minority as intellectuals and
then Catherine is alienated from that

176
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,953
road.

177
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,750
Yeah. I think for Indians only
really does fit this model. Yes,

178
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,960
there are lots of different ways of
conceiving what it means to have,

179
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:42,940
and I'm a minority group at work in
these novels and I think Freddie and Zoe

180
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,330
definitely imagines a minority
group as the glass family.

181
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,360
They're big enough to be a group.
There are lots of children,

182
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:54,620
so you get that sense that there are
clan there sort of a tribe of themselves.

183
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,150
They have this peculiar
quality, their intellectual, uh,

184
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,320
sort of complexity and also their
artistic gifts, especially their,

185
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,350
their gifts in language.
Um,

186
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,860
and there is a conflict
between Frannie Ian's,

187
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,990
Darwin's Zoe is really held out as the
custodian of the glass family identity.

188
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,640
So it's he who instructs Franny and
brings her finally back into the fold.

189
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,830
And that's an example of the comic
ending other examples from other novels.

190
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,270
Can anyone do this for blue sky?

191
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,770
How am I piccola
be an example of this?

192
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,560
Okay.
Let me do it.

193
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,500
Pichola goes up the horrors,

194
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,510
apartment and fines there kind of
love and acceptance from those women.

195
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,100
Yeah.

196
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,890
That does not judge her for her ugliness.

197
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:05,910
Yeah.

198
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,910
That surrounds her with a rich verbal
culture as well as a culture of affection.

199
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,200
Okay.

200
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,390
It is a group that is,

201
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,420
has succeeded from the black community
itself but still maintains a certain tie.

202
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:28,480
Remember the prostitutes admiration
for the good Christian woman.

203
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,910
Okay.

204
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,720
That ties them to the prevailing
norms of the black community.

205
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:35,730
Yeah.

206
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,730
So pichola finds an ideal black
community within that small apartment.

207
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,120
Okay.

208
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,120
But she is alienated from that positive
black self image that she sees in those

209
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:55,761
women by her desire to identify
with white beauty to have blue eyes.

210
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,130
Okay.

211
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,400
And so that's how she would embody this.
Um,

212
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,050
Frieda is also an example
of this freedom and Claudia.

213
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,820
So, uh, actually if we take
the example of Claudia,

214
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,590
Claudia wants to be like, remember
the girl they called Merengue Pie,

215
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,820
the light skinned girl,
she wants to be liked her,

216
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,300
but at the same time she recognizes a
certain insipid quality to this girl.

217
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,530
She doesn't have the kind of strength
that Claudia and Frieda with the addition

218
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:41,071
of Pichola have as a little group that
doesn't pass judgment on their own

219
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:41,950
blackness.

220
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,333
Okay.

221
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,980
So that's again,
between Claudia Frida and Pichola,

222
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,130
there's another small
idealize black community,

223
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,020
but Claudia is somewhat conflicted both
about her membership in that little

224
00:16:56,021 --> 00:17:01,021
group and her difference from the influx
of white blood into that community and

225
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:08,680
white aesthetic into that community.
So she echoes in a less dramatic way,

226
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,250
the same kinds of conflicts
that you see in Pichola.

227
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,793
Okay.

228
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,170
The fourth quality of the identity plot
is that authenticity and origin are

229
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,070
always at stake in the characters
quest for personal identity,

230
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,320
even when those things are absent.

231
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,160
Yeah.

232
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,150
So in the woman warrior,
we have an excellent example of this.

233
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,130
Um,
in the beginning,

234
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,303
yeah,

235
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,260
of the last chapter that I asked you to
read after she tells the whole story of

236
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:49,751
moon,

237
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:54,600
orchid and brave war kid
going to find moon or kids,

238
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,010
Chinese husband,

239
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,260
and confronting him with Moon
Orchid status as the first wife.

240
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,450
After you get this whole richly
imagined story full of dialogue,

241
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,750
the next chapter begins.

242
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,130
What my brother actually said was I drove
mom and second onto Los Angeles to see

243
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:22,470
aunt's husband's. Who got the other
wife? Did she hit him? What did she say?

244
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,760
What did he, what did he say? Nothing
much. Mom did all the talking.

245
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,350
What did she say? She said he'd
better take them to lunch. At least.

246
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,400
Which wife did he sit next to?
What did they eat? I didn't go.

247
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,070
The other wife didn't either.
He motion not to tell.

248
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,410
I would have told if I was his wife,

249
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,940
I would have told I would have gone to
lunch and kept my ears open. I, you know,

250
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:49,920
they don't talk when they eat. What
else did mom say? I don't remember.

251
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,430
I pretended to predict a pedestrian
broke her leg. So he would come.

252
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,720
There must've been more.
Didn't aunt get in one nasty word?

253
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:01,800
She must've said something. No,
I don't think she said anything.

254
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:06,660
I don't remember her saying one thing.
In fact,

255
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,920
it wasn't me. My brother told
about going to Los Angeles.

256
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,310
One of my sisters told
me what he told her.

257
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,660
They are layers of inauthenticity in
the origin of this story are deep.

258
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,950
There is no sense that the story we have
just been told in great detail has any

259
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:34,100
basis in fact,
and yet

260
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,950
this is a book that is patently
autobiography. I autobiographical.

261
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,580
It plays up the authenticity and
the unreliability of this voice.

262
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,580
We know that we cannot trust the
details of what is given to us.

263
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,340
And yet the narrative tries
to seduce us with them,

264
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:03,310
tries to persuade us by their very
dramatic quality and their detail.

265
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,350
And by the way, these stories embody
the voices of their characters.

266
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,390
That these are real stories.

267
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,223
Yes.

268
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,420
So the voice in Kingston that purports
to be a source of identity formation,

269
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,440
she's going to write herself into being

270
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,540
is an inauthentic voice.
Now,

271
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:35,410
there was a controversy about
Maxine Hong Kingston actually,

272
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:38,980
it's been going on for many decades.
It goes on today.

273
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,180
There's a scholar of Chinese
American literature named Frank Chin.

274
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,430
He's also a novelist himself.

275
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,510
He has accused Kingston and a few other
writers in the starkest terms of being

276
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:58,711
fakes and of being against Chinese
culture and of being puppets of white

277
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,504
culture.

278
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,080
Yeah.

279
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,080
Kingston's use of Chinese literature has
come under particular attack from Chin.

280
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,170
And this happened, uh, in, in one, uh,

281
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,790
of its incarnations or one
of its iterations of this,
this feud between the two.

282
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,360
Um, it actually happened at
a conference face to face.

283
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,710
And I know you must think that academic
conferences are always a thrill.

284
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:29,660
A minute. It's, it's not really usual that
they are, but I guess in this case, uh,

285
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,700
it was, um, so frank chin, I guess
shouted her off the stage. I can't,

286
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,840
I don't know all the details, but it
was, it was very exciting, I'm sure. Um,

287
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,870
nevertheless, the argument is serious.
It's an argument about authenticity.

288
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,460
The authenticity,

289
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,143
excuse me,

290
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,300
the authenticity of Kingston's
use of Chinese literature.

291
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,580
So imagine someone saying to John Barth,
wait a minute,

292
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:04,320
you changed the story of the Odyssey.
You're a fake.

293
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,660
That's essentially what Frank
Chin says to Maxine Hong Kingston.

294
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,840
It has a kind of traction to a certain
audience because the purity of an origin

295
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,520
of that kind matters if you think that
that's where authenticity of an identity

296
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:25,750
resides.

297
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,130
So if it's a cultural identity at stake,

298
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,570
the authenticity seems to
matter in a different way. Now,

299
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:38,800
Barth can give us a different
kind of example of this.

300
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,390
Authenticity is mental aliases,

301
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,690
voice in the mental Llyod
really his own is there.

302
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:51,310
Some being leftover that's
apart from that voice.

303
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,860
He says, my voice did olds
on, well, who's the my,

304
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,760
is he just reduceable to that voice?

305
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,930
Is He proteus?
Is proteus him?

306
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,610
Has his identity been lost in his
wrestling with that changing God?

307
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,340
Yeah.

308
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,250
The question of authenticity,
Hans men, Elias,

309
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,660
it haunts Ambrose when he is in the
throes of passion and he feels alienated

310
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:31,740
from himself. This is
passion. I am experiencing yet

311
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,240
that's a kind of inauthenticity.

312
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,570
He can't be grounded in the origin of
identity that we think of as the body.

313
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,810
So a lot of these novels make
a problem out of authenticity

314
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,890
when it doesn't seem like a problem.

315
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,223
Okay.

316
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,520
A novel is making a certain kind of
claim about identity right off the bat.

317
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,460
And that's,
that authenticity doesn't matter.

318
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,640
But in the context of the identity plot,

319
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
you know that it's on the radar screen.

320
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:14,840
Even if it isn't something
that is in the novel itself,

321
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,740
it's there, uh, bias, negative.

322
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,331
Finally,

323
00:24:21,331 --> 00:24:25,590
there are comic versions and tragic
versions of the identity pot just as there

324
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,880
are of the marriage plot.

325
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,750
So the comic version gives us characters
that come to peace with their identity.

326
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:36,420
My favorite example of this is actually
novel. We're not reading in this course,

327
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:37,830
although I could've added,
it couldn't,

328
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,690
I could have done 10 novels in the first
seven weeks. I won't ask you to read it.

329
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,600
It's, uh, Barbara
Kingsolver pigs in heaven.

330
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:47,890
Okay.

331
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,570
In this novel, this is the most
extreme example. I know. Um,

332
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,810
I can't remember the full details now,
but um,

333
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,610
in that novel there is
a native American woman.

334
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,860
There's a native American child who
is adopted forcibly by in the forcible

335
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:10,180
adoptions and it's adopted
by a white family. I think
this is how the story goes.

336
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,690
And eventually after the Indian
family tries to get that child back,

337
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,430
it is discovered that the adoptive mother
was in fact a member of that tribe by

338
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,160
a very,
uh,

339
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,000
diluted bloodline and the,

340
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,190
the adoptive mother marries the
child's full blood grandfather.

341
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,750
Perfect, perfect. Uh,

342
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,990
comic ending for an identity plot novel.

343
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,660
Okay.

344
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,230
I would say that the bluest eye is,
uh,

345
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,120
our tragic version of this where
Pichola we'll never be at peace.

346
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,810
She is in fact a deranged by her,

347
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,290
her conflicted relationship to identity.

348
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,730
Now here is where we need a distinction
between literary fiction and genre

349
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:14,360
fiction. Now I could get into
lots of trouble for these claims.

350
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:19,170
They're fairly broad and ideally I
would want to give them more nuance,

351
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:22,130
but I think it's useful to
think about this distinction.

352
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,910
Incarnations of these kinds of narrative
conventions that we think of as

353
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:34,301
literary use those structures of
narrative as something to play off of or

354
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:40,340
something two and a habit while they
do a whole bunch of other things.

355
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:45,341
Think of the ways that Humbert and Nebach
off use the conventions of romantic

356
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,970
language to make us believe that
Humbert really loves Lolita.

357
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,560
There's something operatic about
the extremity of the situation.

358
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:05,850
We're given the extremity of the
use of those conventions in Lolita.

359
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,070
Well,
in this case,

360
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,490
some of our identity plot novels use that
plot to say something about language,

361
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,460
about literary history,
about tradition.

362
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,510
Some of them simply give us aesthetic
pleasure like the pleasure that we can get

363
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:30,900
from watching Barth use words,
make them funny,

364
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,720
be clever with them

365
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,150
so they may deliver an
artistic satisfaction that
has nothing to do with the

366
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:45,590
identity plot itself.
None.

367
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:50,591
There are incarnations of it that
don't reflect on any of those aesthetic

368
00:27:51,861 --> 00:27:52,490
issues.

369
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,170
Don't reflect on the history
of the literary tradition.

370
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:04,190
Don't engage questions about language
that deliver instead conventional

371
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,000
predictable satisfactions of the genre.

372
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,350
And these we would call genre fiction.
And if you recall,

373
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,600
novakof talks a little bit
about pornography as genre
fiction that gives you

374
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:23,661
that predictable mechanical free song
of pleasure at the predictable place.

375
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:30,981
And he describes Lolita as rejecting
the convention of pornography.

376
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,850
You can think about his description as
applying also to the identity plot that

377
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:43,050
sometimes it functions and I think
they're Kingsolver novel really is a good

378
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:48,051
example of this where there are
predictable pleasures of the child being

379
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:54,240
enveloped by a loving family after
all the complications of her identity.

380
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,251
Finally,

381
00:28:56,251 --> 00:29:01,251
it can all be resolved or there's a
kind of pleasure in that feeling that it

382
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,180
could never be resolved.
That tragic feeling.

383
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,060
So there's genre fiction
that can end that way too.

384
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,160
So other examples of genre fiction,
of course the detective novel is another.

385
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,960
Um, it is this, my argument
today is not to say that the,

386
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,990
this is the only convention
that are novels are working
with the detective genre

387
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,350
is president crying of lot 49.

388
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,700
That's something that you can think
about productively when you think about

389
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:35,530
adipose search for knowledge and clues.

390
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,950
There's a way that pension is playing
off that uh, that convention as

391
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,380
to make the distinction is not
to reject one for the other.

392
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,640
So literary fiction and genre fiction
are both part of what literary scholars

393
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:58,150
use to make, especially these
kinds of broad scale arguments.

394
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,350
So it's not really enough if you want to
argue about a whole period of literary

395
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:10,081
history to only skim off the
very most literary works,

396
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,860
your argument doesn't have a lot of
historical purchase if you do that.

397
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,010
If your ambition is to talk about more
narrowly the evolution of an art form,

398
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,800
that's a very legitimate move to make.

399
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:31,000
To Skim off just those literary examples.

400
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,340
But if your ambitions to say something
through your discussion of literature,

401
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,380
about culture, about politics, about
any other set of issues, philosophical,

402
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,880
historical questions,

403
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,560
you want to be able to demonstrate that
the things you're seeing in literary

404
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:52,561
fiction have a wider purchase and have
grabbed hold of the imagination of a,

405
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,260
of a larger set of people than the
people who read high literary novels.

406
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,670
Yeah.

407
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:05,650
So you can make different kinds of claims
depending on what combination of these

408
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:07,900
kinds of examples you use.

409
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,100
The identity pot obviously
has infinite variations.

410
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,510
Um, I mentioned just a few to
get you thinking about them.

411
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,980
The character seems to be a
member of the majority group.

412
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,570
This is actually in one
sense Frannie and Zoe's case,

413
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,330
as you mentioned,
uh,

414
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,140
it seems like they're much more in
a mode in a majority. They're white.

415
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,970
They are from an upper
class section of New York.

416
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,820
Um, they're distinguished by
their families, intellectual ism.

417
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,050
Similarly,

418
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:54,000
Ambrose could be said to
be in the majority group,

419
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:57,870
and certainly by the definition of
someone like Morrison or Kingston,

420
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,320
that fiction,
they're members of oh,

421
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,700
of a white Anglo Saxon
Protestant heritage,

422
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,150
the members of Ambrose's family.

423
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,310
But if you recall in Ambrose,
his mark,

424
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,260
the family is eccentric.

425
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,130
They too are marked by their
difference from the churches in town.

426
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,770
The independence of their thinking,
the uh,

427
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,720
skill with which they carve,
they have artistic skills.

428
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:35,740
Okay.

429
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,220
The character does not seem to be
conflicted about his membership,

430
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,520
the minority group. This can happen.
Where do you get the drama then?

431
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:44,871
Well,

432
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:49,871
sometimes you get the drama from the
efforts of the majority group against that

433
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,384
piece.

434
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,480
Will that person betray
their group or not?

435
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:06,050
So that's where the narrative tension
can come. If you see this variation,

436
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,540
the character resist the whole idea
of having an identity that stable.

437
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,990
You might think of Kingston
as an example of this. Um,

438
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,650
although I think you can argue
it both ways. I'm certainly,

439
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:26,651
she's not going to think you can
have an identity that stays still.

440
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,420
All those self revisions

441
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,460
that I even just from that little
passage that I read about where her story

442
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:35,210
comes from,

443
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,210
that's the suggestion that she's committed
to an identity that's changeable.

444
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,920
As this period moves on towards
the end of the 20th century,

445
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,820
that variation is much more common.
It gets more and more common.

446
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,340
The critique of identity in theory,
in the world of literary theory,

447
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,730
think of the work of Judith
Butler for example, uh,

448
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:02,570
in the late eighties and
stretching into the present, um,

449
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,520
very influential on undermining the idea
that you could have a stable identity

450
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,354
at all.

451
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,800
And that's where that term essentialism
identity essential ism comes from.

452
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,920
That's a very negative
idea by now by this point.

453
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,740
But in the 1970s and I would argue that
in Morrison's work you see us still a

454
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:30,001
commitment to the idea that you can really
be in a peaceful way African American

455
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,850
and that that's a stable grounded identity
or even that you can be white as a

456
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,890
stable,
grounded identity.

457
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,000
So I think some writers
earlier in the period, um,

458
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,260
persistent that idea,

459
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,030
even while most have gone to the
sense that identity is not stable,

460
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,140
there may be multiple characters whose
identities are at stake in the novel and

461
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:05,840
some subplots might end up as tragedy,
someone's comedy.

462
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,920
You can have a variation
with fiction based on fact.

463
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:14,921
We've seen that both in Richard
Wright and now in Kingston.

464
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It raises the stakes of the fiction and
it suggests it's purchase on the reel to

465
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:29,771
write a fiction that is
sort of autobiography based,

466
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:35,141
partly in fact are mostly in fact it
suggests that what's going on in the

467
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:39,540
fiction is actually very
close to what we live.

468
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,230
And that's a kind of claim
for fiction in and of itself.

469
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,243
Yeah.

470
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,470
And uh, this is an example, this last one.

471
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:52,470
Identity identity is not
based on race or ethnicity.

472
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:55,710
When we think about identity,
we usually think of race or ethnicity,

473
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,500
but sometimes minority status is going
to be claimed or identities can be

474
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:06,501
claimed on religious or philosophical
grounds or just on the grounds of a

475
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,330
personality difference.

476
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,610
Someone who is strange sound
jurors sort of fond of this. Um,

477
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,430
catcher in the rye is an example.

478
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
I think of this where I'm Holden.

479
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:25,641
Caulfield is at odds with his world
because he just sees things really

480
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:27,294
differently.

481
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:32,923
Yeah.

482
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,150
One of the kinds of claims that you have
to be prepared to make if you're making

483
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:42,890
these broad period based claims is
that your claim is specific to your

484
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,810
particular time period.
Now you have to define your time period.

485
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:52,580
I'm uh, dealing with post World
War Two American literature,

486
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,770
somewhat arbitrary,
a cutoff for some scholars.

487
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,970
I think there are reasons to think that
it is a real cutoff having to do mostly

488
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,240
with, um, the changes in
the American cultural, um,

489
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,110
mass market in the years
after World War II. Um,

490
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:13,610
there are identity plots all over in
the history of the richer. So, uh,

491
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,970
the, the plot of mistaken identity
is a staple of renaissance comedy.

492
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,420
You think of midsummer night's dream,
for example,

493
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,000
secret identity is a
staple of gothic fiction.

494
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:29,750
This happens a lot in dickens,
other kinds of Victorian fiction,

495
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,840
artistic identity. Think of portrait
of the artist as a young man,

496
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,970
Joyce's novel about the
artistic formation of a person

497
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,590
that's especially important to modernism.

498
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,280
And you could also say the woman
warrior is an example of that version of

499
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:59,050
artistic self creation.
Um, racial identity.

500
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:03,490
There's a wonderful book called our
America by Walter Ben Michael's. Um,

501
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,080
he argues very persuasively that there
are whole ranges of genre fiction in the

502
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:12,910
1920s that are working
out a logic of race,

503
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,590
of a nativist logic of race
in the early 20th century,

504
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,170
that these novels are
governed by that logic.

505
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,670
So you have to be prepared to explain
how your feature is different from other

506
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:31,240
incarnations in the history of literature.

507
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,600
My contention is the identity,
as I'm describing it, um,

508
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,870
becomes a preoccupation of both literary
and genre varieties of writing in this

509
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:44,710
period.

510
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,710
So that suggests it's scope that it's
not just the concern of a few writers,

511
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,270
it's the concern of lots of writers.

512
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,410
It's different in the
degree of its presence.

513
00:38:56,411 --> 00:39:01,411
So while Walter Ben Michael's argues
very persuasively for the racial logic of

514
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,730
popular Westerns, for example, or um,

515
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,320
for its relevance to Willa Cather's work,

516
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:17,490
it doesn't sit at the center of the
plots of those novels in the same way.

517
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,830
He can tease out the logic,

518
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,970
but it's not because that logic is
what the whole novels drama hangs on.

519
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,440
Some of the drama hangs on that.

520
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,320
But in the novels I'm
talking about in this period,

521
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,440
it has risen to the level of formula
such that you can hang the whole plot on

522
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:41,440
that structure and it's recognizable,
immediately recognizable.

523
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,440
So that's what I mean when I say in the
next bullet point that it achieves a

524
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:52,040
kind of solidity of formula,
a formulaic structure.

525
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,720
And finally, I want to argue as I've, uh,

526
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,690
been doing in a, in a sort of, um,

527
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,090
in passing in the last few lectures,

528
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:10,810
that these novels are working very closely
with things that are happening in the

529
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:12,380
culture in general.

530
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,950
So that tension between activism and
personal growth in the 1960s as modes of,

531
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,780
um,
of social action.

532
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,830
The question about whether you can
intervene in politics through culture is

533
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:34,340
everywhere in the 1960s.

534
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,150
And you can see a come to a head in the
1990s with the culture wars when both

535
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:44,780
liberals and conservatives
begin to fight over,

536
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:49,550
especially over the syllabi
of courses like this.

537
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:55,300
So if you think that it's worth fighting
a political fight over the syllabus

538
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,900
that we all read,

539
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,890
you are already committed
to a cultural politics.

540
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,750
So the end point of this is
a very widespread argument
in the 1990s about where

541
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:17,621
politics happens and that argument
revolves around novels that feature the

542
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:20,834
identity plot

543
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,910
cause those are the kinds of novels that
people thought of as either advancing

544
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,220
or uh,

545
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,700
or resisting the head Gemini of a White
Western tradition that was oppressive to

546
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,110
minority people.

547
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,510
Yeah.

548
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,650
This,
by the way,

549
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:51,330
this final incarnation of the identity
part is going to be very important to us

550
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:52,560
when we read the human stain.

551
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,970
That novel is deeply embedded
in that final iteration of it.

552
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:01,020
How else do you know it's a, it's a
dominant convention. Well it has an end.

553
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,090
This is another way you can
locate its historical specificity.

554
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,600
So it has its limits and you can see
it coming to its end when you see more

555
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,360
elaborate embellishment and variation on
that formula that writers have ambition

556
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,060
have to push it further and further.

557
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Even writers of the genre fiction versions
have to address an audience looking

558
00:42:30,191 --> 00:42:34,540
for the familiar pleasure,
but with just enough difference.

559
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,070
You know, you, you, you can think
of those Hollywood chase scenes,

560
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,800
they all look so much alike,

561
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:46,570
but the new ones always have to have
just that little bit more interesting

562
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:51,571
special effect or that much more dramatic
car flying off some high parapet.

563
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,350
Same thing with Annie,
uh, narrative formula.

564
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,920
And there comes a time when writers
of ambition simply change the subject.

565
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,420
And I'm going to argue that even the
Roth is still thinking in these terms.

566
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,640
The other novels that reading,
starting next week,

567
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,080
uh,

568
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,080
and into the end of the semester
are beginning to change the subject.

569
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,580
So one subject that comes
up very powerfully in those
novels is the subject of

570
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:34,370
history.
It's not unrelated to identity,

571
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,220
but it is distinctly different.

572
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,380
And so in Cormac McCarthy for example,

573
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,740
there is a a a palpable engagement
with history and an Edward P.

574
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,060
Jones in a novel that really seems like
a classic outgrowth of the identity part

575
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:55,631
novels,

576
00:43:55,631 --> 00:44:00,631
especially of Toni Morrison is really
much more about the terror of history than

577
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:03,910
it is about the dramas of identity.

578
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,310
So we will see how that
subject gets changed.

579
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,983
Okay.

580
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,920
When we read the woman warrior,

581
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,350
we might feel that it is very,
very conventional.

582
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:22,540
Okay.

583
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Because it does so much of what I have
just described that the identity pot

584
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,374
does.

585
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,070
Hmm.
I

586
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,920
think in a way that would
be short changing it.

587
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,320
Some novels look dated

588
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,850
or look formulaic because they have been
incredibly successful and I think the

589
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:50,181
bluest sky and woman warrior are
examples of those kinds of novels.

590
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:55,850
Woman Warrior and what this is one of
Frank Chin's corals with it is widely,

591
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,980
widely taught. I always think hard
about including it on my syllabus.

592
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:06,981
Sometimes that's a reason to include it
on a syllabus as evidence in an ongoing

593
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:10,650
unfolding argument. Sometimes
it isn't. In this case,

594
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,890
I've decided pretty securely that it is.

595
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:18,891
It belongs here as a piece of evidence
in this unfolding argument about what's

596
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:21,090
happening in the historical period.

597
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,630
Woman Warrior is widely taught.

598
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,200
It is one of the foremost examples
of this kind of identity writing.

599
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,960
It has some literary satisfactions.

600
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,870
Some of those stories
are really compelling.

601
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,290
She's very good at living a character.

602
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,560
She's wonderful at
reproducing the dialogue.

603
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,510
She reflects on the quality of writing.

604
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,950
She has self conscious about the
construction of her narrative.

605
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,820
And so we can see an artist telling the
story of her own coming to being as an

606
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:05,790
artist in the way she tells these stories.

607
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,750
There's all kinds of things
you can close read in here. Um,

608
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,370
and I'm going to run out of time.
Uh, let me just show you one thing.

609
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,180
This is at the very end,
at two oh seven,

610
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,610
this is when she's told the story about
her grandmother taking the family to the

611
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:28,611
opera and how bandits tend to rob the
houses that have been abandoned while

612
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:33,600
families are at the opera.
Instead, in this case,

613
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,260
the bandits attack the audience

614
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,610
in the experience.
Uh,

615
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,870
the families all broken up in the attack.
By daybreak,

616
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,600
when my grandmother and
mother made their way home,

617
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:53,040
the entire family was home safe proof
to my grandmother that our family was

618
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:57,930
immune to harm. As long as they went
to plays, they went to many plays.

619
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,560
After that, the grandmother's
logic is completely twisted here.

620
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,930
It's turned upside down.
It doesn't make any sense.

621
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,440
They got attacked when
they went to the play,

622
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:13,830
so they go to plays in order to stay
safe because they happen to survive that

623
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,664
attack.

624
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:21,170
The reason why we're given that logic is
that this book is full of stories about

625
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:22,470
insanity

626
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and remember from the story about moon
or a kid in sanity in this story is

627
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,180
defined as telling one story over and
over again insisting on the same story.

628
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,370
She becomes paranoid,
essentially a paranoid schizophrenia.

629
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,900
That means that sanity,

630
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,960
healthiness is found in
multiplicity illogic.

631
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:58,040
It's a kind of contradictory claim about
the status of sanity and storytelling.

632
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:04,150
So the illogic of this little moment at
the very end of the book reaches back to

633
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:10,841
all those other examples of illogic and
insanity that we see throughout classic

634
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:16,691
new critical technique for building the
meaning of a certain trope across the

635
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:20,174
writing.

636
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,240
Yeah.

637
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,470
The other thing also of course to think
about is the fact that this takes place

638
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:27,430
around plays,

639
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,680
that it's art that's held
out as being the lucky thing.

640
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,390
It's art that's at the center.
And this of course,

641
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,450
especially the play reaches back to
Maxine's descriptions of her childhood

642
00:48:42,581 --> 00:48:47,581
drawings where she painted page after
page after page of black worrying her

643
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:51,040
teachers.
But for the young Maxine,

644
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,670
what she saw in a black page was the,

645
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,840
the curtains of a theater ready
to open endless possibility.

646
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,120
So it's that very appreciation of the
play of the dramatic shared by the

647
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:10,680
grandmother repeated even in this,
uh,

648
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,760
inarticulate artistic creation of the
child that builds the sense of artistic

649
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:20,830
identity as an inherited one.

650
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,670
Yeah.

651
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,130
So I'm,
I'm not going to go on with this,

652
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:29,870
but I just show you that little passage
and suggest some of the ways that it's

653
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:35,110
built up over the course of the book
to show you that Kingston's novel or

654
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:37,610
autobiography,

655
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,640
even though it fulfills the convention
so completely that it looks like genre

656
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:48,440
fiction. If you located in 1976
when it was first published,

657
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,140
it's not, it's not at the
end of a long line of these.

658
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:55,190
It's at the beginning.

659
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,020
So it is one of the first popular books
to bring together Barthes insights with

660
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:09,581
those of the identity politics beginning
in the 60s so Morrison and Kingston

661
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:14,891
both are some of the first to take
modernist self consciousness about writing

662
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,680
and combine it with this
interest in identity.

663
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,800
So that's why I think it's sort of doesn't
do her justice to see this as genre

664
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:29,240
fiction as to as to predictable because
it was one of the early versions of it.

665
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,760
So next week we're going to start reading
housekeeping. Just hold on one step

666
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,770
and I want you to think about whether
housekeeping fits the identity plot model,

667
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,090
and if it does, how it does, and if
it doesn't, how it doesn't. Um, it,

668
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,470
that identity plot model was very
influential in its early reception.

669
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:54,800
So I want you to think about
how that worked. Thank you.
