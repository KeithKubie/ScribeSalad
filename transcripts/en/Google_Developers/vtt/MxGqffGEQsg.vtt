00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.430
&gt;&gt;Eric: Welcome to the Android device manufacture
fireside chat. My name is Eric

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.830
Chu. I am responsible for many of the developer
initiative that some of you may

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.750
be familiar with. I'm also the moderator for
this session. So the goal of this

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.560
session really is provide a venue so that
our device manufacturer partners can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.872
give you an overview about what they've been
doing with Android and where we've

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:29.500
been going and also give you opportunity to
ask questions on some of their great

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.230
Android products that they're making. So with
us on the far right with Bill

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
Maggs. He is the -- Sony Ericsson's head of
developer partner for North

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.329
America; next to him we have Ciaran Rochford,
he is Samsung's director of mobile

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.839
R&amp;D group; we also Joon Kang, who is LG Electronics,
head of strategic alliance;

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.069
and then on the far left, we have Lori Fraleigh,
who is the -- who is Motorola's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:00.319
director developer platform and services.
So the format of this session is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.500
that each one of them is gonna spend about
five minutes to kind of talk about

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.159
what they've been doing with Android, why
Android's important, where they're

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.229
taking Android within the product portfolio,
and then when they're done, we'll

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.640
open the floor for questions. I'm also told
that I need to kinda let you know

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.381
that if you want to monitor live notes and
also answer questions in the wave

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:30.430
please go to http://bit.ly/waveio. With that,
why don't we start with Bill.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.439
&gt;&gt;Bill: Hi, everybody. I've been having a
great time at this conference 'cause

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.609
it's pretty much the largest gathering that
we know about of strictly Android

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.219
developers, although there's obviously a lot
of you that are developing for more

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.859
than one platform. So I'll just talk for a
minutes about how Sony Ericsson sees

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:57.139
Android, the products that we're coming out
with and, you know, our hopes really

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:02.869
for this platform in the future. So we've
been working on it for some time. I

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:11.819
think we're an early adherent of going Android
in our product portfolio. As you

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.040
guys probably know, we've been a headset company
for a long time with -- present

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.620
in many markets making products based on a
lot of different kinds of software

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.989
platforms. But as our CEO has recently said,
Android is really going to be our

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.160
emphasis going forward 'cause we think that
it's really architected for the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.879
future from a technical point of view and
also from -- hopefully from a business

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:45.110
point of view. It's got its own interesting
aspects to it and we are coming to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.930
market in a big way in 2010. We take a certain
approach to doing products where

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.851
we try -- we think there are certain thing
that is we're good at that are in

00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:02.130
line with our kind of identity and we've really
worked very hard to bring some

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.189
of those capabilities to our Android products,
working with Google along the way

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.420
and we'll continue to, to try and make the
platform work better and make really

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.730
the template for you, as developers, work
better, to give you more opportunities

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.660
to create things because we do fundamentally
believe that one of the things that

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.939
an Open Platform like Android gives is the
ability to put the information in

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.379
your hands that are gonna help to, you know,
really sell our products in the

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:40.049
future. So the products that we're bringing
to market in 2010 that kind of

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.400
reflect our approach to Android are ones -- the
first of them being our flag

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.489
ship, the X10, which is now shipping in the
world. It's the fastest selling

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.040
smartphone in the history of Japan. And so
Howard Stringer was talking some

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.469
smack earlier about that I guess, compared
to the iPhone. And it's coming to

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:07.079
market everywhere. One of the things that
I can say to you is that all of our

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.849
Android products are going to be coming out
just -- not just globally but also

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:17.100
in -- in the United States during 2010. The
X10 is a product that has a lot of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.790
fantastic capabilities of things that people
thing Sony Ericsson's really good

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.690
at like imaging, multimedia, the idea of entertainment
and things we can do with

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.690
the device. So we've really started with a
strong -- the strong Android, you

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.030
know, base, and added things to it. For instance,
we have the capability of

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.320
doing face recognition and video scene recognition
right out of the camera

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.030
module. These are things that we're bringing
to market to really help the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.340
handset be really great but we also want these
kinds of technologies to be

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.500
things that we share with you. So other products
that are now out and they're

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.630
going to be coming to this part of the world
as well as everywhere else you can

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.320
see in our developer -- our OEN sandbox downstairs
are of a very different form

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.080
factor than the X10 which is a big, beautiful,
four-inch device, 4M screen

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.320
device, which is another statement I wanna
make about Android. We're bringing

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.510
the X10 Mini and Mini Pro out and if you see
those products, they're really,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.710
really taking Android in a totally new direction
which is I think very

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.450
important. That announcement that there are
a hundred thousand activations

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:32.850
going on, umm, every day with Android is only
gonna continue if we take Android

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.000
into every corner of the mobile portfolio.
And for hundreds of millions of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.770
people in the world, they want devices like
this. So we wanna take all the

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.670
power and functionality of Android and make
it accessible and what we've done

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.470
with these two new products is we've created
a one-handed touch which, you know,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.280
we consider to be very compact, very clever,
got a lot of interesting features

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.740
with a unique four corners UI. But there's
an important statement here. We

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.300
haven't fragmented the platform to do this.
We've made it so that your

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.690
applications are gonna run on this and we've
got developer guidelines and tools

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.710
on our developer site, developer.sonyericsson.com,
to help you bring your

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.470
products to these kinds of devices which are,
I think, really, really going to

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.540
help Android succeed in the long run while
keeping it a unified platform so that

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.920
all of your creations can run across those
products. That's basically what I

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.220
have to say.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.720
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you, Bill. Great. Well, it's
great to be here as well. Again, my

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.380
name is Ciaran Rochford, I'm the director
of Android at Samsung San Jose office.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.680
So it's great to be here at Google I/O this
week and get a chance to meet some

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.190
active Android developers. I've met a lot
of people in the pod and had a lot of

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.720
hard questions already so hopefully this is
more of a fireside than a grilling

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.610
today but I'm prepared. Umm, so one thing
that happened to me recently that I

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:00.220
wanted to share before I went to my main comments
and that is, my mother-in-law

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.370
asked me a question. She said, "Ciaran, what
are you working on?" And I

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.430
decided to pull out Android handset and actually
show her the handset. I went

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.841
to multitasking and multiple home screens,
and how network location finders work

00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:15.370
and it all sounded great to me. I was very
interested but I could tell when I

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.630
looked at my mother-in-law, she wasn't, and,
umm, I could also tell she was kind

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:26.780
of thinking about how did my daughter end
up with a guy like this?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.780
[laughter]

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.780
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: So luckily for me, though, when
I showed her some of the apps created

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.780
by you, the community, in relation to news,
stock, weather, entertainment, she

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.850
started to understand why this is important
and augmented reality is also

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.740
something she really enjoyed. So, again, this
really reemphasized to me that

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:48.030
the Android development community is at the
heart of Android and actually looks

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.486
like my mother-in-law's heart now as well
so I've got two bonuses there. So I

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:57.740
have two main points I wanna cover. The first
is Samsung's commitment to

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:03.940
Android. I'm happy to say, as the second largest
manufacturer in the world that

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.841
a large portion of our smartphones this year
will be based in Android. I think

00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:11.321
it's clear to see that Android has moved from
an early-adapter platform to the

00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:17.110
mainstream and with that will come a lot of
opportunities for increased

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:22.380
application download and sales. This will
also bring new challenges to the

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.700
areas of device compatibility and developer
support. I'm happy so say Samsung

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.930
is actively working on these areas already.
And speaking of handsets, I would

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.399
like to speak a little bit about our new Galexy
S handset, which is available

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:41.170
for view at our pod. This device has Samsung's
new super analogue display which

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:48.420
is WVJ in resolution, it also has a very thin
form factor and saves power. The

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.850
Galexy S also comes with 16 gigabytes of external
storage, a one gigahertz CPU

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:59.070
and both front and rear facing cameras. And
like my colleague here, Samsung's

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:05.040
also looking to make sure those are exposed
to you in terms of API in terms of

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.000
front-facing camera so you can take advantage
and build new apps that are very

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.550
creative. Again, drive that content to our
users. So the second thing I wanna

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.180
talk about is Samsung's commitment to the
Android developer community. I'm

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.949
happy to announce that we're going to be extending
our developer program, which

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:27.750
is called Samsung Mobile Innovator, to cover
Android this summer. It can be

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.530
found online at innovator.samsungmobile.com.
It'll have detailed technical

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.870
specifications on our handsets and also provide
direct support for developers.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.740
We want to make sure that your apps look great
on our handsets so that's really

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.740
our goal.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.740
[pause]

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.990
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: We know this is important because
we think Android developers are key

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:54.000
to making end consumers want to use Android
and so that's why we need to provide

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.430
this support. So to close, Samsung's one of
the original OHA members is very

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.829
excited about the growth and possibilities
Android offers and we look forward to

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:08.499
working with you and the rest of the ecosystem
to make sure it evolves and

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:12.250
grows. Thank you very much.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.370
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.620
&gt;&gt;Joon: Should I stand or, uh –

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.319
&gt;&gt;Eric: Anything. You can dance if you want.

00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:33.639
&gt;&gt;Joon: Certainly I'm not bad -- a good dance
so I'll just stand. First of all,

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:37.240
thank you very much for hosting this wonderful
event. I'm sure that everyone

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.921
here is benefiting in a lot of great technology
from Google not only from

00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:41.680
Android respect but from all over technology
arena. My name is Joon Kang, I'm

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.800
leading the Android product development in
San Jose office in LG Electronics.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.420
As you know, we are working very closely with
Google not only for Android but

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:56.680
also lot of different consumer devices such
as, you know, netbook, and TVs, and

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.180
even the home networking system and we are
also looking for as a partnership

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.960
getting into the emerging marketplaces where
our LG brand is so strong. So

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.420
coming back to Android now, we launched Optimus
 -- I'm not sure how many people

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.089
that were aware of it. We launched the product
in Europe and globally last

00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:23.749
month as well as the Optimus Q, one of the
series of the Optimus product, in

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:32.439
Korea as well. And, uh, I guess everyone is
showing their own device so I guess

00:11:32.439 --> 00:11:36.100
I should do the same. This is Verizon Ally.
This is a GD product [inaudible] experience

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.370
device
that we work very hard, very closely with

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:47.649
Google for many months and one thing
I'm really proud of this product is the -- I

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:52.260
can confidently say that it is
world's best keyboard ever designed helped

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:59.199
through the Google engine. Thanks
Google again. So the reason that we are investing

00:11:59.199 --> 00:12:04.430
heavily on the Android is
very simple. It's very rationalized. Number

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:09.519
one of course is it's free. Free
and yet it's the best. You know, free is a

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:14.139
very strong word; second thing,
Optimus, where the developer like you and

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:20.570
myself can realize the, you know,
creative thought into the reality; and third

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:27.529
thing is obviously the very healthy
ecosystem behind it. I'm very, you know, very

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:32.100
excited that, you know, wherever
I see them going into Android market it's

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.019
just the number of application coming
in I don't know how many on a daily basis

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:43.350
but I heard that the quarterly growth
rate, the number of application is over 70

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:49.160
percent, which is phenomenal. So
without further adieu, we at LG is very much

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.980
committed and convinced that
Android is the chosen one to be succeeding

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:59.720
on the leading the technology more
diverse places. So we are ready to contribute

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:05.379
to the, you know, new
technologies such as the dual core, dual display,

00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:12.579
you know, and HTE support as
well as the LTE. In terms of the LTE, long

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:19.680
term evolution, we are the first in
company that will deliver the product -- deliver

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.649
the technology, as well as the
number one, the world's best technology provider

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:28.709
in displays. And the last
thing I wanna touch a little bit on our -- our

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:34.410
 -- our endeavor to reach out to
developers worldwide. We have the web site

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:40.829
called developer.lgmobile.com where
you can connected to the, you know, all the

00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:47.220
developer worldwide as well as you
can submit or suggest any constructive suggestion,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.310
idea, where we can more
innovative, you know, and motivate and deliver

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:56.019
the better and, you know,
creative product into the consumer's spaces.

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:57.160
Thank you.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.480
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you, Joon.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.800
&gt;&gt;Lori: Hi, I'm Lori Fraleigh and I'm the
Director of the Developer Platform

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.470
Tools and Technical Services Team at Motorola
and Motorola decided quite a while

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.279
ago to base a huge percentage of its phone
portfolio on Android. Android to us

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:20.059
is the perfect mobile operating system for
us to grow our -- our future on.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:25.600
It's open, it's well-architected to grow and
evolve over time, and it allows us

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.160
to spend our time innovating on top of it
and to bring consumers and developers

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.029
cool and unique features on which they can
build applications and experiences to

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:39.069
wow the world. And we don't have to invest
in re-architecting a mobile

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:42.329
operating system from scratch. We get everything
we need from Android so we're

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:45.999
very excited about that. We've launched more
than ten different distinct

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:51.810
devices in over a hundred different, umm,
regions, distributors, retail markets,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.230
and carriers around the world. You know, we've
extended our Android portfolio

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.879
all around the world and we're very excited
by what is out there. We're getting

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:03.639
rave reviews on a number of our different
products and the one thing I've seen

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:07.360
standing in the sandbox this week is everyone
likes a different product.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.759
Someone'll come up and say, "Wow, this is
the greatest keyboard. This has the

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:13.610
best slider experience." Someone else thinks
a different phone is better and

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.999
that's gonna be the same way with all the
different applications you create.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:21.790
You're creating applications that are just
gonna wow many different segments of

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.240
the market whether it's a productivity application,
a game, a multimedia

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.410
application, you're creating different app
experiences that are just gonna wow

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.730
consumers out there and drive adoption of
your applications. Motorola has a

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.070
very long history of working with developers
and I'm part of the MOTODEV

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.500
Developer Network that engages with people
like you every day. We take what all

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.380
the great resources that Google's created
for you to enable you to create

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.080
Android applications and provide you with
the additional resources you need to

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.170
understand how to make your applications work
well on our devices. Whether it's

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.060
talking about unique features on our handsets
and how to create one application

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.920
that works across the entire array of Android,
uh, devices yet when it's running

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.889
on our application takes advantage of a unique
feature -- so there's know

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:07.470
fragmentation, you've got one binary working
everywhere -- we've got resources

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.439
for that; we have community based discussion
boards where you can ask your

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:19.589
questions about how to develop for our app
 -- for our handsets; and then we go

00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:29.160
around the world evangelizing Android to developers
in all locations of the

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:41.490
world. We did our first Android developer
summit in San Diego last fall at

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:50.220
CTIA. We went to Beijing in January and we
just competed -- completed a

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.240
two-week tour of Latin America speaking to
Android developers in Mexico City,

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:04.300
Buenos Aires, and Sao Paulo, Brazil, and I
can tell you that what you see here

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.200
for Android enthusiasm in the U.S. is existent
in all markets of the world.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.370
Everywhere we go, people are excited about
creating applications for Android

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.680
devices, they're excited about the power of
the platform and they're constantly

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:30.190
coming up with things that amaze us. We've
talked to developers all the time

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:39.761
but we constantly see new ideas for applications
and we encourage you to be in a

00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:48.090
innovative and work on all sorts of neat ways
to bring your applications to

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:56.210
market. It's us doing cool hardware features,
cool software features that

00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:03.430
enable cool applications from you, it's the
community that's what's driving the

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:26.560
growth and adoption of Android and we're really
excited to be a part of that.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:55.580
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you. So, umm, the next part
is we're going to open up the floor to

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:18.320
questions. You can either come up to the mic
 -- one of the two mics in the

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:38.810
aisle to ask questions or you can enter it
in the Wave, with the URL, and, umm,

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.120
looks like we have –

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:51.831
&gt;&gt;audience member: First question to Samsung.
We grad to hear that you guys are

00:19:51.831 --> 00:20:00.800
committed to Android. Great. What about Bada?
Is it competition? How do we

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.940
see that long term?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:22.140
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Thank you for
that question. So, umm, I think the one thing

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:31.690
we try to
do at Samsung is make sure we have choices

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:45.060
for our customers whether it be
carriers or the end user and Android's a great

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:54.030
platform and we're making a huge
investment on that platform and shipping an

00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:00.930
enormous number of devices with that
platform. But in certain geographical locations,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:13.400
or with certain carriers, or
certain geos around the world, it isn't just

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:20.030
appropriate. We wanna make sure
everyone has a smartphone and that allows

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:25.540
us to do that as a secondary solution.
The thing I'd say is, you know, there's a

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.590
very large domain. Bada is built on
Samsung's own existing platform which we've

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:34.250
had for a long time and will be
exposing APIs as well. But I don't think they're

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.250
in conflict.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.250
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. Gentleman on the left.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:41.930
&gt;&gt;audience member: Is it -- okay. Umm, so
first I would like to thank you all for

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:47.540
coming to interface with us developers. So
I have two questions and they can be

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.930
answered by any of you. The first question
is, on the iPhone platform, umm,

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:58.770
there is certainly a large segment of iPhone
users who the developers can, umm,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:05.020
market their apps for but there's an even
bigger segment and that is for iPod

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:11.580
Touch users who have a device that is less
expensive and doesn't have a cell

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:22.810
phone radio and so far we haven't seen anything
like that for Android where it

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:29.790
is a small form factor like what we have,
umm, that fits in the pocket but is

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:36.210
less expensive and doesn't have a cell radio
and want to, uh, get your thoughts

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.591
on that, whether or not, umm, you four manufacturers
will be considering that.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:43.310
And my second question is, uh, currently in
the release products we have almost

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.371
two or three classes of devices where some
are Google experienced and some are

00:22:47.371 --> 00:22:52.310
customized UIs and some might even be something
else, might not even be

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:57.380
recognizably Android. And right now for our
consumers going to the store to buy

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.850
a product, they might not necessarily know
that a product is running Android and

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:11.761
will run my application. So I wanna get your
thoughts on how, umm, on the

00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:17.860
marketing side, we can message better to the
end users that this is indeed

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:24.300
Android product and will run applications
for the Android ecosystem. Thank you.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.300
[pause]

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.690
&gt;&gt;Bill: Do you wanna take that?

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.290
&gt;&gt;Lori: Sure. Umm, I guess to address your
first question, you know, I can't

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:39.740
comment on any future products but we're always
looking to innovate in terms of

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:47.340
form factors and different market segments.
So I think as you saw when Android

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:54.750
first started it was going after the higher
end smartphone market and you've

00:23:54.750 --> 00:24:06.160
started to see it come down into some of the
lower tiers, uh, in terms of

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:13.070
handsets that are coming out from the different
manufacturers. So I think as

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:20.840
you see the years go on and as we move from
2010 into 2011, you'll see Android

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:30.510
on a wider variety of phones in the market.
Umm, I'm gonna let some other

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:39.050
people comment further. In terms of marketing,
you know, we do a lot of work

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.510
with our carrier customers in terms of how
they wanna market the device and so

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:52.310
it's definitely gonna vary a little bit on
a per customer basis but we are doing

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:56.870
a lot more to evangelize the applications
that are available for the phones.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.710
Umm, and again that depends very much on a
market demographic of a particular

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:07.410
phone. Is this a high-end multimedia phone
you're gonna see more emphasis on

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.260
the multimedia apps. If it's -- is it going
after the teens, you might see more

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:16.040
emphasis on social networking and games. And
so we do this in partnership with

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.270
the carrier or the retail operator, depending
on the market segment of the

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.270
phone.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:37.220
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah. I would agree with Lori that
it does depend -- the way that the

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:43.020
Android flavor of a particular product that
we make is marketed does really

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:49.360
obviously varied by geography and by customer.
But there is an old kind of

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:57.080
saying in our business that the end user doesn't
care what platform it is but I

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.190
think that that's changing, actually, and
I think the strong reflection of our

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.980
conversations with our customers, our operator
customers is that, in fact,

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:14.320
Android is a great way to -- to help to make
 -- to sell a device. So I see -- I

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:24.750
see it, uh, really, really becoming an important
part of the identity of a lot

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:34.580
of our products and I think the people -- the
carriers that'll be carrying them

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:43.440
see the Android brand as an important way
because, you know, I mean, that --

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.790
your applications and the extensibility of
the Open Platform are what are gonna

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:53.210
continue to sell those products. So I think
it's -- it's gonna be a big deal.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:59.850
&gt;&gt;Joon: Okay. The first question is the, you
know, the LG Electric has a variety

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.960
of the -- I would say the first spectrum of
the consumer device. We have

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:12.880
definite plan to utilize the benefit Android
operating system or market a lot of

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:19.720
different consumer device. However, the point
being is that you mention the

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:34.360
iPhone like device probably we need to, uh,
if you have some constructive idea,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:45.780
let's talk, you know, afterward. Second question
is, uh, you know, we ultimate

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:56.880
deliver the product in the consumer and the
consumers is the carriers. Carriers

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:06.640
with different need and customizing requirement
because they feel like they know

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:20.870
how to address consumer's need on their specific
market. For instance, if you

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:46.380
look at China, I mean the, you know, the legality
matter, we can't really

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:58.790
utilize the greatest, you know, Google mobile
service on that vision. So I'm

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:12.990
sure that carriers and, you know, different
 -- in marketing, they utilize

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:20.771
different, you know, different application
service to better address the

00:29:20.771 --> 00:29:30.980
consumer's needs. So we are not trying to
put too much in a different way of

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:40.710
the Android but, I don't know, for certain,
marketing certain, the reason that

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:55.780
we have to, you know, respect whatever is
the market constraint. Okay?

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:09.460
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Yeah. Just to add to that, I think
Android does offer a lot in the way

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:20.610
of convergence as well with all these different
devices running very similar on

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:33.530
a different operating system and obviously
as a large manufacturer like Samsung

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:42.020
covers a variety of different product portfolios,
we see that as an opportunity.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:50.640
The other thing I'd say to the second part
is, much as my colleague said here,

00:30:50.640 --> 00:31:01.520
is that we need to inform the channel and
make sure people are aware when people

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:12.710
are being sold handsets that the messaging
is correct. I think we are actively

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.030
working on that.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:19.970
&gt;&gt;Eric: Yeah. I think it's the one last thing
to add is that obviously we've

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:24.540
been working very closely with handset developer
partners and also carriers

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:30.030
around the world and the consistent theme
we're hearing is that, especially on

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.690
the carrier side, that there is clear understanding
that application is

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:39.020
important and we're working very closely with
them number one to make sure that

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:53.280
Android application is on these devices so
that the user can get to the

00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:05.490
applications that you guys are building, and
second is that in many cases a lot

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:14.480
of these marketing campaign actually center
around applications. And so, umm,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:22.040
you know, what are all these carriers looking
for? Are they looking for

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:30.000
compelling, awesome application to help them
sell more devices? So the more we

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.880
can build these great applications to help
differentiate what -- how Android

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:44.190
devices are better than some of the other
devices, the more eager many of these

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:54.930
carriers and many of these partners here on
stage will be willing to, you know,

00:32:54.930 --> 00:33:00.730
invest to kinda -- to leverage to help sell
devices. So, umm, let me take a

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:07.070
question from -- from the Wave and I actually
saw a few questions along the same

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:13.380
theme and the theme is, we're developers.
We really would like to have root

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:36.430
access to the device so that we can really
accelerate and do interesting things.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:48.490
Let me throw it to the panel and see what
you guys think about that.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:49.490
[laughter]

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.490
[pause]

00:33:50.490 --> 00:34:01.090
&gt;&gt;Joon: I think the earlier, you know, provide
kind of the access to developer

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:12.799
but I think that's why I think last, you know,
trained developer made a, I

00:34:12.799 --> 00:34:21.970
guess, not a good image for our devices. So
I guess the -- that the message I'm

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:33.961
trying to, you know, deliver here is that
we are very much open to -- to, you

00:34:33.961 --> 00:34:42.809
know, open up to the, you know, development,
you know, platform to the developer

00:34:42.809 --> 00:34:50.409
world. But, however, we'd like to set up some
sort of, like, a protocol. Like,

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:57.660
whoever sign up, and register, and certify
developer who can get our, you know,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.279
developer image so on and so forth.

00:35:01.279 --> 00:35:10.299
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Yeah. Just to add to that, I think,
umm, you know, most people don't

00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:18.619
need access to the bootloader. If you're a
regular developer, which a majority

00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:25.290
of developers are, as developing apps, you
don't need bootloaders. If you're

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:32.509
trying to hack a kernel or something that's
a different story but that's a very

00:35:32.509 --> 00:35:36.579
small percentage of the people in general
and maybe that can be addressed in a

00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:42.519
different way. We are trying to make sure
that the regular app developers are

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:47.529
taken care of and can use regular devices
for the development.

00:35:47.529 --> 00:35:52.849
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah. I mean, the other thing, obviously,
most of you guys are

00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:56.880
interested in making applications and there
are contributors to the overall

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.550
Android platform, you know, that are doing
system software. That's a different

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.450
category. Our view is, you know, you take
a really well-architected platform

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:13.860
like Android and there's a lot of stuff you
can do with applications in our

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:22.540
sandbox we're showing off a bunch on this
little mini phone where we basically

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:31.220
came up with a zooming capability to do one-handed
zooming to avoid this need

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:36.670
for pinch -- pinching on a small screen and
all done entirely in application

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:43.539
code and we're sharing the sample code that
you can use it in your applications

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:48.800
as well. So I think good architecture makes
it possible for a lot of your

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:56.190
creativity to come alive with the applications
without access to all the rest of

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:01.520
the bottom of the platform.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:07.829
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. Really quick question to the
right.

00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:18.480
&gt;&gt;audience member: I just wanted to add to
that. Umm, yeah. So you say you don't allow

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:26.259
people root access because it kinda messes
with that, uh, what? The environment

00:37:26.259 --> 00:37:38.210
that developers are building the platform
for but wouldn't you, like, assume

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:51.119
that whoever's, like, rooting their device
if you were to open it up would know

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:58.910
that there are consequences that applications
might not run how they expected?

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:07.960
And, uh, my actual question was, do you guys
have any plans to do any, like,

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:15.809
serial device kind of like external accessories?
I know that I've seen it with,

00:38:15.809 --> 00:38:25.190
uh -- like, a few devices already have, like,
serial interfaces but they're

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:39.790
disabled in the kernel. But I was curious
if, like, on the iPhone, anyway,

00:38:39.790 --> 00:39:09.440
there's GPS accessories or if, like, you're
in a building GPS doesn't really

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:18.339
work so the people make, like, external antennas
that the app can talk to and,

00:39:18.339 --> 00:39:26.890
uh, there's, like, stereo integration and
I'm just curious if you guys are

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:31.680
planning to add that to any of your devices.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.780
&gt;&gt;Eric: Accessories.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:39.930
&gt;&gt;Lori: So Motorola has a long history of
doing accessories for our devices

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:46.730
through our companion products group. Umm,
in terms of a lot of specific tight

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:52.440
integrations we unfortunately haven't, you
know, announced a lot that we can

00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:00.711
talk about yet but it's something that Motorola
does invest a lot in.

00:40:00.711 --> 00:40:01.711
[pause]

00:40:01.711 --> 00:40:10.430
&gt;&gt;Bill: Same. Accessories are a great business,
you know. Uh, traditionally

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:18.509
Sony Ericsson's made fantastic margins on
accessories so I'm sure we're very

00:40:18.509 --> 00:40:20.670
interested in it.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:27.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: I mean more from, like,
a developer's standpoint.

00:40:27.869 --> 00:40:29.309
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah.

00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:51.769
&gt;&gt;audience member: Like, if I was gonna make
an app that had an accessory that would

00:40:51.769 --> 00:40:55.470
complement it versus just using pre-made accessories
from the carrier. Do you

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.970
guys plan to, like, uh, I guess move in that
direction?

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:05.019
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah. We just have to consider it
on a case-by-case basis. We

00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:07.140
definitely are looking at it.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.920
&gt;&gt;Eric: Yeah. And the platform itself is,
uh, for example, support USB, we, for

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:19.600
example, over in the sandbox we have square
using audio jack as an accessory to

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.410
swipe credit card. So there's actually many
ways with a Bluetooth to connect

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:32.210
with a device and build accessories. So we're
starting to see more and more of

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:37.359
this interesting, innovative accessories that
people are building through the

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:43.010
standard APIs, the standard way of connecting
with many Android devices that all

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:51.910
these guys are building. Question to the left?

00:41:51.910 --> 00:42:04.329
&gt;&gt;audience member: Uh, yes. I wanted to obviously
say thank you again for all you guys

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:10.880
coming out and by all means not to attack
you at all, but purely --

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.880
[laughter]

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.470
&gt;&gt;audience member: That's an open-ended statement.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.680
&gt;&gt;Eric: I'm looking for a shield.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:28.450
&gt;&gt;audience member: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm curious
to find out if any -- if there's

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.450
any – yeah.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.450
[laughter]

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:46.450
&gt;&gt;audience member: Putting on the raincoats
now. Is the any future talk about any type

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:59.490
of longevity to the battery life of these
devices? Umm, through development,

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:12.309
I've experienced some problems with the longevity
of the batteries, most of them

00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:29.040
only lasting about a half a day through general
use or my extraneous use. Is

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:38.079
there any plans to maybe roll out a battery
that lasts three to four days?

00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:44.029
Something with a solar connection to it or
something that we can actually plan

00:43:44.029 --> 00:43:58.370
on taking it for the weekend and not coming
back to it?

00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.370
[pause]

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:03.700
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Well, obviously battery life is
very important and we take it very

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:17.359
seriously. I will say, just as my own pitch
here, the Galexy S has 20 percent

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:27.559
better battery life in terms of its monitor
power requirements than the previous

00:44:27.559 --> 00:44:36.789
one because of the super AMOLED display. So
we are very actively working on

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:44.380
that. And just a final pitch here, this is
not only 20 percent better battery

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:54.599
saving but actually 20 percent brighter as
well so you get the best of both

00:44:54.599 --> 00:45:04.579
worlds. And I think like all the manufacturers
we're measuring that and

00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:06.020
thinking of ways of trying to improve.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:13.130
&gt;&gt;Joon: Same here. I mean, the first thing
recommendation for you is to change

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:22.900
your auto synchronization period so you can
get a lot better life.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:28.460
&gt;&gt;audience member: I have 13 e-mails.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.460
[laughter]

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:41.410
&gt;&gt;Joon: All right. Battery's one of the, uh,
major technology investment we are

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:52.369
putting on. We notice that especially smartphone
and even in a smartphone get

00:45:52.369 --> 00:45:59.000
connect to the whole different customer device
like the TVs and, uh, all

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.380
different device. So things get, you know,
is not more attention to it and

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:10.310
there is also different technology now that,
you know, solars through the

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:14.150
charging technology as you all coming in.
So that is something area that we're

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.150
still investing on.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.150
[pause]

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.410
&gt;&gt;Lori: Umm, Motorola has a unique social
networking service called MOTOBLUR on

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:24.010
some of our handsets and what this does is
rather than having five or ten

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.751
different apps that are constantly pulling
the network at different intervals

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:34.150
and starting the data connection pull and
shutting down, it batches the updates

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:46.650
into Push updates. And so this is something
that we have done through the

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:52.029
experiences we create for consumers to optimize
the battery life. And so we're

00:46:52.029 --> 00:46:58.029
taking these experiences that we've created
for our own software and trying to

00:46:58.029 --> 00:47:06.300
figure out how we can enable developers to
take advantage to this as well to

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:12.119
improve the overall experience for the consumer
on the handset.

00:47:12.119 --> 00:47:13.119
[pause]

00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:16.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Yeah. I think the last thing to add,
too, is it really is a partnership

00:47:16.869 --> 00:47:22.160
with all of you, too, in terms of how you
build your application, how often you

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.150
hit the network, how often you, you know,
put something on the screen. All of

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:33.470
these have a huge impact. I mean, I can't
tell you how many times I've -- my

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:38.130
relatives are using Android phone not really
understand what's happening under

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:43.210
the hood and they don't understand why the
battery's draining while meanwhile

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:49.960
they're getting all the e-mails in the back.
And so I think there are a lot of

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:59.410
things that, you know, all of you can do to,
you know, to help, you know, kind

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:07.150
of reduce the amount of battery -- the amount
of power you're using on each of

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.150
these devices.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.150
&gt;&gt;audience member: Great. Thank you very much.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.900
&gt;&gt;Eric: So, up, let me kinda go to the Wave.
Umm, so I also saw a few questions

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:16.220
about updates. Uh, obviously we just announce
Android 2.2 so I think everybody

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:22.749
have -- big question is that, you know, where
are each one of your plan in terms

00:48:22.749 --> 00:48:29.039
of updating the devices that, you know, developers
may have to, you know, the

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:31.489
next version -- the next release?

00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:32.489
[pause]

00:48:32.489 --> 00:48:40.519
&gt;&gt;Lori: So we will be pushing out Android
2.2 to the Droid over the next few

00:48:40.519 --> 00:48:47.119
months. Uh, we're working on the exact details
of the schedule in conjunction

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:52.160
with Google as well. It's announced, it's
not fully out in Open Source yet as

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:58.799
well as with Verizon in terms of how to time
that update. And we actually have

00:48:58.799 --> 00:49:09.220
a public web site where we post information
about when we expect to roll

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:20.890
software updates out to our various phones
in different regions in the world and

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:31.089
it's actually a pretty complex problem because
there's not just -- you know, we

00:49:31.089 --> 00:49:49.349
have more than one phone. Umm, on top of Android
we build a lot of different

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:56.559
experiences. There's carrier software, there's
pre-loaded applications, and

00:49:56.559 --> 00:50:16.400
unfortunately at times it's a little bit more
complicated process that some

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:31.819
would like in terms of rolling out updates
and so it's something that we do in

00:50:31.819 --> 00:50:41.950
conjunction with Google and our carrier partners
in terms of getting those

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:51.130
updates out to everyone. And so we do publish
that information for developers

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:55.140
and consumers to be aware of.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:51:03.140
&gt;&gt;Joon: I'm the same -- same scenario. I'm
the same situation that other people

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:19.029
have for a Google device that we let us huge
support from Google from -- for a

00:51:19.029 --> 00:51:28.849
device that are not a Google device we have,
you know, web interface that

00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:33.509
reaching out to the every single device automatically
over the web. However,

00:51:33.509 --> 00:51:38.539
you know, to identify which carriers, you
know, which version, you know, in our

00:51:38.539 --> 00:51:42.789
countries is a little bit tricky. But, however,
we do have infrastructure and

00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:46.630
we can automatically consumer that the device
can automatically global the web.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:47.630
[pause]

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.440
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Yeah. So, umm, in terms of Samsung
obviously because we are reaching a

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.829
lot of different markets there's different
strategies. But generally Samsung's

00:51:55.829 --> 00:52:02.640
always trying to make sure that the handsets
are updatable. For those working

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.920
with carriers obviously we have to work with
the carrier through those channels

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:17.859
but for the open market I would advise everyone
to download the new SGH program,

00:52:17.859 --> 00:52:27.569
which is Samsung's sync program, with your
PC and, uh, you can find a link on

00:52:27.569 --> 00:52:32.420
that at innovator.samsungmobile.com and that'll
have the latest bills available

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:38.309
for your -- for your handset and there's new
updates available depending on your

00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:42.829
geo, etc. But it is a complex problem and
we are definitely very focused on it.

00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:48.009
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah. So, uh, as with my colleagues
here, we're also going to be

00:52:48.009 --> 00:52:53.109
updating our devices during 2010. We've got
some announcements on that. That's

00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:58.450
also on our developer site. You can, umm,
find out the schedule for that as we

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:09.430
work it out with Google. Umm, we are in many,
many markets as well, obviously

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:21.359
globally and there's so many -- it's just
one of the hardest things to do when

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:25.950
it comes to continually making a product that
satisfies a wide variety of users.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:32.410
But, umm, but we're definitely committed to
staying current. It's the -- it's

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:38.680
the -- it's really the only way that, up,
that the innovations that are

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:47.140
introduced in a very aggressive way into Android
can, you know, become more

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:52.810
stable and then expose to developers and you
can take advantage of all that

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:58.789
stuff. So you're definitely gonna see us keeping
to that schedule.

00:53:58.789 --> 00:54:02.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you, Bill. Question to your
right.

00:54:02.869 --> 00:54:09.221
&gt;&gt;audience member: Yeah. I just wanna say
thanks, guys, for giving us the time today

00:54:09.221 --> 00:54:15.210
to
talk to us. Umm, fragmentation is one of the

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:29.140
words -- I wanna touch on that now
but it's one of the words that keeps getting

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.180
thrown around all the time and I
think partly that's due to, umm, Google. You

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.650
know, they're constantly now this
month updating their list of new versions

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:54.160
and as developers and consumers I
guess my question is mainly at the gentleman

00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:02.930
from Samsung. Umm, you guys -- I
know you guys are pretty focused on TouchWiz

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:13.509
right now but, umm, the moment I
think -- if I'm not mistaken was one of the

00:55:13.509 --> 00:55:28.259
first devices in the U.S. market to
get 2.1 before a lot of the other devices

00:55:28.259 --> 00:55:43.729
and I think, uh -- hope that's because
it's a stock Android device. And my main question

00:55:43.729 --> 00:55:53.109
is, is Samsung committed to
also coming out with stock Android devices

00:55:53.109 --> 00:56:03.809
to us? Most of us here
in the room

00:56:03.809 --> 00:56:10.190
are definitely what's considered power users.
Umm, are you guys committed to

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:21.119
coming out with more stock Android phones
that we hope will get updated to the

00:56:21.119 --> 00:56:23.890
newest version before the rest?

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:33.869
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Thank you. So that's, uh, that's
really good feedback and it's part of

00:56:33.869 --> 00:56:43.060
the reason we come to these developer forums
is to get feedback and to hear what

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.930
you're looking for as well. Umm, you know,
we are, as I said -- as you

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:56.910
mentioned, updating our handsets in the field
and we continue to do that.

00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:01.779
Specifically around TouchWiz, we are evolving
that. Exactly what it's

00:57:01.779 --> 00:57:20.819
configuration is, is still under development
but I really do appreciate your

00:57:20.819 --> 00:57:22.410
feedback.

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:31.089
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. Next person on the left.

00:57:31.089 --> 00:57:49.819
&gt;&gt;audience member: Actually, my question is
related to the previous question. It's also

00:57:49.819 --> 00:58:05.250
like I have maybe comments as well. For instance,
Motorola has a phone which

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:17.630
has two screens, LG has an Android phone,
has a longest screen and Samsung has a

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:29.849
phone has two cameras. All these are great
add-on to the phone. However, it

00:58:29.849 --> 00:58:43.009
created problems for the developers to develop
cross plat -- cross handsets

00:58:43.009 --> 00:58:57.380
Android applications. What other efforts has
been taken to improve to insure

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:06.950
the accountability of Android applications
cross different manufacturers?

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:18.249
Actually, my second question is that, uh,
there are three companies on the panel

00:59:18.249 --> 00:59:22.900
list has alternative platforms. There is the
opinion that, uh, after other

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.400
lower end manufacturers can be able to produce
Android-based smartphones, you

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:31.160
know, September 6 marks our two years, there
will be no space for alternative --

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:36.230
for other operating systems on a lower end
site. What's your comments on that

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:37.320
one? Thank you.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.320
[pause]

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.320
&gt;&gt;Lori: So I'll comment mostly on your -- your
first question. You know, every

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.320
single device Motorola has shipped is compliant
with the Android platform. It's

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.630
passed all the required tests from Google
to insure compliance. If you look at

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:45.539
some of the unique features we've created,
if you look at the Motorola Backflip,

00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:51.631
it has the unique navigation device on the
back of the device called the

00:59:51.631 --> 00:59:57.239
Backtrack. It is possible, despite the fact
that this is completely unique to

00:59:57.239 --> 01:00:04.479
Motorola, the write an application, a single
binary, that will work across all

01:00:04.479 --> 01:00:09.039
the Android devices yet when running on the
Motorola device takes advantage of

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:10.640
the Backtrack all within a single binary.
So to that extent, when we do come

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640
out with innovations, we ensure they're compliant,
we ensure that they don't

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640
create fragmentation, and then we publish
information to developers on how to

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640
take advantage of it and how to properly code
your application to insure that

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640
consumers have the best experience.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640
[pause]

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.760
&gt;&gt;Joon: Same here in the LG Electronic. Every
Android product we released to

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.290
the market under the Google CTS, Compliance
Testing Suite, and we get

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:20.290
certification from Google before the product
get launched. So I don't think we

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.729
are making, you know, any fragmentation here.
On top of that, whenever I make a

01:00:22.729 --> 01:00:25.230
extension we submit it back to the, you know,
the Open Source community for

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.380
getting back to the -- to nurture the Android
developer network.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.809
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Yeah. I think also very similarly,
we also passed CTS and it's now the

01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:40.880
compatibility documents online but I think
you can actually go and read and see

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:47.430
for yourselves exactly why that the test criteria
and the requirements to each

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:50.299
document is now public. So I think it's at
developer.android. --

01:00:50.299 --> 01:00:51.299
&gt;&gt;Eric: Sourceandroid.com.

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:54.220
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: Sourceandroid.com. So, uh, please
check that out. You can sort of

01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:02.840
sound what we're working on in terms of that.
And the thing I'd say is we also

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.660
have extensions like front-facing camera and
we will make those out as pure

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:12.960
add-ons and as someone else mentioned, you
can write an application that's

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.869
generic. It can specialize it behavior or
run time if it finds that extra

01:01:17.869 --> 01:01:18.869
functionality like from facing cameras available
or do something else if it's not.

01:01:18.869 --> 01:01:19.869
So that really is up to the developer.

01:01:19.869 --> 01:01:20.869
[pause]

01:01:20.869 --> 01:01:21.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah. I mean, there's a reason that
Android is growing so fast and one

01:01:21.869 --> 01:01:22.869
of the reasons that there are a variety of
products that are made out of it and

01:01:22.869 --> 01:01:23.869
some of them are gonna be, you know, have
front-facing cameras, and some won't,

01:01:23.869 --> 01:01:32.119
and some will be, you know, very expensive
and some will be very affordable. So

01:01:32.119 --> 01:01:40.960
that's part of the cause of success but as
with everybody else, we -- everything

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.950
is fully compatible. Umm, and we, you know,
Sony Ericsson, are also

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.150
contributing back a lot of what we do. You
can go to check out a lot of

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:51.230
what they contributions are and it's a dialogue.
Technology's always a dialogue

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.549
and so if there's a direction that we think
the products need to go and the

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:56.710
platform needs to support, we found a very
receptive, uh, ear in Google for how

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:57.869
to take that platform so it can generally
support something that we may add to

01:01:57.869 --> 01:01:58.869
make a particular product really shine.

01:01:58.869 --> 01:01:59.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Thank you. I think the only thing
 -- I just wanna make sure you guys

01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:00.869
don't miss it that we -- please go to source.android.com.
We've, uh, published

01:02:00.869 --> 01:02:01.869
some web pages around compatibility and on
there we have a compatibility

01:02:01.869 --> 01:02:02.869
definition document and also the compatibility
test Suite. So now all of you

01:02:02.869 --> 01:02:03.869
can see, you know, the -- in terms of the
specifications and the test reads that

01:02:03.869 --> 01:02:04.869
all of these partners are building the headset
against. They kinda get a better

01:02:04.869 --> 01:02:05.869
sense of how -- where we're doing, what kind
of tools we put in place to make

01:02:05.869 --> 01:02:06.869
sure these handsets are indeed compatible.
I see we're stacking up here. So

01:02:06.869 --> 01:02:07.869
quick question. All right.

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:08.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: My question is directed
mostly at -- to the Motorola. There's been

01:02:08.869 --> 01:02:09.869
a
couple news articles recently that you guys

01:02:09.869 --> 01:02:10.869
dropped the Google network location
provider and they were Skyhook. Could you

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:11.869
give us some kinda history there or
what was the reasoning and has that created

01:02:11.869 --> 01:02:12.869
any friction with Google as far as
creating Google-branded devices?

01:02:12.869 --> 01:02:13.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: Sure. So I think some of the write-ups
of the Skyhook press release were

01:02:13.869 --> 01:02:14.869
actually miswrite-ups. We haven't dropped
the Google network location provider

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:15.869
from the handsets. We have chosen to try to
integrate Skyhook's technology

01:02:15.869 --> 01:02:16.869
alongside of it to provide a variety of choice
for consumers and developers in

01:02:16.869 --> 01:02:17.869
terms of how they can get network location
information, umm, 'cause sometimes

01:02:17.869 --> 01:02:18.869
you're in a location where you might not be
able to get accuracy from one type

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:19.869
of device -- or one type of provider and so
there's different ways of doing it

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:20.869
but we're not dropping it and we're not replacing
it. Some of the initial

01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:21.869
write-ups were wrong and so we worked with
Google and with Skyhook to get those

01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:22.869
corrected.

01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:23.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Thank you.

01:02:23.869 --> 01:02:24.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. Question on the left.

01:02:24.869 --> 01:02:25.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Hello, guys. My name is
Sarcon. I from where, I used to be where

01:02:25.869 --> 01:02:26.869
you locate one of your pre-load partners.
First of all, thank you for coming

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:27.869
and, umm, for cherishing Android. Uh, my question
is, umm, about the same

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:28.869
thing, fragmentation. Umm, we deal with a
lot of carriers and, Android

01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:29.869
versions, different OEMs, UIs, and then permutation
of all we create this

01:02:29.869 --> 01:02:30.869
fragmentation. Uh, do you guys work together,
uh, among OEMs?

01:02:30.869 --> 01:02:31.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: We never talk. I never talk to them.

01:02:31.869 --> 01:02:32.869
[laughter]

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:33.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: And it's -- it's -- it
takes a long time for a device -- why does

01:02:33.869 --> 01:02:34.869
it
take so long for a device to receive upgrade

01:02:34.869 --> 01:02:35.869
from 1.5 to 2.1, like Hero? I know
HTC's not out there but, umm, do you guys

01:02:35.869 --> 01:02:36.869
work together to, I don't know, iron
this out?

01:02:36.869 --> 01:02:37.869
[pause]

01:02:37.869 --> 01:02:38.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: Lucky me, I'm still holding the mic.

01:02:38.869 --> 01:02:39.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: [laughter]

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:40.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: We can fight you for it.

01:02:40.869 --> 01:02:41.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: So the length of time to do an upgrade
depends on a variety of things.

01:02:41.869 --> 01:02:42.869
Umm, first, the version of Android has to
fully reach Open Source. You know,

01:02:42.869 --> 01:02:43.869
the day Google releases it, the source -- or
talks about it, the source code's

01:02:43.869 --> 01:02:44.869
not out there and that's not always I think
immediately known to all the

01:02:44.869 --> 01:02:45.869
consumers and developers. So the source code
has to hit the Open Source market,

01:02:45.869 --> 01:02:46.869
the Compatibility Test Suite has to be fully
published, we have to get our

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:47.869
software integrated and tested on top of it
and depending on the handset, you

01:02:47.869 --> 01:02:48.869
know, you've heard discussions of stock Android
versus more highly

01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:49.869
differentiated. You know, our phones that
have MOTOBLUR are highly

01:02:49.869 --> 01:02:50.869
differentiated and so the integration and
testing of that software on top of a

01:02:50.869 --> 01:02:51.869
new version of Android, umm, takes more time.
The integration and testing of a

01:02:51.869 --> 01:02:52.869
new version of Android on a different hardware
platform then would have been the

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:53.869
feature device for that version of Android
takes more time. The integration of

01:02:53.869 --> 01:02:54.869
testing of pre-load application of carrier-specific
requirements takes more

01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:55.869
time. And then there is the whole carrier
lab cycle and test cycle that takes a

01:02:55.869 --> 01:02:56.869
lot of time. And it's really hard to explain
all of that to the consumer, to

01:02:56.869 --> 01:02:57.869
the developer. Umm, you know, we'd like it
to be faster. We're constantly

01:02:57.869 --> 01:02:58.869
working to improve our ability to do this.
Umm, and we try and get information

01:02:58.869 --> 01:02:59.869
out to developers, you know, as readily as
we can. So it's something we're

01:02:59.869 --> 01:03:00.869
trying to work on and we know -- we know it's
hard.

01:03:00.869 --> 01:03:01.869
[pause]

01:03:01.869 --> 01:03:02.869
&gt;&gt;Joon: Same sequence and, uh, couple thing
probably is the chipset has to also

01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:03.869
be upgraded to the latest version as well
as when you're building umm, you know,

01:03:03.869 --> 01:03:04.869
the newer -- newer version of the Android
for the consumers that are out there,

01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:05.869
you always has to evaluate are the application
being customized for certain

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:06.869
carriers, certain languages, certain region,
blah, blah, blah because otherwise

01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:07.869
you cannot really ship the up-to-date version
to America two months after and

01:03:07.869 --> 01:03:08.869
then, for instance, like somewhere else in
another countries like six months

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:09.869
after. You have to much know same speed, addressing
the number of different

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:10.869
version simultaneously. That's why it's taking
a little while but we are

01:03:10.869 --> 01:03:11.869
trying -- absolutely trying to improve the
speed of the upgrading process.

01:03:11.869 --> 01:03:12.869
[pause]

01:03:12.869 --> 01:03:13.869
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: I don't -- I don't really have anything
to add. Samsung's very

01:03:13.869 --> 01:03:14.869
committed to making sure we can upgrade but
it is a complicated process, as my

01:03:14.869 --> 01:03:15.869
colleagues had mentioned.

01:03:15.869 --> 01:03:16.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: Umm, the only thing I would say is,
you know, you're a pre-load partner,

01:03:16.869 --> 01:03:17.869
I guess, so you benefit from your stuff working
really fantastically with some

01:03:17.869 --> 01:03:18.869
of our devices and you want that to continue
to happen when we upgrade to the

01:03:18.869 --> 01:03:19.869
next version of Android. So as Lori said,
there's layers of testing that stuff.

01:03:19.869 --> 01:03:20.869
We have to test it, our operator partners
have to test it, and man I wish it

01:03:20.869 --> 01:03:21.869
were faster. One thing I wanted to add in
case anybody mentions it, is

01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:22.869
something about the Android Market. When you
do, umm, write your apps and put

01:03:22.869 --> 01:03:23.869
them in the Android Market, you set max and
min for versions of Android and we

01:03:23.869 --> 01:03:24.869
were talking about this before but if you
want your stuff to appear like some of

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:25.869
the companies that we've worked with, umm,
their stuff runs great on our

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:26.869
products but it -- when -- when an upgrade
can happen, sometimes because of the

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:27.869
way they've uploaded it to the Android Market,
it can be momentarily not visible

01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:28.869
as downloading to our handsets. So make sure
when you put that manifest

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:29.869
together when you upload stuff that you're
following the upload path. You know,

01:03:29.869 --> 01:03:30.869
you're following the upgrade path, excuse
me, to make your products be able to

01:03:30.869 --> 01:03:31.869
continue to be visible to all of our products.

01:03:31.869 --> 01:03:32.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Yeah. Let me just clair -- make sure
everybody understands that. What

01:03:32.869 --> 01:03:33.869
we've done with between Android platform Android
Market is give developers the

01:03:33.869 --> 01:03:34.869
flexibility when they upload the application
to declare what version Android OS

01:03:34.869 --> 01:03:35.869
they want the application should be visible
to. Some developers decide may want

01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:36.869
to leave it open so they will say my application
will work on Android 1.5 and

01:03:36.869 --> 01:03:37.869
anything beyond that. And we've seen a lot
of case many app just works,

01:03:37.869 --> 01:03:38.869
developer never seen these new devices and
the app just works out of the box.

01:03:38.869 --> 01:03:39.869
In some cases, some developers are a little
more conservative, for good reasons.

01:03:39.869 --> 01:03:40.869
They decide I want my application only to
work on 1.5 and 1.6 and when that

01:03:40.869 --> 01:03:41.869
happens, when the user upgrade the device
to let's say 2.1 or 2.2, then

01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:42.869
obviously that device is no longer visible
to that application. So again what

01:03:42.869 --> 01:03:43.869
we're trying to do is give you more tools
so you have more choices in how you

01:03:43.869 --> 01:03:44.869
wanna structure your business, how you want
to distribute your application, and

01:03:44.869 --> 01:03:45.869
so just keep that in mind and then, you know,
it's completely up to you on how

01:03:45.869 --> 01:03:46.869
you want to structure things.

01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:47.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Thanks.

01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:48.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Question on the right.

01:03:48.869 --> 01:03:49.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Thank you. Umm, my question
has to do with, uh, customization of

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:50.869
settings and software applications for various
operators and I'd be interested

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:51.869
in hearing from all of you, maybe even a question
for Google but I guess the

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:52.869
lady from Motorola was talking about launching
phone -- launching products to

01:03:52.869 --> 01:03:53.869
multiple operators, multiple regions. Can
you provide any guidance or

01:03:53.869 --> 01:03:54.869
guidelines for how to customize your application
or customize the settings to

01:03:54.869 --> 01:03:55.869
meet the particular needs of an operator?

01:03:55.869 --> 01:03:56.869
[pause]

01:03:56.869 --> 01:03:57.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Can you give an example? What do you
mean by, like, a setting?

01:03:57.869 --> 01:03:58.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: A really simple one would
be browser bookmarks. If you had, you

01:03:58.869 --> 01:03:59.869
know, one -- three or four operators within
a single region and you wanted to be

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:00.869
able to -- to customize those bookmarks for
 -- for each operator.

01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:01.869
[pause]

01:04:01.869 --> 01:04:02.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: So I'm not aware of specific customizations
we do in that area although

01:04:02.869 --> 01:04:03.869
it's entirely possible that we do. Umm, if
you wanna, you know, talk more in

01:04:03.869 --> 01:04:04.869
depth I'd be happy to talk with you afterwards.
I'm just not aware of specific

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:05.869
things. You know, in terms of handling operator
requirements, you know, to the

01:04:05.869 --> 01:04:06.869
extent that they ask us to customize something
that they feel is a strong

01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:07.869
requirement as long as it doesn't violate
the compatibility document and the

01:04:07.869 --> 01:04:08.869
device still passes CTS, if it's something
that they feel is important to them

01:04:08.869 --> 01:04:09.869
and, you know, we come to an agreement, then
we make that customization for

01:04:09.869 --> 01:04:10.869
them. Umm, in terms of something specific
I'd be happy to talk with you more to

01:04:10.869 --> 01:04:11.869
understand the details and comment on a particular
device.

01:04:11.869 --> 01:04:12.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. One recommendation would be,
umm, use the network and what I mean

01:04:12.869 --> 01:04:13.869
by that is you can have your application on
the device determine what region

01:04:13.869 --> 01:04:14.869
it's running in, umm, and then from there
you can potentially download

01:04:14.869 --> 01:04:15.869
whatever's needed for that particular device.
And so there are ways for you to

01:04:15.869 --> 01:04:16.869
do late binding and have the customer information
come in later in the device,

01:04:16.869 --> 01:04:17.869
not as part of the initial download. That's
probably the best way for you to

01:04:17.869 --> 01:04:18.869
have more flexibility in how you build your
application.

01:04:18.869 --> 01:04:19.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. Thank you.

01:04:19.869 --> 01:04:20.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Hi. My question would be
about sun cells. Accelerometers and

01:04:20.869 --> 01:04:21.869
Compass has turned out no on Android but what
about new type of sensors? So

01:04:21.869 --> 01:04:22.869
what I understood is that it's up to the OEM,
you know, to choose if they want a

01:04:22.869 --> 01:04:23.869
new sensor or not and all those kinds of things
and the question would be, how

01:04:23.869 --> 01:04:24.869
that made available to the developers? Because
each OEM will choose different

01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:25.869
dates to have a new type or not and that means
you won't be turned out across

01:04:25.869 --> 01:04:26.869
other platforms. So OEM will make API the
development and how development can

01:04:26.869 --> 01:04:27.869
be sure that it will be the same depending
 -- you know, it won't be dependent on

01:04:27.869 --> 01:04:28.869
the platforms they use?

01:04:28.869 --> 01:04:29.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Actually, let me try to field this
one. Umm, a good example is

01:04:29.869 --> 01:04:30.869
front-facing camera. That in itself is a sensor
and we've had a couple of

01:04:30.869 --> 01:04:31.869
phones to come out have front-facing camera
and what we actually did is we let

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:32.869
you work with the OEMs who, uh, actually come
with the products and my

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:33.869
suggestion is how to structured API and is
what that does at least from an

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:34.869
instruction syntax perspective is somewhat
similar across different devices.

01:04:34.869 --> 01:04:35.869
What that does also is puts it on our radar
so that way when we come out with

01:04:35.869 --> 01:04:36.869
the next release of the OS, the way we're
gonna structure API will be roughly

01:04:36.869 --> 01:04:37.869
the same -- the same way so that when you
want a migrate application to support,

01:04:37.869 --> 01:04:38.869
let's say, the front-facing camera API in
the future we have that, that it will

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:39.869
be a very simple migration. And -- and the
challenge has always been, right, if

01:04:39.869 --> 01:04:40.869
we wanna get a platform out there that work
across all devices, at the same time

01:04:40.869 --> 01:04:41.869
leave it open for innovations we have to make
a possible innovations. And then

01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:42.869
it's, you know, us working closely to make
sure that when these innovations come

01:04:42.869 --> 01:04:43.869
out, especially on our side with we see multiple
OEMs and, you know, we talk to

01:04:43.869 --> 01:04:44.869
them all the time and say, you know, this
is what's coming out of the pot and we

01:04:44.869 --> 01:04:45.869
see a similar trend from multiple major manufacturers
then obviously we're going

01:04:45.869 --> 01:04:46.869
to accelerate the development schedule to
support that, too.

01:04:46.869 --> 01:04:47.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: So it means it's basically
driven from Google. So let's take an

01:04:47.869 --> 01:04:48.869
example. Let's take Gyroscope for example.
People wants to integrate their

01:04:48.869 --> 01:04:49.869
Gyroscopes that means that OEM are come to
you and say I'm planning to do that,

01:04:49.869 --> 01:04:50.869
can you propose an API and then the OEM will
most likely use it, or --

01:04:50.869 --> 01:04:51.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: I wouldn't go as far as to say they
come to us and say, can you propose

01:04:51.869 --> 01:04:52.869
an API. The key thing about Open Platform
is that this gives everybody the

01:04:52.869 --> 01:04:53.869
ability to innovate. What we try to do is
base on information that we get, to

01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:54.869
try to see some trend; right? It doesn't make
sense for us to make an API for a

01:04:54.869 --> 01:04:55.869
new sensor and require on all Android devices
when only one manufacturer wants

01:04:55.869 --> 01:04:56.869
to do it. But with we see that multiple manufacturer
wants to do this, then

01:04:56.869 --> 01:04:57.869
that gives us a good indication that this
is what's coming out of the pipe, we

01:04:57.869 --> 01:04:58.869
beat the price point is now low enough that
it makes sense to integrate these

01:04:58.869 --> 01:04:59.869
type of sensors. So it's the collaboration
of partnership at the same time

01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:00.869
making sure that the core of the platform's
compatible across all devices while

01:05:00.869 --> 01:05:01.869
giving OEMs and carriers the ability to innovate.

01:05:01.869 --> 01:05:02.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Okay. And second question
more like a dream, actually. Would it be

01:05:02.869 --> 01:05:03.869
possible to have a peek upon what kind of
sensor are coming up and what's the

01:05:03.869 --> 01:05:04.869
new things like the second camera which is
in some products but maybe next

01:05:04.869 --> 01:05:05.869
generation? I mean, I will understand if you
say no, I don't want to disclose

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:06.869
that, but if you have anything.

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:07.869
[pause]

01:05:07.869 --> 01:05:08.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. I guess you cannot comment--

01:05:08.869 --> 01:05:09.869
[laughter]

01:05:09.869 --> 01:05:10.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. Let me, uh, take a question
from the Wave. Umm, I think the gist

01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:11.869
of this is, what about Flash? Any plan for
Flash supporting your products?

01:05:11.869 --> 01:05:12.869
Anybody able to comment on that?

01:05:12.869 --> 01:05:13.869
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: I'd like to say that, umm, Samsung
has worked closely with Adobe and

01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:14.869
other products to support Flash and so, umm,
I think this will be an opportunity

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:15.869
for us to do so again in the future.

01:05:15.869 --> 01:05:16.869
[pause]

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:17.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: So similarly, umm, you know, uh, Flash
is an important, uh, content type

01:05:17.869 --> 01:05:18.869
in many of the markets where we're very strong
so we're definitely gonna be

01:05:18.869 --> 01:05:19.869
there when the time is right.

01:05:19.869 --> 01:05:20.869
[pause]

01:05:20.869 --> 01:05:21.869
&gt;&gt;Joon: I think LG has same position. We are
working with Adobe as well.

01:05:21.869 --> 01:05:22.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: Uh, we committed earlier this year
to bringing Flash to Droid when it was

01:05:22.869 --> 01:05:23.869
ready for production. Umm, and so as Froyo
is getting pushed out to Droid, as

01:05:23.869 --> 01:05:24.869
the Flash 10.1 moves out of beta and into
production you'll see that coming to

01:05:24.869 --> 01:05:25.869
Droid. As far as some of our other handsets,
you know, watch for upcoming

01:05:25.869 --> 01:05:26.869
details.

01:05:26.869 --> 01:05:27.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Great. Person on the right.

01:05:27.869 --> 01:05:28.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Umm, I work for a carrier
and as we talk to the various manufacturers

01:05:28.869 --> 01:05:29.869
up there we see that there's sort of this
imaginary dividing line where there's

01:05:29.869 --> 01:05:30.869
Google's commonality and everything is the
same up to a certain point and then after

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:31.869
that, a bunch of things get different. For
example, at the tethered updates

01:05:31.869 --> 01:05:32.869
versus over-the-air updates, versus all these
other different ways. Or

01:05:32.869 --> 01:05:33.869
application pre-loading process for carriers
is different across all of them.

01:05:33.869 --> 01:05:34.869
Or like the other gentleman was saying, bookmarking
and stuff like that. Is

01:05:34.869 --> 01:05:35.869
there any thought by Google or the OEMs to
get together and say, let's make some

01:05:35.869 --> 01:05:36.869
standardization a little bit further on down
so that, you know, update processes

01:05:36.869 --> 01:05:37.869
are common across all the manufacturers? Umm,
carrier pre-loads are common

01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:38.869
across all the manufacturers, things like
that, so there's more

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:39.869
commonality to it? Thank you.

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:40.869
[pause]

01:05:40.869 --> 01:05:41.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: One of the -- one of the variables
in those factors you just mentioned

01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:42.869
are our carrier customers and how they wanna
do things. So some of our -- our

01:05:42.869 --> 01:05:43.869
approaches are in fact driven by that and
whether it makes sense, you know, the

01:05:43.869 --> 01:05:44.869
other way to look at it is I guess there could
be one common approach that most

01:05:44.869 --> 01:05:45.869
of the network operators take with respect
to some of these things and maybe you

01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:46.869
guys should get together.

01:05:46.869 --> 01:05:47.869
[laughter]

01:05:47.869 --> 01:05:48.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: But, umm, I totally see your -- your
 -- you know, in general, like I said

01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:49.869
earlier, technology's a conversation and the
conversation about commonality is

01:05:49.869 --> 01:05:50.869
always going on with Google and even between
some of us I'm sure.

01:05:50.869 --> 01:05:51.869
[pause]

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:52.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay.

01:05:52.869 --> 01:05:53.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Uh, Android is an amazing
Open Source operating system. How soon

01:05:53.869 --> 01:05:54.869
'til we get an Open Source mobile phone?

01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:55.869
[applause]

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:56.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: There are 13 Open Source
hardware companies out there that have

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:57.869
revenues totaling over 50 million they are
on an upward trajectory.

01:05:57.869 --> 01:05:58.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: So I think if you look at a mobile
phone from any one of the four of us

01:05:58.869 --> 01:05:59.869
you'll find that it's made up of a number
of components. Some of it is Open

01:05:59.869 --> 01:06:00.869
Source IP, some of it is our own IP, and some
of it is IP we license from many,

01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:01.869
many different partners that are -- that we
embed into the handset whether it's,

01:06:01.869 --> 01:06:02.869
umm, you know, chipset, something to accelerate
something on the chipset,

01:06:02.869 --> 01:06:03.869
whether it's a multimedia codec, and it's
more than just us that would have to

01:06:03.869 --> 01:06:04.869
come together to Open Source an entire mobile
phone. There are -- it's much

01:06:04.869 --> 01:06:05.869
more than us and, you know, it's a lot of
people's IP-ing. So I think as time

01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:06.869
goes on, more and more things start to become
Open Source and maybe someday we

01:06:06.869 --> 01:06:07.869
get there but it's not something that's gonna
happen probably in the next year

01:06:07.869 --> 01:06:08.869
or two.

01:06:08.869 --> 01:06:09.869
[laughter]

01:06:09.869 --> 01:06:10.869
&gt;&gt;Ciaran: I agree.

01:06:10.869 --> 01:06:11.869
[laughter]

01:06:11.869 --> 01:06:12.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. I think we have time for maybe
a couple more questions. Uh, I

01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:13.869
wanna take one.

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:14.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Uh, when I first came to
Android I was attracted by the Open Source

01:06:14.869 --> 01:06:15.869
and being able to customize my phone how I
wanted to and that's why drives me to

01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:16.869
be, you know, a root user and to be able to
modern my phone. As such, I made

01:06:16.869 --> 01:06:17.869
applications to allow users to theme their
phones and I find it frustrating

01:06:17.869 --> 01:06:18.869
that, you know, non-root users don't have
the ability to theme their phones or

01:06:18.869 --> 01:06:19.869
customize their phones to specific tastes,
maybe to a football theme or a sport

01:06:19.869 --> 01:06:20.869
theme. Do y'all have any thoughts on providing
theme support? I mean, it's as

01:06:20.869 --> 01:06:21.869
simple as using a content provider. A lot
of y'all build desktop replacements

01:06:21.869 --> 01:06:22.869
like HTP does with their sense. Do y'all have
any comments? Google and the

01:06:22.869 --> 01:06:23.869
carriers.

01:06:23.869 --> 01:06:24.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: So specific question is theme support?

01:06:24.869 --> 01:06:25.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Right.

01:06:25.869 --> 01:06:26.869
&gt;&gt;Joon: We do certainly have a widget-based
approach so user can personalize

01:06:26.869 --> 01:06:27.869
their, uh, you know, theme and the home menu
and other -- other places.

01:06:27.869 --> 01:06:28.869
[pause]

01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:29.869
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah. I mean, themes have actually
 -- I think Sony Ericsson invented

01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:30.869
themes on phones and we've, you know, been
 -- it's been a -- it's been a really,

01:06:30.869 --> 01:06:31.869
really important way for us -- for our products
to be sold and they're

01:06:31.869 --> 01:06:32.869
actually -- there's a business in personalization
and themes. So, you know,

01:06:32.869 --> 01:06:33.869
within the, you know, uh, constraints and
possibilities of Android, we're very

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:34.869
interested in personalization and we're gonna
be adding more capabilities in the

01:06:34.869 --> 01:06:35.869
future. So I think it's one of the thing that
is people wanna do with their

01:06:35.869 --> 01:06:36.869
mobile devices is self-expression.

01:06:36.869 --> 01:06:37.869
&gt;&gt;Joon: If I can say just one more thing.
Not one more thing. I mean as I

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:38.869
mentioned earlier, we do have a developer
web site to, you know, respecting all

01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:39.869
the greatest comment from everywhere. So just
join us and, uh, send us

01:06:39.869 --> 01:06:40.869
constructive suggest, idea, or criticize ideas,
to, so we can be all learn and

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:41.869
improving the Android platform and the delivery
created innovative service and

01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:42.869
product and quality to the consumer worldwide.
So, you know, go to the -- our

01:06:42.869 --> 01:06:43.869
developer.lgmobile.com and, uh, feel free
to write up any suggestion you might

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:44.869
have.

01:06:44.869 --> 01:06:45.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay. One more question and probably
can only have one person answer

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:46.869
this since, uh, we're 30 seconds left.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:47.869
[laughter]

01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:48.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: I had a question about
the keyboard. A couple of you mentioned how

01:06:48.869 --> 01:06:49.869
great your new keyboards were. Uh, my first
phone was the G1 and personally I

01:06:49.869 --> 01:06:50.869
think it's the best keyboard that's ever been
on a phone. I think a lot of

01:06:50.869 --> 01:06:51.869
other people think the same way. What's taken
so long to come out with this new

01:06:51.869 --> 01:06:52.869
greatest keyboard or, you know, a keyboard
without a space bar between the V and

01:06:52.869 --> 01:06:53.869
B, or, you know, keys that aren't mashed together?
Uh, we had such a great

01:06:53.869 --> 01:06:54.869
example of what a wonderful keyboard should
look like. Why haven't we got --

01:06:54.869 --> 01:06:55.869
why hasn't anybody been able to duplicate
that or even come close really?

01:06:55.869 --> 01:06:56.869
[pause]

01:06:56.869 --> 01:06:57.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: Keyboards are very, very subjective.
Like I said earlier, I've talked to

01:06:57.869 --> 01:06:58.869
many people here at this show and they walk
up and everyone likes a different

01:06:58.869 --> 01:06:59.869
phone, everyone likes a different keyboard.
Umm, and again I think it comes

01:06:59.869 --> 01:07:00.869
back to where -- who is the target customer
for this phone? Is it a teen, which

01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:01.869
is gonna have a lot tinier fingers than someone
in their 30s. Umm, what's the

01:07:01.869 --> 01:07:02.869
target demographic? What does the carrier
wanna see? Every phone goes through

01:07:02.869 --> 01:07:03.869
a lot of user trials before it ever comes
back and even once it's in production,

01:07:03.869 --> 01:07:04.869
feedback comes back and that's incorporated
into future designs. So, you know,

01:07:04.869 --> 01:07:05.869
while you may think the G1 keyboard's the
greatest keyboard in the world,

01:07:05.869 --> 01:07:06.869
someone else is gonna think, you know, having
a phone with no keyboard's the

01:07:06.869 --> 01:07:07.869
greatest experience and that's --

01:07:07.869 --> 01:07:08.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: I can understand that.

01:07:08.869 --> 01:07:09.869
&gt;&gt;Lori: And so it's really up to the target
 -- the target market, umm, and where

01:07:09.869 --> 01:07:10.869
that phone is going.

01:07:10.869 --> 01:07:11.869
&gt;&gt;Joon: I just waned to suggest to you to
drop by LG's, you know, sandbox. I

01:07:11.869 --> 01:07:12.869
mean, really, seriously.

01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:13.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: I will. I wanna see it.

01:07:13.869 --> 01:07:14.869
&gt;&gt;Joon: I mean, this is the -- in the old
configuration you may not notice but

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:15.869
this key's not equal -- it has H key has a
different variation of height and

01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:16.869
space between each keys to make sure that
we deliver the best keyboard

01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:17.869
experience. We work really hard with Google
for this particular keyboard

01:07:17.869 --> 01:07:18.869
setting, and the layout, and even all different,
you know, key set.

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:19.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Okay. Thank you.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:20.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: Great. Well, thank you. I think we're
on borrowed time now so I wanted

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:21.869
to thank all of you being on the panel.

01:07:21.869 --> 01:07:22.869
[Applause]

01:07:22.869 --> 01:07:23.869
&gt;&gt;Eric: And even more questions, umm, all
these folks are -- we have five

01:07:23.869 --> 01:07:24.869
stations out there from different device manufacturers
so you can go there and

01:07:24.869 --> 01:07:24.878
ask -- ask away many more questions. Okay.
Thank you.
