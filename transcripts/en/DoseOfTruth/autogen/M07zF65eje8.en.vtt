Young was so radical a thinker it's just

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
Young was so radical a thinker it's just
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.740
Young was so radical a thinker it's just
beyond belief like I've read a lot of

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750
beyond belief like I've read a lot of
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.869
beyond belief like I've read a lot of
critics of you and I've always I've

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879
critics of you and I've always I've
 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.190
critics of you and I've always I've
always got a kick out of them because

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
always got a kick out of them because
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.440
always got a kick out of them because
the things they accuse young of are so

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
the things they accuse young of are so
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.120
the things they accuse young of are so
trivial compared to the things that

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
trivial compared to the things that
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.919
trivial compared to the things that
young actually did that it's like

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
young actually did that it's like
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.490
young actually did that it's like
accusing a a murderer of jaywalking like

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
accusing a a murderer of jaywalking like
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040
accusing a a murderer of jaywalking like
because Young was unbelievably radical

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
because Young was unbelievably radical
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.080
because Young was unbelievably radical
like here's one of his ideas you know he

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
like here's one of his ideas you know he
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269
like here's one of his ideas you know he
thought that it was necessary he

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
thought that it was necessary he
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429
thought that it was necessary he
believed that psychotherapy could be

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
believed that psychotherapy could be
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620
believed that psychotherapy could be
replaced by a supreme moral effort and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
replaced by a supreme moral effort and
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509
replaced by a supreme moral effort and
so the moral effort would be something

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
so the moral effort would be something
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640
so the moral effort would be something
like aiming at the good and then trying

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
like aiming at the good and then trying
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410
like aiming at the good and then trying
to integrate yourself around that and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
to integrate yourself around that and
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.819
to integrate yourself around that and
that the the good at which you aimed

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
that the the good at which you aimed
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280
that the the good at which you aimed
would be something approximating what

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
would be something approximating what
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560
would be something approximating what
you would be like if you manifested your

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
you would be like if you manifested your
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600
you would be like if you manifested your
full potential and that you have a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
full potential and that you have a
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180
full potential and that you have a
glimmering of what that full potential

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
glimmering of what that full potential
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.410
glimmering of what that full potential
was so that would be the potential

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
was so that would be the potential
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690
was so that would be the potential
future you and he thought of that he

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
future you and he thought of that he
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700
future you and he thought of that he
thought of people as four dimensional

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
thought of people as four dimensional
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.319
thought of people as four dimensional
entities especially essentially that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
entities especially essentially that
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.229
entities especially essentially that
were stretched across time and that you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
were stretched across time and that you
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.599
were stretched across time and that you
as a totality across time including your

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
as a totality across time including your
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360
as a totality across time including your
potential manifested yourself also in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
potential manifested yourself also in
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670
potential manifested yourself also in
the here and now and that part of what

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
the here and now and that part of what
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070
the here and now and that part of what
your potential manifested itself was

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
your potential manifested itself was
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690
your potential manifested itself was
something like the voice of conscious

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
something like the voice of conscious
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580
something like the voice of conscious
conscience or intuition

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
conscience or intuition
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980
conscience or intuition
it's amazing idea it's an amazing idea

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
it's amazing idea it's an amazing idea
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719
it's amazing idea it's an amazing idea
right because it's like what you could

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
right because it's like what you could
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.520
right because it's like what you could
be in the future beckons to you in the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
be in the future beckons to you in the
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740
be in the future beckons to you in the
present and helps you determine the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
present and helps you determine the
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.149
present and helps you determine the
difference between good and evil

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
difference between good and evil
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.760
difference between good and evil
it's a mind-boggling idea and you know I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
it's a mind-boggling idea and you know I
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.490
it's a mind-boggling idea and you know I
think that it's an idea you have to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
think that it's an idea you have to
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130
think that it's an idea you have to
contend with and then he went further

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
contend with and then he went further
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.030
contend with and then he went further
than that and this is this is also a

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040
than that and this is this is also a
 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.859
than that and this is this is also a
remarkable idea you know he was

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
remarkable idea you know he was
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.030
remarkable idea you know he was
interested in this symbolic

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
interested in this symbolic
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490
interested in this symbolic
representation of Christ and I mean

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
representation of Christ and I mean
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.109
representation of Christ and I mean
psychologically speaking and he thought

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
psychologically speaking and he thought
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.170
psychologically speaking and he thought
of Christ as the representation of the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
of Christ as the representation of the
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.620
of Christ as the representation of the
ideal potential human it's something

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
ideal potential human it's something
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.830
ideal potential human it's something
like that so it was a symbolic rip thats

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
like that so it was a symbolic rip thats
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.389
like that so it was a symbolic rip thats
what Christ was is a symbolic

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
what Christ was is a symbolic
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429
what Christ was is a symbolic
representation of the ideal potential of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
representation of the ideal potential of
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380
representation of the ideal potential of
a human being and so for young there was

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
a human being and so for young there was
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719
a human being and so for young there was
no difference between there was no

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
no difference between there was no
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910
no difference between there was no
psychological difference between who you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
psychological difference between who you
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.429
psychological difference between who you
could be in the future beckoning to you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
could be in the future beckoning to you
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.429
could be in the future beckoning to you
and the prey in the present and

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439
and the prey in the present and
 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.539
and the prey in the present and
orienting yourself in relationship to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
orienting yourself in relationship to
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.219
orienting yourself in relationship to
Christ

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229
Christ
 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.119
Christ
psychologically those were the same

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
psychologically those were the same
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.510
psychologically those were the same
thing and then so that's a pretty

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
thing and then so that's a pretty
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.430
thing and then so that's a pretty
mind-boggling idea like Siri

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
mind-boggling idea like Siri
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.470
mind-boggling idea like Siri
that's a mind-boggling idea you know

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
that's a mind-boggling idea you know
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.420
that's a mind-boggling idea you know
especially when you add the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
especially when you add the
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.850
especially when you add the
psychological idea that the one of the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
psychological idea that the one of the
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.560
psychological idea that the one of the
things that characterizes your ideal

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
things that characterizes your ideal
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.240
things that characterizes your ideal
future self is the ability to make

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
future self is the ability to make
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370
future self is the ability to make
sacrifices right and the deeper the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
sacrifices right and the deeper the
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.350
sacrifices right and the deeper the
sacrifice the better and then also to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
sacrifice the better and then also to
 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.540
sacrifice the better and then also to
recover from the sacrifice right so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
recover from the sacrifice right so
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.580
recover from the sacrifice right so
that's the death and rebirth so the part

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
that's the death and rebirth so the part
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800
that's the death and rebirth so the part
of you that's most essential to your

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
of you that's most essential to your
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.490
of you that's most essential to your
full flowering as a as a being is your

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
full flowering as a as a being is your
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.430
full flowering as a as a being is your
ability to let things go and then spring

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
ability to let things go and then spring
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560
ability to let things go and then spring
back from that so to die in some sense

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570
back from that so to die in some sense
 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.720
back from that so to die in some sense
and to be reborn in the service of a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
and to be reborn in the service of a
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.780
and to be reborn in the service of a
higher good and then well then the next

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790
higher good and then well then the next
 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.510
higher good and then well then the next
part of that is that the direction of

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520
part of that is that the direction of
 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.480
part of that is that the direction of
the world depends on you doing that so

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490
the world depends on you doing that so
 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.190
the world depends on you doing that so
not only your own life but your family's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
not only your own life but your family's
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.320
not only your own life but your family's
life and and because we're networked so

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330
life and and because we're networked so
 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.600
life and and because we're networked so
intently together you know that the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
intently together you know that the
 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.180
intently together you know that the
whole panoply of human kind and maybe

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
whole panoply of human kind and maybe
 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.820
whole panoply of human kind and maybe
the structure of the of the cosmos and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
the structure of the of the cosmos and
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.190
the structure of the of the cosmos and
you know you might think well no but you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
you know you might think well no but you
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.590
you know you might think well no but you
know it's not so simple it's not so

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
know it's not so simple it's not so
 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.810
know it's not so simple it's not so
simple
