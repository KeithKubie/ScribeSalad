00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:02.924
- [Voiceover] We've been
discussing the American Civil War,

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.757
which lasted from 1861 until 1865.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:11.396
It was the deadliest conflict
in all of American history,

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:15.063
in which 620,000 Americans
lost their lives.

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.440
We briefly went over
the very end of the war,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.602
as Grant caught up to Lee at Appomattox.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:28.802
And Lee surrendered, and
then confederate sympathizer

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:32.265
and sometimes spy, John
Wilkes Booth assassinated

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.460
American President Abraham Lincoln.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.046
Lincoln was followed in
office by Andrew Johnson,

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:40.239
who will preside over reconstruction.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.274
But now that we've talked
about the progress of war,

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:47.909
from the first fighting at
Fort Sumter in April of 1861,

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.492
to the last surrenders
in November of 1865,

00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:55.345
I'd like to take just a
few minutes to contemplate

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:58.299
what some of the bigger
issues that the Civil War

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.965
raises are in American History.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.507
And what impact will it have on the future

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:04.924
of American life?

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:09.743
Well certainly one of the
most important things,

00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:12.681
if not the most important thing
to come out of the Civil War

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.514
is the end of slavery.

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.487
You know, before the Civil
War, before the 1850s,

00:01:20.487 --> 00:01:23.620
your average White
American, who lived in say

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.703
Pennsylvania or Kentucky,

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.920
probably wasn't very fond

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:34.087
of slavery, but probably
wouldn't have gone

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:37.745
out of his or her way to
take a stand against it.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.644
I think Lincoln himself
was very representative

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:43.678
of this view, in that, he hated slavery,

00:01:43.678 --> 00:01:47.076
but he thought that he had
no right to interfere with it

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.481
and he mostly just
wanted to make sure that

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:53.066
slave owners couldn't bring
enslaved people out west

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.866
to take lands from, what
he saw as hardworking,

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.252
deserving, poorer Whites.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:03.128
By the end of the Civil
War, no one could argue

00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:05.801
that African Americans,
especially in the north

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:08.134
did not deserve citizenship.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.333
Throughout the Civil
War, African Americans

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:17.500
proved their important to the
nation, time and time again.

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:21.139
Especially through their
military service in units

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.996
like the 54th Massachusetts for example.

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:28.163
And so, for the approximately
four and a half million

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:32.708
enslaved people who lived in the south,

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:36.098
they now had their freedom.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:41.438
And the story of what
happens to these people

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:44.598
who have been freed from bondage,

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.366
is perhaps the most interesting,

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.632
and important story of American history.

00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:53.898
Does all men are created equal mean

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:56.873
all men and women are created equal?

00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:00.272
That is the question that
will occupy the nation

00:03:00.272 --> 00:03:04.043
in one way or another, up
until the present, really.

00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:07.792
Another major important
takeaway from the Civil War

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:11.388
is that that Civil War
represented a movement

00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:12.776
in the United States,

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.609
from a union of states

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:20.975
to a nation.

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.285
And you can even see how
Abraham Lincoln's thinking

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:28.292
on this changes over
the course of the war.

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:31.555
He starts to even use the word nation

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:32.924
more and more.

00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:35.489
Throughout the early part of the history

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.050
of the United States, you
see this balance of power

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.625
between states and between
the Federal Government

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:45.361
really shifting all of the time.

00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:48.916
You see things like the
nullification crisis in the 1830s

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.933
when South Carolina said
we don't like this tariff.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:55.293
We think that as a state,
the union is composed

00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:58.059
out of the consent of
the individual states,

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.248
and therefore the state
has the right to nullify

00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:02.843
a law it doesn't agree with.

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:07.154
The same sort of situation
happened in 1860 over slavery.

00:04:07.154 --> 00:04:09.463
The southern states
believed that Lincoln would

00:04:09.463 --> 00:04:12.418
outlaw slavery, and thought
that it would be more

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.707
important to secede as a group of states

00:04:15.707 --> 00:04:18.456
protecting in their words,
their states rights,

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:21.240
then to be subject to
the laws of the nation.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.990
Well the Civil War ends
that kind of thinking.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.610
In fact you even see it from
how people write the name

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.799
of this country.

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:32.896
Frequently it might have been
said before the Civil War

00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:34.563
these United States.

00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:41.755
It's a group of states that are united.

00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:45.922
After the Civil War, it
becomes the United States.

00:04:46.773 --> 00:04:48.773
One nation, indivisible.

00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:54.966
And so this is the moment
when the Federal Government

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.799
really begins to grow.

00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:02.893
You know during war time,
the north had to really

00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:06.310
organize as a nation to provide resources

00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:09.994
for their populace and for the soldiers

00:05:09.994 --> 00:05:13.553
and so the President gained powers that

00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:17.242
he had never had before,
and the Federal bureaucracy

00:05:17.242 --> 00:05:19.325
itself grew a great deal.

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:23.961
And you're going to see this
throughout the 20th century,

00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:28.021
really up until the 1970s
that the Federal Government

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:32.188
in the United States is going
to have more and more power.

00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:40.591
A third important takeaway
from the Civil War

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:44.758
is that during the Civil
War the north industrialized

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:48.191
to produce all of the goods

00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.024
and material that the
north needed to succeed.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.709
They built factories, and railroads

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:00.193
and those factories and railroads,

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.933
and all the rest of the
impressive engineering

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:05.981
that went into winning the war

00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:09.314
is then going to be turned toward making

00:06:10.513 --> 00:06:12.346
an industrial behemoth

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:16.096
in the post war era.

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:20.720
So, a lot of things that
started during the Civil War

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.200
in terms of national
industrialization really carry

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.031
on in the post war era,
known as the Gilded Age.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.225
That help the United
States become the worlds

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:35.137
premiere industrial
power, and later, based

00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:37.198
on that industrial
power, one of the worlds

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.328
premiere political powers.

00:06:39.328 --> 00:06:42.938
Another thing that is
not often talked about

00:06:42.938 --> 00:06:46.855
with the Civil War is
the growing role of women

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.332
in the United States polity.

00:06:50.332 --> 00:06:53.165
Ya know in the American Civil War,

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:59.249
at first it was very taboo
for a woman of good birth

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:01.386
to go and become a nurse.

00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:03.736
But as the war progressed, that kind of

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:06.810
Victorian thinking, believing
that a woman belonged

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.916
only to a very feminine and
domestic sphere of life,

00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:12.520
really had to fade away

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.065
in the face of the
reality that women needed

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:17.803
to play a role in the war.

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.553
In the north women became nurses.

00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:25.628
They helped to chair the
American Sanitary Commission,

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:27.916
which was one of the key hospital groups

00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:29.606
of the time period.

00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:33.330
And in the south, many
women also really took over

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.268
the running of family farms

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.185
as White men went away,

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:44.190
White women, poorer
White women for example

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.637
would be in charge of a farm themselves.

00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:49.894
A White woman who belonged
to a slave owning family

00:07:49.894 --> 00:07:52.787
herself, would then have
charge of enslaved people.

00:07:52.787 --> 00:07:55.338
So women took a much
more leading role during

00:07:55.338 --> 00:07:56.652
the Civil War.

00:07:56.652 --> 00:07:59.653
After the Civil War,
some of that falls away.

00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:02.102
In fact, there's a really difficult moment

00:08:02.102 --> 00:08:05.104
in the movement for women's rights when

00:08:05.104 --> 00:08:09.271
in 1870, the 15th amendment
granted African American

00:08:10.184 --> 00:08:13.267
men the right to vote, but not women.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.086
And so the women's movement
will take some time

00:08:18.086 --> 00:08:20.482
to regroup in the late 19th century.

00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:22.916
But the Civil War, like many later wars,

00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:24.520
brought women outside the home.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.750
And after the war they were
not anxious to go back there.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.515
They became involved in many
charitable organizations,

00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:34.095
often known as social housekeeping.

00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:38.262
As women do more and more
things outside the home.

00:08:41.657 --> 00:08:44.965
Which will eventually grow
into the women's movement

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:47.437
of the early 20th
century, and lead to women

00:08:47.437 --> 00:08:48.709
getting the right to vote.

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:52.159
This is just a small
sampling of some of the

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:56.360
major impacts that the Civil
War had on the United States.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.861
Often when we think about
United States history,

00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.783
we think about it cutting
off at the Civil War.

00:09:02.783 --> 00:09:05.122
Most college courses
or high school courses

00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:08.407
are organized the US before the Civil War,

00:09:08.407 --> 00:09:10.422
and the US after the Civil War,

00:09:10.422 --> 00:09:12.551
because it's a really
defining moment in our

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:14.656
nations history for these reasons,

00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:16.157
and for many others.

00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:18.382
The United States entered the Civil War

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:22.049
a loose union of states
divided by territory

00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:27.169
and beliefs, and exited the
Civil War a single nation.

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:32.003
Modern, industrial, peopled
by an incredibly diverse

00:09:32.003 --> 00:09:35.957
range of citizens from all over the world.

00:09:35.957 --> 00:09:37.898
In other words, after the Civil War,

00:09:37.898 --> 00:09:40.625
the United States will
really come into its own.

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.902
And that's because the Civil
War was the moment when

00:09:42.902 --> 00:09:44.722
the United States grew up.

00:09:44.722 --> 00:09:48.869
The United States in 1870,
looked a lot more like

00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:53.014
the year 1900, then it did the year 1860.

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:57.131
The 13th amendment, and later
the 14th and 15th amendments

00:09:57.131 --> 00:10:00.388
ruled that people of African
descent were citizens

00:10:00.388 --> 00:10:01.901
of the United States.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.970
Remember, beforehand,
enslaved people in the south

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.295
counted for only 3/5ths of a person,

00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:09.442
and that person couldn't vote,

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:13.018
move freely, or own his or her own labor,

00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:14.711
not to mention their own life.

00:10:14.711 --> 00:10:17.860
The Civil War decided
once and for all that

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.964
everyone born in the United States

00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:21.885
was a United States citizen.

00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:25.844
But what citizenship really
meant for African Americans,

00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:29.305
for women, for Native
Americans and immigrants,

00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:30.739
even for Whites.

00:10:30.739 --> 00:10:32.940
Was still something that
would be hammered out

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.182
through the rest of the
19th century and the 20th.

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:39.778
After the Civil War, the
old problems of sectional

00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:42.775
tension and states
rights, were put to rest,

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.810
but they were replaced by new problems.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.142
Problems of modern America.

00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.323
Industrialization, poverty, immigration,
