00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
GPS provides us with very accurate velocities, which is nice, but on the other hand,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we want to be able to use our system in the tunnel too.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Using a camera with motion analysis is really high tech.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's hard to get results that are really reliable in 99% of the cases.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For experiments, you may actually use a fifth wheel,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but in real life this would of course be awkward and costly.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I would say the accelerometer is the way to go. It's just a tiny chip to be added to the electronics.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
One issue about the accelerometer is that it does not output the velocity, it outputs acceleration.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Hopefully, you have a good estimate of the velocity before we start braking and then we can use

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the acceleration to estimate the evolutional velocity.
