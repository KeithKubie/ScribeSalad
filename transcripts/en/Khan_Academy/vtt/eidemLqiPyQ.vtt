00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:04.584
- [Instructor] Let's get some practice

00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:06.423
rewriting definite integrals

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.882
as the limit of a Riemann sum.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:10.954
So let's say I wanted to
take the definite integral

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:14.204
from pi to two pi of cosine of x dx.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:19.786
And I what I wanna do is I wanna write it

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:24.533
as the limit as n approaches
infinity of a Riemann sum.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.037
So it's gonna take the form of the limit

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:30.230
as n approaches infinity, and we can have

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.435
our Sigma notation right over here,

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:35.102
and I would say from, let's say

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:39.755
i is equal to one all the way to n.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:41.071
Let me scroll down a little bit

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.233
so it doesn't get all
squashed up at the top.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.989
Of, and so let's me draw
what's actually going on

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.488
so that we can get a better sense

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:51.136
of what to write here
within the Sigma notation.

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.969
So let me do it large.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.229
So if this is pi right over here,

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.724
this would be three pi over two

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:07.827
and this would be two pi
right over here, two pi.

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:13.570
Now what does the graph of cosine of x do?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.670
Well, at pi cosine of pi is negative one.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.141
So that's negative one there.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:20.474
And cosine of two pi is one.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.575
And so the graph is gonna
do something like this,

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.743
and this is obviously just
a hand-drawn version of it,

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:29.689
but you have seen cosine functions before,

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.420
this is just part of it.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.379
And so this definite integral represents

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.546
the area from pi to two pi

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:40.251
between the curve and the x axis.

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.301
And you might already know
that this area is going to be,

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:45.800
or this part of the definite
integral'd be negative

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.991
and this would be positive,
and it will cancel out

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:51.663
and this would all actually
end up being zero in this case.

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:55.853
But this exercise for this
video is to rewrite this

00:01:55.853 --> 00:02:00.408
as a limit as n approaches
infinity of a Riemann sum.

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:03.000
So there's a Riemann sum, what we wanna do

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730
is think about breaking this up

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.429
into a bunch of rectangles.

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.567
So let's say, or I
should say n rectangles.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.681
So that's our first one right over there,

00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:16.504
then this might be our second one,

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.420
and let's do right Riemann sum

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.728
where the right boundary of our rectangle,

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:24.012
what the value of the
function is at that point,

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:25.805
that's what defines the height.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:29.529
So that's our second one
all the way until this one

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.282
right over here is going
to be our n-th one.

00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:34.951
So this is one, let me write it this way.

00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:36.447
This is i is equal to one,

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:39.188
this is i is equal to two, all the way

00:02:39.188 --> 00:02:41.855
until we get to i is equal to n.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.792
And then if we take the limit
as n approaches infinity,

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:47.700
the sum of the areas of these rectangles

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.892
are gonna get better
and better and better.

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:52.141
And so let's first think
about it, what is the width

00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:55.286
of each of these rectangles going to be?

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:59.035
Well, I am taking this
interval from pi to two pi

00:02:59.035 --> 00:03:02.006
and I'm gonna divide it
into n equal intervals.

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:04.492
So the width of each of these,

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:06.767
the width of each of these is going to be

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.766
two pi minus pi, so I'm just taking

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:12.267
the difference between
my bounds of integration,

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:16.434
and I am dividing by n,
which is equal to pi over n.

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:19.845
So that's the width of each of these.

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:22.839
That's pi over n, this is
pi over n, this is pi of n.

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.447
And what's the height of
each of these rectangles?

00:03:26.447 --> 00:03:28.476
Remember this is a right Riemann sum.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:33.402
So it's going to be the
right end of our rectangle

00:03:33.402 --> 00:03:34.996
is going to define the height.

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:37.600
So this right over here,
what would this height be?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.722
Well, this height, this
value I should say,

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.972
this is going to be equal to f of what?

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.209
Well, this was pi and
this is going to be pi

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.917
plus the length of our
interval right over here,

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:54.613
the base of the rectangle.

00:03:54.613 --> 00:03:58.456
So we started at pi, so
it's gonna be pi plus,

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:02.623
this was going to be pi over
n, I could say times one.

00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:06.521
That's this height right over here.

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.273
What's this one going
to be right over here?

00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:12.440
Well, this one is going to be f of pi,

00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:17.010
our first start, plus
pi over n times what?

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.979
We're gonna have pi over n two times.

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.646
Pi over n times two.

00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:26.981
So the general form of the right boundary

00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.542
is going to be, so for
example, this height

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:32.853
right over here, this is going to be f of,

00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:34.686
we started at pi plus,

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:37.932
we're doing the right Riemann sum,

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:42.099
so we're gonna add pi over
n n times by this point.

00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:44.808
Pi over n times n.

00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:50.323
Or, if we wanted to say it generally,

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.242
if we're talking about the i-th rectangle,

00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:55.133
remember we sum them all
up, what's the height?

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:57.436
Well, the height is
going to be, in this case

00:04:57.436 --> 00:05:00.353
it's going to be cosine of pi plus,

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:07.337
if we're with the i-th rectangle,

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:10.846
we are going to add pi over n i times.

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:12.346
Pi over n times i.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.368
And then, that's the height
of each of our rectangles.

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:18.238
And then what's the width?

00:05:18.238 --> 00:05:20.028
Well, we already figured that out.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.361
Times pi over n.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.892
And if you wanna be careful and make sure

00:05:23.892 --> 00:05:26.217
that this Sigma notation
applies to the whole thing,

00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:27.441
there you have it.

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:29.936
We have just re-expressed
this definite integral

00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:32.936
as the limit of a right Riemann sum.
