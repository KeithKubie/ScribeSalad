00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.300
Scientists are hooking fish on opioids to
teach us how our brains get addicted to things.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.770
It sounds crazy, but it’s actually just
science.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.679
Over 100 Americans die from overdoses every
day.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.110
Two million Americans have some kind of opioid-related
addiction, and overdoses are now the leading

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.520
cause of death for Americans under 50.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.210
More people die in the U.S. of drug overdoses
than did from car crashes at their peak!

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.190
But an epidemic of opioids is so much more
difficult to fix than car crashes.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.330
Car crashes peaked in 1972.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.110
So, we created national speed limits, seat
belt requirements, drunk-driving laws…

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.750
Opioids are already controlled, and yet, we’re
still in trouble.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.610
And that’s because we just… don’t understand
addiction very well.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.070
So, to learn about our own brains, we’re
getting zebrafish addicted to drugs and it’s

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.070
teaching us a lot!

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.630
A new study hooked zebrafish on opioids using
behavioral training.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.899
Basically, when they swam over a detector
they got hydrocodone.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.100
After a while, they swam into shallower and
shallower water to get the same dose from

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.649
the detector; that’s risky drug-seeking
for a fish, a hallmark of addict behavior.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.070
This is exciting, because now they can put
the fish into withdrawal and test drugs and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.070
treatments on it.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.960
I know that seems weird, fish are friends,
not humans.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.890
But, we share 70 percent of our DNA with zebrafish,
and have engineered their brains to act more

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.570
like ours for studies.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.810
Suffice it to say, they’re good analogs
for humans.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.890
If we understand zebrafish addiction we can
hopefully translate treatment back to us.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.840
And that mission is in progress.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.150
One hooked zebrafish on morphine altering
over 254 genes.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.220
Another optimistically found several receptors
and five opioid-related genes “so far.”

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.530
Studies into the four opioid receptors in
the zebrafish brain found one of them is star

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.530
of the show.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770
Then a follow-up study dug into how it works!

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.890
Basically, we’re making progress with the
drug-addicted-fish method.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.080
There’s still tons to learn, but as we study
these tiny brains, we’re learning more about

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080
our own!

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.439
And someday this could help us find safe treatments.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.659
Hopefully, the zebrafish’s sacrifice won’t
be in vain but for now, we have to just keep

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.670
swimming.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.400
While some scientists are using fish to learn
more about addiction, there’s a group of

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.340
researchers developing a vaccine that could
cure addiction all together.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.170
We made a video about it, check it out here.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.830
What do you think about all this?
