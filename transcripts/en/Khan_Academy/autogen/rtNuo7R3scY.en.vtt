00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:01.269
 In this video I want 

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:03.267
 to gain some experience in simplifying expressions, 

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:04.948
 as we have some more complex numbers included here. 

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:07.189
 These numbers are somewhat complex. 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.047
 As always, try to pause this video 

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:10.719
 and see if you can simplify the phrase, 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.093
 before I try. 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.502
 Okay, I guess I tried it. 

00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:16.558
 Now let's look at it. 

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:23.745
 We have minus 5.55 minus 8.55c plus 4.35c. 

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.748
 The first thing I want to do is see if I can unite 

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:28.868
 those articles involving c. I definitely can. 

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:35.392
 We can first get 8.55c with 4.35c 

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:36.472
 and it will be, to see, 

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:41.708
 it will be minus 8.55 plus 4.35, 

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.250
 I just collect the odds, 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.386
 with and of course we still have 

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:48.894
 this minus 5.55 at the front. 

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.133
 Minus 5.55. 

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.164
 I'll just put a plus there. 

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:56.405
 But how can we calculate minus 8.55 

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.727
 plus 4.35? 

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:00.108
 There are several ways to look at it 

00:01:00.108 --> 00:01:01.293
 or visualize it. 

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.171
 One way is to say that this is the same thing 

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.851
 with the negative of 8.55 

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.951
 minus 4.35, 

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.027
 to see now, 

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:15.989
 8 minus 4, this will be 

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:18.508
 negative, 8 minus 4 is 4, 

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:20.505
 55 hundred minus 35 cent 

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:21.805
 is 20 cent. 

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:23.512
 I can write 4.20, 

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:26.310
 which is the same as 4.2. 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.840
 And all this can be replaced 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.326
 minus 4.2. 

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:33.147
 The whole expression was simplified 

00:01:33.147 --> 00:01:39.301
 to minus 5.55 and instead of saying plus minus 4.2s, 

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:46.289
 I can only write it as minus 4.2s 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.985
 and we are ready. 

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:48.391
 This can not be simplified anymore. 

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.410
 We can not add this article, which it does not contain 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.999
 the variable to that member that includes it. 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.482
 This is as simple as possible. 

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:58.671
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:03.489
 Here I have even more complex numbers. 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.532
 All of them are expressed as fractions. 

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:10.071
 Let's see, I have 2 / 5m minus 4/5, minus 3 / 5m. 

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.615
 How can I simplify? 

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.273
 I can put together all members containing m. 

00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:15.550
 Let's just change the order. 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.949
 I can write this again as 2 / 5m minus 3 / 5m, 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.237
 minus 4/5. 

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:24.373
 I just changed the order. 

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:26.846
 We can see that I have these two members with m. 

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.773
 I can put them together. 

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:33.626
 This will be 2/5 minus 3/5 

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:39.453
 m and then I got minus 4/5 

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:41.311
 on the right. 

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.352
 How much is 2/5 minus 3/5? 

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:46.930
 This will be 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.752
 minus 1/5. 

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:54.673
 I have minus 1 / 5m minus 4/5. 

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.088
 Minus 4/5. 

00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:57.831
 So much. 

00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:59.003
 I can not simplify it anymore. 

00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:01.824
 I can not collect this article, which includes m, somehow 

00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:04.088
 with this minus 4/5. 

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:06.850
 And here we are ready. 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.091
 Let's decide more 

00:03:09.091 --> 00:03:11.309
 one example. 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.992
 Now, and that's interesting, 

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:16.311
 I have braces and then everything else. 

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:17.647
 As always, pause the video 

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.103
 and see if you can simplify this. 

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:22.402
 All right, let's solve it together. 

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.702
 The first thing I want to do, 

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.606
 is to allocate this pair so that 

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.405
 to have only three members that are 

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:29.135
 collected or subtracted. 

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:31.098
 If we uncover braces, 

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:33.433
 we will get 2 1 / 5m 

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:36.312
 is 2 / 5m. 

00:03:36.312 --> 00:03:37.834
 Just make sure you see that m. 

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:38.763
 m is here. 

00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:43.220
 2 minus 2/5 is minus 4/5 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.542
 and then I have plus 3/5. 

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.597
 How can we simplify this? 

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:48.793
 I have these two members here, 

00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:50.163
 which do not include the variable. 

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.498
 They are only numbers. 

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.297
 I can put them together. 

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.478
 I have minus 4/5 plus 3/5. 

00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:58.811
 How much is minus 4 plus 3? 

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.077
 This will be minus 1. 

00:04:00.077 --> 00:04:02.573
 So we will have a minus 1/5, 

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:04.093
 what is enclosed in yellow. 

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:08.656
 And I still have 2 / 5m, 

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:10.838
 2 / 5m minus 1/5. 

00:04:10.838 --> 00:04:11.616
 And we're ready. 

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:14.630
 We have simplified this expression as much as we can.
