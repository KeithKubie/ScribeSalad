ANIA ANZULEWICZ:
Harimata is a company

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.510
which aims to develop a
system for early detection

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.714
of disorders in children.

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:14.297
KRZYSIEK SOBOTA:
We're gathering a lot

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:19.930
of raw data from the tablets,
like touch data, data

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.690
from sensors like
accelerometer gyroscope.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.450
And when you're gathering
it in the NoSQL database,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.610
then this raw data
is preprocessed

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.670
in a cloud service.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.720
And we then write results
to the SQL database.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.550
ANIA ANZULEWICZ: Typically, the
diagnosis of autism spectrum

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.310
disorders takes several months.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.880
And many of the
children are diagnosed

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.580
too late when the time
window for early intervention

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.070
is already closed.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.830
With our technology, we
can identify the signs

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.879
of autism even in two-year-olds.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.570
So we have this
two-year advantage.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.200
Right?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.400
It gives time for
early intervention,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.840
which allows many
of these children

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.740
for independent
life in the future.
