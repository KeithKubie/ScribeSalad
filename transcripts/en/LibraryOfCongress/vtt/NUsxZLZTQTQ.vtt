&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Good
afternoon, I'm Georgette Dorn

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.850
and I'm the Chief of
the Hispanic Division.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.670
It's a great pleasure
to welcome all of you

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.730
to this wonderful library and
this wonderful collection.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330
We have the most extensive
Latin American, Spanish

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.650
and Portuguese collection in
the world, and not just books

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.700
and periodicals, but
also manuscripts, maps,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.900
voice recordings, music,
films and even artefacts

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
in the [inaudible]
collection and more

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.860
than 7 million maps and atlases.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.880
So, it really is worth
being in and beginning

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.180
with the Hispanic reading room

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.480
because it's a beautiful
reading room

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.390
in the Jefferson Building
on the second floor.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.230
It is the oldest foreign area
reading room in the library.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.760
It began in 1939, so it
is now a great pleasure

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.730
to welcome here David Castillo
and Dr. William Eggington,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.610
and Patricia, and I'm not
sure what your last name,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.850
but Talia will introduce you.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.210
And it's a pleasure to
introduce Talia Guzman-Gonzalez

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.460
and moderating the conversation
that I'm sure is going

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.770
to be really provocative
and exciting.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.150
I will keep my introduction
short so we can move

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.820
on to the event, but I would
also like to invite everyone

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.960

the exhibit that the people

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.970

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.520
So, please join me
in welcoming David,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.510
Will and Patricia
to the library.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:26.590
[ Applause ]

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.190
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo:
Bueno, hello everyone,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.830
it's a great pleasure
to be here talking

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.510
about this wonderful
collaboration

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.200
that Will and I have worked on.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.470
The collaboration itself was
wonderful and the results,

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.390
it's for you to judge
[laughter].

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.730
By the way, I've just
convinced Will to go ahead

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.310
and write a sequel to the
book, so watch out for that.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.660
The tentative title for
the sequel is "Humanists

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.660
to the Rescue" [audience
laughter] and now we're

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.880
on record, so we have
to go ahead and do

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.180
that [audience laughter].

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.060
All right, what I'm going
to try and do here is spin

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.780
through a series of slides
that I have put together

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.960
as a spin off from
the book for an event

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.830
that the UB Alumni Relations
Office hosted last night here

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.020
in town.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.190
I had way more time to go
through the PowerPoint there,

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.460
so excuse some of the crankiness
here because I'm going

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.180
to really try to
cut this down into

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.110
about 15-20 minutes, we'll see.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.140
All right, how did we get here?

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.840
This is one of the most
interesting quotes you'll ever

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.380
read, I think.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.030
Ron Suskind, New York
Times Magazine contributor,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.630
in the summer of 2002, after
I had written an article

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.210
in The Squire that
The White House didn't

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.050
like about Bush's former
Communication Director,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.350
Karen Hughes.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.630
I had a meeting with a Senior
Adviser to Bush, he expressed:

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.350
"The White House
is displeasured."

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.710
And then he told me something

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.230
that at the time I didn't fully
comprehend, they said that guys

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.980
like me were in what we call
the reality-based community

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.920
which he defined as people who
believe that solutions emerge

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.420
from your judicious study
of the discernable reality.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.870
I nodded. -- That's not the way
the world really works anymore

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.600
-- he continued -- we're an
empire now and when we act,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.430
we create our reality and while
you're studying that reality,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.270
judiciously as you
will, we'll act again,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.060
creating other new realities
which you can study, too.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.630
And that's how things
will sort out.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.430
We're history factors and
you, all of you, will be left

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.730
to just study what we do --
So, this is from Dr. Who, 1977,

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.900
"You know, the very powerful and
the very stupid have one thing

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.100
in common: they don't alter
their views to fit the facts,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.380
but they alter the
facts to fit their views

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.770
which can be uncomfortable
if you happen to be one

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.870
of the facts that
needs altering."

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.360
[Audience laughter].

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.090
There is a brand-new
technology that allows

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.510
for diminished reality.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.040
[ Video playing ]

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.840
I'm just going to play
a little bit of this.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:56.160
[ Music ]

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.910
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: All right,
well you get the point there.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.930
Things just disappear
in front of your eyes

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.400
and the technology is so fast

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.270
that really actually
once you program this,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.790
the actual filtering, it
can happen in real time,

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.510
so let's see if I can
get back to, all right.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.110
[ Music ]

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.920
Oh, it's going backwards now.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.220
There we go.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.630
So, one possible application

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.510
of this diminishing reality
technology: "Take Google Glass,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.320
the company's overhyped
'smart glasses'

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.100
which can automatically snap
photos of everything we see

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.440
and store them for posterity.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.520
But smart glasses
could do so much more!

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.330
Why not edit out
disturbing sights

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.320
that haunt us on
the way to work?

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.240
Just last year the futurist
Ayesha Khanna even described

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.340
smart contact lenses that could
make homeless people disappear

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.300
from view, 'enhancing our
basic sense' and, undoubtedly,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.070
making our lives so
much more enjoyable.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.560
In a way, this does solve the
problem of homelessness --

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.670
unless, of course, you happen
to be a homeless person.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.700
In that case, Silicon
Valley would hand you a pair

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.780
of overpriced glasses that would
make the streets feel like home.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.710
To quote an ad for Samsung's
fancy TV sets, 'Reality.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.180
What a letdown.'"

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.640
All right and here we go, this
would be augmented reality.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.790
[Video starts].

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.700

with this selfie.

when German Chancellor Angela
Merkel visited a refugee shelter

in Berlin.

arrived in Germany

and was full of confidence.

a half years later,

to the terror attack
in Brussels.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.040
[ Speaking Arabic ]

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.500
The last time they said
I was involved in a crime

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.730
where six attackers set fire
to a sleeping homeless man

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.510
in a Berlin subway station.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.810
[ Speaking Arabic ]

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.920
All these allegations
are absolutely untrue,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.840
but they were published
on Facebook

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.900
and shared more than
1,000 times.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.950
Again, and again, Anas Modamani

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.520
and his lawyer reported
the images

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.710
and asked Facebook
to remove them.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.710
The company says it did.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.420
"We are sorry to hear about
Mr. Modamani's concerns

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.750
with the way some people
have used his image.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.300
We have already quickly
disabled access to content

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.170
that has been accurately
reported to us

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.620
by Mr. Modamani's
legal representatives,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.640
so we do not believe that
legal action here is necessary

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.160
or that it is the most effective
way to resolve the situation."

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.050
But for Anas Modamani,
that's not good enough.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.320
His lawyer says the images
are still in circulation

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.790
on the platform and he's taking
Facebook to court over it.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.560
We want Facebook to delete the
picture from the whole network

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.930
and for them to make sure it
cannot be uploaded anymore.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.150
Anas Modamani cannot find out
himself where his picture is,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.590
it has been shared
more than 1,000 times.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.950
The only one who is able
to do so is Facebook

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.750
and Facebook is also
responsible for making sure

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.920
that the picture is not
circulating any longer.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.750
The trial starts today

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.210
at The Regional Court
in Southern Germany.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.580
The case could have
enormous repercussions

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.710
if the judges decide that
Facebook can be held accountable

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.060
for the distribution
of fake news.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.550
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: Well,
so the trial took place

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:54.280
and Facebook was not
held accountable.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:00.480
So, I guess it's this one
that's working -- Yes, got it.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.420
So, yes. Nothing happened there.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.720
Let's see --

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.240
This is another case, it's
a little bit long-ish,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:22.370
so I'm going to -- Maybe
we can play it later

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.280
if there is a question about
fake news, if people want

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.420
to talk about this
a little bit more.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.950
This is a case in
Idaho actually,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.150
it was reported about
a week ago.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:43.160
So, Facebook agrees to
release ration pars ads,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.380
pledges deeper look at
2016 elections, Zuckerberg,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.650
as you may remember,
projected the criticism

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.560
at first saying shortly
after the election

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.860
that it's a pretty crazy
idea to think that fake news

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.390
on Facebook influenced
the election in any way.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.510
He added that voters make
their decisions based

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.960
on lived experience,
but Facebook had

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.760
to change its tone early
this month when it disclosed

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.080
that a ration company known

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.610
as The Internet Research
Agency had bought more

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.790
than 3,000 politically charged
ads worth about, I don't know,

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.500
about $150,000 on its
platform during key periods

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.620
of the presidential campaign,
often dealing with issues

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.780
such as race, immigration
and gun rights.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.450
We got a Twitter response:
"The ration hoax continues,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.950
now it's ads on Facebook,
what about the totally biased

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.590
and dishonest media coverage
in favor of crooked Hillary?

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.180
The greatest influence over our
election was the fake news media

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.060
screaming for Hillary Clinton."

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.610
Of course, you may remember
these instants here.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:46.230
Let's see, this may not
play, but very quickly,

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.750
this is the famous interview

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:55.610
where Kellyanne Conway
coined the famous expression

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.710
"alternative fact".

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:04.360
So, shortly after I picked up
this article from the internet:

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.970
"The public relation society
of America put out a statement

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.870
on alternative facts
condemning the phrase

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.540
and equating them to lies.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.980
Since Conway's statement many
people have recognized the moral

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.280
and political issue we face

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.980
if our government isn't being
entirely truthful to us.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.200
The statement has been called
'Orwellian' in reference

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.600
to George Orwell's 1984,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.960
which by January 26th had become
the number one Best Seller

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.600
on Amazon."

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.390
So, the question is,
is this reference

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.560
to Orwell's stoking novel
justified and I picked

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.360
up some quotes from the book
that seem to make the case.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.140
This is straight out of 1984: "A
few lines of print and a couple

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.870
of fake photographs and what
wasn't imagine an hour ago is

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.170
now a fact.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.200
There is need for moment
to moment flexibility

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.500
in the treatment of facts.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.000
If the facts say otherwise,
then the facts must be altered.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.240
You must get rid of
those 19th century ideas

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.540
about the laws of nature.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.840
We make the laws of nature.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.820
We can shut them
out of existence."

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.320
Global warming.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.270
There would be no art, no
literature, no science.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.410
Any age, anyone?

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.650
This is the world we're
preparing an endless pressing,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.530
pressing, pressing upon
the nerve of power.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.700
We could also turn to Aldous
Huxley's dystopian novel,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.730
A Brave New World, even earlier,
1931, "In Amusing Ourselves

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.880
to Death, originally
published in 1985,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.070
Neil Postman makes the point
that while we are fixated

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.750
on the Orwellian nightmare
of a totalitarian state built

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.910
on information-suppression
machines, brutal policing,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.290
and physical and
psychological repression,

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.590
our world is inching closer

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.950
to the brave new world
described by Huxley.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.490
A society built on the
promise of a limited

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.750
and instant gratification
in which humanity is drowned

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.660
in stupefying, addictive,
sedating

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.660
and trivializing
media-technologies.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.270
As he writes, 'What
Orwell feared were those

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.130
who would ban books.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.940
What Huxley feared was that
there would be no reason

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.550
to ban a book, for
there would be no one

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.850
who wanted to read one.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.720
Orwell feared those who would
deprive us of information.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.460
Huxley feared those who
would give us so much

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.080
that we would be reduced
to passivity and egoism.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.620
Orwell feared that the truth
would be concealed from us.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.090
Huxley feared that the
truth would be drowned

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:13.980
in a sea of irrelevance.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.610
Orwell feared that we would
become a captive culture.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.890
Huxley feared that we would
become a trivial culture."

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.840
Sure, 1984 and A Brave New
World are eerily relevant,

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.030
but so is Don Quixote.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.130
What do the very
powerful fear the most?

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.140
Clue: Donald Trump did not
attend the traditional roasting

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.960
of the President at
the Press Court Dinner.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.050
Spanish fascist ideologue

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.320
and supporter Ernesto Jimenez
Caballero feared the devastating

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.140
effect of Cervantes's humor,
which in his own words

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.480
"had the power to
ridicule the mystical

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.850
and blind pride of
Imperial Spain".

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.170
He was referring to
the historical empire

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.220
of the Habsburgs as well as
its resurgence or reincarnation

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.100
in the fascist Spain
of the 1930's.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.220
Remarkably, Jimenez Caballero
called Cervantes's irony a

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.070
weapon against stupor,
while noting that the stupor

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.480
of the people is not only
desirable, but necessary

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.700
to advance the cause of empire.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.380
For him, the publication of Don
Quixote was the devastating blow

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.220
to the blind pride
of imperialism

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.230
that marked the beginning
of the end

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.880
of all the great
adventures of Spain.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.670
Amazingly, Walter Benjamin
agreed with him from the left.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.240
Benjamin thinks of
Cervantes's humor

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.380
as the ultimate example
of true critique.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.270
He's explicitly referring to
Don Quixote when he writes:

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.230
"The magic of true
critique appears precisely

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.350
when all counterfeit
comes into contact

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.080
with the light and melts away.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.400
What remains is the
authentic, it is ashes.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.110
We laugh at it.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.670
So, where should we
look today for this kind

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.600
of devastating critique
of empire?"

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.430
About here.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.550
Steven Goldberg uses
truthiness on the debut episode

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.850
of The Goldberg Report.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.080
Truthiness is a quality
characterizing a truth

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.460
that a person making an
argument or assertion claims

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.430
to know intuitively from the
gut or because it feels right,

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.730
without regard to evidence,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.100
logic and intellectual
examination of facts.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.830
He particularly applied it

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.770
to the President George Bush's
decision to invade Iraq in 2003.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.780
Goldberg later described
truthiness to other institutions

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.260
and organizations, including
Wikipedia, which is our source

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.610
for this slide, by the way,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.040
truly Cervantine there [audience
laughter] Goldgberg refreshed

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.410
truthiness in an episode of The
Late Show with Steven Goldberg

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.490
on July 18th, 2016
using the neologism

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.810
"Trumpiness" regarding
statements made

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.050
by Donald Trump during
his presidential campaign.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.060
According to Goldberg, while
truthiness refers to statements

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.890
that feel true, but
are actually false,

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.760
Trumpiness does not
even have to feel true,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.210
much less be true [audience
laughter] As evidence

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.220
that Trump's remarks
exhibit this quality,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.830
he cited The Washington Post
column stating that many

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.250
of Trump's supporters did not
believe his "wildest promises"

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.140
but supported him anyway.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:56.690
And now I have a snippet of --
Let's see if we can pick it up.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.570
I think I may have
to go out of here.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:08.980
Well, that was a bit from the
roasting of President Bush

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.350
at The Press Court Dinner.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.500
I think it was like 2006.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.310
The basic point that
Goldberg was making is

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.340
that President Bush was his hero

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:31.560
because he did not change
his mind, he was steady.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.120
He believed in the same
things on Monday that he did

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.140
on Wednesday, regardless
of what happened Tuesday

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.440
[audience laughter].

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.790
So, Don Quixote revisited.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.230
"The hero of Cervantes's
novel did not feel the need

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.960
to change his mind about the
things he knew to be castles,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.060
giants and armies, just because
these things looked and acted

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.910
like inns, windmills
and herds of livestock.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.420
The famous knight errant was
absolutely certain that shined

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.440
on the barber's head
was Mambrino's helmet,

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.410
regardless of the fact
that, on closer inspection,

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.750
the object admittedly looked
and felt like a barber's basin.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.260
President Bush did not see the
need to adjust his convictions

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.330
about global warming or Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.110
despite ample evidence
to the contrary,

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.590
just as Don Quixote continued
to hold to his "giants"

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.690
and his "armies of knights" even
as he encountered, first hand,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.160
the bruising reality of
windmills and livestock.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.490
If, as the above quoted fascist
ideological Jimenez Caballero

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.950
suggested, the central
tenet of empire,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.780
its defining characteristic
is its necessary mystical

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.880
and blind pride,
then the real enemy

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.260
of empire would not be the
properly designated "axis

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.740
of evil" but the
demystifying irony

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.640
that both Jimenez Caballero
from the right and Benjamin

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.670
from the left attributed
to the Cervantine legacy,

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.600
a rich comedic tradition
that continues

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.760
to hold counterfeit notions to
the piercing light of truth.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.320
From this perspective, the
fact that SNL is at the height

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.500
of its popularity at
this very moment in time,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.040
ought to be taken
as a hopeful sign.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.580
This is a nice title there,
"I'm American, so can you".

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.190
"America again, r- becoming the
greatness we never weren't".

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.460
This is from 2012, the book
itself, although it reads

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.380
as a parody of MAGA,
Make America Great Again.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.080
So, back to Cervantes,
ridiculing the blind pride

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.990
of anti-smarts, reality proof,
empire building fundamentalism.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.590
In 1615, Cervantes published a
collection of theatrical pieces

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.070
with the heading "Eight Plays

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.240
and Eight Interludes
Never Performed".

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.300
The collection included
two humorous interludes

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.370
that are relevant in light
of the present discussion,

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.710
The Election of the
Mayor of Daganzo

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.040
and The Stage of Wonders.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.680
In The Election of the Mayor
of Daganzo, candidate Humillos,

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.380
a name based in a
clever word play

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.550
that suggests both being
proud and smoke screen,

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.670
campaigns for the
highest office in town.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.660
A college graduate asks
him a left-field question:

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.110
"Can you even read, Humillos?"

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.070
The Candidate's response
is a straightforward

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.370
as it is priceless.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.260
"Certainly not and no
one will be able to say

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.400
that a single member of my
kin will ever apply themselves

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.960
to learning those chimeras that
drive men to the stake and women

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.100
to houses of ill-repute.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.520
I come from uncontaminated
Christian stock."

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.760
In The Stage of Wonders, the
producer tells the audience

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.520
that his show will single out
anyone who is contaminated

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.670
by non-Christian blood, for
no one can see the wonders

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.990
that are shown in it if they
belong to a tainted race.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.070
While the stage remains empty
for the entire performance,

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.970
everyone in the audience
will have to pretend

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.390
to see the dramatically
announced wonders

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.000
to avoid the stigma of
contamination and that shows

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.700
that they are indeed members
of the exceptional community

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.110
of legitimate Christians
and true Spaniards.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.040
If we could play with
Colbert's language a bit,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.340
what the producer of Stage

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.650
of Wonders is telling his
prospective audience is

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.470
essentially this: "I am
Spain and so can you".

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.060
Cervantine lessons
in reality literacy.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.590
Where would Cervantes go
today in search for truth

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.270
in our age of truthiness?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.150
Surely, he would tell
us that the truth is

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:01.520
to be found among the victims
of our own stages of wonders.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.200
The pieces of the world
that are removed from you

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.290
by those diminished versions
of reality that shield us

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.230
from what we don't want
to see, say the homeless;

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.930
and also the victims of
our augmented reality,

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.430
say the Syrian refugee who has
become an alternative fact,

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.560
whose sole purpose is to justify
our own fears and to allow us

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.510
to double down on
our chosen reality

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:30.510
or perhaps the truth can be
found in the Netherlands.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:26:58.130
[ Video playing ]

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.120
I have to end it there.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.040
All right, so Will--

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.290
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: OK, so what
we thought we would do is have

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:11.720
David give this presentation
largely related

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.910
to the current part of
the book, the book's focus

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.460
on contemporary culture and --
Clicked the exit, all right,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.420
I'm going to have to not speak
and do at the same time, so yes,

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.100
if you don't mind I
need to find mine --

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.570
now and that's great Talia.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:33.560
And then what I could do is
very briefly show a case study

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.690
of the focus that the book has
on the Early Modern period,

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:42.180
so the early 17th century at
the heart of a great empire.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.290
Then Spain, even though
they were scumbags, right?

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.490
[Audience laughter]
Failed, totally failed.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.190
So, the book was called
"Mediology's Case Study:

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.960
Emblems in the Framing
of Justice".

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.730
So, what I wanted to do was
actually show some reproductions

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:02.170
of some emblem books from the
early 17th century as an example

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.570
of one of the fundamental
points of mediologies,

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.500
which is that out analysis of --

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.310
And so let's take
this great example

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:14.950
that David was talking about,
diminished reality and the ideas

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.790
that certain companies, even
Google Glasses, were thinking

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.840
about this making, in
essence, your way of walking

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.110
through the world more pleasant
to yourself by being able

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:28.040
to edit out in real time
aspects of your social reality

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.340
that are disturbing to you.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.310
So, editing out homelessness
was the idea

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:38.410
that was actually published at
the time and you saw it working

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.930
with stuff on your bathroom
or stuff on your desk.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.280
Well, the first thing that
one could say is, "well,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.860
this is just very technological
and obviously it depends

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.550
on enormous technological
abilities to do that".

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:52.930
Part of David's and my point in
mediology is that the function

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.520
of editing out doesn't have
to be purely technological,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.170
it can happen through what
we consider, what we call

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.750
in the book "framing techniques"

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.880
and those framing techniques
have been available in all times

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.780
in cultures one could say, eh?

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.170
That our understanding
of basic reality depends

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.030
on how we frame it narratively,
how we frame it in terms

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.200
of interpersonal relations,
how we frame it in terms

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.930
of expectations, but
that new media emerges

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.990
and always adopt framing
modes at the time.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.100
And so, if we have electronic
media in the 20th century,

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.560
in the Early Modern period,
so around the beginning

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.960
of the 17th century the newly
emerging empires were taking

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.160
advantage of the media
that they had at the time.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.370
One of them was obviously
the print culture

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.400
and you have fantastic examples
out on the hallway of some

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.760
of the great best sellers
of the time and we will

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.410
of course referring to
some of them ourselves.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.920
Others were theater.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.120
The theater in Spain
began for the first time

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.960
in the early 17th century
to attract up to 90%

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.830
of the newly burgeoning urban
populations who would go

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.310
to see the theater and
they would be going

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.610
and watching the same plays.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.300
How are these forms of newly
popular culture helping

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.640
to frame reality?

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.100
We thought we'd take an
example from emblem books

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.020
and let's make sure that I'm
pressing the right button

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.320
to do this.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.130
Good. So, this one comes out
in 1610, very, very popular,

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.890
one of the great
circulating books of the time

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:24.020
and they're made with a
combination of printed page,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.440
so using the printing
press and woodcuts

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.740
and the woodcuts are
very high quality.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.460
This is from Sebastián
de Covarrubias whose also

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.950
well-known for having
produced one

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.290
of the most important
dictionaries of the time,

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.550
the Diccionario de Autoridades.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.390
And so, we'll take
an example here

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.390
so that I can actually
read it with my poor eyes.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.990
I've found ways to have taken
the actual -- There we go.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:57.490
So, the structure of an
emblem is a woodcut print

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.050
and then a saying underneath,
so it's a combination.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:04.490
The readers are supposed
to reflect upon an image

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.560
and here we have an
image of that's supposed

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.910
to represent a king,
that's power

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.130
but it's also aging terribly
and suffering and it has its paw

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.310
on the world this lion as
it has the crown on its head

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:22.390
and then underneath, or in
the banner there is a saying,

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:30.390
and in this case it says: "What
do you think it means to rule?"

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:35.540
Question, and then the
answer: "To serve while dying".

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.650
So, servir muriendo.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.230
The emblem turns the table
on the common complaint

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.130
of the abusive power to will
power is to suffer abuse

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.920
in the service of the
common good, it is to give

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.830
up all pleasure and
selfish desires

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.820
to become consumed by sacrifice.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.090
The face of the lion, like
the steers body is sagging,

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.670
the skin loose and hanging aged
early by the cares of office.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.170
The front right paw placed
with paternal protection

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.630
over the world is the void
of the violence and fear,

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.780
the great beast's claws
would normally project --

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.140
it radiates instead a
father's benevolence.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.130
So, then let me go
to another one.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.220
Covarrubias in the next one
is shifting the suffering

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.260
of sovereignty inward

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.160
in an emblem depicting the
fatal outcome of the easy road

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.470
of self-fulfillment as a
wide-open net of pleasure.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.460
A word he uses in the emblem
is "gusto" that narrows

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.370
into the death trap of the
great satanic fisher of souls.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.500
So, just as people's proper
protection requires the

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.690
self-sacrifice of the sovereign
in the previous emblem,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.120
this emblem directs its
reader toward the sacrifice

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.400
of his own pleasure, linking

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.050
as it does all pleasure
to damnation.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.060
A watchful, prudent eye must
be watchful first and foremost

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.920
of its own desires is the
message that we're meant

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.090
to receive from this emblem.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.940
We can see the positive
counterpart

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.320
to this ammunition [phonetic]
in the 1665, a little bit later,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.340
festival book called
Luces de la Aurora --

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.880
I just flipped forward
several hundred years

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.090
to a great [inaudible]
turn of the 20th century

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:17.960
of the great book, Luces de
la Aurora or Lights of Dawn.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.520
In this emblem and let
me find this one here,

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:25.860
this is over on the left side
here of the page, we're treated

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.530
to inversion of the traditional
moral faetons [phonetic] fall

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.180
rather than a cautionary
tale of the dangers

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.880
of uninhibited ambition of
leaving one's natural station

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.680
in life and flying too high.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.800
The author of this
wonderful book of emblems,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:47.160
Francisco de la Torre, reads
faeton as morally exemplary.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.490
A self-sacrificing model

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.910
of altruism whose flaming fate
is worthwhile suffering as long

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.670
as the intent was noble.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.050
So, the theme of self-directed
suffering in the service

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.880
of greater morality is what
we're starting to glean

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.110
from this reframing that's
happening through this group

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.220
of emblems and it's
rampant in Covarrubias,

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.230
especially in the
realm of education

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.960
where the whip is shown in
several cases as being essential

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.610
to the civilization of students,
to their happiness and even

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.980
as in this personalization
of the pedagogy of violence

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.760
to life itself and
that's what you see.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.740
You see the tools of pedagogy

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:34.260
and central indent is actually a
whip for flaying peoples' skin.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:39.550
So, the emblems motto is: "Dolor
les doy y juntamente vida."

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.270
Pain I give them, so it's the
personification of this whip

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.030
and at the same time,
life says the whip,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.170
but it also specifies
the kind of students

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.900
who will benefit from its rigor.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.320
The word specifically
is "lerdos",

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.400
the oafs and the slow witted.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.770
Those, in other words, who
haven't the self-discipline

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.060
to tame themselves will
benefit and even gain life

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.680
from punishment, but
not all students need

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.030
to be shaped in this way.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.960
As Covarrubias writes in another
emblem dedicated to the theme

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.890
of education, this one here,
so it's in the very same book.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.970
In fact, it's only
separated by a few pages.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:17.360
Teachers should spare the
whip on well-born children

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.810
for whom its rigors
are more likely

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.740
to cause their generous spirits,
naturally generous spirits

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.920
to cower and make them waste
their time in useless exercises.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.560
The comparison between
these two views

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.140
on corporal punishment is
eye opening, in agreement

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.170
with the tendency of this age,

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.480
Covarrubias accepts a
foundational distinction

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.020
between kinds of
men, kinds of people,

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.350
already present in
their children.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.130
There are those whose blood
destines them to be leaders,

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.680
whose natural generosity
makes the imposition

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.180
of suffering unnecessary and
even potentially detrimental

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.580
and for these, literally in
Spanish, sons of something,

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.770
"Hidalgos" the base term
for the gentry of the time,

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.030
literally signified already
having something in them,

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.950
a proclivity to choose
suffering over pleasure.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:09.390
It is meanwhile the oafish,
the weak, those lacking

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.700
in such natural attributes,
such lineage,

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.220
who should not be spared
the lash if only out of duty

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.500
and compassion for their likely
fate, free from its scar.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.840
So, what I think to draw us back
to the contemporary applications

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.220
that David was making
in the opening,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.800
this should make us think about
the assumptions of neutrality,

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.140
immediacy, equality
that lead one to assume

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.250
that one's position, for
example, in life is a direct

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:45.070
and unmediated expression
of personal worth.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.490
Crucial for any justice
system then, we would argue

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.050
and we would try to argue
in mediologies and we talk

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.410
about media literacy as being
fundamental for any kind

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.460
of social change is to be
self-aware of the sorts

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.740
of filters that determine our
notions of guilt, of innocence,

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.580
of virtue and responsibility,
and the point

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.000
of the book then is to show
how the very strategies

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.340
that are determining
those notions for us today

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.690
under the pretense of
simply "Look out there,

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:20.780
it's just reality unmediated,
unaltered in any way,"

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.440
are in fact not dependent
specifically on technologies,

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.240
but rather are built into
the way that old technologies

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.750
as well are perfectly capable
of manipulating reality.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.050
All right.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.590
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Thanks.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:45.140
So, I want to thank
David and Will

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.800
for this very [inaudible]
provoking introduction

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.640
and I thought that
before we move

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:55.880
on to a more interactive Q&amp;A
it might be useful for you

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.720
to talk a little bit about
the framing of your project

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.050
because the whole book is
structured around a dialogue

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.810
between what you call the
two inflationary ages.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.500
The one of the 16th and
especially 17th century

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:17.030
and then the contemporary period
and you really based the book

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:22.180
on a dialogue between these
two-time frames so to speak.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.550
And it might be useful for
those who maybe haven't not

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.710
yet read the book or
the entire book for you

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:33.390
to explain how this dialogue
provides entry points

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.410
into understanding some
contemporary cultural

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.520
and political phenomenon that
you were illustrating, David,

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.680
at the beginning with
some of these examples.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.880
So, how this comparison
between the 16th

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.670
and especially 17th century

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.960
and our current period might
help us understand some

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.620
of the things we
have been living

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.000
through in the last few years.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.920
&gt;&gt; William Egginton:
David, can I jump in?

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.220
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: Sure.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.520
&gt;&gt; William Egginton:
David always comes

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.820
up with fantastic examples
[audience laughter]

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.240
so he'll just jump
in after that, but --

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.540
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo:
You killed me there.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.840
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: No, no.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.320
I have full confidence,
I have full confidence.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.290
In fact, I'll start with
an example that you said

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:15.060
to me this morning, so that
I was walking to meet David

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.360
and I get a text from
him that says: "Oh,

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.720
look at this article."

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.920
and I proceed to
read this article

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.360
on my phone while walking
to him and it is an article

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.270
about how we're so addicted
to technology in our phones,

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.750
that we're getting all
of our news by our phones

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.050
and we're not even noticing it.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.640
I'm reading it and I'm shaking
my head and saying: "Yes,

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.240
this is completely true."

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.830
[Audience laughter] as
I consumed the exact,

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.970
you know the -- And what I
think the point that we want

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.360
to make is, what
is our definition

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.100
of inflationary media is an
inflationary media, again,

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.400
is somewhat independent from
the technological specificity

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.700
of the media.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.170
What inflationary media
do, it's a kind of media

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:59.670
that causes those who are
immersed in its world to begin

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.610
to lose sight of the
distinctions between how

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.950
that media is framing and the
reality that it is framing,

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:12.580
in other words, its media
that necessarily is capable

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.290
of blurring the frames of
representation of causing us

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.140
to begin to lose sight
of that distinction

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.110
between what the reality it
is that we're talking about

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.170
and the means that
we're using to represent

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.420
and talk about that reality.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.530
So, we can go from tiny little
examples like that to ones

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.920
from the Early Modern period,

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.390
this we don't actually
discuss directly in the book,

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:41.070
but when theater was introduced
and turned really into one

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.370
of the first performative mass
medias throughout the 17th

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.150
century in more countries
than just Spain,

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:49.740
throughout Western
Europe, at the same time,

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.030
critics had to start
paying attention to --

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:56.250
And there was great debates
about the unities of,

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.300
which were, like, how do you
write a good theater play?

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.020
And they took very
serious the possibility

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:07.940
that if they weren't paying
attention to unities of time

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.520
and space, that people might
be sitting in the audience

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.250
and forget that they're actually
in an audience watching a play.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:19.250
Now we think about, oh, you have
to get to the early 20th century

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:22.450
when the Lumiere brothers were
showing a film of the train

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.770
at the Gare de Lyon coming in
and then people would get up

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.660
and run away because it was
a technological innovation.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.970
I think this example shows

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.720
that it isn't necessarily
technological innovation,

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.380
that you can have critics
very seriously debating

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.130
in the 17th century when
there's no such thing as film

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.680
or highly realistic images in
film debating the possibility

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.040
that people are not going
to get that what's happening

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.330
on the stage is in fact a
theatrical representation

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:51.520
and we have to insert
a certain separation,

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.800
a certain artificiality
to ensure

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.000
that they don't fall
into that trap.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.300
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: Thank you,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.610
I got my own microphone
[audience laughter] This is the

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.850
microphone for examples
[audience laughter] All right,

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.880
since he put me on the spot,
here's an example for you.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:17.140
In the second quarter of the
16th century - I'm from Granada,

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.560
Patricia and I were
talking about this earlier,

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:27.250
and you know, Granada was
one of the last bastions

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.510
of Moros presence in Spain.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:36.290
In 1492 is the date of the
so-called discovery of America

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:41.410
and the date of the final
expulsion of the Mores

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:45.830
from Spain, from Granada
and the Jews as well,

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:49.680
and it's also the date
of the publication

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.620
of the first Spanish
grammar by Nebrija.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:58.030
In any case, the region of the
Alpujarras on the South side

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:04.930
of Sierra Nevada became
historically relevant

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.540
in the second half of the 15th
century when the Moriscos,

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.620
the descendants of
the Mores rebelled.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.430
The rebellion lasted
three years,

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:20.010
it took Philip the Second three
years to crush the rebellion

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:27.600
and after executing the leaders
and the great carnage that came

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:34.350
with the oppression of the
rebellion, then the Moriscos

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.210
of Granada took a
different tact.

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.790
They decided to try
a cultural rebellion

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:46.950
and what's interesting is
that they must have managed

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:53.270
to realize that they had
been essentially written

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:57.430
out of Spain, they were
effectively being written

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:04.060
out of Spain by so called
historians, actually many

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.300
of them disciples of
Nebrija of the [inaudible]

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.720
who had been commissioned
by the [inaudible]

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:15.670
to effectively invent
genealogies of Spain to prove

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:21.170
that Spain had been Catholic
essentially before Christ

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:25.640
[audience laughter] All the
way back to Noah's descendance.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.130
Now, the Moriscos realized
that that version of Spain,

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.910
that reframing of Spain

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:36.570
as essentially always already
Catholic was effectively writing

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:42.900
them out of existence, so they
decided to rewrite themselves

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.960
into history by doing
their own reframing.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.460
so, they put together
a nice series

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:57.310
of fake archaeological artefacts
that they aged artificially,

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:00.440
these were the famous
lead books of Granada

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.210
and they planted these fake
archaeological artefacts all

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:08.760
over the hills of Granada, on
the other side of the Alhambra,

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:16.560
a part of Granada that now
has been named as Sacro Monte,

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:23.530
The Sacred Mountain and these
naming comes from the planting

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.060
of these archaeological
artefacts.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.630
In any case, they were supposed
to be found by neutral parties.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:35.860
Peasants ended up finding
them over a period of months

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:42.140
and they brought them to
the authorities of Granada.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.580
Of course, the authorities
of Granada figured, well,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.000
they need to be translated,
who here can speak Arabic?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.930
So, the same people who planted
them received the archaeological

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.990
artefacts for translation.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:58.800
Now, they were written
in Arabic characters,

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.040
but they were gibberish,
they didn't mean anything

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.450
and there was real
thinking behind that,

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:11.290
they wanted for these findings,
these alternative facts,

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:16.490
to have the flexibility
to adjust to the tongues.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.640
So, basically, they started
translating the artefacts

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:25.010
and interactively they were
kind of gaging the reaction

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:28.360
of the Grenadian gentry and
based on their reaction,

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.440
they would continue
the translation,

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:35.260
but in essence what they were
constructing was an alternative

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.980
history of Christianity in
which the first disciples

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:45.490
of Christ were Arabs
and they spoke Arabic,

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:48.610
which is why Arabic
could not be expelled

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.870
as a language from Spain.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:54.700
So, here we have a real case
of fake news, fake histories.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.180
Fake history against
the fake history,

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.850
reframing against reframing,

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:04.310
which essentially brings
us back to our present.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:11.230
This is why we think that
to look at the two periods

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:16.300
of inflationary media, side by
side, to create the dialogue

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.460
between them, can
be fruitful for us.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.760
&gt;&gt; William Egginton:
Just a quick follow

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.110
up because I know Patricia
has more questions, maybe one

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:29.250
or two more, but this also leads
directly to what we consider

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:33.600
to be the urgency of the call
towards the end of medialogies

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.180
that David just submitted.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.780
We're working on the idea of
expanding that because those

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.630
who dialogue already about this
with the book have been asking

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.630
when you call for more
humanities at the end

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.000
of the book, what
shape would that take?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.670
And part of our point is that
it's not to say, "Ah, well look,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:56.150
this set of people who
intervened created this set

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:59.080
of alternative facts and they're
just responded to by this set

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.910
of alternative facts, so we can
all throw our hands in the air

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.340
and say, "Well it
all just depends

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.590
on the frame that
it's given you."

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.980
No, we believe that there really
is an answer to that and that

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.500
that is ultimately what the
humanities are capable of doing.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.360
Philology, looking at texts,
making decisions based

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.210
on arguments and
interpretation, textual evidence

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.890
and that this is what we
call not just media literacy,

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.220
which is a part of it,
but reality literacy.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:29.140
If it's true that reality
is constantly under assault,

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.260
if you will, and we have
to accept that it is

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.720
and will be the best
tools for discerning

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.470
and then ultimately engaging
in rational discourse

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.490
about reality, are precisely
those that are inculcated

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:44.410
in educated and worked on,

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.970
developed through the
disciplines of the humanities.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.710
History, philosophy,
literary theory,

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.670
literary history, etcetera.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.830
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Yes,
that was actually going

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.740
to be my next question, so
what would be the antidote

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:02.860
to this proliferation of fake
reality upon reality and so,

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.670
but I have a number
of other questions,

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.380
but I think that given the
time, it might be better

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.660
to open the floor for questions

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:14.890
from the audience
or comments or.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.900
Yes, here and then there.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.360
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering
what - This new phenomenon

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.530
of people having a voice
and commenting on media

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:29.180
which I think is in a
[inaudible] What role does

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.210
that play in this age
of inflationary media?

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:36.200
The fact that everyone
can comment on an article

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.590
that is fake and what happens
after everyone's discussing --

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.490
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: Well I
think it's a great question

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:46.240
and it's one that I think
demonstrates exactly the

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.150
cautionary note that
we're sounding, right?

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:52.290
Because in an age of
inflationary media you're going

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.400
to have, if you will,
what I would call,

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.640
and I think David would agree
with me, a kind of facade

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.750
of democratization
occurs, right?

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.750
So, ah, the more people
who are commenting

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.940
and making this point,
the more media the better,

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.460
the more democratic and
ultimately, we get to the truth

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.010
that we see it doesn't often
necessarily work that way

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.360
and that discernment becomes
extremely important, right?

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.380
And the discernment involves --

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.790
it's not easy, it involves
study, it involves education,

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:26.120
it involves knowing languages,
cultures, precisely that which

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:30.880
in the present day end
up being de-emphasized

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:36.110
by educational regimes that are
focused on a purely economic

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.410
and instrumental outputs.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.870
No, you have to learn exactly
this in order to be able

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.260
to get a job programming or
you have to learn exactly that.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.950
It's probably true that
learning these exact set

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.960
of skills might get you a job,

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.580
but it doesn't necessarily
expand you as a human being

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.910
or allow you these
sorts of discernments

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:58.530
that would permit a truly
democratic society to function.

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.000
David were you looking for --

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.300
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: Yes, I'm
looking for something that --

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.640
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: David is
going to show us something.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.750
&gt;&gt; Do you want to take
the other question?

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.050
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Yes, sure.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.370
It was that lady over there.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:15.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, so, thank you very
much for this, it's intriguing

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.710
and synergizes a lot with my
own thinking over the years.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:24.390
I was a graduate student
in the 80's and 90's

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.790
and when I'm thinking
about for those who may

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:31.730
or may not have been in
that scene at that time,

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:36.480
but the humanities at that
point were in a huge period

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.550
of self-reflection and
crisis almost of what's come

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:43.130
to be called constructuralism

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.250
and I'm not sure what
we'd call it after that,

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:46.870
post- constructuralism?

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:51.810
But the idea that what I've been
reacting to personally coming

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.880
out environment, when
I hear about facts

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.810
in the media right now is like
there is no such thing as facts

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.890
because that's what I learned
in graduate school, OK?

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.970
There are no facts, what
there is is evidence

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:06.270
and then there are
cultural constructs that we,

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:10.590
as a society, have come to agree
upon as facts and if you look

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.080
at it more on the science
side and you can, you know,

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.040
someone like Structure
of Scientific Revolutions

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.580
by Thomas Kuhn, the way that
science comes to the point

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.550
where it will agree that
something is a [inaudible] fact,

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:27.690
but at the base of it,
it's all an agreement

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:32.140
and what I'm thinking about is
I look very much look forward

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:36.690
to your next book because
I want to hear more

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:40.980
about what the humanities can do
about this, but I almost wonder

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:46.980
if this isn't a natural backlash
because the progression would be

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.480
to politicize a little
I was also caught

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.000
up in the culture wars of the
time and political correctness

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.640
and so, I remember having
defended something I said

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.540
in public once in an alumni
magazine because I was accused

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.620
of political correctness
by a 1950's era graduate

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.330
who read the quote of what I
had said, it was about slavery,

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:06.630
the legacy of slavery.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:10.600
And so, we had people
like Dennis Desouza

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.020
and the closing the
American mind and he's still

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.350
out on Twitter every day, right?

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:16.010
Saying bizarre things.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.640
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: Desouza
wrote Liberal Education.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.230
Allan Bloom wrote the --

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:21.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes, you're right.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:22.830
I got that wrong, thank you.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.730
You're paying more attention to
these things in the recent world

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:29.970
than I've been but anyways,
sort of, to the extent

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:32.160
that the academic
left is aligned

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.560
with the post-constructuralism
that took over much

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.580
of the humanities
and social sciences

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.970
in that time maybe we're
in a period of backlash

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:46.030
and I wondered if you could
address that aspect I f--

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.290
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: We are
100% in a period of backlash,

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:51.230
there's no question about that.

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.360
The question that I
have is the extent

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.930
and I think this is demonstrable
because we like to talk in terms

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:58.630
of textual evidence,
you can look at plenty

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.810
of textual evidence
and immediate evidence

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:05.870
that in the 2016 elections,
one of the boogeymen

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:11.220
that was brought around as those
that we need to react toward

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.550
or put down our Post-Modern
professors and famous quotes

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.520
"We have become too
politically correct."

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.160
and there was a lot of
rational political correctness.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.640
I think what's interesting
is that again,

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.860
using our methodology to
look how things are framed is

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:31.550
to examine to what extent in
fact political correctness

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.660
and Post-Modern professors
have the kind of power

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:40.320
that is claimed to justify
this kind of political reaction

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.800
and not only to what extent
they have that kind of power,

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.340
which is in fact
I think minority

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:49.200
and certainly exaggerated
in the extreme,

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:55.380
but to what extent the
interpretations that these sorts

00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:00.360
of claims are based on are in
fact accurate interpretations

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.370
of what even the philosophers
that were being banned

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:07.930
about during the 1980's
were in fact saying.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:09.620
So, everything is just text,

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.290
there is no outside
to this text.

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:17.350
Everything is interpretation and
there is no such thing as truth.

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:22.070
Many of these were in fact
either quotes taken completely

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.760
out of context, like people
didn't actually understand

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.330
or take the time to
really confront or deal

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.680
with the philosophies
that they were applying

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.530
or were simply fabrications
themselves, claims that such

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:38.420
and such said this when
they didn't say it at all.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.240
Again, a truly grounded
humanistic discipline is one

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:48.110
that pays attention to texts,
that pays attention to history,

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:52.170
to standards of evidence
and isn't willing

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.620
to simply take something at
"Do your first Google search,

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.100
come up with an answer
and say ah, ok, see?

00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.400
This is what happened."

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.700
and move on from there.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.000
I think that's what
we need to get back

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.880
to a certain skepticism, a
certain being aware of where

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.020
of what are the grounds of
the claims you're making.

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.400
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: And
here's where paying attention

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:14.360
to the filters really
can be useful,

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.010
so a word like "skepticism".

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:21.760
The term has been
hijacked in upright circles

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:28.610
to justify the said interest
of those who would prefer

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:32.190
to bury their head in the sand
when it comes to global warming.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:36.140
It's our responsibility
as humanists to rescue

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:40.940
and the notion of skepticism
from that hijacking.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.760
The same can be said
about doubt.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.530
Doubt is absolutely
necessary for thinking,

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:52.960
part of the problem,
as we see it,

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.440
with our media technologies
is it frames

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:03.380
out the possibility of thinking.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:07.230
It steals time from us, time
that's necessary for thinking.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:09.890
The speed of communications is

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:13.210
such that we really
have no time to think.

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:16.490
Before we can think
we have to doubt.

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:24.180
Doubt has been also hijacked by
the same market forces, so it's,

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:29.080
again, our responsibility as
humanists to rescue that term

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.910
from that nefarious place.

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:35.630
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: So many
other terms: liberty, freedom,

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:38.470
community, faith
have been hijacked

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:41.200
and often then become terms
that are automatically assumed

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.650
to have one set of constituents
and one kind of audience.

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.710
No, not necessarily,
look at the history.

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:48.770
Look at how these terms
have been used in the past.

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:51.410
Look at the kind of
values that they've managed

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:54.870
to mobilize in the past.

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.340
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: And
the other point we made

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:03.090
in mediologies is that the
place where we find ourselves,

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:08.070
this crisis of reality in which
we find ourselves is directly

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.730
connected to the
widespread of fundamentalism

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:16.920
that is the result of the
silent [phonetic] of information

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:24.210
that comes with a certain usage
of social media, for example.

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:30.900
So, it's not really the result
of, you know, skepticism taken

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.520
to its, or this kind of
Postmodern doubt taken

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.660
to its ultimate consequence
it's actually the result

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:45.300
to fundamentalism, the notion
that I can feel justified

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:52.520
in my own beliefs regarding of
any evidence based knowledge

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.740
that may resist it, that
may become obstacles to it

00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.170
to the extent that
I can [inaudible]

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:03.310
in my media [inaudible] and
say a combination of faux news

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:07.350
and report news and, you know,

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:14.870
feel like my beliefs are
reinforced every day,

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:18.160
then I don't really have to talk
to people who think differently.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.810
that's what we call in the
book reality entitlement,

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:26.220
so which for us is really
a symptom of fundamentalism

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:32.490
and we talk about fundamentalism
as being equal to fragmentation

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:37.150
as opposed to postmodern
thoughts.

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:40.540
&gt;&gt; I'm not secure
about your views

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:41.840
on contemporary literature.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.750
Some people don't study
humanities and might get some

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.310
of the benefits by
reading literature.

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:51.610
What are your thoughts

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:55.880
on current literature
or current fiction?

00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.220
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: So,
for example, you know,

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:06.500
I'm just re-reading Dystopias
and now it seems like --

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.160
I'm fascinated by
the cultural terms.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.270
So, I think Talia mentioned

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:20.380
that in 2016 we coauthored
this book called Zombie talk,

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:25.000
it was a time when zombies
had become very prevalent

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
and I was interesting in
reading zombies as a symptom

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.970
of our anxieties, you know,
you can think the bonfires

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:37.800
as effective -- And we could
even imagine the possibility

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.910
that we would want to
become vampires [laughter]

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:43.140
in a form, but zombies?

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.860
Who would want to
become a zombie?

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.480
So, really that kind of
brought me to thinking

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:57.160
about why the popularity of
zombies, what kind of anxieties,

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.220
you know, individual

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:05.080
and collective anxieties
were being exercised or dealt

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:12.760
with through the representation
of zombies and I think

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.150
at this point, you know,

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:21.690
I mentioned that 1984 was the
number one selling book in 2017.

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:27.900
The success of The Handmaid's
Tale is another example.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:35.060
&gt;&gt; Going back to the [inaudible]
Tale is not really drawing

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.340
from what [inaudible] I'm
just curious about that.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.070
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo:
Right, so there is a new way

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:45.000
of Dystopias right now and
they are coming out like crazy

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.810
within five or ten years
we're going to have

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:49.080
to examine the whole
canon of Dystopias.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.850
They are coming out with
incredible speed and we have to,

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:57.720
once again, try to, you
know, figure out what is it

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:04.120
that makes Dystopias such
powerful tools to relate,

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.650
to comment to our world and
the same thing could be said

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:12.370
about humor so I
showed there a couple

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:18.830
of books by Steven Goldberg.

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:26.360
There is more of a-- In some
ways, we're going back to a time

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:34.280
where traditional genre
divisions don't hold that well,

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.020
so we thought, you know,

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:40.080
the talk show commentators
are now book authors

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.480
and the other way around, we
have shows that turn into books

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.210
and books that turn into
shows, but the theme

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:52.100
of irony is another very
powerful weapon right now

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:57.970
in our world and this speaks
to a certain need that we have,

01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:01.280
we believe, to examine filters

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.210
and irony is a very
powerful weapon to do

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.790
that because it implies
a certain obliqueness

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.030
that allows us to
see a double image,

01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:11.290
sort of in an anamorphic way.

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:13.730
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: We think
one of the potential powers

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.310
of literature and reading
books, not just analytic books

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.610
and nonfiction books

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:21.580
but actually fictional books
is the power of literature

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.910
and the written word
in particular,

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:26.500
but we do analyze television
shows and we talk about movies,

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.380
but that literature and the
written word has a focusing the

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.680
attention on invisible filters.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.830
You don't see these filter
per se but they're there,

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:38.090
the filters that we spend the
entire book talking about.

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:43.230
Literature can animate the
senses to pay attention

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:49.690
to how our reality is posed for
someone who is living in it,

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:54.130
how a particular media
environment situates something

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:57.210
for someone who's
imbued or immersed

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:58.510
in that media environment.

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:00.940
We talk a lot about
Cervantes which is, of course,

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.910
old literature, but we also
make the argument and it's one

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:07.920
that I went into
great length to work

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.860
out in my intellectual
biography of Cervantes the man

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:14.670
who invented fiction, that why
I make this outlander standing

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:16.170
claim that he invented
fiction is

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.890
because we have certain
expectations

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:21.280
in modern fiction all of
which can be traced past back

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.000
to what he was able to do with
the text it was precisely that.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.900
Our expectations of characters

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:27.270
as being three-dimensional
people

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:30.850
that we can somehow relate
to, that integrate themselves

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:32.690
with our sense of
empathy with something

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.630
that he created and
how did he do it?

01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.190
By making other characters
who are both bewildered by

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:39.980
and capable of analyzing
and thinking critically

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.100
about their relationship
to media

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:48.100
and to the truth laying outside
that media, so I think often

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.500
about a wonderful interview,
and you should look it up,

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.320
I can't remember what
publication published it

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:57.400
but it was an interview between
the novelist Marilynne Robinson

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.960
and our former President
in which he expressed,

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.370
because he's a great
reader of novels

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:06.530
and he expressed this worry
in an age that is reading less

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:10.000
and less literature in the
sense of the presentation

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.340
of realistic characters
that we can have empathetic

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.640
relationships with.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.800
What is it doing to our
capacity to empathize?

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.620
And the neuroscientific
research on precisely

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.040
that topic does give
some credence

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.460
to the President's
sense of alarm, right?

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.940
Because apparently
reading novels,

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.470
more than any other consumption
of fictional narratives

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:38.570
in other words, media in
what we call a hotter way

01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:40.930
where you have less of
an ability to filter

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:43.700
and use your own
imagination to create.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.030
Reading novels in particular
ignites our ability to empathize

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:49.810
with those who are
different from us, all right?

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:52.330
And this is something
that we see in the history

01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:58.110
of the modern novel from as far
back as Cervantes up to novelist

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:03.950
like Valeria Luiselli or Karl
Ove Knausgaard or so many others

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.560
that I could think of.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.860
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira:
Any other questions?

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.320
I do have a question and
you refer in the book

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.980
that today's mediology
turns copies into things,

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.140
so things that proliferated
as copies become reality

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:23.530
and this tends to sideline
reality itself, right?

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:27.970
And you link this to the
current ecological crisis

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:31.080
because reality as such
becomes expandable and so,

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.380
you can just expose of it.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.900
And I was wondering if
you see also literature

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.230
or the creative arts,
let's call them like this,

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:44.060
as a way to counter
this phenomenon.

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.860
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: I think
very much we do and we think

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.540
of literature and creativity and
the arts as one of the only ways

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.840
of countering this phenomenon.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.210
So, what you're referring to
is in the second age of media

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:57.290
that turns copies into
things, our idea of the world

01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:04.390
as a totality of the world
being a representation

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:06.800
that gets packaged
into something

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.240
that is itself bottomless,
so the world

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.240
as that what supports us becomes
something like a commodity

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.970
which means it has and end, it
can be thought of as a resource

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.780
that we can expend, and of
course, we need to think

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.990
about it in those terms, but
at the same time once we think

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:24.960
of the very source of
life itself, of everything

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.150
that we are, not as something
infinite and grounding

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:31.700
but as one granted
very, very big,

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:36.080
but one resource
among many this kind

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.590
of opens the door
into a scary future.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:42.290
You begin to think of
everything in terms

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.350
of potential commodities,
people are commodities,

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:48.340
life sources are commodities
as opposed of thinking

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:54.150
about what is the potential
value of these sources

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:57.380
of these things in their
own terms, not in terms

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.520
of what they might be
calculable in dollars.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.510
We do find that art and
literature are precisely anchors

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.170
that keep us from
falling entirely

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.000
over the cliff in that sense.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.300
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: Yes,

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:17.700
and we also mentioned
the tourist industry,

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.720
sort of the ultimate
paradigm of that kind

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:28.780
of dialectic negation
that takes place.

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:34.520
In the book we also
mentioned a recent example

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:40.800
of the American Airlines
mural that is displayed

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:48.110
over the JFK security area, you
know, it's called the skyline

01:08:48.110 --> 01:09:00.420
of the world and it
shows a rather unreal,

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:04.670
Disney World-like
picture of globalization

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:09.670
where you have Eiffel Tower,
with the Empire State Building

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:13.250
with other landmarks
throughout the world,

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.200
the skyline of the world.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.670
As you walk through security,
the reality of you having

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:24.190
to take your shoes of,
take your belt off,

01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:29.160
you know, do a spread eagle.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:34.780
It's funny, don't know how
much you actually to share

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:42.380
of this reality, but a Spaniard
that shaves only inconsistently,

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.940
coming through security,

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.410
the notion that one the one
hand you have unlimited movement

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.640
of the mural, where
you are a citizen,

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.950
you are being interpellated as
a citizen, a global citizen,

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:57.260
a citizen, skyline of the world

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:00.080
and at the same time you're
taking your belt off and going

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.480
through increasingly
oppressive measures

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.000
that show you the exact
opposite, you know,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.600
that opens up the room
for question to think

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:20.420
about if this image is true
and what is it negating?

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:24.320
Like the tourist industry,
like Disney World, you know,

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.700
it negates oppression,
colonialism.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.170
&gt;&gt; William Egginton: The
90% of the population

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:33.340
who doesn't have
the capacity to walk

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.580
through security
to another country.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.880
&gt;&gt; David R Castillo: Exactly,

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.390
yes and that's part
of the thinking.

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:47.330
Once we look at the
world in these terms,

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:54.540
once we train ourselves in
the art of reality literacy,

01:10:54.540 --> 01:11:02.320
in a way you can apply
that skill to literature,

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.150
to the American Airlines
Mural, to the tourist industry

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:13.070
in search for that
allusive manifestation

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:19.150
of the truth in the
filter itself.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.730
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Well, I'd
like to thank David and Will

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:24.100
for this wonderful presentation,
I believe there is going

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.980
to be a book signing
outside, so first of all,

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:30.930
thank you for [applause].

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:34.630
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
by the Library of Congress.
