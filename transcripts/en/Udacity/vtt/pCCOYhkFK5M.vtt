00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.130
Okay, there would be four possible combinations. Because

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.300
chromosome pairs are split up during meiosis, right?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.850
We learned that a couple exercises ago. An

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.570
then that means that this pair of chromosome two,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.290
we could get the dominant lactase allele in

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.370
one gamete and the recessive lactase allele in another

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.730
gamete. Well this gamete is also going to

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.270
have one chromosome from the chromosome four pair and

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.610
it could get either the recessive allele or

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.159
the dominant dwarfism allele. But it could also have

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.940
gone the other way, where the dominant dwarfism

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.090
allele ended up with the dominant lactase allele, and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.700
the recessive lactase allele ended up with the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.770
recessive dwarfism allele. You will notice that each of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.120
these four genotypes is distinct and entirely possible

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.690
based on the process of the law of segregation.
