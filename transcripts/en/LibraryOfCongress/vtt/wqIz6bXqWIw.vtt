00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:18.710
[silence]

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.150
&gt;&gt; TOMOKO STEEN: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.470
I am Tomoko Steen at
Science, Technology,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.610
and Business Division here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.080
Today's event is organized
by our division, science,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.880
and technology, and business.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.510 position:56%
Sometimes we co-sponsor these events
with other part of the library.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.860
Today's speaker is
Dr. Ilya Zaslavsky,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.530
is director of the Spatial
Information Systems Lab

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.760
at the San Diego Supercomputer
Center,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.040
which is part of the University
of California, San Diego.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.090
His research focus on
very complex program.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.300
It's a distributed information
management systems and spatial

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.360
and temporal data integration.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.050 position:56%
So Dr. Zaslavsky received his PhD in
University of Washington in geology

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.910
in 1995 and before he came to this
country, he also received his PhD

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.800
from Russian Academy
of Science in 1990.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.440
He has led design and
technical development

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.880
for several large cyber
infrastructure project supported

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.290
by National Science Foundation
and that's include Asque

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.480
and the National-Scale
Hydrologic Information System.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:06.360
He's also co-chair of the OGC, WMO,
Hydrology Domain Working Group,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.940
which is a way to develop
international standard

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.620
for the water data.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.300
I hope I said the right.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.690
Today, Dr. Zaslavsky is going to
talk about a very exciting topic.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.080
SDG, which is Sustainable
Development Goals.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.330
SDG is United Nations
initiative and its long name is

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:49.030 position:56%
"Transforming Our World, the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development."

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:58.420
This is a set of 17 global
goals with 169 targets.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:09.070
So the aims are: end poverty,
to protect the planet,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.760
and ensure prosperity
for all of us on earth.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:26.390
So the goal was put forward 2015 by
UN and before I go over difficult,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.880
the words, I think it's best
to explain by the speaker.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.610
So before further ado, please join
us, welcoming Dr. Ilya Zaslavsky.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.370
[applause]

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.750
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY:
Thank you very much.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.880
Thank you very much, Dr. Stein.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.300
I am Ilya Zaslavsky.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.180
I am gonna talk about
sustainable development goals

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.950
but sustainable development goals
is just one of the applications

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.350
of the software that we
developed and I will start

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.680
with describing general
trends in computing

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.060
and in cyber-infrastructure and
try to talk through transformations

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.950
that are happening in the computing
world and see how the tools

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.940
that we have been developing
recently help bring in more people,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.700
engage users, and make it easier
to access data and analyze data.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.260
So one of the applications is
sustainable development goal

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.500
indicators, but there are
several other applications

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.990 position:56%
and time permitting, I will show
you if that would range from Picasso

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.100
and Van Gogh paintings to somebody
diversity image collections,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.770
to other library collections.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.670
This talk may be a little unusual

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.990
because I don't have
that many slides.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.840
I will do the introduction and then
we'll try to switch to a live demo.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.980
I'll tell you where I come from.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:12.150
I work at San Diego Supercomputer
Center which is a fairly large

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.980
and one of the oldest super
computing centers in the country.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.250
It was one of five original
centers founded in 1985.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.040
We work on high-performance
computing and advanced networking.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.850
But more recently, the focus
has been cyber-infrastructure.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.490
I hope you've heard this word.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.420
So these are the key part
here is infrastructure.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.180
We're trying to make it
such that you don't need

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.570
to understand the details
of computing

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.100
in order to be able to use it.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.850
Similar to electrical grid.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.290
Electrical grid is a
very common metaphor used

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.680
to explain infrastructure.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.270 position:56%
You plug your appliance to an outlet
and you should be able to use it

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.250
without understanding the details
of how electricity is generated.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:05.840 position:56%
In computing, there of course are
lots of databases and cloud services

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.120
and web services and devices

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.450
and many different components
are involved in order

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.020
to deliver the data and
some services to users,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.690
and users are not supposed to
understand the mechanics of it.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.120
They should be able to just
plugin, to find the data or plug

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.190
in their own data,
and be able to use it.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:36.090
That's, currently, a dream and a
very big challenge and research

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.950 position:56%
on this area is being funded by
National Science Foundation and NASA

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.750
and DOA and other agencies.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.320
Right. So, cyber-infrastructure.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.800
And this slide is from Jim Crosier
who is the head of computing

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.450
and engineering department
division at NSF.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.270
Just to give you an outline of
what cyber-infrastructure is

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.510
and what is the vision of
cyber-infrastructure at the NSF.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.270
You have a lot of different
types of resources

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:20.470
that include cloud resources
and various compute systems,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.980
storage systems and so on, and
some of these are supported by NSF

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.690
and there are of course lots of
resources in the commercial world,

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.650
there are international
resources, and so on.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.490
On top of it, there
is middleware layer

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.870
where that manages
communications and exchange

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.160
between different systems and helps

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.940
to orchestrate the
systems working together.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.000
There are some acronyms here
which I am not gonna spell out,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.260
but if you have large
data sets sitting

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.820
in different storage systems,
you may want to connect them.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.120
And so there is a brokering system.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.020
If you want to access
these different systems,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.300 position:56%
you may need to have a single
sign-on system so that you don't log

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.750
in to each individual
system to work with it.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.890
And on top of it, there are
science-focused applications

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.870
and there are a lot of tools
that have been developed

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:23.210
in this domain including various
APIs and portals and gateways

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.520
that support different sciences.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:36.250
So, the dream is how to move
it to become more plug and play

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.050
so that we don't have to think
about each individual population

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.860
and the separation
are hidden from us.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.630
Kind of towards the electric grid.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.200
This is, as I said,
challenging because we see a lot

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.530
of transformation going on in
different areas of computing.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.140
So that's another slide from NSF

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.250
which outlines so-called
cyber-infrastructure ecosystem.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.750
And that includes organizations
and computer resources

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.790
and software and networking.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.530
Changes are happening
in all of that.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.730
Software used to be
developed by small groups,

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.570
now this is large-scale
collaborative activity

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.250
that involves multiple groups
working together so they have

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:35.530 position:56%
to communicate, they have to be able
not to step on each other's toes,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.630
so to make this work
smooth, organizations have

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:47.140
to align what they do to
support collaborative science.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.360
Scientific instruments have to
plug in to the same infrastructure

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.100
and be able to not only provide
data but also provide information

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.450
about how this data
has been collected

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.070
so that you can always go back
and understand the origins and try

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.340
to explain where it comes from.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.410
And of course, huge
changes in the data.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:15.930
What we have been generating
in a year

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.650
or in two years exceeds
what has been generated

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.270
in all previous times.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:27.070
And so the questions are, do
we want to store this data?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.800
That's not possible,
because we generate more data

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.100
than we can store.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.600
Do we want to somehow
mine this data?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.660
How you decide what is important
to keep, what can be discarded?

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:46.130 position:56%
And, most importantly, how to use it

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.720
such that it brings along
benefits for everybody.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.080
So this is a very complex system
and transformations are going

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.470
on in all parts of it and
so, there's no surprise

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.210
that people are talking
about revolution

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.060
and sometimes call it
"big data revolution."

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:13.180 position:56%
And these are just some of the
snapshots that I pulled off the web.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:21.050 position:56%
We're talking about forty zettabytes
of data in digital universe.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.020
And zettabyte is 10
to the power of 21,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.150
sextillion or something like that.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:37.890
We have a huge amount of quantum
posted on YouTube and Facebook.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.340 position:56%
200 million emails sent each minute.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.870
So this is a huge amount
of information to handle.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.260
And if you want to make use of this
information, there should be tools

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.900
that can quickly parse this data.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.750
And so, the entire
ecosystem, software ecosystem,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:59.840
is changing to tune to
this amount of data.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.650
How people have defined big data?

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.480
In 2001 there was an original
paper that started with 3 V's.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.150
Big data is data that
has huge volume,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.060
comes at you with high velocity,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.500
and presents a large
variety of data types.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.700
That idea of adding more
V's became quite popular

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.460
and that's a clear sign of
a marketing hype, of course,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.320
so eventually you end
up with vendors claiming

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.320
that only our software can solve
your verisimilitude problems,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.980
and other types of V's
that have been added.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.860
But volume, velocity, and variety
are perhaps the most important

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.720
characteristics that
everybody who work

00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:01.160
with data have been
trying to tune to.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.750
&gt;&gt; So this is just to emphasize
the point that you really want

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.160
to have a grid-like
system where you don't want

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.730
to understand the crazy variety
of tools and systems that exist.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.180
They have overlapping boundaries,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.280
they don't necessarily
talk the same language,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.700
they don't necessarily
connect with each other.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:29.750
And it also highlights the
importance of nurturing new types

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.180
of scientists who can actually
navigate in this huge ecosystem

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.260
and figure out what is usable
and what is connectable.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.880
That's the big data landscape that
is compiled from different versions

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.710
that happens every year and I'm
sure there are lots of systems

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:54.090 position:56%
that aren't mentioned on this chart.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.490
What we have been doing
in this space.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.980
And so this is my lab.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.390
We have been working, mostly,
on spatial data integration

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.310
and large information systems.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:10.910
And I'll just mention
a couple of them.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.840
One is Hydrologic Information
System.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.770 position:56%
I note here that this is the largest
in the world, probably the largest

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.070
in the world, it's hard
to make claims like that,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.800
because it's not a single database.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.770
It's a system where you can
connect to multiple databases

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.500
that follow the same language
and the same protocols.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.430
So the first thing we did when we
tried to organize such a system is

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.750
to develop this common language.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.970 position:56%
It was called Water Markup language.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.610
If you can expose your
data in this language,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.900
then it will be unambiguously
interpreted by any client.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.850
And that is an important component

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.030
of different systems
talking to each other.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:01.840
So this language has been adopted
by multiple groups, universities,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.270
and federal agencies, and as
a result, we have a system

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:10.490
where you can, from a single
client, you can query all of them.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:20.120
Another interesting example is
with integration of brain data.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.200 position:56%
When you work with neuroscience
atlases, in this case we have worked

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:33.800
with atlases of rodent brain,
people develop photographic slices

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.330
and organize them as stacks.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:42.200
And it is important to understand
distribution of the signal

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.690
that you see in one
collection of slices.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.060
How it relates to something which
has been observed by other people

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.040
in other country and in a
different research group.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.850
The key question here is how
you can relate information

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.780
about location in the brain.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.820
It's not earth, so there's
no latitude, longitude here,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.120
not to mention that all
brains are different.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:12.200
So, you have to come up with some
kind of probabilistic specification

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.220
of location and then
develop services

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.850
that will exchange
information about locations

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.450
so that once you register
your slices to the system,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.780
you would be able to get a
gene expression, segmentations,

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:31.670
and other data that somebody have
observed in that part of the brain.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.080
So, you see from these two examples
that we've been working mostly

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.270
in the middleware realm, but I
was actually planning on talking

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:49.250
about a different project where
I think we are trying to tap

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:55.230
into totally different part
of big data challenges,

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.080
and that is making data
accessible and easy to use

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.860
by large groups of people.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.910
So I will be talking about
the system called SuAVE.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.850
SuAVE, no references to shampoo,

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.830
it stands for Survey Analysis
via Visual Exploration.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:21.040
And surveys are treated
somewhat generically here.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.760
So it's not just questionnaire
surveys.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:29.450
It could be biodiversity surveys or
vegetation surveys, soil surveys,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:35.660 position:56%
and other types of collections where
you have information that may come

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.280
from observations from some
annotations from notes,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.770
from devices, from anything.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.180
And so you have various
heterogeneous of information

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.140
that you need to explore and figure

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.730
out where you start
subsequent analysis.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:57.130
So, you see that there are
different types of applications,

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:02.480
even on this screen, I
have public opinion survey

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.970 position:56%
and Van Gogh paintings, which each
of these paintings has some metadata

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:13.150
that you can use to slice
and dice your collection.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:19.620
You can have different views
of the data, map views,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.820
bar charts, cross tabs, and so on.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:29.260
Before, I was hoping
to show you the demo,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.630
I will talk about another
type of data revolution.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.150
So, data revolution is a term
that is used by United Nations

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:43.390
to highlight the challenges
that people now have

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.470 position:56%
with managing development worldwide.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.360
It's very important to have
information about what's going

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.030
on in different countries
and how countries perform

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.390
on various matters, so that
to be able to make decisions,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.770
and to be able to assess where
each country is with respect

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.420
to sustainable development goals.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.640
So in 2014, there was a UN report

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.850
that proposed global
partnership for ...

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.750
Partnership for sustainable
development data

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.280
and the key component
of it was agreeing

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.300
on sustainable development
goals and developing indicators

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:34.430 position:56%
to monitor progress of every country
that subscribed to this document

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:43.640
and there're 194 countries that
agreed to follow that system.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:52.180
So in September of 2015, this
program, "Transforming Our World,"

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.630
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development was adopted

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.350
that specified 17 sustainable
development goals.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.800
This is the program for the United
Nations for the next 15 years.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.260
In the previous 15 years,
the program was called

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.890
"Millennium Development
Goals" and that was adopted

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:17.940
after millennium summit in 2010,
also focused on 15-year period.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.460
There were eight goals.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.270 position:56%
The progress has actually been quite
remarkable on these eight goals,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.780
but very uneven across countries.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.870
And these 17 goals have just
started so we have baseline data

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.280
for each country on these goals.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:43.230
Goals include eradication
of poverty and hunger.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.010
Establishing conditions for
good health and well-being.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.740
Education and a bunch of other
matters, targets that deal

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:56.900
with development, especially
sustainable development,

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:02.820
ecological factors,
and social inclusion.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.290
Let's try.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:17.250
Right. So this is the website,
SuAVE.sdc.edu, and you can see

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.020
that there's a gallery, there
are news, there are blogs

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.280
and a few other common
elements of a website.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:31.670
If you go to news and search for
SDG's, there will be an application

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.430
that deals with SDG indicators.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:41.990
You see that what I have
here is a collection

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.960
of flags for each country.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:54.340
You can look at different
types of representations.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.830
Maps and so on.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.730
I can map by, let's say,
Sustainable Development Goal rank.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.480 position:56%
So all countries are ranked in terms

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.960
of how close they are
to fulfilling the goals.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:18.390 position:56%
If I look at, let's say, Sustainable
Development Goal rank and look at,

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.160
let's say, the first 40, you
would see that the best countries,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.460
in terms of closeness

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.530
to SDG indicators are
Scandinavian countries.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.660
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What is the source
of the data that each country ...

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:41.790
Do they create and generate their
own data, therefore it would seem

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:49.630
to be, probably, uneven and
inconsistent across 200 countries?

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.930
Where does this data come from?

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.230
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY:
Very good question.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.080
So it is a fairly complicated
process.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.420
There is UN statistical
commission, that compiles data

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:01.290 position:56%
from multiple sources, and of course
it has to rely on local sources,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.140
but there are multiple
verifications that happen.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.210 position:56%
The most difficult thing is to align
different measurement protocols.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.430
But, one of the key goals here
was to define such indicators

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:19.610
that will be measured more or less
unambiguously among countries.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:25.350
SDGI rank, something that I
showed, is just an average

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.640
of ranks on different goals.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.330
Does that make sense?

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.770
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Does SuAVE
normalize the data?

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.540
You said that the biggest
challenge is...

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.840
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: No.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.140
SuAVE does not do it.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.560 position:56%
People who prepare the data do that.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.390
We just take the data and make
it accessible and easy to use.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.470
Okay. So, here you can...

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.930
So, these are 40 countries that
happen to be in good shape.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.240
This is where they are on the map,
if you are interested in countries

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.010 position:56%
that are at the end of the spectrum.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.580
That's their locations.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.040
And this is how they
are distributed by rank.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.260
But in the same fashion you can
look at, you see that there are

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:23.670
about 90 indicators here,
not the 469 or so indicators

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.390 position:56%
that have been proposed, many of
these indicators are very difficult,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.180
actually, to compile
information for.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.780
So even those indicators

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.690
that we have here do not have
complete coverage sometimes.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:41.610
Okay? You can look at,
let's say, poverty below ...

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:52.530
percent of people who live on $1.90
per day - percent of those people.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:59.050
So this has a fairly complete
coverage, but poverty rate,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:04.530
these are only countries for which
poverty rate has been estimated.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.910
So, it's not even.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.520
It's, I should say,
a work in progress.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.280
What I'm trying to demonstrate is
not where the data come from, also,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.430
you can click on "About
Survey" and get the information

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.390
about the source and
follow that source.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.090
But to show what the
software can do.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:34.530
So, for example, sorry
about this, and...

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:44.060
You are looking at ...

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.350
One interesting characteristics
is subjective well-being.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.710
Let's look at it.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:56.440 position:56%
That was estimated based on surveys
and it runs on a scale from 0 to 10,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.480
so you can see how
countries are distributed.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.780
It would be interesting to see

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.620
if subjective well-being
is actually how it relates

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.570
to objectively-measured
variables, right?

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.890
You can look at, let's say,

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:17.700
subjective well-being
versus, for example, poverty.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.760
And you would see that it's
not, of course, a diagonal.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.830
There are lots of outliers
on both sides.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:30.980
There are countries where
populations subjectively think

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.750
that they're in good shape,
but poverty level may be high

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.050
and the other way around.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.440
So if you look at these
countries, for example,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:45.210
this is where poverty
level is fairly low

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:51.810
but subjective well-being
is also quite low.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:27:01.140
These are Cambodia,
Gabon, Bulgaria, Sri Lanka,

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:08.990
so some of these countries
experienced unrest in recent years

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.940
or have been in the shadow
of some larger metropolis

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:19.360
and that may contribute to lower
values of subjective well-being.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.750
So there may be multiple
explanations

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.320
that you can develop here.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.480
I would probably just invite
you to play with the data,

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.970
because I will try to show
you that it's very easy

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.270
to play with the data and see.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.570
Yeah?

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.240
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I have played
around a little bit ...

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.310
I didn't find this one, but
I saw some of a similar one

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.610
and played around with it.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.740
Is there a way in here
to look at the raw data?

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.820
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.120
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Yes.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.040
So the question is, is it
possible to look at the raw data?

00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:00.700
So, again, if I go to about
data and click on this link,

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:09.200
it will open another webpage
where I got the data from.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.080
And there you can get to the
actual spreadsheet and look

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.210 position:56%
at the methodological description
and see, in the metadata statements,

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.740
where this data came from
and how they were computed.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:29.510
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: And I was looking
at it, thinking about how to play

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:36.500
around with it with my own data,
so is that something you'll talk

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.800
about in your [crosstalk]

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.100
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Right now.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.400
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yay!

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.700
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Okay.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.000
And I also have my slides here.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.300
Yeah, so, I'll do this in just ...

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.440
It will be the demo
after the next one.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.340
So the idea is, as I said, totally
different from what I've been doing

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.490
in my regular research is how to
make your data accessible and how

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:02.200
to make it easy and fun
and engaging to work with.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.280
How many of you have
answered surveys?

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.580
Any types of surveys.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.880
At work, at ...

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:14.250
How many of you have ever tried to
access the results of these surveys

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:20.050
or have seen the results of these
surveys or tried to not just ...

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:25.080
Sometimes results come back
as documents, as pie charts,

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.070
and bar charts, but if
you would want to combine

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.720
and explore the variables,
you are out of luck.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.550
And that is a very common problem.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.860
So even if you go to
a government website,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:40.320
such as National Cancer Institute,
or General Social Survey source

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:48.030
or another one, all you see here is
ability to load data in SPSS, SAS,

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:54.390 position:56%
STATA, if you are a survey analyst,
you are in luck, if you are somebody

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.830
who is just interested in
exploring the data yourself,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.570
it may be problematic.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:08.530
So, this is an example of how you
can do surveys using the same data

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.380 position:56%
that you can download from the site.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.440
So, this is General Social Survey.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.950
Probably some of you
have heard of that.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.710
That is a survey that is
very important in the US.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:23.560
It's been run by the National
Opinion Research Center since 1972.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.300
Every 2 years on average,
there's an additional survey,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.610
and people answer all sorts
of different questions

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.080
about different types of ...

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:49.300
I think I should actually
have it open somewhere.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.600
No? No. Okay.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.900
It opened.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.420
Typically when you analyze
surveys, you work with tables,

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.630
you work with charts, right?

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.820
Here, the visual paradigm
is totally different.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:10.310
Each respondent is an icon and
you just observe how these people,

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.460
these icons, form groups.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.680
You can zoom in to
any person and see how

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.600
that person responded to questions.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.730
You can have a few
additional visual dimensions.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.800
So here, we know that
it's a white woman.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:36.610
So you can specify your
icons to be representative

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:41.460
of certain variables you select
such as race, and gender,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:47.110
or it could be other
variables, it's your choice.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.440
Let's try to do some analysis here.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.200
So one of the questions was about
happiness, general happiness.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.570
Let's look at how people response

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.650
to about your level
of general happiness.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:09.170
We see that 26% of people
say that they are very happy.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:13.640
Let's try to explain that based on
some factors and we can try income,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.760
we can try other things
that have been asked here,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.120
or we can try a level of education.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.960
Let's see, highest tier
of school completed.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.060
Let's say 15 years and more.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.950
That increases your level of
education somewhat from 26 ...

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:39.070
Your level of happiness,
sorry, from 26% to 31%.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:44.970
You can compute the contribution
of this factor, so that's 5%.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:50.830
In fact, this is somewhat similar
to a regression model but based

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.730
on mixed data where you
just compute contributions

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.810
of different factors
in the explanation.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.600
In this case, explanation of
behavior saying very happy

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.100
in response to this question.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.500
Interestingly, you can ...

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.280
There are several questions
about education.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.140
If you look at highest tier of
education completed by spouse,

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.390
actually, your level of happiness
will be significantly higher.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:30.240
So now we have 44% saying
they're very happy as compared

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.750
to previous 31, so this
contribution here is 18%.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.390 position:56%
And we can try to analyze it further

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.090
and see how it is different
by gender, or how ...

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.690
Actually, the first question
probably should be qualified by age

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.040
and marital status, because then
we can really compare these things.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:54.560
But you can see that analysis
becomes quite simple here,

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.970
you just add additional factors.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:06.860 position:56%
So let's just say, that would be age
and gender, and there are all sorts

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:13.970
of factors here, so for one group
it will go in one direction,

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:20.270
for females it will go
in different direction

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.700
and I will let you interpret
the results yourself.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.650
So, now, how you get your
own data into the system?

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:40.810
Let's say, I have a data
set that sits on my desktop

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:47.250
and it's just a CSV file that
is a survey of geoscientists

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.050
who were asked about
300 or so questions

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:56.060 position:56%
about how they use different types
of data, how they use data developed

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.370
by others, what kind
of challenges they have

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.530
when they need to use
data and so on.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.800
We can open this data set
in Excel and you will see

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:13.910
that this is a very standard Excel
file that just has questions,

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.720
has columns and these
are respondents.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.660
There are 1500 or so people.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.930
So it's fairly easily formatted.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.420
Now, when you create an
account in SuAVE, you get ...

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.950
yeah, this is my account and I have

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.930
about 88 different
surveys in this account.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.590
Once you create an account, you
will have a gallery like that,

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.520
but it will be empty initially.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.440
So if you want to add a survey,
you just say, new survey,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.760
point to this file which is

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:56.110
on the desktop that's
here, and give it a name.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:02.490
Whatever you see survey.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.040
That's it.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.830
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Who owns the data
once you've uploaded onto SuAVE?

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.720
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY:
Actually, you own the data,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.840
and I'll show you in a second.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.590
So this is your personal gallery.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:20.050
For most people, I don't
know what they put there,

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:26.630
I just check the storage,
because you can specify this data

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:31.460
to be private and then it will not
show up in your gallery for others.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.540
It will still show up for you to
manage this, but when others come

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.750
to your gallery, they
will not see it.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.740
Right. So we created this survey.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.320
You can already analyze it now.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.430
But it's not really that much fun,

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:51.560 position:56%
because remember we can also
associate a shape and color of icons

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.320
with some variables and that will
make it somewhat more interesting.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.880
So initially it's just the
default, but everything

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.630 position:56%
that you wanted to do is already ...

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.350
Population is already here.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:12.380
So let's close that and make
it look more interesting,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:20.760
so I will have a gender, I will
have male and female silhouettes.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:30.060
So gender, it will parse the
file, and suggest icons for me.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:39.250
Okay. I can also say that colors
will reflect primary discipline.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.460
Let's say we have geoscientists and
computer scientists in that survey,

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.420
and those who said that they're
both geo- and computer scientists.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.080
You can change colors,
and I'm gonna do that now.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.340
And then you can also
specify what will show

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:57.360
up as a dynamic text
over each person.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.520
So when you zoom in, you will
actually get more information

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.820
about that.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:07.250
So let's do my primary role here.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.750
When you submit it, it
should update the survey

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:19.110
and now you will have a somewhat
better way of looking at it

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.580
and also sharing it with others.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:26.980
So it's much easier than trying to
figure out how you can find a tool

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.010
that will read SPSS
file or STATA file.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:37.050
So here you can look
at distributions.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.880
Let's say how people answered
questions about the importance

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.310
of different types of data.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:55.730
And so, how important
atmospheric data for you.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:01.200
So that's a distribution.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:06.040
So you may hypothesize that if you
are atmospheric science person,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:11.150
then atmospheric science data
will be important for you,

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.700
which will be generally correct.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:21.810
Right. So I'm just
subsetting this for people

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:28.230
who declare themselves atmospheric
scientists, except for one person,

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:32.910
who says that the data in his
domain are of low importance.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:38.050
I think we can actually click
on this guy and see who that is.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:43.680
I mean, not who that is, but how
that person answered questions

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.530
and tried to explain
why it happened.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.440
So this is a way to zoom in from
overall picture to deviant cases

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.830
and kind of make this
observation of,

00:39:54.830 --> 00:40:00.340
transition from your general
view to view of a single,

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.980
small group, very smooth and easy.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.570
And then if you are interested in
this pattern, let's say you want

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.970
to share it with your coworkers,
you have a distributed group,

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:18.890
then you would say,
"comment on this,

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:25.690
look at this interesting
behavior on the left."

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.230
Right? So you can save
this annotation

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:37.550
and then you can share this
annotation with others.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.150
So you just click share and
that will generate a link

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:47.140
that you can put on your Facebook
or send to your coworkers or put

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.140
in an email and then when
users click on that link,

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.750
they will open this same view

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.590
and can take exploration
in other directions.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:04.190
So, that answers your
question somewhat.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.490
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.480
Thank you very much.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.020
Would you mind also [inaudible].

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.320
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Yes.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.820
So. Right.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:17.860
In this survey, I don't
have location information.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.400
If I would have latitude and
longitude as two columns,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:30.710
then I would just click the map
here and it will show me a map.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:36.550
If I don't have latitude and
longitude but I have address,

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.730
I will specify that this
is address information

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.680
and I do believe it will geocode
on the fly and create a map,

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.680
so there are two ways to do that.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.980
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: To me, It looks

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.200
like it's a very powerful
system for describing data.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.650
Is there also a component
that would account for some

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:58.620
of the statistical power, the
statistical properties of surveys

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:03.670
or different types
of survey designs?

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.970
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Right.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:10.390
So the question is can this
system be made more traditionally

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:14.550
statistically powerful?

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:18.300
And the answer is, somewhat ...

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.470
Well, of course, it's a yes,

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.950
but it's actually a
little bit more complex.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:28.530
We are trying to develop, to
make it such that visualizations

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:33.320
and statistical measures go hand
in hand and reinforce each other.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.760
When we compute traditional
statistics, quite often,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.120
they would not have that clear
visual expressions compared

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.370
to increments or decrements
of conditional frequencies.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:52.000
So those changes in conditional
frequencies, which generally is

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.720 position:56%
on the fly on the client side, as I
showed in the table of rules before,

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:02.960
where you can compute contributions
of selected factors to explanation.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.340
We also have a connection with "r".

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.050
So. I'll show you in a second ...

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:13.110
If I would ...

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:17.860
Oh, yes. So, here, I can also
say that I want to include "r"

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:25.680
and it will include an icon on the
right that will allow me to call

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.400
"r" via our open CPU interface
and pass variables that I defined

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.700
as independent variables

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.940
and dependent variables
to "r" to compute.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.210
In this case, we have
enabled logic, pro fit

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:42.310
and log-linear models
but can be done.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:45.210
Yeah. The same bridge can be used
for other types of computations.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.100
Does that answer?

00:43:48.100 --> 00:44:00.870
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Do you think you
can verify a little after, again?

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.170
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Right.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:09.390 position:56%
So we have applications in different
areas and since I promised you

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.480
at least Picasso, I'll
have time for Picasso

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.800
and then we might have to wrap-up.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:26.890
You may go to the web page
and you would find, actually,

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.430
a bunch of galleries of artists.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:37.850
So I have Picasso, Van
Gogh, Dali, Balthus, Bosch,

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.760
Rivera, and a few others.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.630
So, let's look at Picasso.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.390
And this really demonstrates
the power

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:51.560
of doing exploration
with visual images.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.420
So these are paintings.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:00.640
And as you see, as you zoom in,
you get higher resolution versions.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.020
You have heard, I'm sure, of
different periods in his life,

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.960
like blue period, pink period,
African period, and others.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.180
Let's try to detect these periods.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:17.380
So, I would turn on
paintings that have been done

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:22.290
at the turn of the century.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.730
And sort this by year.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.970
And here you go.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:40.630 position:56%
Right? Indeed, towards the end of
1901, he fell into a deep depression

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:44.640
that lasted three years,
or almost four years,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:52.370 position:56%
and typically it's attributed to
his friend and fellow Spanish artist

00:45:52.370 --> 00:46:00.140
who lived in Paris and was a
good friend, Carlos Casagemas,

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.510
he committed suicide, and so,

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:06.510
Picasso went through
some very dark times.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.580
And most of the paintings
are also ...

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:17.310
The subjects are beggars
and all sorts of ...

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:23.350
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: How did you get the
data to describe the paintings?

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:29.320
Is it input metadata, or
is it a visual software

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.920
that visually analyzes the colors?

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.220
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY:
Very good question.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.520
Both ways.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.920
I work with several art historians.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.730
They sent me data.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.770
So, for example, the Van Gogh data
set, it came from Lev Manovich

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:46.120
who works in New York,
and he's director

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.100
of Software Studies Initiative
and also practicing artist.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.800
So he studies so-called
style-spaces.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:01.430
You can place photograph of a
painting in multidimensional space,

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:06.340
look at clusters, and see
how as artists moved from.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.820
Let's say one place to another,

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.400
whether it corresponded
to change in clusters.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.910
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Based on what?

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:18.310
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Yes, based
on brightness, hue, saturation,

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:22.370
plus other things that
you get from the picture.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:23.990
Other things become more difficult.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.950
Brightness, hue, saturation
is fairly easy to get

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.250
and this is what we
have in Van Gogh.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.610
So maybe I can show you.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.960
So, there are two ways.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.170
There are actually
more than two ways.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.890
One is to pre-compute some
of these measures based

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:44.310
on image characteristics.

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:49.720
Another is let people come to
this application and annotate it

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.690
in the way I showed you
and they would be able

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:57.780
to capture some more information.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.120
And then, we also have a system

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.630
where people have been
annotated based on forms,

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:10.330
so that the information goes
directly, goes back into SuAVE

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:13.430
and people can analyze
it immediately.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.570
Does that answer your question?

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.870
Right. So, in the future,
we are planning

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:21.570
to have a somewhat more advanced
system where people will be able

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.990
to define, themselves, what
kind of additional attributes

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:29.680
of pictures they would want to
extract and bring into an analysis.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.060
For now, it's done outside
the visual interface.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.800
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you have
some animal locomotion there?

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:41.460
When I first came into the
room, that was on the screen.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.890
There were horses running and I
wondered if you had worms crawling

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.870
and turtles going and what all.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.370
And I thought I saw
our animals there.

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.730
But you don't.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.740
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY:
I don't have horses.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.830
I have tigers.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.130
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.620
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: So, it's been
used for camera trap images.

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.360
And you can look at a
collection of images and,

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.420
let's say, tigers or onkas or ...

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.060
And see at what ...

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.810
It all depends on what
metadata you have.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:17.570
You can see at what times
of day they are active

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.380
or at what temperatures
they tend to show up

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:25.900 position:56%
and it's actually interesting to
compare it across different species.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:31.390
I also have examples from
a system called iNaturalist

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:39.410
where people contribute their
photographs of what they observe

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:45.160
in their yards and that goes into a
large image archive with metadata.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.780
So I have some examples with that.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.540
Not with horses, no.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.680
Yes, and I have one last
slide, I think that will...

00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.600
Yeah, so the types of applications
I more or less described,

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:08.210
I will skip that and the last slide
is, this is really an invitation

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.480
to explore what you can
do with the data yourself.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.630
It's a free system, it's
open-source system, it's supported

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:20.870
by National Science Foundation,
and you can create a login

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.430
on the system, you will
get your personal gallery,

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.490
upload your data, and play with it.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:31.360
We opened it up about 5
months ago, we have 90 users

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.140
who load their data, and
you're very welcome to do this.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:41.570
I really think that making data
easily accessible will make a

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:50.100
dramatic impact on the
this-called data revolution,

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:54.430
or make a real difference there
because it will increase the level

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:59.820
of trust that people have in
any statements based on data

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.960
and it will let people play
with the data themselves,

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.510
which is interesting.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:11.080
Thank you very much and
sorry about the difficulties.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.800
[applause]

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.100
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Questions?

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.400
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I have
another questions.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.680
Could this handle a
genuine big data set,

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.760
like computational
fluid dynamics data set?

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.090
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY:
We'll need to talk.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:28.840
So, the question is, "can this
handle very large data sets?"

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:35.950
We have interfaced it with a system
that has about 400,000 records.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:41.160
So, of course, you cannot put
400,000 dots on a single screen.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.560
The maximum we had so far was 8300.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.600
And these were images
of macrofossil samples

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.010
from British Geological Survey.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:57.610
It's a fairly large
application about 30 GB worth

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.650
of data, well I should ...

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:00.950
I can say in one screen.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:05.520
But really, at some point these
are dots and when you zoom in,

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.120
you actually get more information.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:13.600
So, with large collections, you
have to first search and come

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.790
up with some subset that
will be meaningful to display

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:20.390
in SuAVE and we've done that.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:30.300
So, if you have some specific
application in mind, we can talk.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.600
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: [inaudible]

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.900
&gt;&gt; ILYA ZASLAVSKY: Thank you.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.200
[applause]

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.630
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
