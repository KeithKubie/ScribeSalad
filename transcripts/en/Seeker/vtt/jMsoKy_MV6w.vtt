00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.279
Every travel pic that you see on your friends'
Snapchat is of a plane wing, but what do you

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.009
really know about those mechanical marvels?

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.980
And what is that little flippy thing?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.440
Hey wingbats, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.390
A Boeing 787 has over 2.3 million parts, and
workers on the 747 have to drill 1,000,000

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.450
holes during its assembly.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.900
AIRPLANES ARE COMPLICATED.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.630
Aircraft companies are constantly working
to update how they design and build these

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.770
massive machines.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.350
They have to fly for decades, take off and
land constantly (a 737 takes off somewhere

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.490
on Earth every 2 seconds) and of course, be
smooth and comfy; that's important too.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.850
For me though, when I see an airplane I see
an aerodynamic tube with wings hooked on the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.850
bottom.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.850
Simple.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.850
But, in reality…

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.480
We put a lot of time and energy into make
sure the wing body goes on correctly and that

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.370
there are zero defects.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.260
That's Kay Keovongphet.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.270
She is a supervisor at the Boeing 737 manufacturing
factory in Renton, Washington.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.900
It's approximately a 12 hour process
] The wing body joint is the heartbeat of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.460
the final assembly and if the wings don't
get attached, the airplane doesn't move to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.600
the next flow day.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.320
This factory builds 42 airplanes every month
-- that's more than one plane every day -- but

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.700
they still spend 12 hours to attach the wings
to the fuselage -- that’s the place where

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700
you sit.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.260
That's how solid they fit in there.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.350
Todd Gray, engineering team leader at Boeing's
Renton factory is one of the people in charge

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.450
of this process.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.530
They just slide into the center wing box.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.510
Uh, and then are fastened with about uh, 1600
bolts.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.119
At this point, the two wings and the base
of the airplane essentially become a single

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.310
piece, with that fuselage riding on top of
them!

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.120
That's right, the wings aren't on the side
of the plane, they're on the bottom.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.490
And not only are they on the bottom, (called
a low-wing) but they angle up slightly, called

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.630
a "dihedral."

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.150
Wings with a high dihedral make for a more
inherently stable airplane.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.509
Basically, if the pilot let go of the controls,
inherently stable planes return to normal

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.020
flight more easily.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.390
But where to put the wings is more of a design
thing --

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.469
lower wings put engines and wings closer to
maintenance, while

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:12.689
high wings allow trucks to drive underneath,
and the fuselage to be right on the ground

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.450
to make it easy to load.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.629
And while we're looking at that wing, think
about its shape.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.900
Wings are designed in a few different configurations:
[

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.999
Rectangular, Elliptical, Swept and Delta.

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:28.129
According to NASA (the first A is for Aeronautical
after all), the "go to" for powered jet flight

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.909
is the SWEPT wing.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.480
Swept wings have less drag and work better
at high altitude, but need more power to lift

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.480
the plane.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.099
The 737, like pretty much all commercial jets,
use the swept-wing designs.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.049
Modern airplane wings are more or less like
the wings from history;

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.239
they have a backbone, called a spar, ribs
and stringers to give them shape, and control

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.590
surfaces that change the shape of the wing
to give it more lift or drag.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.480
Also stuffed in there are the fuel tanks!

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.019
But, not all wings are created equal.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.870
When in flight, air is flowing around the
wing beautifully -- except around the wingtip.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.419
The tip of the wing creates little vortices,
pushing up and down on the end of those wing

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.230
-- making it less efficient.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.739
So now, you'll see wings with this flipped-up
wingtip, called a winglet, which keep the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.769
air pressing up on the wing!

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.319
They're really there for fuel efficiency,
so we get an extra few percent of fuel burn

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.049
uh, on the airplane with that performance
of the wing tip.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.049
That's right.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.370
With the amount of flights that these things
fly, you know, in the amount of a month or

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.999
a year uh, that adds up to big dollars for
our airline customer.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.739
Since a quarter of all the airplanes in all
of the fleets of the world are Boeing 737s,

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.029
engineers and mechanics have a huge amount
of data on the stresses and safety of these

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.029
airplanes.

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.029
And they're still improving!

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.029
They just started putting winglets on all
the planes a few years ago!

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.930
