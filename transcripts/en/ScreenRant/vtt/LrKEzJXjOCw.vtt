00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.730
It’s easy for any movie fan to remember
their favorite performances of all time.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.340
Great acting efforts like Heath Ledger in
The Dark Knight, Jennifer Lawrence in Silver

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.840
Linings Playbook or Leo in The Wolf Of Wall
Street are always fresh in our minds.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.130
Unfortunately, sometimes the most terrible
performances can be just as easy to remember

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.029
and can totally change the way that we look
at an otherwise well respected actor.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.930
For this video we are taking a look at some
of the worst in our list of 10 Amazing Actors

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.329
With Bad Performances You Just Can't Forget.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.350
Robert De Niro as Dick in Dirty Grandpa (2016)
For decades, Robert De Niro has been on of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.010
the most revered actors working in Hollywood
with amazing performances in films like Raging

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.109
Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and so many
more.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.540
In recent years, De Niro has made some odd
choices, opting for comedies and more light

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.170
hearted movies and for the most part his performances
have still be okay.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.760
That was until 2016 brought the world the
movie Dirty Grandpa which showcased Robert

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.480
De Niro hitting rock bottom.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.770
In the movie, the Academy Award winning actor
plays a widowed old man trying to have sex

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.500
with a college aged girl.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.010
The movie is full of crude humor that really
misses the mark and it really was a shame

00:01:25.010 --> 00:02:47.480
to see such a great actor stoop so low.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.730
Colin Farrell as Bullseye in Daredevil (2003)
There are about a million bad things that

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.930
can be said about the 2003 movie adaptation
of Daredevil.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.120
Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are famously
bad in their roles and we are sure people

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.600
are happy that Netflix has recently provided
Daredevil with an adaptation worth of it’s

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600
hero.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.650
With everything else bad going on in the 2003,
it can be easy to forget just how bad Colin

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.390
Farrell’s portrayal of the villain Bullseye
was.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.450
Not only did he look super weird, Farrell
seemed to make all the wrong acting choices

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.350
and the character felt cheesy and fake.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.760
It’s not like this was a terrible performance
in an otherwise great movie so we can understand

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.670
why people have forgiven him.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.290
Russell Crowe as Javert in Les Miserables
(2012)

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.891
Les Miserables is arguably the most famous
Broadway musical of all and the 2012 film

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.270
adaptation got a lot of things right.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.170
Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were great
in leading roles and the live singing turned

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.260
out to be a great choice to preserve the authenticity
of the film.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.319
The one aspect that really drags the movie
down is Russell Crowe’s luke warm performance

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.200
as the antagonist, Javert.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.810
Not only is Crowe a very low energy character,
his poor singing stands out like a sore thumb.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.750
When the movie came out, Crowe was seriously
ridiculed and it took a few years for him

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.750
to fight back from this poor performance.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.240
Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka in Charlie and
the Charlie Factory (2005)

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.720
There was a time when Johnny Depp was pumping
out quality acting performances every year,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.830
but those days seem to be long done.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.470
Depp has given us amazing performances in
movies like Pirates Of The Caribbean and Edward

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.470
Scissorhands.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.239
In recent years, Depp has turned in some pretty
dreadful performances but the one that sticks

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.389
out the most is his utterly creepy turn as
Willy Wonka in the 2005 adaptation of Charlie

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.469
and The Chocolate Factory.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.389
Depp’s attempt at the beloved character
wasn’t just bad, it actually tainted the

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.920
memory of Gene Wilder, who famously played
the role in expert fashion.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920
Halle Berry as Catwoman in Catwoman (2004)
After Halle Berry took home the Academy Award

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.920
for Best Actress in 2002, it seemed like her
career was set to skyrocket to truly monumental

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.920
levels.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920
Then, along came an infamously horrendous
film called Catwoman.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
This one wasn’t all Berry’s fault, but
her inauthentic and weird portrayal of the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.920
titular character definitely didn’t help.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920
This movie/performance has been showing up
on lists of worst superhero movies for years

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.920
now and it will take a lot of bad movies to
knock it out of contention.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.920
Other than an X-men film, Berry hasn’t done
much notable since but she will be appearing

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920
in the Kingsman sequel in 2017.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920
Here’s hoping that she won’t be wearing
a weird leather outfit this time…

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.920
Nicolas Cage In 'The Wicker Man' (2006)
Let’s face it, Nicolas Cage's days of being

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920
a respected actor are long behind him and
lately he is more commonly considered a joke

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920
these days.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920
He’s turned in some laughably bad performances,
but none were quite as bad as his role in

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
2006’s 'The Wicker Man.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920
The movie was all wrong from top to bottom
but the most notably bad part was definitely

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920
Cage’s infamously frantic Edward Malus.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.920
His performance has been ridiculed for years
and has sparked countless online memes.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920
At this point, Cage needs to just embrace
himself as a joke or get out of the game completely.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger in Black
Mass (2015)

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920
Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best and
most respected actors working today.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920
From the small screen hit, Sherlock, to the
Marvel super movie Doctor Strange, Cumberbatch

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920
has been pumping out great performances left,
right and center.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920
In 2015, however, Cumberbatch turned in a
pretty terrible performance in the Johnny

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920
Depp led Boston mob movie, Black Mass.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.659
Cumberbatch played Depp’s brother and his
character had a Boston accent, which he absolutely

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.659
butchered.

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.270
In his defense, it’s a tough dialect – especially
for a British actor, but he was definitely

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.770
the wrong guy for the part.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.900
Luckily, Black Mass was a pretty big flop
so not too many people actually got to see

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.080
Cumberbatch out of form.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.510
Hayden Christensen As Anakin in Star Wars
Prequels

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.919
It’s no secret that most fans were not very
fond of the Star Wars prequels and we are

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.699
sure that people are thankful that The Force
Awakens was generally well received.

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.069
One thing that most fans seemed to hate about
the prequel trilogy was Hayden Christensen’s

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.139
portrayal of Anakin Skywalker.

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.569
The writing wasn’t great, but Christensen
definitely did do much to help, as his performance

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.479
was both whiny and creepy.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.379
After the movies, the actor received an unbelievable
amount of backlash, so we can understand why

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:48.650
he decided to stay out of the spotlight going
forward.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.479
January Jones as Emma Frost in X-Men First
Class (2011)

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.219
Anyone who has watched Mad Men can confirm
that January Jones is indeed a talented actress

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.910
as she was fantastic in the role of Betty
Draper.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.849
Unfortunately for Jones, the same definitely
cannot be said about her performance as Emma

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.120
Frost in X-Men: First Class.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.949
Jones is very boring in the role and the movie
only really uses her for her sex appeal, putting

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.139
her in weird revealing costumes.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.800
This performance was just a small misstep
for January Jones as her career has continued

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.930
well since.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.780
The X-Men franchise has made some serious
missteps over the years, and this one was

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.839
just another on that long list.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.639
Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie White in Carrie
(2013)

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.719
Chloe Grace Moretz is one of the best examples
of a child actor successfully aging into a

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.619
mature adult actor without succumbing to the
traps of a young burnout.

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:40.680
Over the years she has proven that she can
do it all from horror, to action to comedy

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.479
and for the most part she has been very good
in her films.

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.650
Unfortunately, at the ripe old age of 19,
Chloe already has one performance that is

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.930
a real stinker.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.669
In the 2013 film, Carrie, Moretz plays the
titular character and her portrayal is less

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:54.669
than memorable.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.279
To be fair, the entire film is pretty bad
and we have to think that Chloe (and her co-star

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:06.569
Julianne Moore) probably regret deciding to
star in this flic.

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.509
So there you have it, there’s our list of
ten great actors who turned in some absolutely

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.249
dreadful performances.

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:15.229
Which one of these acting efforts do you think
was the worst?

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:23.900

your gears?
