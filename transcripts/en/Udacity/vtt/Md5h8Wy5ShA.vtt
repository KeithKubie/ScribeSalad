00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.830
I hope you didn't get tripped up by this question. The answer is a fast ADH

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.410
and a slow ALDH2. Think about it. A fast ADH means we're going to go right

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.330
from ethanol to acetaldehyde. We're going to have

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.840
a quick buildup of acetaldehyde. I'm going to slow

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.830
ALDH2 or reduced activity ALDH2, means that we're

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.820
going to be really slow at moving from acetaldehyde

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.250
to acetic acid. So it's going to be the biggest buildup here. Now the opposite

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.380
of that, a slow ADH and a

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.140
fast ALDH2 would actually minimize the acetaldehyde intermediate

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.500
and have the least severe alcohol flush. Whereas having a fast ADH and a fast

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.560
ALDH2 or having both enzymes have a

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.950
reduced activity would be somewhere in the middle.
