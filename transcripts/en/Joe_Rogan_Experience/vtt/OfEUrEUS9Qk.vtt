WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.080
These are pretty cool. And we're live. Hello Steve? Yeah, that's the Kanye one.

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.420
That's the most recent. That's a Skype plasta cell. Phong Tran. He uh,

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.020
creates all these, he hand paints each one. They're really not. Yeah,

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.910
he sculpted. It makes like a mold. And then he's got a bunch of dope ones.

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.470
It's all on his line. And you've got a book bro. I do call it noise blue.

6
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:26.840
The color of noise. Yeah. What's this about?

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.630
<v 0>It's my memoir. It's um, uh,</v>

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.950
talks about the beginnings, um,

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.720
goes through my process. It goes through a lot of different things. I mean,

10
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.900
at the end of the day I spend more, so it's more about,

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.200
it's less about what's happening now and more about like how I got there,

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.850
you know, the story and different piecemeals stories that,

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.990
that are thematic and you know, with this overarching idea of blue,

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.440
which is like the different shades of blue of my life, it's my favorite color.

15
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.090
And actually my last name is means blue tree. Really? Yeah.

16
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.540
Yeah. So it's like there's a lot of synergy with the color.

17
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.350
So when I was coming up with the idea to name the book,

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.740
you know, I had to think of like, uh, you know,

19
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.110
something that relates throughout my whole life.

20
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.480
So there's so many different shades, emotions,

21
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.130
feelings that are represented and all of these different stories.

22
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.750
Do you, have you always been a writer? Um, I'm like, uh, yeah,

23
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.950
I guess like a piecemeal writer, you know, I, I needed help finishing this book.

24
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.310
There's no doubt about it. I had so much. It's like, you know,

25
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:42.180
cause I still like, you know, have the pen and paper is still, you know,

26
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:46.320
like I grew up before, before computers and all that stuff. I was,

27
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.910
when I was writing, uh, lyrics for my bands, I was always like a notepad.

28
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.790
So I had just so many different stories.

29
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.730
I didn't know how to put it all together. Um,

30
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.890
I started the inception of writing, you know, the,

31
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.560
these different stories of my life six years ago.

32
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.930
And then I shot a documentary for Netflix and uh, we dropped it called,

33
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.930
it's called asleep and I'm dead. We dropped it three years ago, four years ago,

34
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.770
2015 to 16, I think. And I and I,

35
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.220
after I saw the reception on and how people responded to the doc,

36
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.790
then I knew that like, you know, this is really going to take shape.

37
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.740
Is it gonna be front centers finishing and,

38
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.190
and writing them a proper Memorial.

39
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.071
<v 1>So the,</v>

40
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:34.550
the idea of writing a memoir is only the idea of writing and writing about

41
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:36.110
yourself is only to write this memoir.

42
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.270
You sound like you write on a regular basis. No,

43
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.670
<v 0>no, no. I mean, you know,</v>

44
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:45.350
like I am actually coming up with some new ideas for the next, you know,

45
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:50.270
conception of what I would put out there in book form because it's a different

46
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:54.680
process for me that's quite exciting just to like the challenge to do something

47
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:55.610
like this. Cause I'm,

48
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.040
my natural way to express myself is through music and um,

49
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.730
and I love being able to step outside my comfort zones.

50
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.940
I think at the end of the day when you do that enough, you just,

51
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.170
you just get better as a human being and try, you know,

52
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.180
if you always do the same thing over and over again,

53
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.000
you're never really learning. So it's a,

54
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.850
it's been like a great learning process, you know,

55
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:22.060
putting out this memoir and uh, and, and,

56
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.890
and like actually opening up.

57
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.450
There's a vulnerable side to who I am that I, I don't necessarily,

58
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.300
I don't talk about really, you know, like for people that know me,

59
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:34.690
like my fans or my music fans or anyone else that know Stevie. Okay.

60
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.720
They don't really know what's in this book. You know,

61
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.820
they might have a glimpse of it from a documentary,

62
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.900
which I did because I talk really deeply about my relationship with my father

63
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:44.710
and,

64
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.030
and like this drive that I have as a kid to make it.

65
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.990
And uh, and it shows you enough where it's like, okay,

66
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.280
now I have a little bit more than my live shows and what's already out there.

67
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.690
But this goes, you know,

68
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440
obviously a lot deeper because it's a book and we're going through emotions and

69
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:05.150
the vulnerability and, and um, and I,

70
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.170
I want to tell the stories of the hardships and at the end of the day,

71
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:12.430
I want to speak to young kids out there yet young people out there,

72
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.580
even the older people that are trying to figure their own thing out and,

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.520
and because the documentary related in so many ways,

74
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.340
on a personal level that I shared there,

75
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.640
this is how I wanted to share that through my own words.

76
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.340
<v 2>Do you find that writing these things down and just thinking about your life</v>

77
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.810
and,

78
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.810
and trying to express it in a way that's gonna resonate with people,

79
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.060
that this helps you think about it and helps you sort of a categorize it and put

80
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:46.850
it all in your head and cause do you know anyone? Do you know who that is? Yeah.

81
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.070
Yeah. Famous chef. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. He's a friend of mine,

82
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.360
great guy and writes every day. And I asked him why. I'm like, why,

83
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.640
why are you writing? Because he's written books, but he's,

84
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.590
he writes to sort of collect his own thoughts. Yes. Yeah. 100%. Yeah.

85
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.720
<v 0>It's like once you, that's the trigger for me because even when I read,</v>

86
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.170
I write right after, like what I gained from it. I'll almost like this,

87
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:13.080
like my note, my a homework. Yeah. For retention on,

88
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:15.440
on what I gather a takeaway from what I'm reading.

89
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.640
So I'm always like reading and writing or writing, scribbling in my,

90
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:23.170
in my book or, or like writing off the side and a note patter.

91
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.610
Like now I was like, you know, I look like a tablet or something.

92
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.450
But it's like you need to gather your, your,

93
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.470
your head space so you have retention.

94
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.700
<v 2>Yeah. You right to understand, right? Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.120
And then the right to express it so that other people can understand.

96
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.110
And in that process you kind of understand yourself better. Right.

97
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.710
[inaudible] sort of, Eddie described it and when he said it to me, I was like,

98
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.950
God damn. And I don't write enough like that. I write more comedy stuff.

99
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.430
I try and write material and essays on things and pull jokes out of them.

100
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.150
But like I think there's probably a great benefit for anybody to just sort of

101
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.750
write about your thoughts dear diary, you know, just that you know,

102
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.570
I mean there's something to that because in that time,

103
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.910
I mean you could speak to this because you've written a book on yourself,

104
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.710
but in that time of writing about yourself and reflecting upon your life,

105
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:13.970
you probably learn a little bit about who you are and why you're the way you

106
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:14.450
are.

107
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.880
<v 0>Yeah. And you know, thinking about this,</v>

108
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:21.330
I never really thought about it to this point or found the,

109
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.101
the parallel here,

110
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:26.660
but when I started seeing a therapist to go into my past and try to break down

111
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.494
what,

112
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.390
like why make the decisions I do or like why I spiral out here or do something

113
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.070
that I am not comfortable with or I want to change. A lot of that I'm able,

114
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.190
like after the sessions I go and start writing, you know,

115
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.180
and then a lot of that, you know, eventually makes it in the book.

116
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.960
Do you run long hand or do you write on a keyboard? I, I would do both now.

117
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:52.880
I do both, but like I have scribbles of stuff everywhere, you know?

118
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.190
But then I made like at the end of the day for organizational purposes,

119
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.160
it's just gotta go in. Like I gotta do put it in a computer, you know? But,

120
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.410
um, yeah, this is a very, this is my own therapy. You know,

121
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.430
as you could say, it's like,

122
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.880
it is putting all these stories and these memories and the feelings and the

123
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.510
emotions and the hardships or whatever it might be. You know,

124
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.750
it's like, I think the hardest part is like picking the right ones, you know,

125
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.790
the end of the day

126
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.510
<v 2>when you put all this stuff together and you spend so much time on this,</v>

127
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:30.530
do you find that the process of that in any way enhances your music?

128
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.820
<v 0>Yes, it does. Because I mean, when I think about,</v>

129
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.410
first of all, I think about the process of making music. I think about it,

130
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.850
a very simple, similar to what you're doing when you're,

131
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.600
when you write for your comedy skits and you're efficient, you're like,

132
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:52.680
okay this is going to work cause I want to be able to share it this way.

133
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.690
You know, just writing your thoughts down. Right?

134
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.390
So like when I'm in the studio, I'm very efficient. You know, I'm like,

135
00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.440
I'm going and going, I'm going to make a club thing or just for the festivals.

136
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:05.280
So the crowds go crazy and it's less about the emotional message.

137
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.350
You know what with this, being able to talk about that side, that's,

138
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.720
that adds that other layer that that I'm,

139
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.480
I'm seeing now more than ever in the last like three or four years when I

140
00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:23.180
started making songs with lyrics that actually, you know, I've, you know,

141
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.870
seen the fans come out and drove saying how much it's gotten them gotten them

142
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:31.680
through hard times because the lyrics were able to speak to them in a certain

143
00:08:31.681 --> 00:08:35.430
way. So it's, and that's the essence of collaboration at the end of the day,

144
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.790
you know, working with songwriters and singers and,

145
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.390
and being able to be pulled in that direction is incredible. As an artist,

146
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:44.700
you know, instead of just having like, all right,

147
00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:47.730
we're making this record to make everyone go crazy,

148
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:52.170
even though essentially electronic dance music is all about the music. Yeah.

149
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.230
It's not about, you know, the touching lyrics.

150
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.340
They might be like the flavoring on top, but the,

151
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:02.130
the foundation is all about the beat, you know.

152
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.320
But now it's like about mixing both worlds as much as possible, you know,

153
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:09.390
cause at the end of the day, when you think about my shows,

154
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.200
it's a very full on experience. Like when I, when I put on a show,

155
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.660
I'm trying to, like, I'm trying to come compound all the senses, you know,

156
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.220
I want it to be entertaining as hell. I want it to be fun, engaging.

157
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.450
Um, I want you to leave knowing that you saw Steve Aoki show.

158
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.170
So that's why I try to do different, unique things. Like, like, you know,

159
00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:34.020
I cake people. I don't know if you know this cake.

160
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:38.390
People at my shows take them like you hit them in the head with cakes. Yeah,

161
00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:41.930
I would say the head but yeah, but this is all consensual by the way. So

162
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.220
I'll give you those. So you know,

163
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.470
I think as you are on the stage all the time, you want to make your skits,

164
00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:54.280
do you want to make your, everything that you do unique to Joe Rogan, you know,

165
00:09:54.281 --> 00:09:57.760
like you don't want to be like, Oh yeah, he's a copy of this person.

166
00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:00.250
No one wants to be that, you know? So I'm thinking like,

167
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.420
what am I going to do that's going to be unique and different? Engaging. Um,

168
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.470
Hey, Oh, you know, like everyone's doing that. Everyone sit down,

169
00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:13.270
everyone jumped. So you know, I'm like, you know, your brain's always thinking.

170
00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:17.920
So I got an idea after a song that I really saw my label.

171
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:20.080
I have my own label and we,

172
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.220
we released this artists where the video was cakes exploding in people's faces,

173
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.450
super slow motion, high-def. Really beautiful. And then I was like,

174
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:31.330
you know what? I'm going to go to a bakery,

175
00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:36.331
I'm going to buy a cake scribble like the song on the top of the cake and let's

176
00:10:37.181 --> 00:10:41.470
just see what happens. It'll be funny little thing, you know, and I,

177
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.460
I brought the kisses 2011 mind you, so this is seven years or however long ago.

178
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:50.030
That was it, you know, long time ago, I didn't do the math anyway,

179
00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:54.370
so it was a long time ago and I walked around the front of the stage and one of

180
00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:57.040
the, one of the kids in the front, one of the guys up front was like,

181
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.520
why is he walking around the front? Like, am I supposed to like grab it?

182
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.610
And then he just starts pointing at his face and then all his friends around him

183
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:08.590
are pointing at him and the whole place was just staring and waiting and

184
00:11:08.591 --> 00:11:11.980
watching and wondering what the hell is gonna happen? So like kicked him,

185
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:16.300
we filmed it before, this is pre Instagram, put it up on YouTube. It's like,

186
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.440
I gotta do this every show. This is incredible. And then six months later,

187
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.410
people started coming out with cake. Me signs.

188
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.620
Six years later, look at the, okay, here we go. So six years later,

189
00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:33.820
like I think I've kicked over 15,000 people now. You know.

190
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:39.010
Oh my God, Jesus like gonna go crazy. You hit it right in the mug too,

191
00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:41.470
dude. Perfect shot. Well, I'll tell you, I mean, you know, it was just,

192
00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:45.620
practice makes perfect, you know? Yeah. You've thrown 15,000 kicks. I get you.

193
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.570
Get you get a feel for it. Look at her. She's dancing. Yeah. Wipe it up.

194
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.790
Let me see one more time. This is like a, that was all tra.

195
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.700
Oh my goodness. We have a cake rider. We have very specific cakes that are,

196
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.930
you know, uh, at our show you have a S it's like a special Aoki cake.

197
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.310
What is in it? The strange thing is,

198
00:12:04.311 --> 00:12:08.110
is there is like not as much cake as you would think. It's just like frosting.

199
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.090
It's just so it just explodes everywhere. So it's less bread. Yes.

200
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.250
Just so like less carbs, more sugar. Well, if you're diabetic,

201
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.930
just get out of the front row please.

202
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.240
What a crazy thing for people to enjoy. To get kicked in the face. Yeah.

203
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.930
When he was having a good fucking time. That's okay.

204
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.960
That's the most important thing at the end of the day is like my shows take me

205
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:35.530
with a bullseye. Okay. This is very normal for me to see.

206
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.900
You know, like some cases there's like 50 50 people with signs up.

207
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.790
So crazy. Look at that cake face. One of the, Oh, I'm watching my face.

208
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.740
Yeah. I mean it's just, it's a signature part of the show. It's fun.

209
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.820
It's exciting. Um, dude,

210
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:57.100
I need to go to one of your shows because everybody that I know that's been said

211
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.090
as it's wild experience, not just music, it's just there's something,

212
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.110
you're doing something transformative, you know that people come out of there,

213
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:08.650
they're just like woo, they're buzzing. Yeah, yeah, fine. That's the goal.

214
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:11.710
You know? And if I, if I feel like I'm doing that,

215
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:14.140
if I feel like I'm really having this impact,

216
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.030
then I go that not, that's why I end up doing like so many shows. Cause I,

217
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.110
on average, I'm doing about 250 shows around the world every year.

218
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.270
That is so crazy. And I do this,

219
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.980
I've done this consistently for over 12 years. So it's,

220
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.903
it's a,

221
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.290
it's not like an artist that just drops an album and then they tour like around

222
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:39.610
the world for a year or two. Like I'm on, I'm on a worldwide tour,

223
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.230
you know, every, every single year. Is that sustainable? How,

224
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.970
how's your body holding up? I need to work out a lot. Yeah.

225
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.920
You're really into health and wellness and all that stuff.

226
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:51.880
But that seems insane. Particularly with all the travel. It does. I mean,

227
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:55.210
you have to, you have to like treat yourself like an athlete, that's for sure.

228
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.190
Um, the way I think about my regiment is different, you know, and I,

229
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.790
and I'm like obsessed with, uh,

230
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.540
trying out new ideas,

231
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.280
using myself as a Guinea pig to work with different scientists,

232
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.940
sleep doctors, uh, you know,

233
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
different people in various fields that are testing new ideas to like deal with

234
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:24.920
jet lag or things that I am dealing with the, they're on the road that,

235
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.530
that can wear you down and make it not sustainable. Do you do IVs,

236
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.780
uh, like STEM cell? No. No. Like vitamin, like vitamins or anything like that?

237
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.490
Not as, no I don't, but I, you know, like I,

238
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.510
at one point I was,

239
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.830
I wasn't down the same road as Ray Kurzweil doing 250 vitamins a day,

240
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:49.240
but I was probably, you know, experimenting with about 50. Have you met him?

241
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.040
I have. He's an interesting dude. Yes. Yes. He's

242
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.480
<v 3>quite a trip behind his eyes. There's a lot going on. Yeah,</v>

243
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:59.000
absolutely. And, uh, I mean my,

244
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.400
so like I have a whole album series called neon future.

245
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.900
So I have neon future one, two,

246
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.830
and three that just came out my out my albums and each album, um,

247
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.090
I actually work with a scientist on a song. Oh wow.

248
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.860
So I had Ray Kurzweil on on one.

249
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.270
So he's talking on a song about like life expansion, life extension, um,

250
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.700
big singular, not necessarily Singletary nut,

251
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.390
but like I'm a big fan of the idea that we can live indefinitely.

252
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.220
I'm an enthusiast of that world. I might not, not definitely not an expert,

253
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:29.820
but I'm an enthusiast for sure. Yeah.

254
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.980
And I got JJ Abrams on to like an Aubrey de grey on two. Oh wow.

255
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.000
I've had moms, well, yeah. Yeah. And like I interviewed him, I went to,

256
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:42.290
I went to res Ray Kurzweil's apartment in the Bay area.

257
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.240
Yeah. Yeah. So I mean,

258
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.900
I know that we have lot of synergies on the science and tech stuff.

259
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:53.000
And three I'd bill Nye. Oh wow. And four, which is coming out next year.

260
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:58.001
I'm having my favorite author on the album that I've read so far.

261
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:01.450
So I'm very excited. Have, I, you know, I might as well now.

262
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.070
I might as well announce it here if I'm going to announce it anywhere.

263
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.700
I haven't announced it yet, but you've all heard already. Oh wow.

264
00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.270
I love that guy. Yeah. Sapiens is amazing savings. My favorite book,

265
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.450
I'm on the second one right now. Yeah. I was just finished on with Davis and uh,

266
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.190
I mean he has a very like C I think of the future very positively.

267
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.970
It's a neon future. Yeah. He doesn't think of it totally so rosy. Yeah.

268
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:25.580
But you know, I like his, I like his, uh,

269
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.880
his analysis and you know,

270
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.520
the way he's trying to understand how we've evolved or pushed out outwards.

271
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.370
Yeah. And I agree with a lot of what he's saying. Well,

272
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.110
why and why what he's saying is irrefutable.

273
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:43.400
But what's interesting is the way he sort of coalesces it,

274
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.210
the way he combines it all and you really get a sense of, wow,

275
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.900
this is what a person is like, this is how it all went down. You know,

276
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.160
he's a brilliant guy too.

277
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.040
I've seen him interviewed really fascinating character. Yeah. You know?

278
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.250
Yeah. Opry degrades a trippy dude too because he drinks so much. I know I've,

279
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.300
I've hung out with him and like, like pint after pint, I'm like, Hey man,

280
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.130
aren't you supposed to be the fucking wellness longevity guy?

281
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.420
He's so in,

282
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.980
in trenched in science that he thinks that the solutions are going to come

283
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:18.170
through the laboratory. Right. He, he,

284
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.530
I mean he doesn't seem to exercise if he does, I think he just Rose a boat.

285
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.390
Have you seen that? Like he like Rose boats around the Harbor,

286
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.690
wherever he lives in England and um, he drinks,

287
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.130
I think it's in his beard though. The boos, the beard, the beard is his,

288
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.690
his like magical wizardry. And I've actually that's against science, but,

289
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.780
but uh, yeah, he's a very interesting guy. He jumped,

290
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:42.950
I have a foam pit in my house.

291
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:46.760
He jumped in my foam pit watching 50 year old man with a beard down to his

292
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.980
blows, nipples jump into foam pit. It's actually pretty

293
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 0>cool. That is cool. A scientist as well, you know, this like, you know,</v>

294
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:58.620
it's cool that he's willing to be silly. Yeah, exactly. You know, like, and I,

295
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.250
I have a, uh, you know, have the Aoki foundation, which I'm wearing. It's,

296
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:06.060
I'm obsessed with the human brain. So all of our, um,

297
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.120
our money that we raise goes to brain research organizations,

298
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.810
brain science orgs and uh, but also like, uh,

299
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.120
or said deal with anti aging or anything that's interesting that relates to, um,

300
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.290
you know, living longer, healthier lives. And one of which is a sends org,

301
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.780
which is Aubrey's org. Have you ever heard,

302
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:27.930
you didn't know who David Sinclair's, uh, remind me,

303
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.000
<v 2>uh, he's a Harvard professor. He's on the podcast next week. Uh,</v>

304
00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:37.001
he's been on before but he is at the front of the line of anti anti-aging

305
00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:41.060
technology. And the podcast I did with him was incredible. He's a brilliant,

306
00:18:41.061 --> 00:18:44.670
brilliant guy dealing with things like NMN and you know, and uh,

307
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.300
NAD and all these different, uh,

308
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.060
drip infusions and concoctions and molecules that, uh,

309
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.350
lengthen telomeres, enhance the, you know, the,

310
00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:00.080
the body's ability to regenerate and age much slower.

311
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.730
Really, really interesting stuff.

312
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.560
<v 0>Well, the, I mean, I love that stuff. Yeah.</v>

313
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.440
<v 2>So how did you get in this?</v>

314
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.750
Because your thinking about your own mind or is this just something you've

315
00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:12.584
always been fast

316
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:17.350
<v 0>created by? I think, uh, it, it started, um,</v>

317
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.450
when after my F my father passed away seeing the death of your father,

318
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.570
he died of a, um, cancer,

319
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.910
but it started with hepatitis C from, um,

320
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.170
a boat accident he had in like the late seventies.

321
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.710
The boat accident gave him Hep-C, I don't know, happened a blood transfusion.

322
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.770
Oh wow. And then he,

323
00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.600
I mean he was surviving with Hep-C for, for decades, changed his,

324
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.830
his, um,

325
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.060
interferon and the things that were keeping him going before there's a vaccine

326
00:19:49.061 --> 00:19:53.270
or cure. This is all before then. Um, I'm not sure if there is, but, um,

327
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.100
I'm almost positive there is. But, um, yeah, I think there is, I think, yeah,

328
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.540
very expensive involved process, but that, that like hurts,

329
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:02.171
you know what I mean?

330
00:20:02.171 --> 00:20:05.620
It's like if someone dies close to you and then like something like that

331
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:09.640
happens. Yeah. So this is all happening, right.

332
00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:13.510
And I see him die and I'm also like, you know,

333
00:20:13.511 --> 00:20:17.680
I think I know about health. I'm vegetarian, you know, this, that and the other.

334
00:20:17.681 --> 00:20:20.860
I'm like sort of healthy. But after I saw him die,

335
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.280
I read books on cancer. I started reading, like try to research like,

336
00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:27.160
what could I've done to help my father?

337
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.440
And I still have people in my life that I absolutely love that I want to learn

338
00:20:32.441 --> 00:20:34.510
and share. Like my mother, like, you know,

339
00:20:34.511 --> 00:20:39.370
anyone else that's like close to me that's getting older. And um, then it just,

340
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.420
I just, I just went on this like bender, like, you know,

341
00:20:43.421 --> 00:20:47.500
reading books on anti aging and then, you know,

342
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:51.070
I'm really big scifi nut. So, if anything,

343
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:54.580
I love living between the world of science fiction and science fact and finding

344
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:59.530
out in that gray area what is going to be science fact in our,

345
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.760
you know, in our though as long as I'm alive, you know,

346
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:07.480
and there's a lot of things happening because I do agree with that, that uh,

347
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.620
that curve, that we are not moving at a linear rate, you know, we are moving,

348
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.540
I don't know if it's exponential,

349
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.920
but it's definitely between linear and exponential with technology,

350
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.590
with what we're learning in science and medicine.

351
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.360
And as I'm learning more about this stuff, my music career is also raising,

352
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.820
uh, my platform as a personality is, is also getting raised.

353
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:36.090
So then now I get to go and make a phone call to Ray and he'll answer and I

354
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:39.880
could get to meet him. And then I want to have fun too. So I'm like,

355
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.820
let's make a song. Let's do a video, let's do an interview.

356
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.420
So I created this whole neon future session so I can meet, you know,

357
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:49.780
Stanley rest in peace. Like, I got to meet him, hang out with them,

358
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:54.060
did an interview with him, took some photos. Emily, a Stanley Marvel who?

359
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.770
Stanley Marvel. Stan Stanley, the Marvel comics. Dan Lee.

360
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.030
I'm just going across the board here. Who? Stanley Marvel. But you know,

361
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:03.341
I'm like,

362
00:22:03.341 --> 00:22:06.640
I just went across the board of all the people outside of my music space that I

363
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.310
can talk to, science people, science fiction people,

364
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.350
JJ Abrams to like whoever it might be. Um, even authors of books I've read,

365
00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:17.680
like Richard Dawkins, I flew to Oxford university and I sat with him. Oh,

366
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:20.650
that's great. And, and I talked to him and he was, he was like,

367
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.430
I don't know why I'm here with you, but someone told me I should be, you know,

368
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.940
I think I'm gonna get the same response he's supposed to be coming on next

369
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.710
month. Yeah. And talk to him. Yeah. It's like you talk to him after a stroke.

370
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.750
No, this was a,

371
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.370
I remember him riding his bike to, to interview,

372
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:41.470
which is kind of cool seeing Richard Dawkins ride his bike.

373
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.650
It felt like Albert Einstein was coming at me or something. You know,

374
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:48.940
cause he's kinda like that kinda like, like he has a lawyer with him.

375
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.590
Um, yeah he does. But that was a 2015,

376
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:57.630
16 I think. So that sounds like around when he had his stroke. Okay. May,

377
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.510
I mean I actually wouldn't find out when he had a stroke. He's um,

378
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.190
recovered very well though. Apparently he's still has some residual issues.

379
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.470
Oh wow. So this is definitely pretty strongly. 2016. Yeah.

380
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.040
So this is pretty strong. Pre-stroke [inaudible] the,

381
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.470
the crazy thing is I've did all these interviews with all these different

382
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:18.280
people. Didn't, didn't actually post them up online. Why?

383
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.500
We did two with wired magazine.

384
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.690
We did the one with Ray Kurzweil and one with Stan Lee.

385
00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.960
And I had like the rest lined up, but we wanted to, you know,

386
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.300
like present them the right way and go, Oh well that's actually, you're,

387
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.810
you're great on the internet. Jamie's the best.

388
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.850
And what's cool is that in his office? No, we got, um,

389
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.500
Oxford university gave us this room, you know, and uh,

390
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.943
I took it over.

391
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.810
<v 2>That's awesome. With them. Do you, when you talked to Kurzweil,</v>

392
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.790
did you get into his idea of being able to download consciousness? Um,

393
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.710
no, we didn't get that far, but I would love,

394
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.110
I'd love for you to tell me more about,

395
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.870
now it's a weird one because we went to this, uh,

396
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:06.290
I think it's called a 2045 conference in New York city.

397
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.180
And the idea behind it is that they think that somewhere around 20,

398
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:15.380
45 there's going to be some sort of a technological singularity with the

399
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:18.410
exponential growth or perceived exponential growth, whatever it is,

400
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.370
the leaping the in new innovations creating these new possibilities that

401
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:26.390
somewhere around 25, 20, 45,

402
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.540
there's going to be so many changes in so many new innovations that they believe

403
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:38.060
they're going to be able to put your consciousness either into some sort of a

404
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:40.490
hard drive, some sort of quantum computer,

405
00:24:40.491 --> 00:24:44.760
or perhaps even a physical embodiment of a Steve Aoki. Like you have a,

406
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.980
an artificial Steve Aoki like a sleeve. Yeah. And then your co,

407
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.520
your actual brain right inside this thing.

408
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:57.350
So as your body dies now you will exist in this whatever the fuck it's made out

409
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:59.840
of. Right. You know, and he thinks he's going to be able to do that.

410
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:02.090
And you know he's got a really bizarre motivation too.

411
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.270
His father died when he was young and he didn't really get to know him that well

412
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:10.880
and he has all these images and all these terms and he thinks that he is going

413
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:15.881
to be able to in some way shape or form recreate his father and have some sort

414
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:21.950
of a, a reasonable facsimile. Some sort of a,

415
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.760
a way to communicate with this.

416
00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:28.010
His dad actually have is with all the memories that he has of his father,

417
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:28.470
all the,

418
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:33.470
the video and images and actually recreate his father to have a communication

419
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:38.660
with them. It's very weird stuff. Yeah. I mean I think a lot of these,

420
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.310
those, those storylines get drawn out and, and scifi. Yes.

421
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.900
Cause that's essentially where we want.

422
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:47.580
Like we want to go without any issues and problems and,

423
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.890
and backfire and know like black mirror episode, you know,

424
00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:55.610
kind of blender because I mean it, we are,

425
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.140
we are definitely going in that direction.

426
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.580
We're going on somewhere weird for sure.

427
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.460
We are 100% going there and there's no stopping it. No way. Yeah.

428
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.710
Every he's can't. Yeah.

429
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.280
Reds buying new phones and new technology and we're pushing it as far as we can.

430
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.210
There was a guy, um, I think it's from the university, Connecticut.

431
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.360
He is the preeminent researcher on time travel and he is right out of a fucking

432
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:20.960
Spiderman comic book. His dad died when he was young,

433
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.990
same sort of situation and he wanted to figure out a way to go back in time and

434
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:27.584
save his dad.

435
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.130
So he's literally trying to come up with a workable theory for time travel.

436
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.570
This, that's the gentleman, what is his name? Dr Ron mallet. Yeah.

437
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:41.930
Dr Ron mallet. And it's right now, I mean,

438
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:44.340
he's got a working but it's,

439
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.170
it becomes a matter of having enough energy to actually pull this off.

440
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.030
But the idea behind it was all inspired by his father dying and he thinks he's

441
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:57.870
going to be able to, or someone may be able to go back in time.

442
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.830
But what he will hear stories like this, right? When you hear the story,

443
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.070
cause I know like this is like what you do. You get to talk to all these people.

444
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.220
Do you,

445
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.840
do you believe them to a certain extent and then you like you go because for me,

446
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:13.860
I need the scientific understanding, you know, like yes,

447
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.900
I'm not too much into the paranormal.

448
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.860
I need to like understand too to see if the sexually is conclusive.

449
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.240
I think he found out something unfortunate, uh,

450
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.180
in that the idea as far as time travel as we know,

451
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:32.181
it will only exist from the time the time machine is invented forward and

452
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:36.300
backward to that moment. The idea like Terence McKenna described it,

453
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.620
the idea that you cannot travel where there are no roads and so once a road is

454
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:43.350
established, then things get really fucked up.

455
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:48.351
Because if you create a time machine as Lisa's in terms of what they understand

456
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.900
or what dr Malick believes about time travel right now,

457
00:27:51.901 --> 00:27:54.240
and I hope I'm not butchering, I'm sure I'm butchering it,

458
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:55.560
but I hope not pushing it too bad.

459
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:01.230
You can only travel back to the moment the first time machine is invented.

460
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.280
So once that door is open, then time ceases to become linear.

461
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.490
Anything from the end of time till the invention of the time machine happens all

462
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:15.180
at once because anyone can come back to that moment because it time machine

463
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:18.120
exists now, it's made. So of course they're gonna innovate.

464
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.950
Anyone in the future is going to innovate.

465
00:28:19.951 --> 00:28:21.960
These people that do innovate are going to have a much,

466
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.580
much superior version of this time machine and everyone's going to be able to go

467
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:30.390
back to the moment that the time machine is invented in any point along the way,

468
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:32.400
from the end of time to the beginning of time,

469
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:36.300
from the moment that time machine is invented. So in that case,

470
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:40.680
if that really is the case, yeah. Has a time machine been invented?

471
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.100
I don't think it has Y well, I could be wrong,

472
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.390
but what's your like I think everything is going to be completely fucking Gonzo.

473
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:52.710
You're going to have people appearing and disappearing and showing up and going

474
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.730
and it's a normal thing. It's like, Oh yeah, he's traveling through time.

475
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.080
It's just that like all events,

476
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.480
say if like you would you know that w what if he was a world war five a hundred

477
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:05.310
years from now and you were like, fuck this,

478
00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:08.480
I'm going back in time a hundred years before world war five and I'm just going

479
00:29:08.481 --> 00:29:09.990
to live there. And they do.

480
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.320
They decided to do that or world war three or world war four there.

481
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:16.290
Just keep going back in time and forward in time.

482
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.190
You could go if you had a time machine and the time machine was, and again,

483
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.840
I'm butchering this, I'm a moron. I'm not a scientist.

484
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.630
If you had a time machine and time machines existed from now until you know the

485
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:32.280
perceivable end of the lifespan of the earth,

486
00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:36.720
right when the sun supernovas and there's no more life left on earth,

487
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.710
you could kind of go anywhere you want from now to a million years now as long

488
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:42.790
as there's a place to go,

489
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.350
as long as there's a time machine available and the idea is that time as we know

490
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:51.400
it will cease to exist because our time now is dependent on, you know,

491
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:55.420
our biological entities waking up, moving forward. What time is it? Oh,

492
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:58.930
it's three on my meeting's at five better hurry, hurry over to downtown.

493
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.670
Traffic's rough this time of day.

494
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.940
All that stuff is going to be nonsense if there's time machines because you're

495
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:07.330
just going to be able to move anywhere you want at any point in time.

496
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.820
Sounds ridiculous, but so does the internet.

497
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.170
Have you brought the internet up to some guy who lived in Victorian times and

498
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:16.700
say, look at this. This is my phone and you can ask it a question.

499
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.940
I'll give you all the answers. Anything you want.

500
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.050
That would be the most astounding form of witchcraft ever invented.

501
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:27.700
And now my 11 year old daughter has one of those. Yeah. You know, I mean she,

502
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.530
she asked that thing questions all the time.

503
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:32.710
She gets answers to stuff all the time that we used to have to go to a library

504
00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:36.460
forum. She could watch videos that just come out of the air. That's magic. Yeah.

505
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.210
And, but it's, we are accustomed to it. We adapt very quickly.

506
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:45.540
So the idea is that what this would do is change every aspect of reality as we

507
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:51.160
know it in terms of like linear time. It would no longer exist.

508
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.240
[inaudible] would only those people that know how to use a machine have access

509
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:57.610
to it. Well, I mean, wouldn't it be like cell phones?

510
00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.270
Like eventually everybody gets one and we're talking about time, right?

511
00:31:01.271 --> 00:31:04.660
So if everybody gets access to it a year from now or three years from now,

512
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:07.080
it doesn't matter because the time machines already been invented so they could

513
00:31:07.081 --> 00:31:09.670
travel back to that moment and forward from that moment.

514
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.470
So the moment they turn that fucker on, everything goes haywire. Wow.

515
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.230
So let's, so let's not turn that thing on like, Oh well it's weird.

516
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.860
It's inevitable. People press get it. Yeah,

517
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.020
well they want to see if they can even make that happen.

518
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.320
I used to have a bit that I used to do about the big bang because they were tr,

519
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:33.570
everyone's always tried to figure out like what was the universal like before

520
00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:37.750
the big bang. Like what, what happened? How was it created?

521
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.440
And when you look at the progress of technology,

522
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:46.000
my thought was that if you look at where we're going and we're constantly

523
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:50.110
innovating and people are constantly coming up with new and more impressive

524
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:54.090
forms of technology that one day we're going to create a big bang machine and

525
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.910
that this is what happens the every 5 billion years or so,

526
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.870
things get so intelligent, they develop a big bag machine and they sit around,

527
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.060
these dudes are on red bull and Xanax and simulation and one guy goes,

528
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.060
I'll fucking press it. And he hits the button and boom,

529
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:11.920
the whole universe starts all over again.

530
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:17.160
And if you had a big bang machine and you knew that if you pressed it within 5

531
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.920
billion years, humans would create another big bang machine.

532
00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:24.700
This is an endless cycle. Would you press it? Fucking for sure.

533
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:26.020
There's someone that would press that button.

534
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.760
100% person out there that would press that button.

535
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.920
Yeah, no, I heard more about the simulation idea. Well that's another,

536
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.100
that's another idea. But that's, yeah, Ilan believes that he believes

537
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.190
<v 1>that it's very possible. Like, like one of the things they said,</v>

538
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:47.360
if you could ask AI, what would you ask? He said what's beyond the simulation?

539
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.200
Like he believes this is a simulation, but if you're Elon Musk,

540
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.360
of course you'd believe it's the simulation.

541
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.530
People letting you drill tunnels under LA and shoot rockets off into space.

542
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:01.820
You're making electric cars is solar roof panels.

543
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.200
I mean he's, he's literally living like some character in a movie.

544
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.260
He's like professor X or something. Yeah. But if you're in a simulation,

545
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:11.580
it's nothing you can do about it. Right? So you just might as well just do it,

546
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:16.640
do it all. So it's a great way to think about like what is a simulation?

547
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:19.880
If everything is a simulation, it's still life, right?

548
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:23.750
Like your existence is still everything you're accustomed to and everything you

549
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:26.450
experience. And if it is a simulation,

550
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:31.451
at least some aspects of this are comfortably or comfortingly,

551
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.400
uh, like obvious, like work hard, you can get better at things,

552
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.410
you can be nice to people, they're nice to you, like be be a good friend,

553
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:45.560
you get good friends, eat healthy food, you're healthier.

554
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.240
There's some comfort to the lack of,

555
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:51.590
I mean there's,

556
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.430
there's certainly some variables that are very difficult to account for,

557
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.020
but there's also,

558
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.490
there's a surprising amount of life that's pretty straight forward.

559
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.330
So if it is a simulation, it's not the most difficult one to follow.

560
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.950
It's pretty crazy and chaotic, but there's, there's a lot of comfort in it.

561
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:13.670
Like as much as we try to dwell on the horrors of humanity and I'm certainly a

562
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:14.660
lot of them because it guys,

563
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.340
a lot of beauty and people too and there's a lot of cool shit and people,

564
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:21.460
you know what I mean? When you focus on that, then yeah.

565
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.550
Then there's real growth.

566
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.090
I was at the comedy store last night until like two o'clock in the morning in

567
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:29.420
this comedians bar just hanging out with all these comedians.

568
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.040
We're just laughing and talking and this is no, no audience.

569
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.590
Just a bunch of people that get paid to make people laugh.

570
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:38.440
Like John steward was back there,

571
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:42.170
Michelle Wolf and all these really funny comics were all just laughing and

572
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:45.200
having a great time and talking and it was, I was like, wow,

573
00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:48.500
this is so nice and it's so fun. It's rewarding.

574
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.760
It's like there's cool things in this life if you can find good people and

575
00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:53.660
friends and,

576
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.610
and communicate and spread love and have interesting,

577
00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:00.950
fascinating thought provoking conversations.

578
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:05.180
There's a lot of really positive things. Right? So this is a simulation.

579
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:10.010
It's pretty bad ass for Steve Aoki. Yeah, I definitely am for sure.

580
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:13.310
Joe Rogan people and shit. You know,

581
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:17.480
making a brain foundation. I mean, what a fucking great simulation you're in.

582
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:21.410
Absolutely. I think, yeah, it's like you, you can make what you want of it.

583
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:22.850
I mean, it's not,

584
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.300
it might not be the dream like the Eli Musk scenario right away,

585
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:28.730
but it takes time to get there. Well, you don't want that dream.

586
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:32.000
I don't want his dream. Yeah, exactly. His dreams crazy. I mean,

587
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:33.590
his dream of like, I mean, like you said,

588
00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:36.980
he's just like almost a superhero is Bruce Wayne, you know, doing whatever.

589
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.243
You know, he's,

590
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.080
<v 3>he's iron man, you know. Well, you know some, some cars have small engines,</v>

591
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.860
right? There's Honda civics out there and then there's fucking rocket cars.

592
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.580
He's got some sort of crazy quantum rocket car engine for a brain.

593
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.020
If you talked to him. No, I haven't. He's a trip. He's actually on the,

594
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:56.160
on the list of people.

595
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:59.670
I would love to be in the studio with the make music with and you know,

596
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.310
just get into his mind a bit.

597
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.310
I've been putting that out there to the universe.

598
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.140
He's one of those guys and when you're talking to him,

599
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:09.780
you have this feeling that he's running code in the background. Why he's talking

600
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:17.280
[inaudible] he just gets bored with like regular mundane conversations and he's

601
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:20.160
got 50 million things going on constantly and he's also trying,

602
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:24.440
like he was talking about it to me about how difficult it is to manage his mind.

603
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.090
Like you wouldn't want to be me. I'm like, Oh

604
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.100
he thought he was crazy when he was younger cause he like so much was bouncing

605
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:35.250
around in his head and he realized that other people weren't like that.

606
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:38.590
And he's like, Oh no, no, but I'm alone. Yeah,

607
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.650
I mean like literally he's probably alone.

608
00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:42.890
Who the fuck is like that guy in terms of like a,

609
00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:47.891
a public intellectual who's responsible for so many groundbreaking technologies?

610
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.130
You know the number one electric car in the world, like space X,

611
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:57.660
tunneling under LA with the boring company and like fucking, he's a crazy man.

612
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.310
Fast. Thank God he's around though. Yeah, I didn't know people like that.

613
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.490
It's so cool to have like a true outlier. You know,

614
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.220
someone who's just really out there and Oh man,

615
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:12.060
he's constantly attacked and maligned and people are misrepresenting him and you

616
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:15.270
know, people like all the crabs in a bucket don't like it.

617
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.850
Then I try to pull them down to God damn smart.

618
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:21.210
All these people that fancy themselves smart, you meet that guy like, Oh,

619
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.260
okay, there's levels to this game. Yeah, no, he's,

620
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.730
he's like the top of my list just so you know, being his presence.

621
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.600
But I think it'd be very exciting to try to do a song with Elon Musk.

622
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.660
I'll ask him, well, after the podcast I send him a text message too. So he's,

623
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.970
he's probably busy. Yeah, I could, I could always make as easy as possible,

624
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:46.120
but just go to space X or Tesla or wherever that, Oh,

625
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.300
so what do you in particular, are you doing with this brain foundation? Um,

626
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.140
I mean,

627
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.710
I think one of the most important things is inspire people more about brain.

628
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.380
The brain, you know, like, uh,

629
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.410
I mean obviously it's to raise money for brain research works. Uh, for one,

630
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:05.880
finding curious for degenerative brain diseases and to just understanding the

631
00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:06.571
brain more,

632
00:38:06.571 --> 00:38:09.960
working with [inaudible] that want to understand the brain more so that we can

633
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:13.440
expand what our limitations are. You know,

634
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.200
in the conversations that we're talking about, you know,

635
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:20.030
bring some of the science fiction science fact, you know, um,

636
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.290
I love this idea that like, you know,

637
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:27.240
telekinesis is when you can move things with your mind as soon as possible.

638
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:32.340
It's, it already is really not like in the supernatural sense. Like Magneto.

639
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.010
Well, you know, it's like, you know, there's, I mean, it's happened like

640
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.690
<v 0>five years ago. People moving wheelchairs with their, with like, uh, implanted,</v>

641
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.150
they planted. Yeah, exactly. I'm not sure that the right terms,

642
00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:47.710
but I've seen the videos, you know, like a monkey being able to move,

643
00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:52.230
uh, an arm to its mouth to eat the Apple. Yeah, those were happy. Those,

644
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.140
it happened like 2013 or 14 or fact check that.

645
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:59.320
But it was not 2019. It was like years ago.

646
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.760
So whatever they're doing at DARPA, whatever they're doing at like Google,

647
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:08.650
whoever's got these research orgs and labs I wanted,

648
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.180
I would love to jump in there and just like put my ear out there and just listen

649
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:16.060
and find out what's going on. And, you know,

650
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.760
cause I have my own interests and passion on what, what the breakthroughs are.

651
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.980
And I would also love to try some of these things.

652
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.370
Do you think they'd let you then? Sometimes, I mean, listen,

653
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.820
you got to try this. Boston dynamics might be your best bet though.

654
00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.050
The raw the robot people. Yeah. They might let you in,

655
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.800
but DARPA's DARPA, DARPA, DARPA won't let me in.

656
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.620
Obviously they will not let me in. You're gonna have to sign some paperwork,

657
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:44.460
but I want to get in to as many doors as I can on any of this kind of stuff.

658
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:50.470
And uh, that's like my own personal gain. But also with the,

659
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.550
with the brain or I get just the brain foundation. It's just, uh, like,

660
00:39:54.551 --> 00:39:58.990
you know, help out the smaller orgs too that are, that are one,

661
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.570
find the cures. Because at the end of the day,

662
00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:05.530
what I've learned is that if you don't die of cancer or heart disease,

663
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.990
you're going to have a brain degenerate disease. You're going to,

664
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:10.600
you're gonna go crazy. You're gonna, you're gonna lose your memory,

665
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:13.780
you're gonna deteriorate. Yeah. And you know, you know,

666
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.500
years down the line we're going to be able to literally turn our body into like

667
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:24.310
a used car and change all the parts. Yeah. But you know,

668
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.090
if you start losing your memory, then you start losing who you are.

669
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:32.650
Did you talk to Kurzweil about those? Uh, yes.

670
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.460
It was years ago, so I'm trying to remember even like the interview that we did,

671
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:37.121
but I, you know,

672
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:42.121
I went in deep on a lot of the anti aging stuff and you know,

673
00:40:42.251 --> 00:40:42.331
I,

674
00:40:42.331 --> 00:40:45.670
I think the struggle that he's going to have is if he's going to make it to 20,

675
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:49.440
45 cause he's 70 or something. Right, right. Yeah.

676
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:54.490
And he has a heart. Um, he has a genetic defect with his heart, you know, so,

677
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.030
um, but it,

678
00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.270
I mean he's just like one of those like those heroes of mine that I was lucky

679
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:05.080
too to be in his space, you know,

680
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.700
playing on his Kirksville keyboard and he invented the synthesizer.

681
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:11.523
Uh, that was,

682
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.250
that was a moment where both on the keys each to texts to didn't he? Yeah.

683
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.331
I think, I mean he's,

684
00:41:16.331 --> 00:41:20.890
he's invented more than a hundred really significant inventions.

685
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.110
Yeah. Fascinating guy. Absolutely.

686
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.520
But can we squeeze 25 more years out of them? Yeah, yeah.

687
00:41:27.521 --> 00:41:32.260
His biological life to get to 20, 45 because if he's going to like,

688
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.100
he's going to be one that's going to really

689
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.290
<v 1>push that envelope part. I think he's, if there's anyone out there and so I'm,</v>

690
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.650
I, you know, it's clearly obvious why Google picked him up. Yeah. You know,

691
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:46.400
and had him like head the whole, I forgot what the department is called,

692
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:51.170
but you know, well, didn't Google by Boston dynamics as well,

693
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.880
the Bata robot company. I know that, which is like, what are you guys planning?

694
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.360
You can control everybody's email.

695
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:02.560
You have the number one search engine on the planet earth, you have a,

696
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:04.970
the number one browser. Like what are you guys doing?

697
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.310
What are you doing over there? Yeah, you make them robots,

698
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.660
but don't you want to be in the room? Yeah, you don't want to be in the room,

699
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:14.150
but you know, some of their choices are a little bit questionable.

700
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:19.520
There's so much, there's, there's science, but then there's so much,

701
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:22.940
there's social decisions, you know,

702
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:26.690
that they're making in terms of like what people get to see and talk about in

703
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:30.440
here. And a lot of is based on the zeitgeists is based on the, you know,

704
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:34.850
the current state of politically correct ideology and what you can and can't say

705
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:35.810
or can and can't do.

706
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:38.120
And that becomes really dangerous because you're kind of controlling

707
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.970
information. You're throttling information. Like, you know,

708
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.370
Tulsi Gabbert is suing Google for, what is it,

709
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:45.800
like $50 million or something crazy like that.

710
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:51.050
They say that they purposely stifled her search engine results so that people

711
00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:54.920
wouldn't be able to find her as easily and they've, she's apparently proven it.

712
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.560
Wow. Excuse me. Um,

713
00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:02.970
so it's not a pure information based company.

714
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.420
There's ideology behind it, there's motivations behind it that you know,

715
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.550
politically leaning motivations right now.

716
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.450
So I don't know what goes into that though,

717
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.370
when he goes into that world on like, Oh, I,

718
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.780
you forget about that sometimes when you're like, I want to be in the Bay.

719
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:22.710
Right. Their rooms, you know. Well there was a,

720
00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:27.170
an internal memo that were they referring to Ben Shapiro and someone else?

721
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:31.040
I think it was Jordan Peterson and maybe Dennis Prager as Nazis,

722
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.570
which is hilarious cause both Ben Shapiro and Dennis Prager are both Jewish.

723
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:40.070
So it's like their, their perception of who a person is. This was brought up,

724
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.170
this is brought up by, um, um, people in, in Congress.

725
00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:47.390
Like they had to have hearings on it. I was trying to figure out like,

726
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:50.180
what is Google doing? Like, what are you allowed to,

727
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:54.230
how are you allowed to define people internally in your memory memos?

728
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.540
And then of course once you call someone a Nazi,

729
00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.440
then you can act as if they're not seen and you know,

730
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:05.441
stifle any sort of search on them or stifle results or you know,

731
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.940
point point people in the direction that you think would be better for humanity

732
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:15.650
versus just pure information. And it gets, it gets very weird, you know?

733
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.330
But as a technology company,

734
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:21.770
look at their amazingly just what they're doing with Android and Google

735
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:26.570
searching and Google assistant and Google maps is by far the most,

736
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.380
the superior map application on the planet earth.

737
00:44:30.381 --> 00:44:33.900
And it's constantly getting better, constantly gathering up new information.

738
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:37.860
I mean, part of me loves the fact that they exist and part of me is like,

739
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.830
Dan is too much power, has too much power for one,

740
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.900
one company to be able to influence people one way or the other. So what's, uh,

741
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.690
what's your, so what's the Joe Rogan solution to something like that?

742
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.800
Regulations. No mom too stupid for this. This,

743
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.920
I need to rely on people that have actually spent real time studying the effects

744
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:02.370
and understand it from a, a very deep level. I don't,

745
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.100
I understand it that it's, I understand that it's problematic.

746
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.760
I just don't understand what the solution is. And I don't know if it's even,

747
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.420
it's just a free distribution of information across the board because then what

748
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:17.040
do you do about actual Nazis?

749
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.800
Like if you find there's a new Hitler and he arises and he really does want

750
00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.820
exterminate the Jews, what happens there?

751
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.770
Do you just allow that guy to be on Google?

752
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.350
Is he on Google Hangouts with little Nazi hanging out?

753
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.800
They're planning on exterminations and where are they? Where's the next, um,

754
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.970
Auschwitz, you know, no, I don't think that that shouldn't be the case.

755
00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:37.380
So what is the case?

756
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:42.300
Do you allow white supremacists on there to organize rallies, FOC,

757
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:46.800
um, where, where does freedom of speech and you know, yeah,

758
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:51.540
it's very complicated questions. Yes. We're all learning to navigate.

759
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.750
Yeah. I think in many ways,

760
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.960
and this is a weird thought that I have and I repeat it over and over again,

761
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:02.940
but I think technology is going to provide us with a new way of communicating

762
00:46:02.941 --> 00:46:07.020
that's not dependent upon language, but rather can read actual intent.

763
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:12.480
Like an actual mind reading technology. And I, when I,

764
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:16.500
when I see Elan's um, a neuro link,

765
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.820
this thing that he's trying to deal with,

766
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.240
they're opening up the bandwidth to humans and information through use of

767
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:25.860
implants and some sort of a Bluetooth wearable device like that I think is like

768
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:30.340
a step in that direction. And I think Ellen and you know,

769
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.960
in many interviews he said that he thinks that human beings are the organic

770
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.550
biological bootloader for [inaudible] for artificial intelligence.

771
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.950
So if we're a bootloader for AI,

772
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.030
the way to sort of combat that as boot loader boot loader. Yeah. Like,

773
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.900
like a computer boot loading already system. Gotcha.

774
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:54.160
That what we're doing is we're the biological blah, well,

775
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.650
the way I've described it is that we're sort of an electronic cocoon that's

776
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:01.310
about to make the butterfly and that we're,

777
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.820
we're at the Caterpillar that's making the cocoon and we're constantly in

778
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:09.480
pursuit of innovation or fly is the AI. Yes. The butterfly.

779
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:10.830
Like if you see a Caterpillar,

780
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.050
that kettlebell doesn't know what the fuck's going on.

781
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:15.330
It's just making a cocoon. That's what it does. Yeah.

782
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.790
And that's what it knows to do. Yeah.

783
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.150
And the idea is that we don't know what the fuck we're doing either.

784
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:24.090
Like why do we need five GS, four G not good enough. God damn,

785
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:27.600
I get on the internet pretty God damn quick. What are we doing?

786
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:30.610
What seems like five GS better and will be better than five G? Yeah.

787
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.230
And if you want to get that mind reading software,

788
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.030
you've got to get seven G and we're,

789
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:39.060
we're gonna do this to the point where one day there's going to be a real thing

790
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:40.840
sitting.

791
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.770
<v 0>Well we will merge with the AI because that's,</v>

792
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.700
I mean that's the future that I hope for you don't lose yourself in that,

793
00:47:47.701 --> 00:47:48.410
you know, like,

794
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:49.600
<v 1>but are you yourself,</v>

795
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:52.840
once you've merged with the AI and then what's holding you back? God,

796
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:55.240
all these emotions are bullshit. That's getting into right.

797
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:57.590
Let's get rid of those. Let's just have pure people. Yeah.

798
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.760
Pure people now available through Nabisco.

799
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.500
<v 0>It's interesting cause I, cause like my whole point with neon futures,</v>

800
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.720
the convergence of [inaudible] the ultimate goal is you have cricket versus to

801
00:48:09.721 --> 00:48:13.720
have technology and our humanity to the point where we live, you know,

802
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:15.610
forever through, you know,

803
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.770
this downloading system that we're talking about earlier on or, or you know,

804
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.950
whatever seemingly makes sense in the trajectory of where technology is going.

805
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.960
You know, so we do live indefinitely, you know, I mean that's like a

806
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.540
for me as well, you know,

807
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:36.010
my insurance policy for if I don't make it to this point,

808
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:40.270
like my dad didn't make it to that, that cure is, you know,

809
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.430
obviously a CRO genically freezing the body while I'm already signed up.

810
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.450
Jeez. So, you know, cause I feel like, I mean if we are really,

811
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:53.410
this discussion is, are we gonna make it there in our timeline?

812
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.490
I'm 41 so I've a better chance of Ray Kurzweil, obviously. Yeah.

813
00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.300
So if I know, and I really believe that, you know,

814
00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:04.150
I guess it's hopeful, you know,

815
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.400
that that will get to this point in our generation that will,

816
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.950
they'll make it what? It's that close, right?

817
00:49:08.951 --> 00:49:13.120
So either we make it and then I die and then everyone lives forever.

818
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.510
Do I want to be the generation that of people that die or the generation of

819
00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:21.100
people that go, Oh, death is as a cure. We just, uh, we just found,

820
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.350
we found a cure for death. Just like a cure for cancer.

821
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:24.340
Just like a cure for whatever.

822
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.540
<v 1>What if after your biological body ceases to function,</v>

823
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:33.541
you move into a new realm of reality that is a completely different dimension

824
00:49:35.501 --> 00:49:38.710
that's filled with love and understanding. Like the after death. Yeah,

825
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.610
there's no room. We don't know. There's no biological shortcomings.

826
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.380
There's no emotions and there's no fear, none of that. And there's,

827
00:49:47.381 --> 00:49:50.920
there's no bodies. You just, you're a soul in another dimension.

828
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.620
And then someone unfreezes you like, well, Steve wanted to be on frozen and

829
00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:01.210
stuck back in. Kate. People are like, fuck man, I was,

830
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:04.480
I was there. I was on the other side. They're like, you'd be like,

831
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.470
click off doubt. No, I can't believe this.

832
00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.290
And so then you go, well, I'll just die again.

833
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.810
<v 0>Well here, here's, okay, this is, this is what I know. Cause I don't know.</v>

834
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.290
I mean we both don't know what's really going to happen. That's likely. I mean,

835
00:50:18.291 --> 00:50:21.290
anything is likely. Okay. I'm not saying that I'm not like a,

836
00:50:21.291 --> 00:50:22.970
I don't believe in God or I do believe in God.

837
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.270
I'm just don't know what's really happening afterwards. But I know,

838
00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.320
I know what I've seen as me,

839
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:35.060
what I understand of what's around me and my feelings is that if I wake up

840
00:50:35.061 --> 00:50:40.061
tomorrow or if someone I love wakes up tomorrow with an incurable disease that's

841
00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.590
going to kill them, it would be the most horrific thing.

842
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:43.940
And then I think at the end of the day,

843
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:49.010
the human race is going out to find cures for those kinds of situations. Sure.

844
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.180
So that's like, yeah, suffering, pain. I mean, that's what we do.

845
00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:56.690
We try to stop any longer [inaudible] our life essentially.

846
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.700
We all want to live indefinitely, you know,

847
00:50:58.701 --> 00:51:03.310
like through finding cures for all these issues. So we want to live healthily.

848
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.101
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

849
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:07.230
You don't want to be in a wheelchair like for four 50 years,

850
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.580
just like staring at a TV and Hawkins. Yeah, yeah.

851
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:13.100
Which is w but, but then again,

852
00:51:13.101 --> 00:51:17.750
like maybe he found all the silver lining, I'm not sure. But you know,

853
00:51:17.751 --> 00:51:21.860
if you're healthy and moving and then boom, night and day are there,

854
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:26.300
of course it's awful. But, um, at the end of the day you just don't want that,

855
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:29.540
you know, like, I mean, I mean you, you don't want that kind of thing to happen.

856
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:34.690
So for me it's like I would rather opt out than have someone make the sunlight

857
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.360
disease, make that decision for me. The suffering things. Yeah.

858
00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.910
<v 1>The thing that we all want to avoid,</v>

859
00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.830
we want to avoid discomfort and pain and also causing discomfort to our loved

860
00:51:44.831 --> 00:51:48.490
ones. Like one of the scariest thing about dying is leaving behind grievers,

861
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.810
leaving behind people that are sad and miss you terribly. Yeah.

862
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.020
It's like when you've seen people where their loved ones have died, it's, it's,

863
00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:58.240
you know, I've lost loved ones.

864
00:51:58.241 --> 00:52:02.020
We all have and it's a weird void.

865
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:07.000
<v 0>It's a, yeah, it's horrific. It's traumatic. And it's, you know,</v>

866
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:12.010
that's where my conquest or my interest in passion led to anti-aging,

867
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.110
the future, you know,

868
00:52:14.111 --> 00:52:18.670
and then building on that for the ones that I love that are alive now, you know,

869
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.140
and doing whatever I can to like share the information so that they live as long

870
00:52:23.141 --> 00:52:27.040
as they possibly can in the healthiest way possible. You know, so like,

871
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:32.200
I'm like just gathering, gathering information as I go, you know,

872
00:52:32.201 --> 00:52:35.590
and it's, and it's exciting because as I was saying, it was, as I get bigger,

873
00:52:35.591 --> 00:52:38.590
as a personality, you know,

874
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:43.470
sometimes I do jump into these rooms. And in one case, just recently, I,

875
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.260
uh, there's a doctor that, that just, that I've worked with,

876
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.100
I've gotten stuff done, some STEM cell injections with them in Denver,

877
00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:54.270
and he came to my house and he was with some other doctors and they're like, Oh,

878
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.050
yeah, this is a doctor convention. I live in Las Vegas.

879
00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.530
Those conventions all the time there. So they all came over and like, Hey,

880
00:52:59.531 --> 00:53:01.380
you know, there's some breakthrough, um,

881
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.540
groundbreaking stuff just happened this year. Uh,

882
00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:08.680
you can now find out on a cellular level, uh, uh,

883
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:13.390
cancer detection, uh, for at least 16 different cancers, you know, so like,

884
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:17.410
it's like very, very preventative, you know, far along the line.

885
00:53:17.411 --> 00:53:19.630
So I was like, I want in,

886
00:53:19.631 --> 00:53:22.450
so I got the information and I just liked that was a Christmas present for

887
00:53:22.451 --> 00:53:26.040
everyone. What kind of STEM, so procedures are you getting? I

888
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.150
<v 3>mean the first time was through, through Dan Bilzerian. He,</v>

889
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:34.920
he's introduced me to uh, uh, the one in Panama, so I went down there.

890
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:39.330
Did Neil Riordan exactly. But my mom was just telling them, Oh yeah, last week.

891
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:41.160
Yeah, I've sent it down there twice. That's great.

892
00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:45.630
And it was in the verge of getting a knee replacement and her knee was really

893
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:49.620
bad. And uh, eight months it was took a while, you know,

894
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:52.900
cause my mom was 73 and um,

895
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:58.220
within eight months her knee stopped being in pain and she was able to walk and

896
00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:01.770
she can say they went to the grand Canyon and hazy. Yeah.

897
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.220
And now she went back again to just get a a second dose and juice it up some

898
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:08.310
more. It's incredible. I just know when I was there,

899
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:13.170
I saw a lot of kids in there. The one in Panama because it's it,

900
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.430
it grows muscle or does something like a, I don't want to say the wrong thing,

901
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.120
regenerates tissue. Right. So kids with muscle dystrophy,

902
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:23.900
kids with the like where they can't walk anymore,

903
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.550
they get the STEM cell injections and they can walk for 'em.

904
00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:29.310
Then after six months, you know the,

905
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:34.350
the STEM cells to leave your body or are like the reason stay with you,

906
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:38.970
right? Yeah. So once again, I don't have scientific terms, I could be off,

907
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:43.830
but they have to go back in, get the STEM cells on. They can have, you know,

908
00:54:43.831 --> 00:54:47.640
as, as you know, that kind of life instead of having me in a wheelchair.

909
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.170
So I went, I went in there, um, because I just wanted to try it out.

910
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:56.280
My friend also came with me. He has asthma, knocked out his asthma.

911
00:54:56.281 --> 00:55:00.420
He never had to use an inhaler for way past six months. Really? Yeah.

912
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:05.400
Because the STEM cells also really affect the lungs. Um,

913
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.230
the umbilical cord cells, they,

914
00:55:07.231 --> 00:55:11.950
they travel the lungs first from what [inaudible] Ivy virginity. Yeah. And Ivy,

915
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:12.960
we did Ivy.

916
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:17.670
I did shoulder my shoulders because I have,

917
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:23.130
I later got a, um, uh, rotator cuff surgery. Um,

918
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.350
cause I had like a bone spur going into my tendon,

919
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.910
but I try to use the STEM cells to sudden have to go to the surgery.

920
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:33.690
But you can't erode bone. Right. So yeah.

921
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.260
So you gotta shave down and so what they did exactly. Yeah. And um,

922
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:39.660
but I just liked my performance level went out.

923
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:43.800
The like the general kind of markers of what it's supposed to do actually

924
00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:47.910
increase. Actually right after, um, right after that,

925
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.190
like I went back and I went back to Vegas,

926
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:55.140
met up with Dan and we did a workout and it was like, it's just, you know,

927
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:59.520
two times more and it, you know, it worked. Like, you know,

928
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:02.880
it did what it was scientifically supposed to do for me,

929
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:07.350
for my stamina, my energy. And, um,

930
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.750
you would did it for three days, do the three days,

931
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:14.650
three days and three days of Ivy and then injects into different joints and

932
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:19.410
exactly. And uh, that did that. And then about a year later, um,

933
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:23.610
I was with a dr Grossman, he's the doctor I work with in um,

934
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:27.670
he wrote the book with Ray Criswell called, uh, um,

935
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.020
I think it's the sub,

936
00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:34.021
the subtext of the book is staying alive until we get tiller till who you reach

937
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:37.170
singularity or something like that. Uh, it's uh, it's like a,

938
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.800
a book on being healthy basically anti aging book. He wrote that in,

939
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:45.940
um, with uh, with, with uh, Ray Kurzwell. So that's why I heard about him.

940
00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:51.450
I went to him a few years back to get like the full blood work going for me and

941
00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.470
my family and want,

942
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.970
we did like two days of testing all kinds of stuff to learn more about our

943
00:56:57.971 --> 00:57:00.070
bodies and see what we're deficient in, what we're not,

944
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.130
what vitamins we need to take to supplement the things that we're deficient in.

945
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:07.620
And I came back just, you know, maybe a year ago to do, um,

946
00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:12.100
his version of STEM cells because in America is a different kind of thing like

947
00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:13.600
Panama obviously out of America.

948
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:17.770
So they're doing the umbilical cord STEM cells where they harvest the STEM cells

949
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:22.750
from umbilical cords. So they have stage zero STEM cells. He's doing STEM cells.

950
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:28.080
It's almost like a plasma therapy when they took my blood spin it and they're,

951
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:32.680
uh, you know, pulling out the STEM cells from my own blood.

952
00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:35.440
So it's 41 year old STEM cells.

953
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:40.090
But his point that he is saying is that the size of the STEM cells,

954
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.890
they're much smaller. So they're able to travel past where it ends up clogging,

955
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:47.290
which is like the lungs and like certain areas of the body.

956
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.970
So it does travel more. It just, it's not the days zero STEM cells,

957
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:54.160
but it's still effectively doing its work.

958
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.030
When you think back to like 20 years ago, there was no discussion of this.

959
00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:01.330
So this is a completely, you know, I've had STEM cell shots too,

960
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:04.840
and I had a full length rotator cuff tear in my right arm that's gone.

961
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:08.410
Just it went sealed up. Well healed. Yeah.

962
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.780
I was having real problems with his arm where I was thinking I was going to need

963
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:14.440
surgery. Now it works great. No problems at all. Hit the bag,

964
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:17.720
lift weights and you, you injected intravenously and into the arm. Yeah,

965
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.440
I've done both. Yeah. Exosomes have done,

966
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:24.160
there's a new thing called Wharton's jelly that I had a pretty profound effect.

967
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:26.890
So very potent mixture of STEM cells.

968
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:30.340
We're getting close to the point where you don't have to go to Panama,

969
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:34.360
but go on to Panama right now is the way to go. So that's why you went for, no,

970
00:58:34.361 --> 00:58:36.070
I didn't go to Panama and did it all in America.

971
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.670
Where Santa Monica place called the white spot. Denison. Yeah.

972
00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:40.893
I have to try that out.

973
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.960
Some places that I originally started going to for Virginia King.

974
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:47.050
Do you know Regina King is Regena King, was uh,

975
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:52.080
originally invented in Germany and a lot of guys like Peyton Manning and Koby

976
00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.350
Bryant, they had to flew up, fly to Germany back in the day to get this.

977
00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:01.330
And what they do is it's a more advanced form of platelet rich plasma, right?

978
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:02.830
Like they're taking your blood out,

979
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.330
they spin it in a centrifuge and heat it through some process and they add

980
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:08.200
things to it.

981
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:12.280
And in the process it creates this incredibly potent antiinflammatory agent

982
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.040
that's from your own blood. It's like this yellow serum.

983
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.230
Then the inject this yellow serum directly into areas where you have injury and

984
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:22.340
or inflammation has a radical

985
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.480
<v 2>healing effect and it's really, really good for bulging discs.</v>

986
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:29.090
People that have disc issues of back issues.

987
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:32.420
And I had a pretty bad one in my neck that was keeping me out jujitsu.

988
00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:34.920
My hands were going numb, you know, cause the,

989
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:39.800
the bulge was pushing against my nerve. Now it's gone. Like I've got a,

990
00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:43.070
I've got an MRI six months later after the procedure, there's no more bulge.

991
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.820
Now, most of the time when you have a bulging disc,

992
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:50.150
sometimes it can go back and heal. But most of the time it does not.

993
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:54.440
And most of the time what happens is you wind up having to get a disectomy where

994
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:55.520
they go into the disc,

995
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:59.300
they removed the offending piece that sticking into your nerve,

996
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:02.330
but now you have a smaller disc, you have less disc tissue,

997
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:07.310
so your disc start to collapse your, your actual spinal column, you know,

998
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:12.311
the actual hard bone moves closer to the other hard bone and you know,

999
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:16.190
becomes a real problem. Arthritis forms, scar tissue forms.

1000
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:20.690
The more disc tissue you have, you know the, the better off you are.

1001
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.250
And they're able to do that now to the point where they increased the disc

1002
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.750
tissue. Well it would, it doesn't decrease it. So when the disc is bulging,

1003
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.280
it actually gets it to go back in.

1004
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.000
It gets it to retreat and the STEM cells as the blood plasma therapy,

1005
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:38.900
Regina King, but STEM cells have been shown to start to do that too.

1006
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.160
They have actually started injecting STEM cells directly into Dick's disc

1007
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:47.780
tissue. And I was talking to dr Roddy McGee out of Las Vegas. He's,

1008
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:50.450
he's one of the guys that's really at the cutting edge of all this stuff.

1009
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.260
Welcome with UFC fighters and they're doing that with them.

1010
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:58.730
And he was the guy I originally went to to gr to treat my shoulder because of

1011
01:00:58.731 --> 01:01:02.480
Dr. Davidson from the UFC who's the main doctor for the UFC.

1012
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.850
He was telling me he had shoulder surgery.

1013
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:06.820
He's a little bit older than me and uh,

1014
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.230
his shoulder surgery took [inaudible] but he was still having issues with it and

1015
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.040
he was trying to figure out, um, what he,

1016
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.350
what he should do cause he was still having pain when he was swimming.

1017
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:18.170
Went and got some STEM cell injections. All the pain went away.

1018
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:20.390
So he was telling me about that. He's like, you know,

1019
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.040
you've got some pretty significant tears.

1020
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:24.740
He might really need surgery but maybe this will help you for now.

1021
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.830
So I went there and the, the, the amount of help that, the,

1022
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.730
the amount of alleviation of pain and discomfort was stunning. How's,

1023
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:37.970
I can't believe this is a real thing that you could just shoot this into

1024
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.450
whatever is bothering you and then all of a sudden like four months later you're

1025
01:01:41.451 --> 01:01:44.900
like, where's the pain? I don't have any fucking pain anymore. I need to meet.

1026
01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:47.840
Can I, can you introduce me to Magee? Oh yeah, that's great. Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:51.590
I'll give you his number. That'd be great. I send people to him all the time,

1028
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.280
but he's on the cutting edge of everything. Like anytime.

1029
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:59.390
He's a young guy and he's a really enthusiastic and super brilliant and anytime

1030
01:01:59.391 --> 01:02:03.830
there's any sort of cutting edge medical practice that guys, he's on it.

1031
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.090
Like for instance,

1032
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.570
one of the things they're doing now is when people get ACL tears,

1033
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.610
which usually when you get an ACL tear,

1034
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.020
usually you need reconstruction and usually with that reconstruction is either a

1035
01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:20.021
cadaver graft where they take the Achilles tendon out of a dead person and shove

1036
01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:24.000
it in your knee and then your body re proliferates that with its own cells.

1037
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.150
It takes about six months and then you have a functional tendon again.

1038
01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.150
It's great. I had it done myself worse,

1039
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.820
but now they're able to reattach the actual torn ACL with,

1040
01:02:35.581 --> 01:02:39.840
they have some special technique they do and they've had people tear and ACL and

1041
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:44.730
then compete in the Olympics four months later. Wow. Which is fucking bananas.

1042
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.810
That's crazy. Yeah. And he showed me this procedure and how they do,

1043
01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:51.870
and then he showed me this guy four months postop doing all these box jumps and

1044
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:55.830
shit. And I was like, this is nuts. It is nuts. Wow. Yeah.

1045
01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:00.750
So there's a lot of hope and when in terms of regenerative medicine.

1046
01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:06.000
Absolutely. Yeah. And thank God for people like dr Riordan and Dr. McGee and um,

1047
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:09.330
dr Ben Rui, who's the guy that I go to in Santa Monica.

1048
01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:14.331
I mean these guys are just on top of this incredible new wave of regenerative

1049
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:15.204
medicine.

1050
01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.330
<v 0>Yeah. I'm, I'm obsessed with that world. So the more you're talking about it,</v>

1051
01:03:19.331 --> 01:03:22.900
it's like, uh, it's very exciting cause yeah, you're in Vegas.

1052
01:03:22.901 --> 01:03:26.410
You gotta visit Roddy. I would love to meet [inaudible] too. Yeah.

1053
01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.770
You'd love him. Yeah. And he's like super enthusiastic about it.

1054
01:03:29.771 --> 01:03:32.060
If he finds out that you're enthusiastic about it, he's,

1055
01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:37.000
he'll geek out with you. So that was awesome. Yeah. What else have you had done?

1056
01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:42.900
Um, STEM cells, um, shoulders, shoulder. I, I had, um,

1057
01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.710
I just had focal surgery, vocal cord surgery. Whoa. Uh,

1058
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.900
did you get polyps or something? Yeah, I did. Yeah.

1059
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.870
Paul deployed on my vocal cord cause I used to sing in a band. I used to,

1060
01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:56.830
I used to be a S like in a screamo hardcore band or a few of them.

1061
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.740
I mean that's where like, that's my roots of who my,

1062
01:03:59.741 --> 01:04:04.120
where my music was as far as what led me to deejaying was being in,

1063
01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:08.020
in these like hardcore punk bands. So that's a lot of screaming.

1064
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.070
Lots of screaming. Yeah. And then I carried that through when I finally,

1065
01:04:12.071 --> 01:04:14.050
like when I finally, you know,

1066
01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:18.880
retired that hat and I started deejaying years and years later and I started

1067
01:04:18.881 --> 01:04:21.070
doing these bigger, bigger shows and started doing the festivals.

1068
01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:25.030
I brought out that same energy again. And I started, you know,

1069
01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:28.690
when I started producing the music, uh, electronic music, all this,

1070
01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.410
bringing in guitars, I was screaming on some of these songs.

1071
01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.620
So I'm bringing some of my past in with my music and I'm back again,

1072
01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.480
but in a different world. Um, and, and I just, I,

1073
01:04:43.481 --> 01:04:45.730
I'm not, I, I'm not a trained singer, you know,

1074
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.760
so I destroyed my vocal chords and I was just like raspy as hell.

1075
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:55.560
Like I was just like an old Italian man, so my shows

1076
01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:02.050
and uh, and then I saw a doctor and he's like, you don't have a choice.

1077
01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:04.810
You're going to have to, like, you don't have to take a break. And I'm,

1078
01:05:04.811 --> 01:05:09.240
you know, I'm doing like 250 shows a year. So I was like, huh.

1079
01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:16.030
Cause stuff for the month and, and uh, and, and not talk for a month.

1080
01:05:16.031 --> 01:05:19.090
That was crazy talking for a whole month. Yeah.

1081
01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:21.940
Imagine Joe Rogan not talking for a whole month. Wow. A bit.

1082
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:26.290
A lot of people would be excited, but I had to do that.

1083
01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:29.170
That was very hard. I actually saw a life coach before cause I'm like,

1084
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:32.710
I'm terrified. I don't want my like demons or whatever,

1085
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:36.910
anxiety or whatever things that I have like creeping up or they're like, okay,

1086
01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:40.910
your mind now you can't, you can't talk to someone about, you know, yeah.

1087
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.590
Like I don't love scared, you know. But, uh, I, I got through it. I just,

1088
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.060
I'm a very busy body kind of person. So like I just scheduled,

1089
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:53.350
it was like going back to this college but with things that I needed to train

1090
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:56.380
and get better at, like, get better at piano, get better at meditation,

1091
01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.520
get better at, at, uh, you know, twisting the knobs, engineering,

1092
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:02.260
whatever it might be that I wanted to be better at it.

1093
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.000
I just brought more people in my world.

1094
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.400
Then I finished like an album in that month, making music with different people.

1095
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:12.370
So I just was just so focused on creation and,

1096
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.570
and learning and reading and you know, all that good stuff.

1097
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:19.750
So when I left I was like, okay,

1098
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:24.751
now I know how to do TM meditation or transcendental meditation and uh,

1099
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.080
you know, I'm more comfortable doing the things that,

1100
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:33.340
that help me be a better artist. Obviously worked. Right.

1101
01:06:33.341 --> 01:06:36.130
But what was the first sound that you made after a month?

1102
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.990
What was the first word? I'll,

1103
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.940
I'll tell you something that's really interesting.

1104
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:44.970
I know now to do the most hygienic sneeze that you can possibly do.

1105
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:49.960
Tell us because now I can sneeze with no, um, visible, uh,

1106
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:53.250
vapor red residue. Cause you don't want any people sneeze. You can,

1107
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.530
they see those videos. It's like, yeah,

1108
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:59.650
it's like this cloud of trillions of bacteria floating in the air. Of course,

1109
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.130
if you do that to me, you'll probably see some vapor,

1110
01:07:03.131 --> 01:07:06.220
but you don't feel on your hand if you sneeze and you just like you're,

1111
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:09.280
it's all like gunky. And you know, it happens sometimes, right? Yeah.

1112
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:12.430
Well now I can sneeze because I'm not using my vocal chords.

1113
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:17.440
So as I sneeze I blow out really hard cause I had no choice.

1114
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:22.180
I couldn't cough. I couldn't actually use a vocal cord after the surgery.

1115
01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.740
So what if you had to cough? So I'll be like, Whoa.

1116
01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:32.170
So like when I sneeze, I sneeze like that. I go. So if you do that,

1117
01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:34.710
if you do that kind of sneeze was that, that's how you do it, right?

1118
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.780
That's how I sneeze. I just want to get some dust, see, see if you could,

1119
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.170
if you could make me seize, I will show you. And then

1120
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.350
basically, so you just breathe out. Yeah. It's,

1121
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:49.550
it's the cleanest sneeze you could possibly do. Yeah.

1122
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:52.420
So that's one very important thing I learned through this whole,

1123
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.650
but the first sound, I mean,

1124
01:07:56.651 --> 01:08:01.160
I don't remember scared to say a word like when the 30 days was up. Yeah.

1125
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:06.040
Yeah. It's probably just, you know, you know,

1126
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.000
also whispering is really bad whisperings band like that. Yeah. Like,

1127
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:14.980
yeah. So your healing whisperings not good for your vocal chords. Uh,

1128
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.950
you think it's like

1129
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:20.370
<v 3>gentler on them. But from what I was told to not whisper.</v>

1130
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:25.670
So I literally was texting all the time for [inaudible], you know,

1131
01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:27.710
until I had to make that, you know,

1132
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.170
you probably developed some fucking lightning fast thumb

1133
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.870
wanting to get things out, but did,

1134
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:37.250
that's what you did most of the time just text people, text to tie our,

1135
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:41.660
it's called text to talk when I was in my meetings cause you know,

1136
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:46.490
I've run various different, uh, you know, businesses and I have to, you know,

1137
01:08:46.491 --> 01:08:50.900
be on call. So I'm like texting a talk and I was Stephen Hawking. Yeah.

1138
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.070
You know? Yeah, yeah. But yeah, it's like go back to yeah. Uh,

1139
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.320
the agenda for two days. Yes.

1140
01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:00.380
They apparently wanted to give him a better voice and he didn't want it.

1141
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.690
He was like [inaudible] they're more Siri like voice. Yeah. Sorry,

1142
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.910
I didn't understand that. You know,

1143
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.990
you can get Siri in nice English voice in his videos. He was not interested.

1144
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:15.440
He likes that he liked while he was alive at that weird,

1145
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:19.940
rough computer voice. He, I mean, from what I heard about him, he just,

1146
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:24.920
his sense of humor was, was very funny and he's just a very sarcastic guy.

1147
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.790
Seem you seem like a really interesting guy who also really likes strip clubs.

1148
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.700
No, I did not. Yeah. Eric Weinstein told me about that. Remember? See,

1149
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:38.600
there was a really interesting article written about him that, uh,

1150
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:43.100
he would love to get wheeled into a strip club he liked, he enjoyed it and like,

1151
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:46.340
like being there, but I guess that completely makes sense.

1152
01:09:46.341 --> 01:09:51.341
If you lost control of your body or still were attracted to women,

1153
01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.500
you can still found them amazing. You'd,

1154
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.860
you'd want to see them naked dancing in front of you. Right. It's like,

1155
01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:02.180
it makes total sense. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Cause you want like, I mean,

1156
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.830
exactly. You can't get it, but you can at least be there. Yeah.

1157
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.541
What do you got Jamie?

1158
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:13.541
There it is a claimed physicist talking a regular in California strip joint.

1159
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.090
He's irregular. Wow. That's hilarious. That's pretty awesome.

1160
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:19.910
Make it rain.

1161
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:24.440
I am proud to say that I saw him speak when I was in college. Oh wow.

1162
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.440
No kidding. Yeah, look at him. When all this trippers hollow.

1163
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.290
Peter's Stephen Hawkings goes to her clubs. Look at him. That's amazing.

1164
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.880
What does it look at? A smile. He looks so happy. He looks so happy.

1165
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:42.920
Who are we to hate of the Lilly? Yeah. Um,

1166
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:47.120
I would, I would imagine that would be a very trying 30 days.

1167
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.590
So when it came, when it was over, was your voice normal? Did it,

1168
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.230
did it come back? Did it, it was different,

1169
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.990
but I was warned that it would sound a little different.

1170
01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.270
Like you sound different now than you sounded before the operation.

1171
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:01.850
I'm used to what I sound like now,

1172
01:11:01.851 --> 01:11:03.950
so I almost forgot what I sounded like before,

1173
01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:08.450
but I think maybe a semitone differently, you know?

1174
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:13.500
Um, but you know, it's like you just get used to new you.

1175
01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:17.970
Like if I was going to be half cyborg, half half man, I'd probably just be like,

1176
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.480
okay, yeah, this is me. You know, like you just get to that when you've,

1177
01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:26.160
when you've situated in that the half sidebar,

1178
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:29.490
things can be really weird when people start replacing legs.

1179
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:33.390
Because I think if you could develop a leg,

1180
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:38.040
like a cybernetic leg that's better than a normal leg, someone's gonna say,

1181
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:41.670
chop my leg off and give me one of those, someone,

1182
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.230
someone somewhere is going to do that.

1183
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:48.690
And if that becomes seamless and you know, you get some Steve Austin,

1184
01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:53.670
$6 million man type shit going on, things he'd get real weird. That's uh,

1185
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:57.660
what, um, you've all talks about and holidays, you know,

1186
01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:58.920
that whole idea that like,

1187
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:02.340
first we use the technology to heal the people that need it,

1188
01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:07.080
but at the end of the day it's going to be used for advancing humanity.

1189
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:12.120
You know, like there's like, you know, the, the, you want to save,

1190
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.970
you want to help people that, that need to walk first, right? Yeah.

1191
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.000
But then it's like, just like you said,

1192
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:23.360
if it becomes very normal than the upgrades will be used as well to advance the

1193
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:27.300
people that don't need it. Yeah.

1194
01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:30.330
And then we get to the point where you're unscrewing your head,

1195
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.240
taking your brain out. And it's,

1196
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:38.400
that's also what's interesting is that when you say that, you know,

1197
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.690
now it sounds crazy. It does, but it doesn't, yeah.

1198
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.420
Well to you it doesn't, but to me it doesn't either.

1199
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.800
But that's exactly what you're saying about the phone too. You know,

1200
01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:52.680
or like what you're showing someone in the Victorian age. Yeah.

1201
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.090
It's about the internet. Right. And when we get to that place,

1202
01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.470
it's gonna, you know, it's gonna feel like,

1203
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.440
Oh well everyone, everyone did itself.

1204
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.740
Like when Luke Skywalker got his arm chopped off and star Wars and they put

1205
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:11.730
another arm on really quick, remember? Yup. Yeah.

1206
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:16.690
That shit's going to happen. I believe it. Yeah. I don't think that's, I don't,

1207
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:20.010
I don't think that's too far away. I think that's probably 25 years away.

1208
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.030
I hope so. I think, I hope so too. Cause we're,

1209
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.370
we are seeing some pretty advanced, um,

1210
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:29.070
artificial limbs. So, um,

1211
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:32.910
there was a guy that got his leg and his arm bit off by a shark and I met him at

1212
01:13:32.911 --> 01:13:37.110
the comedy store and he has this carbon fiber arm and a carbon fiber leg.

1213
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.280
The guy doesn't walk with a limp.

1214
01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:42.390
He walks completely normal and he shook my hand. I was scared cause I was like,

1215
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:46.030
don't crush my hand cause he's got some fucking iron man hand and he's,

1216
01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:50.490
he should have like the uh, does it look like a hand or is it just a metal hand?

1217
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.971
Well yeah,

1218
01:13:50.971 --> 01:13:55.971
like a black carbon fiber hand that articulates it moves cause they're starting

1219
01:13:57.481 --> 01:14:00.950
to make it where you can feel. Yeah. So I think they are. Yeah.

1220
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.840
So that way it's right there. Wow.

1221
01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:05.790
Yeah we've actually done that to the next level. Right.

1222
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:09.630
It's like when you can make an arm that has nerve joints into this artificially

1223
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:14.200
until it artificially connecting with your, with your brain. Yeah.

1224
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:17.980
He's, he's an interesting character because that arm,

1225
01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:21.880
I mean it's, you w you really get this.

1226
01:14:21.881 --> 01:14:26.380
I am robot kind of feel from seeing his arm and his leg.

1227
01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.520
Like, cause it's,

1228
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:31.570
I mean I'm sure he would tell you that he's much better off with his arm and his

1229
01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:35.260
leg back. But when you see the guy walk around, man,

1230
01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:39.550
he fucking just walks around. He looks normal. I mean,

1231
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:43.150
what they used to have in comparison to what they have today.

1232
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.990
I mean it is leaps and bounds and I'm sure the future.

1233
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.440
So that's his actual arm. Wow. That's what it looks like. Wow.

1234
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.870
Shark bit his fucking arm off. That's a, I mean, I,

1235
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.940
I wouldn't want to put the arm and Lake yeah,

1236
01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:02.800
that was a hungry shark asshole. Yeah. It's a, you know,

1237
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:06.190
it's interesting cause this is that we're in,

1238
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.130
we're in this new frontier of what's possible.

1239
01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:12.640
I'm sure they're upgrading his stuff all the time as well, you know, and what's,

1240
01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:15.370
or what's available to someone like him. Yeah.

1241
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:20.440
But it's exciting to see, like when you, when you like, you know,

1242
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:24.880
when you see it firsthand and you see them not living and you know where we're

1243
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:26.870
going and I'll like, Oh,

1244
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:30.910
like I'm saying like all the scifi films that we see that some of them are going

1245
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.620
to have very real, you know, scenarios in our life for sure. Yeah.

1246
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:36.730
Yeah. Um,

1247
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.740
are you a technology geek outside of the sort of, uh,

1248
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.840
thinking about the body as in, I mean, I am of course, I,

1249
01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.380
I'd definitely say I'm a tech geek. Yeah. Because you kind of have to, right?

1250
01:15:50.381 --> 01:15:52.780
If you're, you create electronic music. Yes.

1251
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.350
I'm a gadget guy too. You know,

1252
01:15:56.351 --> 01:16:01.210
I love like gadgets and trying new little things that are out there. Um,

1253
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.460
you know, like I just want to try it all.

1254
01:16:03.461 --> 01:16:07.990
I want to like experience things in different ways to enhance my experience

1255
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:12.250
overall. Yeah. Creating music electronically is,

1256
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:16.480
it's kind of polarizing to some people though, right?

1257
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.960
Because I mean, I think your music sounds fucking amazing,

1258
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.090
but for some people they want to hear an actual sanding of a guitar,

1259
01:16:25.091 --> 01:16:27.550
the wrap of a drum, the, you know,

1260
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.620
like people have this like very narrow ideas. Music is, is true. And,

1261
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.080
uh, you know, I,

1262
01:16:34.081 --> 01:16:38.790
I think that there's two layers to two,

1263
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.070
like electronic music, you know, you have to first of all make the music.

1264
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:46.660
So you're, you're, you are making the music in one form or another with,

1265
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:51.610
and I don't actually don't use like live instrumentation so much,

1266
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:55.180
but sometimes I do. And um, because I come from that world,

1267
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:59.440
it's natural for me to bring a guitar in, but it's not necessary. You know,

1268
01:16:59.441 --> 01:17:01.660
everything can be made from a laptop.

1269
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.670
You don't even actually need very much anymore.

1270
01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.400
What can make you can make like a garage or something. Yeah.

1271
01:17:07.401 --> 01:17:10.040
I garage band I guess would be the rudimentary phone. Do you use

1272
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.430
<v 0>windows? Do you use a Mac? I use, uh, um, Apple, um,</v>

1273
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:17.640
Ableton live and uh, that's Ableton live as a software. Yeah.

1274
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.530
So like the doll that I use to create the music, but you know,

1275
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.000
you can literally, you don't even need a keyboard. You don't even need a mouse.

1276
01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:29.750
Well, if you really, you just need a hard drive of samples or you know,

1277
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:34.751
having enough that you can build off of and your keyboard becomes,

1278
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:37.990
you know, you know how,

1279
01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:42.500
how you're going to paint your notes in so you can make it that streamline if

1280
01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:45.980
you want it to. Now having like this big studios, it's great.

1281
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:48.950
And I have a really beautiful studio in my house,

1282
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.460
but it's more about the energy of the room for me.

1283
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:54.340
Like I want to go in there like going,

1284
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:57.830
I'm going to work 12 hours and I want to be excited to do that all the way until

1285
01:17:57.831 --> 01:17:58.664
whatever time.

1286
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.750
It's that Las Vegas Vegas effect of being in a club or being in a casino and you

1287
01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:03.650
don't know what time it is.

1288
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:08.390
I want that same effect in my room to be like energized and also energized

1289
01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:11.570
people that come in. But if I'm on the road, like, you know,

1290
01:18:11.571 --> 01:18:15.920
making an idea and just like strip lining it, I don't really need much,

1291
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:20.120
you know? And I think that's like the setup right there. Oh yeah. Dude,

1292
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.520
what a fucking bad ass room.

1293
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:27.850
So I'll call a carpet. Yeah, I call it when I want that. It's a,

1294
01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:32.130
you know, blue, obviously my, my book's called blue, uh,

1295
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:37.100
is my favorite color and I want the, the, the feeling to feel,

1296
01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:40.440
uh, futuristic. So it's the neon future cave. Now,

1297
01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:44.220
if you look up at the ceiling, if you scroll up in that picture, whatever, uh,

1298
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:47.330
you'll get to see, maybe it's not in that picture, but I have, yeah,

1299
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:51.860
so you have like these like led lights coming through the ceiling as if you're

1300
01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.850
in like a cave. And um,

1301
01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.630
and then you're looking at everything in this enormous projection screens that

1302
01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:03.440
what that is. Yeah. And it's, and it seats a ton of people. So, you know,

1303
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.030
just, I mean, I'm releasing my,

1304
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.960
my next singles with the Backstreet boys so I can fit all the Backstreet boys

1305
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:13.160
skies in my house and my studio and we can, you know,

1306
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:17.750
do what we do. Have you always lived in Vegas? Um,

1307
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:20.270
I moved to Vegas in 20.

1308
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:26.210
I bought my house in 2013. What made you move to Vegas? Um,

1309
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:30.170
I was living in LA and my career broke in Los Angeles,

1310
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:33.860
so there's no doubt about it being in LA for, as a musician, as an artist,

1311
01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.560
someone in music. That's where you, if you want a break,

1312
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:40.370
you can have all the connections and build your network here fastest than

1313
01:19:40.371 --> 01:19:44.660
anywhere else. In the world. New York, I feel like is the media hub or fashion.

1314
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:49.310
And then LA is as a music hub. And then Atlanta is like the hip hop hub,

1315
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:52.130
Nashville's country. Um,

1316
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:57.430
but I broke in LA and when I started touring 2009,

1317
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:03.440
10, 2008, nine, 10, 11, I was just gone.

1318
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.460
I started, I wasn't like living in LA the way I lived in LA,

1319
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.920
going out to all the places that I love to eat,

1320
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:12.810
all the culture of what LA offs offer.

1321
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.520
I was only there 50 days of the year maybe. So I was like, well,

1322
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:20.180
just sign a residency to in Las Vegas. Um,

1323
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:24.630
when the nightlife boomed for DJs and from 2010,

1324
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:29.130
it was a big shift of, of what nightlife has to offer in Vegas.

1325
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:32.900
And DJs were a big part of that. And I signed a, you know,

1326
01:20:32.901 --> 01:20:35.610
a big residency deal and then I was like, I,

1327
01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:40.170
I mean I'm here more than I am in LA and uh,

1328
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:45.810
you know, it's a good tax situation there. Um, there's no state tax there.

1329
01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:51.420
And, um, I'd have to leave LA, my, my home turf, but I'm not even there. Right.

1330
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.260
So I just moved ship entirely bought a house,

1331
01:20:55.261 --> 01:20:58.350
bought the dream situation house. That's another, like,

1332
01:20:58.351 --> 01:21:00.720
there's so many perks for me because LA,

1333
01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:04.680
I had like a 2020 500 square foot, maybe 3000 square foot house,

1334
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:07.110
which was nice million dollar house in the Hills.

1335
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.430
And that's when I finally made it before I lived in an apartment on DeLong,

1336
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.090
prenatal central, uh, East Hollywood, I guess Hollywood and vine area,

1337
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.480
$900 for 900 square feet. That's where it all started for me.

1338
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.150
That's when I first moved to LA and started making money.

1339
01:21:21.151 --> 01:21:23.490
It took time to get there. I kind of talk about that in the book,

1340
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:26.790
like the hardships to get there because, um,

1341
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.060
one of the best lessons that my father, uh,

1342
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.590
shared with me was this tough love attitude where, you know,

1343
01:21:34.591 --> 01:21:38.040
he was a very rich, flamboyant restaurant tour.

1344
01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:42.570
Benihanas had fancy cars, was very flashy, very American.

1345
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.760
Uh, he's the one that broke through the American dream. The, the Japanese,

1346
01:21:47.761 --> 01:21:50.760
the one of the few Japanese people that actually did that. So he's just like,

1347
01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.930
yo, look at me with, you know, hot flying, hot air balloons, uh,

1348
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:58.110
offshore boat racing and, and then like, you know,

1349
01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:01.230
I guess the traditional thing is like the, he would financially help me,

1350
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:03.300
you know, because he has the money to do that.

1351
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.320
But one of the most powerful things he did was he just financially,

1352
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:11.190
he didn't financially help me and I had to figure though my issues,

1353
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.660
my hardships, my business plans, my, uh,

1354
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.550
financial issues that I was going through on my own. So I had to start there.

1355
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:21.760
And because of that, I was able to succeed through some of the hard stuff and,

1356
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:25.740
and have that drive to want to make money for myself.

1357
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.050
So during that time in LA, you know, I'm kind of digressing here. Uh, you know,

1358
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:36.051
I lived in this apartment for about seven years and then,

1359
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:40.860
um, the deejaying, my first priority of my record label, that was like,

1360
01:22:40.861 --> 01:22:44.070
why I moved to LA, sign artists, develop them, help them.

1361
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.380
And then I was deejaying,

1362
01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:52.190
building the brand of the label and we created a really cool scene in LA and we

1363
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:56.880
were breaking some of the biggest acts, not breaking where we were.

1364
01:22:56.881 --> 01:23:00.960
We were the underground hot bed, you know,

1365
01:23:00.961 --> 01:23:04.770
like let's say like the comedy shop or something where like everyone would hang

1366
01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:08.740
out. So like lady Gaga was playing for free at our shows.

1367
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.520
Scrillex was there every single week. Um, we'll,

1368
01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:15.910
I am was dancing in the corner and then going back to the studio making black

1369
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:20.800
IPS hits because 2007 through 2009 black IPS were the biggest artists.

1370
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.900
LMF fail was there every single week. This is,

1371
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:24.520
and then they became the biggest acts.

1372
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:30.010
So we're like this hotbed of music culture in LA, but it was by parties. Wow.

1373
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:33.250
And, and then that's how I, you know,

1374
01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:36.670
made a name for myself is that I was throwing these parties and I was deejaying

1375
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:38.590
them, but no one cared that I was deejaying them.

1376
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:42.760
The only reason why they were going is because these acts would always be there

1377
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:48.070
and then the celebs would come in. You know, that's when I met DJ am in 2006,

1378
01:23:48.071 --> 01:23:51.520
2005 and then we got together and he brought the celebs in.

1379
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:56.470
So now like there's a spotlight of pre TMZ kind of like, Oh,

1380
01:23:56.471 --> 01:23:59.500
what's going on over here with this electro sound with what you have,

1381
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.550
like daft punk, their unmasked and uh,

1382
01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.310
and like really cool underground like kid Cuddy there and Connie West coming

1383
01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:06.490
through.

1384
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:09.760
And then there's Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton and all these different people

1385
01:24:09.761 --> 01:24:11.170
all like in this small room.

1386
01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.180
And people wanted to know what the hell is going on in the,

1387
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:15.870
in that little space. And this is what's,

1388
01:24:15.871 --> 01:24:20.290
what's great about this time was that it was pre uh, Snapchat,

1389
01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:23.020
pre social media. It was just my space.

1390
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:26.200
So you had to be in that room to experience what was happening.

1391
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.800
So people would fly in to just be in that room to hear what was the cutting edge

1392
01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:36.460
sound that was going to be eventually popular. You know,

1393
01:24:36.461 --> 01:24:39.430
people wanted to play in that little 300, 400 cap room.

1394
01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.940
Did you film any of that? There was always one guy filming.

1395
01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:46.690
I mean that's a thing because back then there was no phones that could film was

1396
01:24:46.691 --> 01:24:50.890
like razors and you know, like, like blackberries, you know,

1397
01:24:50.891 --> 01:24:54.520
you just can't get kicks. Yeah. It's like, it's the worst quality.

1398
01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:59.020
So a guy who has to bring a cam quarter in, right. And this one guy,

1399
01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:03.100
Glen Jaman, he would always film those parties, would have Cobra snake. My,

1400
01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:06.730
he was my best friend who would just run with me to all the shows and parties.

1401
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.260
Uh, cause back then I would play like five nights a week in LA. And, um,

1402
01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.620
and he would photograph and he would document.

1403
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.700
And that's how you'd find out about the lifestyle, the, the,

1404
01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:20.770
the clothes like this, the look of, you know,

1405
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:25.420
what it was to be on Coalinga and Hollywood and that whole, you know,

1406
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.690
and then you see kid Cuddy there and you'll see Connie West there and you'll

1407
01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:32.050
see, you know, whoever else that was just like hanging out,

1408
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:37.210
absorbing the culture that we're, that we're like creating there. And,

1409
01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:42.430
uh, and then eventually that was what got me out of my debt bubble.

1410
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:43.751
That was, you know,

1411
01:25:43.751 --> 01:25:46.760
cause I was a pretty bad businessmen when I was running and good luck.

1412
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.230
I thought I was doing shit right. Uh,

1413
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.200
because I signing acts that actually mattered and were taking off,

1414
01:25:53.201 --> 01:25:57.460
but I just didn't know how to, you know, I was just spending spending like, yo,

1415
01:25:57.790 --> 01:26:01.630
keep going with this and then, uh, you know, this are bringing the right people.

1416
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.010
And I was like, okay, I need to build a team. I need to build some

1417
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:07.490
<v 1>people that have some sensibilities in this world. One creative.</v>

1418
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:11.780
And then the deejaying just took off as I was getting more into production,

1419
01:26:11.781 --> 01:26:15.860
getting more to remixing, getting more into, uh, creating myself as an artist.

1420
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.730
And then that is what people know about me now. But really it was,

1421
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:24.210
people knew about me because of the DIMOC and, and it's, uh, it's,

1422
01:26:24.211 --> 01:26:28.010
it's interesting how sometimes the evolutions of the errors of who you are,

1423
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:32.900
you know, have changed over time. Um, and then, you know,

1424
01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:37.220
fast forward 2013 is when I was like, okay,

1425
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:42.080
I got, yeah LA help grow me to who I am, my management,

1426
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:45.590
my label, there's still LA, you know, um,

1427
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:48.650
but Steve Aoki is going to be Las Vegas.

1428
01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.990
So I would love to see a documentary on that to see the,

1429
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.770
that would be an amazing film. Like to see how that all was going down.

1430
01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:00.610
Right. You know, like if you have video footage,

1431
01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.560
did you get somebody to edit that and put together a documentary of that time

1432
01:27:03.561 --> 01:27:08.280
period? Cause it's a really interesting time period. Yeah. You know, for the,

1433
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:13.310
the creation of electronic music and what you pointed out that's so interesting

1434
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:19.750
was that 2010 was really somewhere around the time Vegas started becoming these,

1435
01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.380
these electronic music shows started taking precedent.

1436
01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.540
They're the biggest fucking thing.

1437
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:30.060
I was staying at the Wynn recently and uh,

1438
01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:35.440
the hotel room we were at was overlooking the pool and I forget who it was that

1439
01:27:36.051 --> 01:27:40.340
was playing there, but it was fucking chaos.

1440
01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:43.460
And like you don't, and especially when you're, you know,

1441
01:27:43.461 --> 01:27:46.370
we're all like above like high above looking down on the pool,

1442
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:49.700
we'll tell room for inside of you. It was so crazy.

1443
01:27:49.701 --> 01:27:53.150
It was so loud and so crazy and there was everybody's in the pool.

1444
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:59.510
It was fucking madness. And you go on, this never existed.

1445
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.020
I mean that's true to Vegas for a long time. This is a new thing.

1446
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.700
It is a new thing over the last nine years. Exactly. And it's overtaken Vegas.

1447
01:28:07.701 --> 01:28:08.361
Everywhere you go,

1448
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:12.920
there's these gigantic billboards with either your face on it or whatever.

1449
01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:16.790
Other DJs in this place and who's the guy with a fucking marshmallow head?

1450
01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:20.840
Is a guy a marshmallow that's marshmallow. Yeah. Okay.

1451
01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:24.830
That's like the unknown comic that's got a Marsh ball on his head.

1452
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.020
But there's so many that I didn't even know who that was.

1453
01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.670
Like my kids were explaining to me,

1454
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:31.010
my 11 year old was explaining to me marshmallow. I'm like,

1455
01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:35.870
how the fuck do you know who Marshall doesn't? And we're there and it's just,

1456
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.740
it's everyone that's going out in Vegas.

1457
01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.690
But it used to be Vegas used to be like a cultural weird void.

1458
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:49.490
Yeah, right. You would have some big acts that would come through there,

1459
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.210
but it always seemed like they were at the end of their run. Right? Yeah.

1460
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:55.940
You had to be at the end of your run. Yeah.

1461
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:59.360
Like when Michael Jackson was considering doing Vegas, I was like, okay.

1462
01:28:59.390 --> 01:29:02.670
He's like finally saying that this the right, or you know,

1463
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:05.580
it's like you see how to like Celine Dion, you know,

1464
01:29:05.581 --> 01:29:09.120
she did a residency in Vegas. You're like, ah, she's probably just tired.

1465
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:13.860
Donny Marie. Yeah. Perfect. Manilow Barry Manilow, you know,

1466
01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:17.670
like carrot top does a residency there. I mean, he's doing really well.

1467
01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:20.970
It's not, it's not a knock. Yeah, no, it's not. It's really not. But it's,

1468
01:29:20.971 --> 01:29:22.320
that's what it was.

1469
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:26.550
But then all of a sudden they became electronic music and it's like, wow,

1470
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:30.990
what is happening? Like the, you know, these things are enormous.

1471
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:36.140
Like there's so much bigger than any other kind of event that you have in Vegas,

1472
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:39.540
other than like massive sporting events like [inaudible] or something. Yeah.

1473
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:44.490
Well, it definitely, it's, it's provoked by energy too, you know, like,

1474
01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:48.750
and it's, and that's infectious. Yes. Well it's a fucking great time.

1475
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:51.150
Like if you go to see Barry Manilow or you know,

1476
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:54.570
whatever who have no knock on them, but you know what I'm saying, it's like,

1477
01:29:54.571 --> 01:29:57.060
I'm sure it's fine. It's mellow. It's like whatever you're into,

1478
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.100
but when you're seated, you know,

1479
01:29:59.101 --> 01:30:01.950
like you're seated for a reason cause you're there to like sit and just enjoy.

1480
01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:03.150
Yes. At a,

1481
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:08.470
there's no seats at a Steve Aoki show there are there like the tables and stuff,

1482
01:30:08.581 --> 01:30:12.660
but no one's sitting down. Right. That's the, that there'll be strange to see.

1483
01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:14.670
So unless there was passed out drunk or something,

1484
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:18.780
but for the most part everyone's standing and jumping and being part of the

1485
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:21.720
moment and that's, that's my job. Yeah.

1486
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:25.920
I need to make sure everyone's attention is on me and then I'm taking them to

1487
01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:30.600
this next level. I've always wondered what it's like to live in Vegas though.

1488
01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:32.640
Like I've never lived there in my, you know,

1489
01:30:32.641 --> 01:30:35.070
my good friend Dana white lives there. He loves it there. He's,

1490
01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:40.070
he raves about it, but I've always liked Vegas. Okay. So

1491
01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:44.720
<v 0>me, so I'm an LA guy, right? Like my heart and like, you know,</v>

1492
01:30:44.721 --> 01:30:47.990
I love Los Angeles. I know LA so well.

1493
01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.170
And you know with LA you have your limitations. It's Los Angeles. You,

1494
01:30:52.171 --> 01:30:54.740
you can't like, if you want to build your dream house,

1495
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:57.650
you cannot have a lot of money to do that. In Vegas.

1496
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:02.330
When I moved there in 2013 I got a sick deal.

1497
01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:04.910
I bought my house at 16,000 square feet. Whoa.

1498
01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:10.040
2.8 million I think. Two point. Yeah. 2.8 it was a short sale.

1499
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.970
Has a total steal. I mean like the guts were not good.

1500
01:31:13.971 --> 01:31:16.040
Like it was like one of those like prop homes almost.

1501
01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:21.080
So I had to Regan like I spent like 5 million into the house and it was more

1502
01:31:21.081 --> 01:31:24.710
about building my own dream house as I would want to have it.

1503
01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:29.560
I have a foam pit in there with a trampoline room. I have, I, I, I,

1504
01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:32.420
the pool in my backyard was too far away from my house.

1505
01:31:32.421 --> 01:31:36.770
So I filled it in and I built a pool at 16 feet deep right next to my,

1506
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:40.910
um, uh, patio as 20 feet up.

1507
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:45.080
I built the patio out so that way I can jump into the pool from, from the top.

1508
01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.050
And I'm like kid and basically a big kid. Um,

1509
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:51.200
and I just think about how I want to make my house fun,

1510
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:54.860
interactive for the artists that come there for me. Uh,

1511
01:31:54.861 --> 01:31:57.560
I have a S I've a fun gym. I've, you know,

1512
01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.810
I got my own like chest station, backgammon station, have a poker room,

1513
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.210
you know. Um, it's,

1514
01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:09.100
it's the most hospitable house, you know, and I have all this space.

1515
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:11.920
I have like a big shoe room. I'm big shoe collector.

1516
01:32:11.921 --> 01:32:16.570
I got this crazy library with books and records, you know, and I've,

1517
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:21.310
I've a Bruce Lee mirror room, a mirror room. It's my closet,

1518
01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:25.030
but it's just like you walk in and it's like led strips everywhere with mirrors

1519
01:32:25.031 --> 01:32:29.770
and you know, I'm just having fun. I'm having fun with my house.

1520
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:35.080
There is a mirror room. I have some really crazy, really beautiful RA,

1521
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:39.400
but I got this amazing Banksy piece. Um, and so, you know,

1522
01:32:39.401 --> 01:32:41.560
I've been starting to collect art. There's my shoe remote.

1523
01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:47.110
So you get mad if people buy shit. Well, I bought it from him. Oh, you met him.

1524
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:51.670
Tell us what he looks like. He is a, he's a girl. Ooh,

1525
01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:55.630
I'm just kidding. I never met him, but uh, I, you know, I,

1526
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:59.530
I got into through is some people to get into,

1527
01:32:59.531 --> 01:33:04.150
cause he definitely a real person. Uh, you know, I don't know how Brown is that.

1528
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:09.130
Yeah. It's someone in 2019 is managed to stay that secretive and really kind of

1529
01:33:09.131 --> 01:33:13.480
amazing. Credible because he's a cultural phenomenon. Yeah. I mean he's,

1530
01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:17.740
I mean everybody knows who Banksy is. Yeah. Right. Or you know,

1531
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:21.040
of young C I should say, but no one knows who he is, which is crazy.

1532
01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.920
Who the fuck has ever pulled that off, right.

1533
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:29.080
Unique human being. Yeah, it's true. How does that work?

1534
01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.520
How does not sure do that? I think you have, I mean it's, it's like his,

1535
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:38.640
he's always seen me to find a way to troll people in a social or political

1536
01:33:39.911 --> 01:33:44.500
critique. Um, just like he did with, uh, the, um,

1537
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.090
the art sale of, of the shredded painting Yas. How amazing was that? Yeah,

1538
01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.070
that was pretty crazy. Yeah.

1539
01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:55.840
But watch those people after they paid it and see the, the thing me dropped out.

1540
01:33:55.841 --> 01:33:58.210
But I'll read though. Let me ask you this though.

1541
01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.130
I don't want to go too deep into this,

1542
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:04.900
but because I don't know if I'm like stepping on anyone's toes here, but

1543
01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:10.750
if this is really Selfridges or you know, like a real auction house,

1544
01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:14.440
aren't they gonna look at the painting or the piece,

1545
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:18.520
are they going to open up the frame and make sure there's not some weird drill

1546
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:21.940
going through? Like I think they would ever expect that to be the case. I mean,

1547
01:34:21.970 --> 01:34:25.120
but your but your and your antique, you should be checking everything,

1548
01:34:25.121 --> 01:34:27.430
making sure everything's authentic now. Well,

1549
01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:31.420
if it's an authentic piece and it somehow or another,

1550
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:36.070
some reliable source brings it to them as an authentic piece.

1551
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.270
They just accept the fact they don't check the details of the piece.

1552
01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:43.930
I mean what can they do? Wow. By the way,

1553
01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:46.410
I'll take that and fucking glue that bitch back together again.

1554
01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.680
Leave it that way. You want to like that?

1555
01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:53.080
That's like what makes the value is that you like to actually have it hanging

1556
01:34:53.081 --> 01:34:56.410
there. That's why you want it in your house. Really. You want it just like that?

1557
01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:00.920
Yeah. Look at the people's face. Sometimes. I forget that I'm on the phone.

1558
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:05.810
Oh no. Oh no. Thurston we've lost the piece.

1559
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:09.770
Yeah. You know, I, I wish like,

1560
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:11.840
it's funny that we're talking about this cause sometimes I forget like,

1561
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:16.160
you know, we were having a chat and uh, I realize,

1562
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:19.970
Oh there's a lot of people listening in on this so maybe I should give away some

1563
01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:23.360
of the stuff that I've learned about it. But, um, yeah. Anyways,

1564
01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:27.170
I'll leave it there. Well he's a definitely unique human. Yeah.

1565
01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:32.030
So let's get back to Vegas so you don't feel weird living there.

1566
01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.570
Cause the one thing that I've felt about Vegas is I always enjoy going there and

1567
01:35:35.571 --> 01:35:38.640
enjoy leaving more. I'm like gimme home give me,

1568
01:35:38.890 --> 01:35:41.510
well that's because you go there with that intention. Like for me,

1569
01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:46.250
I built my compound, right? So it is home. It's 100% home. It's,

1570
01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.330
it's exciting to be home.

1571
01:35:47.331 --> 01:35:50.000
And the best part about it is like first I built the compound,

1572
01:35:50.001 --> 01:35:53.540
this dream house to invite. Like all my friends,

1573
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:56.870
I'm a hospitable guy so I like I want artists that come there.

1574
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:58.010
My friends would come there,

1575
01:35:58.011 --> 01:36:02.810
stay there with me in a family and the next best thing was calling my mom and my

1576
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:07.310
sister who lived together and I said, will you move to Vegas?

1577
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:10.910
Will you be in my neighborhood? And they said yes.

1578
01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:13.970
And that was the best money I spent was by my mama house. And they, you know,

1579
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.140
like they live around the corner.

1580
01:36:15.141 --> 01:36:18.620
My mom was cooking like by the time I'm home I see my mom all the time and I

1581
01:36:18.621 --> 01:36:19.970
never had the opportunity.

1582
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:25.750
We had this 10 plus year gap where I see her like once every six months because

1583
01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:31.040
I'm just touring like a beast right now. I just see my family a lot more,

1584
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:35.450
you know, like so in a way I'm trying to bring my family all to Vegas.

1585
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.790
My cousins moved from uh,

1586
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:42.680
from the East coast with his wife and his mom to Vegas, you know,

1587
01:36:42.681 --> 01:36:46.640
before even my mom. So I have my, my cousin there, I, my mom,

1588
01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:49.760
my sister there with their daughter. Uh,

1589
01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.490
my brother Kevin who is a restaurant tour as well.

1590
01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:56.510
He's planning to make the move cause we're going to open up some restaurants on

1591
01:36:56.511 --> 01:36:57.344
the strip.

1592
01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.970
Dan did you got your fingers in a lot of pies and on that pie note I do have

1593
01:37:01.971 --> 01:37:06.580
pizza Aoki. Yes I do. I have 19 kitchens now. Whoa. Yeah,

1594
01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:10.670
it's been about about a year and two months and we're growing at a rapid rate.

1595
01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:14.690
And I would imagine 19 and 19, 19 kitchens of the year,

1596
01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:18.530
most of them are in Los Angeles because that's, you know,

1597
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:22.370
like that's where we kind of broke ground and we were just like opening up

1598
01:37:22.371 --> 01:37:26.900
kitchens and all the areas that that a Postmates was giving us information like,

1599
01:37:26.901 --> 01:37:30.740
yo, this is where it makes sense to do that. So we work with all the, the uh,

1600
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:35.630
delivery hubs and uh, mostly delivery thing or do you yeah,

1601
01:37:35.631 --> 01:37:40.040
I do have two dining locations, but the whole business model is about delivery.

1602
01:37:40.190 --> 01:37:44.300
Really. Yeah. It's all about delivery and uh,

1603
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:48.020
that way my costs are very low and then, um,

1604
01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:52.490
I could be effective. Like I'm not really spending much money on marketing. And,

1605
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:53.600
and what's funny is,

1606
01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:58.380
is that people love to post pizza and pizza Oakey is a pretty fun concept.

1607
01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:02.740
Dude. Fight companion. Pete's Aoki Saturday, let's make it happen. I'll,

1608
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.950
we'll send as many pizza cookies you guys need.

1609
01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:09.510
Like whenever you want a live fight companion for the UFC this Saturday it'd be

1610
01:38:09.511 --> 01:38:13.830
like 11:00 AM in the morning cause it's in ABI Dhabi. So, uh, we'll hit it up.

1611
01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.210
I'll make that happen. Yeah. Alright. What kind of pizza you got man? Oh,

1612
01:38:18.211 --> 01:38:21.450
we got all kinds of pizzas. But most importantly,

1613
01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.160
you know the F the idea of pizza Oki might sound like a gimmick and you're like,

1614
01:38:26.161 --> 01:38:27.180
okay, I'll try it out.

1615
01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:31.410
But 60% of the people or in PCO return,

1616
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.870
so we know that it's quality. You know,

1617
01:38:34.590 --> 01:38:38.910
imagine that you're doing anything half-assed. No, I don't think so. Do you,

1618
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:39.930
do you get, you don't,

1619
01:38:39.931 --> 01:38:43.380
so you have a established essentially like created your own world in Vegas.

1620
01:38:43.381 --> 01:38:47.760
So everyone's there that you know, and you can stick the thing about Vegas,

1621
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:49.470
right as like the allure of the strip,

1622
01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:51.780
but you're kind of removed from that anyway. You don't do drugs,

1623
01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:54.510
you don't drink. Right. You don't fuck around with anything. No. Yeah.

1624
01:38:54.511 --> 01:38:56.280
That's like one of the things that we've taught, like,

1625
01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:00.260
you know when we talked about how I'm sustainable is that you,

1626
01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.530
you have to not do the certain things that make it unsustainable. Right?

1627
01:39:04.531 --> 01:39:08.220
So I never really got into drugs. I do talk about my book,

1628
01:39:08.221 --> 01:39:12.210
my first acid trip when I was 13 but that scared the living shit out of me to

1629
01:39:12.211 --> 01:39:16.620
stay away from anything hallucinogenic and like literally you got 13 so I just

1630
01:39:16.621 --> 01:39:21.450
stay away from drugs. That's a bad time to do acid. It's a very,

1631
01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:25.890
very funny story. But I'm sure it got to the point where I just became this,

1632
01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.200
this uh, straight edge hardcore kid.

1633
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:33.470
I became extremely religious because I was in this like I was 13 I was looking

1634
01:39:34.291 --> 01:39:35.850
up going, I'm going to be fucked for the rest of my life.

1635
01:39:35.851 --> 01:39:38.730
Like when you're on acid, you're like fucking out there.

1636
01:39:38.731 --> 01:39:42.840
You're just so fucked up. And, and when you start thinking like,

1637
01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:44.190
this is how I'm going to be forever,

1638
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:48.210
you're clinging on to anything that can get you out. Right. And for me,

1639
01:39:48.211 --> 01:39:49.290
when I grew up as a kid,

1640
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:53.000
my mom was putting me into like Catholic schools and one of the best thing that

1641
01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:57.850
Catholic schools do is indoctrinate kids on fear. And so,

1642
01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.830
you know like you know,

1643
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:02.610
I remember going up to the drawing board like there was like a a drawing of what

1644
01:40:02.611 --> 01:40:06.930
hell is like, guess who's going there forever. People that don't believe,

1645
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:08.033
you know,

1646
01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:11.640
and you know when you're young you start seeing that and then when you get into

1647
01:40:11.641 --> 01:40:15.810
a place of vulnerability where you're like, where I was,

1648
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:18.420
I was like scared shitless. I was like,

1649
01:40:18.421 --> 01:40:22.170
I'm going to go to an insane award when I'm 13 because I can't get out of this

1650
01:40:22.171 --> 01:40:26.670
acid held trip. How long did it last? I guess like what?

1651
01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:30.600
78 hours. But every second is like a minute, you know,

1652
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.530
cause you cannot sleep, you cannot stop thinking about what you're in.

1653
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:39.270
I mean there is like, it's like this exaggerated emotions.

1654
01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:43.950
Like the first part of my acid trip was like, I was so funny.

1655
01:40:43.951 --> 01:40:46.380
I was laughing at everything. It was like the best thing I ever did. I was like,

1656
01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:48.900
Oh my God, everything is so funny. I'm laughing.

1657
01:40:48.901 --> 01:40:52.560
I'm like in pain cause I'm like, so just laughing at everything.

1658
01:40:52.561 --> 01:40:54.310
Just everything is joyous.

1659
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.510
And then like I went into this upside down world,

1660
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:03.570
like stranger things when I got dropped off at my friend's house and everyone

1661
01:41:04.181 --> 01:41:07.270
went dark and my friends were my friends. 14 he doesn't do drugs.

1662
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.290
So he was just in, his mom was come down, you're okay. Everything's okay.

1663
01:41:12.250 --> 01:41:14.290
He didn't know you want to ask them? No, they knew I was on acid,

1664
01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:18.520
but they're like, you're like, I'm like a 80 pound Japanese kid,

1665
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:22.030
you know, five foot, you know, like a little kid.

1666
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:23.980
Like what the hell am I doing acid for? You know,

1667
01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.890
I do talk about like where that came out. But um, yeah, so like when I was,

1668
01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.440
when I got flipped in that world, then everything was like,

1669
01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.880
I saw street fighter, like fireballs from rye. You coming at me,

1670
01:41:36.881 --> 01:41:39.190
like when I closed, when I closed my highs, it was very,

1671
01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:42.990
very vibrant and fitted. And I mean, it was,

1672
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:46.120
it's a trip for sure. So once you regain sanity,

1673
01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.870
you're like enough of any of this nonsense. Once I was like, Oh, why God,

1674
01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.030
I'm back, this is, this is for real. Like I, I have fucked drugs.

1675
01:41:55.031 --> 01:41:58.360
Fuck this shit. You know, like, and then I was like,

1676
01:41:58.361 --> 01:42:01.300
I'm straight edge cause that's the music I was starting to get into.

1677
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:06.160
And then I was like, I'm all about God and Jesus,

1678
01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:09.070
it's going to save me, you know, like he saved me.

1679
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:13.870
So like as a kid I was very religious going, um, Allen and that, you know,

1680
01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:15.400
start exploring more about the world and,

1681
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.480
and then when more from this face or faith-based concepts of living through life

1682
01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:27.100
to, you know, things that needed me more, I needed to make sense for me.

1683
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.210
Um,

1684
01:42:28.210 --> 01:42:33.040
I'm very much more scientific on like the understanding of how I want to see

1685
01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:37.180
things. Where, where did the change take place? When did it take place? Uh,

1686
01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.440
that would happen to be college and post.

1687
01:42:41.890 --> 01:42:45.850
Where'd you go to school? UC Santa Barbara. So when you went was great air.

1688
01:42:45.851 --> 01:42:49.570
I love Santa Barbara. God, it's like the hidden gem of California, right? Yeah.

1689
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:51.100
So sweet out there. Yeah.

1690
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.850
So you just became educated,

1691
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:57.400
started learning more about things and then, so yeah,

1692
01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:00.730
I don't know if there was like one spark that happened.

1693
01:43:00.731 --> 01:43:05.620
It was just kind of like, I just had questions about why things happen.

1694
01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:09.850
Like w what, what is religion? Like what, you know,

1695
01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.340
you know, how things work in the world, how societies are built. Um,

1696
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.140
did you study theology? A little? A little,

1697
01:43:20.141 --> 01:43:23.320
but I don't know if that would be like the philosophy classes I was taking was

1698
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:27.730
not really the, the crux of it. Sociology was my major.

1699
01:43:27.731 --> 01:43:30.730
I was women's studies and sociology when I was in college. Women's studies.

1700
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:34.980
Yeah. W I would want, yeah, I want to say them out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1701
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:37.400
the bottom of this, I have to say like, strangely enough,

1702
01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:38.890
that's the first thing you think about, right? Why?

1703
01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.680
Why is the guy in women's studies, let's try to understand.

1704
01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:44.793
I mean,

1705
01:43:44.890 --> 01:43:49.030
the reason why I was in that department is because my favorite teachers,

1706
01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:52.220
uh, were the teaching those classes.

1707
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.980
<v 3>So I just was like, all right, I'll try this one. And then I was like, wow,</v>

1708
01:43:54.981 --> 01:43:58.190
this is actually pretty interesting. I'll try another one. And um,

1709
01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.360
and then I was like, well, I'll just,

1710
01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:03.020
I'll finish off the nature [inaudible] and uh, you know,

1711
01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.470
I'd have to say like the stuff that I learned in school,

1712
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:09.890
it's in large part of how I kind of looked through,

1713
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:14.540
kind of like navigate through my life. Like sociology. I am a sociologist,

1714
01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:18.710
I want to study people like why they do certain things, you know,

1715
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.920
like how do I navigate them in different directions? Well,

1716
01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.720
and then you've become a purveyor of great fun.

1717
01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:32.220
Like that's essentially what you do professionally, right? I mean,

1718
01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:37.100
you give people a great time. Like your shows are this wild,

1719
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:42.670
extremely energetic experience for people and they leave.

1720
01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.070
There is a certain level of transformants right? You know,

1721
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:51.020
I've watched some of your shit online and you do these enormous crowds,

1722
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:51.381
man,

1723
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:56.090
and it's so Epic and you see all those people going fucking crazy and dancing

1724
01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:59.300
along to your shit. I mean, it's gotta be a wild,

1725
01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:04.220
wild feeling knowing that you're giving this really positive experiences.

1726
01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:09.590
Thousands and thousands of people that are just roaring along to your music

1727
01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:15.980
while yeah, no, as you say, I'm like, you know, getting all like goosebumps.

1728
01:45:16.290 --> 01:45:21.200
Yeah, I know. Cause it is exactly what you're saying and that's why, um,

1729
01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:25.220
I guess you could say I'm addicted to that and because I care so much about that

1730
01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:30.320
I have to be sustainable. You know, it goes back to what we were talking about.

1731
01:45:30.321 --> 01:45:32.540
Like what do I need to do as you do too.

1732
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:37.070
There's no fucking way you could do 250 shows a year and get fucked up 250 days.

1733
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:41.090
Oh yeah. Cause there's a lot, you know, in that business especially, you know,

1734
01:45:41.110 --> 01:45:44.440
the business of electronic dance music, there's a lot of people doing Molly,

1735
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.751
right?

1736
01:45:44.751 --> 01:45:49.070
There's a lot of people doing all kinds of amphetamines and all kinds of crazy

1737
01:45:49.071 --> 01:45:51.770
shit. And you got to think like you do that every night, man.

1738
01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.430
You're going to look like an 80 year old man by the time you're 40 years old

1739
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:58.820
because you've literally burned the candle with a blow torch.

1740
01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.950
You've used that Elon Musk not a flame fucking fucked up candle, you know,

1741
01:46:03.951 --> 01:46:05.000
I mean it's,

1742
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:10.250
but you know what I always say if whenever I have the opportunity is that for

1743
01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:13.970
the people in my crowds and I have to say country by country,

1744
01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:17.690
they're very different as far as like what I think if they're doing drugs or

1745
01:46:17.691 --> 01:46:22.460
not. Where did they do the most drugs? No, I don't think so.

1746
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:25.700
I don't, but you know it's hard. It's like I'm just judging. Right.

1747
01:46:25.701 --> 01:46:27.830
I don't know like what people are doing out there.

1748
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:31.910
I could judge by how interactive they are. That's the best way I can tell.

1749
01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:35.630
Right. If they're like, yeah, if their that's the worst.

1750
01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:38.690
That's the worst subject to play too.

1751
01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.870
It's like literally playing at a cocktail party when their backs are turned to

1752
01:46:41.871 --> 01:46:43.190
you is the same kind of thing for me.

1753
01:46:43.191 --> 01:46:46.640
So if they're already high and they just like lost it in their world,

1754
01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:50.040
like it's no fun for me. Plus I spend so much

1755
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.340
<v 0>time making like my set so interactive,</v>

1756
01:46:53.341 --> 01:46:58.270
so engaging and entertaining. Like it's a bit disrespectful.

1757
01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:02.070
Yeah, it all. But like, you know, some people are going to do it.

1758
01:47:02.071 --> 01:47:04.350
You're not going to be like the Debbie downer and be like, yo, everyone,

1759
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:08.040
all drugs get the hell outta here. You lose 80% of the crowd.

1760
01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:14.340
You said that everyone on drugs at the front guy, they listened to you.

1761
01:47:14.341 --> 01:47:18.060
What percentage do you think in Vegas would leave? Oh God, I don't know.

1762
01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:20.220
I don't know. I don't even want it. I don't even want to know.

1763
01:47:20.221 --> 01:47:25.110
I don't even want to know honestly. I's weed weeds different though.

1764
01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:28.080
Weeds more like chill, you know, like,

1765
01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:31.920
but if you're so like high zonked off your head where you can't,

1766
01:47:31.921 --> 01:47:34.080
you don't even know where you are, what's going on,

1767
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:36.720
then like you just lose the whole experience. I mean,

1768
01:47:36.721 --> 01:47:39.860
a lot of the times people wake up, well, what happened? Well, I mean,

1769
01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.940
what's the point of, of uh, you know, all of the experience. If you,

1770
01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.990
you're so blitzed out of your head, you don't even know what's going on.

1771
01:47:45.991 --> 01:47:50.700
So allegedly during the experience or having a good time at it. Yeah. Yeah.

1772
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:54.910
But I mean that's, it's a really wonderful way to make a living. It's the,

1773
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:59.370
it's like literally the dream come true, you know, to make people happy,

1774
01:47:59.371 --> 01:48:01.140
get to be, I always say like,

1775
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:05.070
I feel like I'm the chef in the kitchen making the food and I go out and I get

1776
01:48:05.071 --> 01:48:08.850
to watch people eat my food and then they're like, Oh, this is really good.

1777
01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:13.230
I'm like, I'm like, yes. You know? Like, I, since I see that feeling,

1778
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.900
I'm like, let's go back and make more food,

1779
01:48:15.901 --> 01:48:19.620
but we got to sprinkle more truffle on that and then let's deliver it and I get

1780
01:48:19.621 --> 01:48:23.670
a C and then they're like, you're the, you're the chef. Like that's me.

1781
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:27.810
You know? So like, it's like I get that luck,

1782
01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:32.900
lucky position to be able to make my music and then share it and hope that they

1783
01:48:34.141 --> 01:48:36.660
have the same feeling that I have sharing it.

1784
01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.820
So how many shows do you do in Vegas and how many shows do you do abroad? Uh,

1785
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:46.950
around 40 in Vegas. So two 10 40 a year. 40 year.

1786
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.500
So how do you, when do you there? Like, how do you, do you still have residency?

1787
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:56.490
You just were at a Hawk, Hassan Omnia um, jewel,

1788
01:48:56.491 --> 01:48:59.130
smaller club of theirs and uh, and what Republic.

1789
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.140
So there's four properties that I play,

1790
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.900
which is nice cause if I had to play 40 shows in one,

1791
01:49:04.650 --> 01:49:08.130
I mean it wouldn't necessarily be that bad because the thing about Vegas is a

1792
01:49:08.131 --> 01:49:10.830
transient crowd, right? So it's always no matter what,

1793
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:15.300
even on one weekend I might be playing possibly three or four times for one

1794
01:49:15.301 --> 01:49:19.560
weekend. Right. And every show I do, whether it's a day party in a club,

1795
01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:24.990
the club is a complete different influx of people coming in because the people

1796
01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:28.470
that saw me at the day party are going to go see Chainsmokers or marshmallow or

1797
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.240
you know, whoever else or Calvin Harris or whatever is playing out on the strip.

1798
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:36.780
The competition is as thick as it gets every night.

1799
01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:41.550
There's the biggest DJs playing alongside, you know, each other.

1800
01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:42.900
It's really amazing.

1801
01:49:42.901 --> 01:49:47.901
If you stop and think about what a crazy change that to an entertainment

1802
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.070
<v 1>environment like the Vegas,</v>

1803
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:54.880
the transformation to that electronic music around, like you said,

1804
01:49:54.881 --> 01:49:59.350
2010 there's not a thing like that that you can point to anywhere else in the

1805
01:49:59.351 --> 01:50:04.300
world where like all of a sudden this one dominant form of entertainment has

1806
01:50:04.301 --> 01:50:09.160
taken over the entire nightlife of a city. Right. Other than a big,

1807
01:50:09.490 --> 01:50:11.920
some sort of big event that's in Vegas,

1808
01:50:11.921 --> 01:50:15.550
the fucking rodeo or the UFC or something like that where everybody comes in to

1809
01:50:15.551 --> 01:50:17.740
see that you guys are what's up?

1810
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:22.930
I mean that is what's up in Vegas. It's the, it dominates it. What,

1811
01:50:22.931 --> 01:50:26.590
how did that happen? That's a crazy thing. It really is. Yeah.

1812
01:50:26.591 --> 01:50:29.710
When you say it like that, I'm like, no one had place.

1813
01:50:29.711 --> 01:50:33.100
Like if you go to New York, if you go to LA, if you go to all, all places,

1814
01:50:33.101 --> 01:50:33.934
all around the world,

1815
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:39.030
there's no other thing that has transformed the nightlife of a city.

1816
01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:44.440
The way electronic music has transformed Vegas transformed, changed.

1817
01:50:44.441 --> 01:50:48.670
Everything went from non-existent to number one with a bullet.

1818
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:52.570
Like there's not even a close second. It's all electronic music.

1819
01:50:52.690 --> 01:50:56.460
Anthony Bordain used to hate it. It was hilarious. He's the Quito.

1820
01:50:56.610 --> 01:50:58.980
He was like [inaudible]. It was old and crotchety.

1821
01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.010
He'd be at these places and all the music and he just wasn't his thing.

1822
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:08.011
But he still was in awe of how that guidance.

1823
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:13.120
I love that guy. I never met him, but he was awesome. Yeah, I miss them.

1824
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:16.930
Yeah. There's a plenty of people that that do go to Vegas or like,

1825
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:19.000
Oh this is so annoying.

1826
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:25.930
Just kids running around like kids. But like young adults running around,

1827
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.530
you know, especially the day like in their bikini's running. I mean, I,

1828
01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:34.750
I suppose probably people would like that, but in any case it's uh,

1829
01:51:35.710 --> 01:51:35.951
yeah.

1830
01:51:35.951 --> 01:51:39.640
It's also different for the casino operators because they're dealing with this

1831
01:51:39.641 --> 01:51:43.360
younger generation of people too and they have to think differently about how

1832
01:51:43.361 --> 01:51:47.650
they're going to get them to, you know, deal what Degas has meant to be.

1833
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:50.650
You know, what the economy is serving. Gambling. Yeah.

1834
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:55.180
Well they're paying to see you as well. And alcohol sales as well.

1835
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:59.740
I think alcohol sales have become a large, large portion of their revenue.

1836
01:51:59.741 --> 01:52:02.320
Right. I think that like, I could be wrong here,

1837
01:52:02.321 --> 01:52:07.300
but the gambling side is actually smaller portion than the everything else.

1838
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.910
I think that's true. I think that's shifted.

1839
01:52:10.110 --> 01:52:13.150
I've read something about that recently that entertainment has become the

1840
01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:18.040
primary revenue source in Vegas, whereas it used to be gambling. Right.

1841
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:23.230
But it's, you know, there's, there's still gambling, but boy,

1842
01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:26.980
it's hard to just convince young people to start gambling.

1843
01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:31.930
It's easy to convince them to start dancing, you know? Yeah. It's like,

1844
01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:35.380
it seems normal. It's natural. There's also, when you're young,

1845
01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.390
you don't have the money to just risk,

1846
01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:42.070
but you have the money to go and like experience fun. Yes. Yeah. You know,

1847
01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.560
like when you're older you're like, okay, I can, I have some of like flexible

1848
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.100
<v 3>income streams I can put down on some blackjack or whatnot.</v>

1849
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:53.240
I would have loved to seen the Sinatra days like Vegas when it was run by the

1850
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:57.970
mob. I'd love to see what those, like the rat pack and say, yeah, he was junior.

1851
01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.270
I just would love to have been in the room and watch,

1852
01:53:00.590 --> 01:53:03.170
watched one of those shows and then you know,

1853
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:06.470
come to today and see how things have changed.

1854
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:08.180
I mean I think that's like the Bourdain thing.

1855
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:12.180
Like he had been there when he was young and then see it change now. Right.

1856
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:16.820
But I am fascinated by change. I don't resist it and uh, I don't,

1857
01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:19.550
I don't say Oh the good old days. That don't mean shit to me.

1858
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:24.200
I am absolutely on the same page as you. Yeah. I'm, I'm interested in, I'm yeah,

1859
01:53:24.201 --> 01:53:27.470
I'm always interested in the next thing. I want to try the next thing. Yeah.

1860
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:30.290
And you know, you want to enhance your experience.

1861
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:34.250
You want to enhance what you're doing to make it serve you better.

1862
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:38.060
But if you went to someone in like 1985 and said, Hey man, guess what?

1863
01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:41.180
2019 electronic music, cause when you do this shit,

1864
01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:43.610
that's going to be everywhere. People would go, what are you talking about?

1865
01:53:43.611 --> 01:53:45.800
Get this guy out of here, man. There's a wall. There's one,

1866
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:50.420
one guy that did say that though, who? Jim Morrison did. He really? Yeah.

1867
01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:54.200
So like he did a prediction. It's like somewhere, I'm sure you can find it,

1868
01:53:54.201 --> 01:53:57.650
but he did a prediction where whenever he was alive, I guess,

1869
01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.080
I guess I would probably back in 76, 60 or 70.

1870
01:54:00.081 --> 01:54:01.720
So he said like the future will be one,

1871
01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:06.410
one person with some sort of computer or something. Uh,

1872
01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.130
it was that's going to be devised electronically or something like that.

1873
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:13.300
And that one person will be making music for people and,

1874
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:17.420
and performing that now. Oh, we'll watch a video. So yes,

1875
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:21.350
I remember this now. Yeah. So I, I forgot what he said,

1876
01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:23.180
but he said something to that effect and it's like,

1877
01:54:23.210 --> 01:54:26.330
it's crazy cause I was what 50 years ago, take it from the beginning.

1878
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:32.040
<v 4>Indigenous to this country are uh, the, uh,</v>

1879
01:54:32.250 --> 01:54:37.250
black music blues and the kind of folk music that was brought over from Europe

1880
01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.690
and it would,

1881
01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:44.280
I guess they call it country music or that kind of West Virginia high lonesome

1882
01:54:44.281 --> 01:54:45.570
sound that those,

1883
01:54:45.571 --> 01:54:50.520
those are the two main streams of root American music.

1884
01:54:50.521 --> 01:54:52.980
There might be others I don't have, but, uh,

1885
01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.480
like 10 years ago with they called rock and roll was kind of a blending of those

1886
01:54:57.481 --> 01:55:02.220
two forms, I guess in four or five years. Uh, the new

1887
01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:07.710
generations music will be, um, it'll have, uh,

1888
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:12.750
a synthesis of those two elements in some third thing. It'll be entire.

1889
01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.580
Maybe it'll be, uh, it might rely heavily on, uh,

1890
01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:23.570
uh, electronics tapes. I can kind of envision maybe, um,

1891
01:55:25.410 --> 01:55:29.580
one person with a, uh, a lot of machines,

1892
01:55:29.581 --> 01:55:33.710
tapes and electronic setups, uh, uh,

1893
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.740
singing or speaking and using machines.

1894
01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:41.950
<v 3>Yes. From what his mindset is of what he can consider is what that would be.</v>

1895
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.040
It's, you know,

1896
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.110
<v 1>he did prints, you know, he did predict. Yeah. I mean,</v>

1897
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:49.710
near where it is, you know, like,

1898
01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:51.930
I think that's what happens when you do acid correctly.

1899
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:58.650
You get those sort of visions. Yeah. Because I mean, also Jim Morrison,

1900
01:55:58.651 --> 01:56:02.970
like you can tell he's, he's such an artist that, you know,

1901
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.080
he could, after the doors, you'd just be himself. Yeah. You know,

1902
01:56:07.081 --> 01:56:09.960
he would have done a Jim Morrison album where he's made all the music,

1903
01:56:09.961 --> 01:56:12.900
he's done everything. He would be exactly what he's saying.

1904
01:56:12.930 --> 01:56:15.480
He's basically predicting what he would have, in my opinion,

1905
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.050
what he would become. And he was probably like 25 in that video,

1906
01:56:19.051 --> 01:56:23.490
which is even crazier. Yeah, I mean, died at 27 that's, that's crazy. Nuts,

1907
01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:24.720
nuts. I mean,

1908
01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:29.580
that whole era of the 1960s fascinates me to no end.

1909
01:56:29.581 --> 01:56:32.970
I love the cars. I love the sound. To this day,

1910
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.990
most of the music I listened to is classic rock. I mean,

1911
01:56:36.991 --> 01:56:38.940
I listened to a lot of new stuff, but man,

1912
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:43.620
I will pull out some fucking classic rock. I love it. I love listening to it.

1913
01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:45.870
There's something about it that makes me,

1914
01:56:46.710 --> 01:56:51.710
just makes me realize what a profound change it was between the 1950s and 1960s

1915
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:59.640
that's the culture exploded, that something happened, something happened,

1916
01:56:59.641 --> 01:57:00.840
and the, the,

1917
01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:05.850
the clothes and the music and the sounds and the fucking muscle cars,

1918
01:57:05.851 --> 01:57:07.980
like everything went haywire.

1919
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:12.630
Like you went from 1950 to 1916 just a radical shift.

1920
01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.460
Right? So many great artists, you know, Hendricks and yeah,

1921
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:19.020
the whole idea of like, like, okay,

1922
01:57:19.021 --> 01:57:23.910
now it's time to experiment and to free ourselves from the confines of what

1923
01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.710
like, you know, it's been posted. Yes. Yeah. Right. The doors wide open.

1924
01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:31.110
I think buddy Holly was great. I love buddy Holly.

1925
01:57:31.111 --> 01:57:33.720
But if you go from buddy Holly to Hendrix, you're like, what?

1926
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:39.780
What happened? You know, that's what acid trip actually goes, right?

1927
01:57:39.781 --> 01:57:43.530
Like you're saying, apparently they said he used to put acid in his bandana.

1928
01:57:43.531 --> 01:57:44.430
I dunno if that's true,

1929
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:47.500
but that it would seep into his skin as he was pulling down.

1930
01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:51.780
He's just like letting his guitar on fire and picking with his teeth.

1931
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:57.160
Man. How much would you love to watch that guy live? Oh yeah. Oh,

1932
01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.190
that was been incredible.

1933
01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:04.350
To be in the presence of something completely unique. You know,

1934
01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:09.270
this hippie black dude who's the greatest guitarist of all time,

1935
01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:13.200
still still like there's no one.

1936
01:58:13.201 --> 01:58:16.650
Like there's some amazing guys today, Gary Clark jr. and of course,

1937
01:58:16.651 --> 01:58:19.800
you know Stevie Ray Vaughn was amazing. There's a bunch of great,

1938
01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:24.270
amazing guitars all sudden. The showmanship though, you know the outfits,

1939
01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:28.980
like it's like all of the combined, not just his, his technical ability,

1940
01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:34.350
the fact that he was doing these, these things that you're like, you know,

1941
01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:38.550
some of that guitars won't, wouldn't do that. That's not part of their like,

1942
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:41.980
you know, protocol. But he was just like on another world.

1943
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:45.380
<v 2>Yeah. And did to be a part of that, you know, see that. That's incredible.</v>

1944
01:58:45.381 --> 01:58:49.180
A complete outlier. Yeah, yeah. Yes. And again,

1945
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.710
like no one was like that before that and like go to the 1940s it's only 20

1946
01:58:53.711 --> 01:58:58.600
years. Yeah. 40 is only, I mean 20 years ago is, you know,

1947
01:58:58.601 --> 01:59:02.500
we're dealing with, you know, 1999 that's,

1948
01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:04.450
that doesn't seem that long ago. Yeah.

1949
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:09.870
But 69 to 49 you might as well be from another world.

1950
01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:13.600
Yeah. You really might as well be my, I might as well be another planet.

1951
01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:17.520
So what do you think was one of the bigger cultural shifts of why that happened?

1952
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:21.250
Simply hundred percent. Hundred percent. Yeah. I mean,

1953
01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:25.630
obviously when we talk about Jimmy Hendrix and the Beatles and the beach boys,

1954
01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:29.410
like whoever else is like, yeah, yeah, yeah. The doors, Joplin drugs. Yeah.

1955
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:33.150
Drugs, the doors, drugs. Right. Everyone. Drugs. They were,

1956
01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:37.150
they were taking mind expanding psychedelics and the culture had shifted to

1957
01:59:37.151 --> 01:59:38.950
embrace these mind expanding psychedelics.

1958
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:41.110
And there was also the resistance to the Vietnam war.

1959
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:44.020
There's this rebellious movement. There was these young,

1960
01:59:44.050 --> 01:59:48.370
compassionate people that were trying to figure their way through life in a way

1961
01:59:48.371 --> 01:59:52.150
that didn't resonate with the way their parents had set boundaries and

1962
01:59:52.151 --> 01:59:56.680
standards. And they wanted out of all of it, that Goldwater Republican shit.

1963
01:59:56.681 --> 01:59:56.931
They will,

1964
01:59:56.931 --> 02:00:01.510
they wanted to be free and flower children and hippies and then Woodstock and

1965
02:00:01.511 --> 02:00:03.660
all that craziness, you know? Yeah.

1966
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.680
And what's amazing is how quickly it ended. You know,

1967
02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.310
so many things came around.

1968
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:14.980
Some of the things came along and that scared people, you know, like, you know,

1969
02:00:15.010 --> 02:00:16.750
at the end of the day, like when,

1970
02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:21.460
when they're dropping at 27 your heroes, Morrison,

1971
02:00:21.461 --> 02:00:25.720
Janis Joplin, Hendrix, all 27 and, and like,

1972
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:29.890
they're the leaders of this experimental revolution. Yup. Not good.

1973
02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:33.310
That's going to end things pretty quick. I think there was that,

1974
02:00:33.311 --> 02:00:37.720
there was also the sweeping psychedelic act of 1970 that made everything

1975
02:00:37.721 --> 02:00:40.510
schedule one and they were locking people up in jail.

1976
02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:45.130
They were also passing laws directly was there was a civil rights movement was

1977
02:00:45.131 --> 02:00:48.580
happening at the same time and they were passing laws that were directly

1978
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.940
targeting the people in the civil rights movement because they knew that they

1979
02:00:51.941 --> 02:00:54.710
were smoking grass and they were and doing mushrooms. Right.

1980
02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:58.060
So they were going after them with these drug laws and then, you know,

1981
02:00:58.061 --> 02:01:01.210
they would arrest one person, they would turn on everybody else and then,

1982
02:01:01.211 --> 02:01:04.990
you know, they'd do like mob tactics people and yeah, the whole thing.

1983
02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:08.320
They just poured water on it. It took, you know,

1984
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:12.520
it took like 10 or 20 years before shit started popping again. You know,

1985
02:01:12.521 --> 02:01:16.270
in terms of like the influence of a psychedelic culture. Again,

1986
02:01:16.271 --> 02:01:18.640
really more like 30 years, you know,

1987
02:01:18.641 --> 02:01:22.300
it's like the two thousands where things started happening again or people

1988
02:01:22.301 --> 02:01:27.040
started becoming more and more aware of the positive benefits of psychedelic

1989
02:01:27.041 --> 02:01:28.840
drugs and ultra States of consciousness.

1990
02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:32.230
Not trying to escape reality,

1991
02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:36.700
but trying to get a grip on reality from a different perspective,

1992
02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.010
you know? But I think that's an like, like when I

1993
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.900
<v 0>think about psychedelics in that regard of mind expansion or you know,</v>

1994
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:50.060
we got at the same time, it's like this uncontrolled situation that like, okay,

1995
02:01:50.061 --> 02:01:51.110
we're going to jump into this world,

1996
02:01:51.111 --> 02:01:55.990
but there's no way to really control your lane. It's just like this. Yeah.

1997
02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:59.960
It's like, yes, we can go there. Well it might not end up,

1998
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:04.280
you might get stuck there. That's my problem with that. You could get stuck,

1999
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:07.790
you know? I mean like you, you hear the horror stories and that scares the hell.

2000
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:11.670
Did you like sky is still on an acid trip for 25 years walking around that,

2001
02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:14.760
you know, thinking people are chasing him. Acid in particular. Yeah,

2002
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.650
like shine on you

2003
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:16.990
<v 2>crazy diamond. And I think there's,</v>

2004
02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:22.020
there's people that have a predisposition towards psychosis there.

2005
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:27.160
There's certain people that have schizophrenia in there. Their journey,

2006
02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:30.970
their genes and their answer. And for those people it's very dangerous.

2007
02:02:30.971 --> 02:02:33.700
You know what else is very dangerous for those people? Edible marijuana.

2008
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:36.760
Not just like what you think of as hardcore psychedelics,

2009
02:02:36.761 --> 02:02:38.170
but I've known a quiet,

2010
02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.010
quite a few people that have eaten edible marijuana and blown.

2011
02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:46.670
<v 0>Wow. Yeah. There's something I, I I just recently did,</v>

2012
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.140
which is pretty exciting for me was um, you know,

2013
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:54.770
once again the scientific information, I'm just gonna wing it, but I,

2014
02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:56.840
I tried this brain cap on, okay,

2015
02:02:56.841 --> 02:03:01.790
this has all these nodules like that can read the neurotransmitters in my brain

2016
02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:05.560
and it's connected to a computer. And uh, you,

2017
02:03:05.561 --> 02:03:08.660
you sit there for about a minute and you just, you, I kind of meditate on,

2018
02:03:08.661 --> 02:03:12.110
really focused on one, one thing. So it could start like reading your,

2019
02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:17.900
your brain, basically your, your neurotransmission signals. Um,

2020
02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:18.740
and uh,

2021
02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:21.960
it's kind of like neural feedback on steroids if you know anything about neural

2022
02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:24.620
feedback. Um, and, uh,

2023
02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.260
it gave me a list of, of categories of what I want to know about who I am.

2024
02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:33.890
I've, I, I always thought that I had a slight add.

2025
02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:38.870
I never was diagnosed cause I have like if, if Joe Rogan's boring me,

2026
02:03:38.871 --> 02:03:42.620
I might like turn over here, you know, like the, my invitation is normal. Yeah,

2027
02:03:42.621 --> 02:03:43.640
I know, right. But I was like,

2028
02:03:43.641 --> 02:03:46.970
I don't have that bad of add where I can't concentrate to get things done

2029
02:03:46.971 --> 02:03:49.580
because I get things done. But I do have,

2030
02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:54.680
I do think about a lot more things than I think I should. Maybe. So anyways,

2031
02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:58.320
I was, I did this test and it shows like your,

2032
02:03:58.350 --> 02:04:00.560
your signals coming and uh,

2033
02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:04.970
and it has all of these different things like anxiety, delusion, schizophrenia,

2034
02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:10.160
um, uh, you know, attention so forth, you know,

2035
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:14.420
absolutely incredible. I was like, okay, I'm scared of press this button.

2036
02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:17.750
Schizophrenia. I'm really scared but I want to know.

2037
02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:20.810
So it gives you the feeling of being schizophrenia? No, no, no, no.

2038
02:04:20.811 --> 02:04:25.790
It shows your brain activity if you, if you have a tendency to be schizophrenia.

2039
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:28.140
You were saying like there's a way for them kind like,

2040
02:04:28.670 --> 02:04:31.890
like do you want to feel what it feels? No, no, no. That's,

2041
02:04:31.930 --> 02:04:35.840
that's like in the future. But like, I want to see if like,

2042
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:38.430
do I have the neural pathways

2043
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:40.290
<v 3>that, that a schizophrenia person would,</v>

2044
02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.850
would you know how they would think about the world? Yeah. So, you know,

2045
02:04:44.851 --> 02:04:49.140
I clicked on that and I'm like, I'm good. You know, I'm good. Okay, good.

2046
02:04:49.141 --> 02:04:52.980
So what about um, delusion. Okay. Anxiety low. OK. So I,

2047
02:04:53.150 --> 02:04:54.570
I got a lot of information out of that.

2048
02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:58.110
So I guess the reason why I'm sharing that is that, you know,

2049
02:04:58.410 --> 02:05:00.530
you should try this out. You think it's something that,

2050
02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:03.080
that I think you'd be interested in. I am interested in. Yeah.

2051
02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:08.040
Do you know the name of the uh, well they, they flew to me just like I'm saying,

2052
02:05:08.041 --> 02:05:11.850
like I love to meet groups and organizations and research, uh,

2053
02:05:11.851 --> 02:05:15.600
researchers and scientists and these people you,

2054
02:05:15.601 --> 02:05:18.150
I was putting out to the world and they came, they flew all to me,

2055
02:05:18.151 --> 02:05:22.830
like some from Colorado. So I'm from Toronto and uh, and,

2056
02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:26.670
and they, they did this test on my head and my brain. Whoa. Yeah.

2057
02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:28.470
So I'll get you information on that,

2058
02:05:29.130 --> 02:05:31.710
try it out and see if it's something that's like interests you.

2059
02:05:31.711 --> 02:05:35.070
But I'm sure it will. I'm in. It's very exciting stuff. It sounds,

2060
02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:38.970
I hope I'm not crazy. Fuck, what do you do if you find out you're really insane

2061
02:05:41.290 --> 02:05:43.680
when I put the thing on you and they're like, dude, you're fart.

2062
02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.970
Results like this before you need to be locked up, then all sudden people come.

2063
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.430
Well, you wouldn't even know it, right? If you're really crazy you like,

2064
02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:51.810
you think that like,

2065
02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:54.900
you know the five people are on the corner chasing after you.

2066
02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:55.950
They're always the real,

2067
02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.740
or maybe the beautiful mind guys to have a bit about the problem with dumb

2068
02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:01.920
peoples that they, they're too stupid to know they're dumb. So the thing,

2069
02:06:01.921 --> 02:06:05.700
everybody else is dumb. Yeah, that's a problem. Right? So if you're crazy,

2070
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:08.910
you might think everybody's crazy, right? Even though, Oh yeah,

2071
02:06:08.911 --> 02:06:10.950
like the brain scan is making you crazy.

2072
02:06:10.951 --> 02:06:13.220
It's like you might think that everybody else is crazy, right?

2073
02:06:13.221 --> 02:06:16.530
And then you do the brain scan like, no, no, no, no, no. It's you. Yeah,

2074
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:19.020
you're tricking me. You're, you're doing something to me.

2075
02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:22.140
Why have you ever met people that blame everyone else in their life?

2076
02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:25.800
For all their problems. Yes, sure. Yeah. And they can't see what we can see.

2077
02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:28.230
Yeah. You can see, Hey man, it's you. Yeah.

2078
02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:32.640
You are causing your problems. Yes. But yes,

2079
02:06:32.641 --> 02:06:35.520
you never are self critical. Yeah.

2080
02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:39.030
Looking externally for all of your issues,

2081
02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:40.890
you're criticizing everyone,

2082
02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:45.350
but you are the architect of your own demands and you don't even realize it.

2083
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:46.560
I think that is one of the,

2084
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:51.390
the the biggest problems for like why people are not finding their own success.

2085
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:52.650
Yeah. You know,

2086
02:06:52.651 --> 02:06:56.640
because they keep blaming other people for problems when they could use that

2087
02:06:56.641 --> 02:07:01.641
same time to actually focus on a small success that's realistic in their

2088
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:05.610
trajectory or whatever they're doing. Yeah. And I've seen that a lot with my,

2089
02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:09.240
you know, some people I know and just it's, they get stuck in that, that,

2090
02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:13.860
that framework and then there might be people that enable that same mindset.

2091
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:16.140
Yeah. It's patterns as well.

2092
02:07:16.141 --> 02:07:20.310
Like sometimes people develop these defensive patterns in order to protect

2093
02:07:20.311 --> 02:07:22.040
themselves from reality. Right.

2094
02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:27.200
They put up these psychic shields to sort of protect themselves from self

2095
02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:30.690
critical ideas or externally critical ideas,

2096
02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:33.780
and they just don't want to deal with change. They don't,

2097
02:07:33.810 --> 02:07:36.080
they want to pretend that they're the fucking man. They're

2098
02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:39.640
<v 1>the coolest. Did they get it? Everybody else is dumb and God,</v>

2099
02:07:39.641 --> 02:07:44.641
it's such a toxic way to view the world and the people that have that view gain,

2100
02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:49.960
no traction, almost always fall apart. Yeah. It's just,

2101
02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:54.320
it's unsustainable. It's not a way to live your life. No. Yeah. It's,

2102
02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:58.300
it's fucking hard to see to, man, it's hard to see why.

2103
02:07:58.301 --> 02:08:01.450
If you know someone that's like that, you almost kinda got to go, fuck man,

2104
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:05.800
I'm walking away. I can't help anymore. Yeah. Well, I think also for them,

2105
02:08:05.801 --> 02:08:08.170
they see the success of other people and they're like,

2106
02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:12.550
like they want to be that, but they're like, yeah. You know,

2107
02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:14.050
they obviously can't with,

2108
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.800
they just blame everyone that they can't be that person. Right.

2109
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:20.080
Instead of just like going,

2110
02:08:20.081 --> 02:08:23.800
well we got to take these small baby steps to get out of this funk and then

2111
02:08:23.801 --> 02:08:26.770
eventually, you know, stop comparing yourself to other people.

2112
02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:30.580
But compare yourself to your yourself. Yes. Look at yourself critically.

2113
02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:35.080
But I think another thing that's really important is to enjoy other people's

2114
02:08:35.081 --> 02:08:39.010
success instead of being jealous, which is a really common,

2115
02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:44.070
easy to understand sort of an emotional reaction to other people's success.

2116
02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:47.980
You what the best way to look at it. In my opinion,

2117
02:08:47.981 --> 02:08:50.680
the best way to look at is look at someone else doing amazing things and go,

2118
02:08:50.681 --> 02:08:53.110
fuck, this is amazing. What would they have done?

2119
02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:56.740
Be excited by it and then be inspired. Exactly.

2120
02:08:56.770 --> 02:08:59.080
You can use it as fuel in a positive way.

2121
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.040
And then also there's no negative feeling like that person doesn't have to feel

2122
02:09:03.041 --> 02:09:06.930
like you're, you're fucking giving them the sour face cause you're, you're,

2123
02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.810
you're jealous and bitter and weird and you're looking to be critical of them

2124
02:09:10.811 --> 02:09:14.020
and find flaws in them. Look at what they're doing.

2125
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:19.350
Like look at like if you were a guy who's coming up right and you wanted to be a

2126
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:25.180
guy who makes electronic music and I'm sure you have haters. All my God,

2127
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.380
they're lined up, lined up, I'm sure. Yeah. Why? Why do you have haters?

2128
02:09:29.530 --> 02:09:32.050
Because you're fucking awesome. That's why.

2129
02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.450
Because what you're doing is fucking awesome. So instead of saying, man,

2130
02:09:37.451 --> 02:09:40.510
this guy is inexhaustible. He's excited about what he's doing.

2131
02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:44.050
He's got a real passion for creating things. People love it.

2132
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:47.710
And your attitude about making these shows and giving these people this amazing

2133
02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.380
time and how much focus and energy you put into it.

2134
02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:55.180
What I hate or should look at that and go this, I've got to do more of that.

2135
02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:56.510
I got to do more of that. I've got to give more.

2136
02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.770
But instead they try to poke holes. The music. Yeah. Fucking cakes.

2137
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.940
[inaudible] that is a sore spot for people to, I'm sure. Yes.

2138
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:10.570
Anything awesome as a sore sore spot for assholes. Yeah.

2139
02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.990
It's just nothing you can do about that. You just have to,

2140
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:18.370
you got to keep on being you. But them their, their, their hell.

2141
02:10:18.371 --> 02:10:20.870
And their prison is that they're focusing on. Yeah. Yeah.

2142
02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.380
They're hating and focusing on, yeah, yeah, true words.

2143
02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:30.910
Yeah. It's, um, it's a weird world being an entertainer, isn't it? Yeah.

2144
02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.830
It's a different kind of lifestyle, you know? It's,

2145
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:37.880
<v 3>you know, I mean, actually the strange thing is when I think about like,</v>

2146
02:10:39.170 --> 02:10:43.910
like fame or whatever celebrityhood uh, when I walk through certain areas,

2147
02:10:43.911 --> 02:10:45.620
I get like I have to just go, okay,

2148
02:10:45.621 --> 02:10:49.130
I have to accept the F the photos I have to accept. Like people coming up to me,

2149
02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:50.480
I want to be the asshole.

2150
02:10:50.481 --> 02:10:54.020
Cause I have been that kid going up to someone and they're mean to me.

2151
02:10:54.021 --> 02:10:56.600
And I'd be like, Oh, that guy's a Dick. You know,

2152
02:10:56.690 --> 02:10:58.060
I'll never think of you that way for us.

2153
02:10:59.030 --> 02:11:02.320
Even if you're just in a bad day or some, you know, you just,

2154
02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:04.940
the one that might be using me the most is people coming up to you while you're

2155
02:11:04.941 --> 02:11:07.010
eating. I had a guy come up to me right now,

2156
02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:11.630
last night in the middle of like literally cutting food and in a crowded

2157
02:11:11.631 --> 02:11:12.464
restaurant. Yeah.

2158
02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:15.980
And he's hovering over the table trying to get me to get up and take a photo.

2159
02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:18.800
I'm like, dude, what if I did that for everybody? Like what if I just, yeah,

2160
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:22.340
right. That this is a ridiculous request. Yeah. Like you shouldn't do that.

2161
02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:26.240
Like, what did you say? Did you say that? Okay, let's take a picture.

2162
02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.730
We're in the middle of a meal. Not only that, we were in the middle,

2163
02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.350
it was Andrew Schultz, my buddy,

2164
02:11:30.351 --> 02:11:33.470
and we were in the middle of talking to this guy.

2165
02:11:33.471 --> 02:11:36.740
Just interrupted the conversation, wanted a picture. I was like,

2166
02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.590
there's a time and a place for it, right. If you want to say, Hey,

2167
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:43.970
when you're leaving, can I get a picture? Sure. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Well,

2168
02:11:44.070 --> 02:11:46.560
you got a mouth full of food and you're cutting food and somebody could come on

2169
02:11:46.610 --> 02:11:47.960
and you can't interrupt meals.

2170
02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:52.400
There's a ridiculous that that happens to me all the time.

2171
02:11:52.740 --> 02:11:53.573
It's what stupid.

2172
02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:57.620
But you know what's really weird in LA doesn't have to be that much. Well, I,

2173
02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.310
people are more accustomed to seeing famous people. Yeah. And they're like,

2174
02:12:01.630 --> 02:12:04.930
I don't want to, you know, they just get it. They don't want to bug you as much,

2175
02:12:05.070 --> 02:12:07.580
but everywhere else, LA in New York,

2176
02:12:07.581 --> 02:12:09.410
I'm not really bothered as much everywhere else.

2177
02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:12.740
It's like it just says just going to, I just have to accept it,

2178
02:12:12.741 --> 02:12:16.230
but you can't interrupt people while they're eating. That is just one of those,

2179
02:12:17.090 --> 02:12:18.380
don't interrupt me when I'm meeting.

2180
02:12:18.381 --> 02:12:20.810
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to my kids like this. This,

2181
02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:25.040
it's a stupid thing to do. You have to have manners.

2182
02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.420
You have to have some sort of a, a,

2183
02:12:28.710 --> 02:12:32.780
an understanding that this is a human being that is living their own life and

2184
02:12:32.781 --> 02:12:36.400
even though you're a fan of them, your being a fan does not take precedent. You,

2185
02:12:36.401 --> 02:12:39.290
you can't just, you, they don't owe you this, right?

2186
02:12:39.290 --> 02:12:42.920
You can't just interrupt their life and you shouldn't want that.

2187
02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:46.490
You shouldn't want to interrupt someone in the middle of a conversation in the

2188
02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:49.040
middle of the middle, in the middle of talking to their children.

2189
02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:53.060
It's a foolish way to interact with them. I remember one time I was,

2190
02:12:53.690 --> 02:12:55.340
you know, in a deep conversation,

2191
02:12:55.341 --> 02:12:59.050
just like you're talking about with someone outside of a, um,

2192
02:12:59.330 --> 02:13:04.330
casino about to leave and the sky's just drunk and he's just like,

2193
02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:08.720
like staring and like wobbling and like, you know,

2194
02:13:08.721 --> 02:13:13.310
doing his thing and I just see him hovering and I am not going to engage with

2195
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:16.820
him. I'm just talking. And finally I'm like, Hey man,

2196
02:13:16.821 --> 02:13:20.300
I'm just in the middle of a conversation and you know, well,

2197
02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:22.430
I didn't say we'll get a photo later. I'm like, well,

2198
02:13:22.431 --> 02:13:26.330
I'll talk to you later because I didn't, I didn't want to like be presumptuous.

2199
02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.860
And, uh,

2200
02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:32.920
I got done with the conversation and he was just a very aggressive,

2201
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:34.920
and I just, I just ran

2202
02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.800
and I remember I ran to my car and, um, I'm like,

2203
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:44.850
I just don't want to get into this, you know, like, and he's chasing me.

2204
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.690
Oh my God, he's chasing me. And just like, fuck you.

2205
02:13:49.230 --> 02:13:53.610
I was your fan and you feel like treated me like, shit,

2206
02:13:53.611 --> 02:13:56.690
this is how you treat your fans. I'm like, I'm like, Oh my God.

2207
02:13:56.990 --> 02:14:00.060
It's just too much. You know and like, and it stays with you. You know,

2208
02:14:00.061 --> 02:14:04.260
like even though I dunno, that's part of the problem with Vegas too.

2209
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:09.210
People are at, it's that they're at new year's Eve level every night. Yeah.

2210
02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:11.870
You know that it's like a thing for new year's Eve.

2211
02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:15.210
I stopped doing shows a couple of years ago on new year's Eve cause every time I

2212
02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:15.781
would do them I was like,

2213
02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:18.570
why does everybody think it's okay to be an asshole tonight?

2214
02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:21.720
People want to heckle. They want to yell things out. I was like,

2215
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:24.690
on new year's Eve, I'm just going to stay home. I'm going to hang out.

2216
02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.380
I'm not going to do shows. It just seems too chaotic.

2217
02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:32.340
It never feels that feels like a real show. Well, Vegas is like,

2218
02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.090
there's a lot of people that are running around like every night.

2219
02:14:36.091 --> 02:14:37.400
Like what happens in Vegas,

2220
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.540
they just go and crazy. It's, it's such a wild place. It's a hall pass.

2221
02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:50.070
It's like, okay, we gotta go big. We're here 24 hour drinking, right? Yeah.

2222
02:14:50.071 --> 02:14:50.641
Free booze.

2223
02:14:50.641 --> 02:14:55.080
If you gambling like what a wacky thing we're going to give you a drug that

2224
02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:58.530
fucks up your decision making and then you're going to gamble everything you

2225
02:14:58.531 --> 02:15:01.290
have. How is that legal? How does that,

2226
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.420
you can't really enormous sums of money and they're giving you alcohol. Right?

2227
02:15:06.421 --> 02:15:10.590
This is so crazy, but I love it. I love that it exists.

2228
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:15.690
I love that there's a city where everything is kind of wild where everything is

2229
02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:16.451
like things are up.

2230
02:15:16.451 --> 02:15:20.970
Like I play pool and Vegas is one of the rare places where pool halls are 24

2231
02:15:20.971 --> 02:15:23.640
hours a day. So you could play pool till five o'clock in the morning,

2232
02:15:23.641 --> 02:15:25.640
six o'clock in the morning, you know, you,

2233
02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:28.050
and there'll be good players in there and you know,

2234
02:15:28.051 --> 02:15:31.140
people really appreciate pool and you know,

2235
02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:34.890
everything's 24 you can get good meals like really late at night.

2236
02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:40.020
That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So wild place, man. It really is. But you,

2237
02:15:40.021 --> 02:15:44.700
because you're a clean and sober guy, you avoid all the pitfalls.

2238
02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:48.210
Yeah. I think that's like how it works for me cause I, I'm not like,

2239
02:15:48.630 --> 02:15:52.570
I'm not a strip club guy. You know, I, I just, I don't, I,

2240
02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:57.420
I've learned my lesson on gambling. I guess that was like a gamble. I did play,

2241
02:15:58.120 --> 02:15:59.940
um, blackjack mainly.

2242
02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:03.540
And that's just the worst odds for you the most you've ever lost in the night.

2243
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:09.210
Um, 50,

2244
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:12.390
50 K Dana white told me lost 1 million bucks one night. Yeah.

2245
02:16:12.391 --> 02:16:15.780
I'm not at that level, but he won 7 million.

2246
02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:19.710
And then when he wants [inaudible] babies as far as like, kindness,

2247
02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:22.530
data's crazy. But they kicked him out of the casino.

2248
02:16:22.531 --> 02:16:25.470
They said he can't come back. Yeah. That's the problem actually.

2249
02:16:25.471 --> 02:16:29.530
When you like do well for yourself when the odds are stacked against you and

2250
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:30.130
they kick you out,

2251
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:33.940
<v 1>that's crazy. Well, the crazy thing is he's just gambling.</v>

2252
02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.840
He just happened to win. Like, what are we doing?

2253
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:41.020
Is this really gambling or you're just stealing money from people?

2254
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:42.063
What are you doing?

2255
02:16:42.570 --> 02:16:45.770
The guy won and they like where you're not allowed to play here anymore. Right.

2256
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:50.410
You know, he's not stealing. He's Dana white. You know, he's rich. Yeah.

2257
02:16:50.510 --> 02:16:54.070
It's not, you know, he's just a gambler. Yeah. So this is like real gambling.

2258
02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:56.860
This is not like some guy with some sort of a scheme and it's cheating.

2259
02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:01.930
If someone's doing something with the car as actually gambling and you're mad at

2260
02:17:01.931 --> 02:17:05.050
him or mad cause you lost. Yeah, that's it.

2261
02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:09.850
That's the can just take you out following the rules. You can come back.

2262
02:17:09.851 --> 02:17:13.390
They'll ban you from the casino. I almost wish I was like,

2263
02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:16.390
can I get to that level? It's like, can I get there where I'm,

2264
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:20.920
I've just won that much. Um, God man, but interested.

2265
02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:24.600
I don't gamble at all. I used to gamble on fights. Yeah. Um,

2266
02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:25.690
but then I was like,

2267
02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:28.700
well maybe I shouldn't be doing this cause I'm doing commentary on these fights,

2268
02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.170
gambling like of interest. But that was the early days,

2269
02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:35.560
like the early two thousands, like 2003 and four and shit like that.

2270
02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:39.370
Cause they would have some wacky numbers back then too.

2271
02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:43.240
Like guys would come in from other organizations and these oddsmakers didn't

2272
02:17:43.241 --> 02:17:47.140
know who they were. And I was a fanatic, so I knew who everybody was.

2273
02:17:47.141 --> 02:17:49.060
I knew these guys are fighting in Japan. I was like, well duh, duh,

2274
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:51.640
duh duh duh duh duh, everything got this motherfucker.

2275
02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:54.640
Cause there was times where a guy was the favorite and I was like,

2276
02:17:54.641 --> 02:17:58.480
that guy has no chance. Like he's going to get your heart right.

2277
02:17:58.481 --> 02:18:02.010
And I was right like 80% of the time. Like my friend Aubrey and I, uh,

2278
02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:05.430
I've given him tips gotta give him tips now cause I don't care about myself on

2279
02:18:05.590 --> 02:18:09.970
it, but we're like at eight 86% winning. Why? Why stop then?

2280
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:14.410
Because of because you're commentating don't, there's no law against it.

2281
02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:15.910
I can't affect the outcome,

2282
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:20.980
but I don't want to be sidecar psychologically.

2283
02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.420
I don't want to be subliminally influenced or subconsciously influenced.

2284
02:18:25.421 --> 02:18:29.830
Like wanting someone to win. Yeah. Like if you got $10,000 riding on a fight,

2285
02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:34.140
you're going to want that guy. Right. How much of a professional you are. Yeah.

2286
02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.280
You know, when someone loses, you're going to be like, fuck,

2287
02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:39.370
what do you fucking made? The whole thing is like,

2288
02:18:39.470 --> 02:18:44.470
you're supposed to be there to do justice to the experience of these two guys

2289
02:18:44.710 --> 02:18:47.710
going at it and giving their all right. Supposed to be hoping one guy.

2290
02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:52.870
It's true, but it's also really hard for me when a friend's fighting, you know,

2291
02:18:52.970 --> 02:18:57.220
like Daniel Cormier, he fights. It's very hard for me to see him very hard.

2292
02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:00.190
The last fight with Steve Bay, and I love Steve pay too,

2293
02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:04.600
but to watch Steve Bay beat the shit out of Daniel was rough. It was hard. Yeah,

2294
02:19:04.630 --> 02:19:08.050
because Daniel is such a good guy. I love that guy.

2295
02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.470
And to watch him eat those left hooks to the body and then get beaten down,

2296
02:19:11.471 --> 02:19:13.180
I was like, Oh that must be hard.

2297
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:16.090
And I'm commentating on it like it's an amazing thing I'm watching. Right.

2298
02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:19.330
It is amazing. So it's hard to separate,

2299
02:19:19.630 --> 02:19:22.150
you know when Brendan shod was fighting, it was the hardest.

2300
02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:25.330
That was the hardest cause I was good friends with him and I knew he really

2301
02:19:25.331 --> 02:19:29.000
didn't want to fight anymore and I was God that that's, that's really,

2302
02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.680
that must be really hard. It was running.

2303
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:32.870
He doesn't want to fight anymore and he just getting beaten.

2304
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:35.600
He was getting beaten and he was getting beaten bad and I didn't,

2305
02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:37.370
I didn't see an end to it.

2306
02:19:37.570 --> 02:19:41.390
Who is the guy with the nose that went crooked like this recently? Mike Perry,

2307
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:44.240
all that crayon picture's crazy. Crazy.

2308
02:19:44.241 --> 02:19:47.330
I can't believe someone can continue fighting when their nose is literally

2309
02:19:47.331 --> 02:19:51.070
across their face. That dude's a Savage. I mean, you have to be a Savage.

2310
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:54.920
You go 100% bonafide died in the woods.

2311
02:19:56.060 --> 02:20:00.290
Like he literally like imagine what he's fighting through when he has his, his,

2312
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:05.270
his nose over here. It's his face has to be completely numb. Well, well,

2313
02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:08.270
no, no, no, no. I mean, I don't know. I don't really know pain. Okay.

2314
02:20:08.271 --> 02:20:09.104
Massive pain.

2315
02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:12.440
The sinuses are one of the most sensitive areas of your face when you get your

2316
02:20:12.441 --> 02:20:14.750
nose shattered. First of all, you can't see,

2317
02:20:14.751 --> 02:20:19.460
your eyes are watering and his nose is pouring blood getting choked.

2318
02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:22.760
Right. He's in the middle of getting chug on his nose like, Oh,

2319
02:20:22.761 --> 02:20:27.761
that is the worst fucking dose I've ever seen in my life of all the years of

2320
02:20:28.761 --> 02:20:31.910
calling fights. The only thing that comes close is rich Franklin,

2321
02:20:31.911 --> 02:20:36.911
when he fought Anderson Silva pull up a rich Franklin's nose versus Anderson

2322
02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:42.020
Silva. And you'll see similar, but not quite as horrific.

2323
02:20:42.021 --> 02:20:46.760
But the thing is about rich Franklin was bombed out about his nose, whereas, uh,

2324
02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:52.100
you know, Mike Perry was like, fuck yeah, he didn't look at that one.

2325
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:55.130
The far left right there, far left, far left, far left, right there.

2326
02:20:55.131 --> 02:20:55.964
Click that one.

2327
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:59.840
That's the one where Anderson Silva sort of reconstructed his nose.

2328
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:04.370
It's hard to see in that picture. Make it larger so that that's as knows after.

2329
02:21:04.690 --> 02:21:08.240
Yeah, it's all shifted off to the right. It looks all fucked up,

2330
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:09.321
but that ain't shit.

2331
02:21:09.321 --> 02:21:12.260
Compared to Mike Perry's Mike Perry's is the worst knows in the history of the

2332
02:21:12.261 --> 02:21:15.620
sport. Did they? F I mean, what does he look like now? What was that guy's nose?

2333
02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.960
Look, click on that one. In the middle. Above. Above.

2334
02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:21.410
It's like Gronk a little bit. Geez. Wow.

2335
02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:25.900
Whose fucking noses that she sees us?

2336
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:30.060
It went up into his a forehead look like this.

2337
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.520
Worst nose breaks in the UFC. Who is that dude? Yeah.

2338
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:38.900
He looks like it looks like half his nose is, is a up in his eyelids. Oh my God.

2339
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:42.320
That's just swelling. Right? But look how March shift Ryan McGillivray.

2340
02:21:44.170 --> 02:21:48.930
Woo. That's rough. Wow. Jesus Christ. Wow.

2341
02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:53.740
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's still smiling. Knows he's still smiling there.

2342
02:21:54.690 --> 02:21:56.820
Shogun Sjogren's nose got fucked up too. I think that was against Jon Jones.

2343
02:21:57.330 --> 02:22:01.020
Yeah. Connely or Connolly's nose got shattered. Yeah, man.

2344
02:22:01.021 --> 02:22:04.170
And then you got to get it all reconstructed and they got to sort of stitch the

2345
02:22:04.171 --> 02:22:09.171
bones back together again and [inaudible] because if you get this bone shatters,

2346
02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:14.070
I'm like, Aw man, there's not much there. You know? It's such a tie.

2347
02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:17.930
If you feel that bone, it's like so gentle. So delicate. Yeah.

2348
02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.920
If you take a knee, they're like, Oh, that's how they're breaking, right? Yeah.

2349
02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:26.160
He's all right now. It looks pretty good. Damn.

2350
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.400
<v 0>They did an amazing job. Reconstruct is eating pizza, Aoki pizza,</v>

2351
02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:35.220
but it's the crazy thing is his nose was look like the worst situation that you

2352
02:22:35.221 --> 02:22:38.690
could possibly get in and his nose now looks pretty normal. Or the other guy's,

2353
02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:39.840
his noses are just like that.

2354
02:22:39.841 --> 02:22:44.100
One guy with the bowl dropped by his eyebrows like and his nose is still curved

2355
02:22:44.101 --> 02:22:48.420
to the right and he's smiling like you'd assume Mike Perry would have that kind

2356
02:22:48.421 --> 02:22:52.110
of nose after that. That kind of situation is right after the fight.

2357
02:22:52.490 --> 02:22:55.920
You know Mike Perry had to go through extensive surgery overseas.

2358
02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:00.090
Where does that, where does that fight take place? Uruguay, South America.

2359
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:04.260
So he had to stay there and get really extensive surgery.

2360
02:23:04.310 --> 02:23:08.100
Was there for several days just to try to recover before he could fly home.

2361
02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:10.890
The scary thing is his is get back in the ring,

2362
02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:14.460
fuck gay is he loves it and then that,

2363
02:23:14.610 --> 02:23:17.520
that bone that he's going to have is going to break down again.

2364
02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:20.730
Is it going to be weaker or is it going to, I wish I could tell you.

2365
02:23:20.731 --> 02:23:24.450
I don't know. You know, it really depends. Imagine if it just shatters again.

2366
02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:29.160
He's got to do it again. Yeah man. Wait times got his nose reconstructed.

2367
02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:32.790
Who is, what is this? Not a UFC, but it's called

2368
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:38.810
UFC and Africa in Africa kicked in the face. Oh Jane. God,

2369
02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:43.290
that's the worst no's ever. [inaudible] Oh my, that's horrible.

2370
02:23:43.530 --> 02:23:48.360
Oh my God. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh look at the guy's nose. Oh,

2371
02:23:48.361 --> 02:23:49.350
that's the one that Corona said.

2372
02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:53.700
Oh the other guy on the bottom is a guy who got his nose damaged somehow or

2373
02:23:53.701 --> 02:23:58.260
another and they grew it on his head. Oh yeah. It's a hard businessman.

2374
02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:02.940
What kind of exercises do you do? Um, I'm, I like hit training,

2375
02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:08.160
high intensity, high intensity, um, and uh, you know,

2376
02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:11.850
kind of like blending two worlds. I've, you know, I stopped gambling the casino,

2377
02:24:11.851 --> 02:24:16.050
but I love gambling with my friends and I love making prop bets on, you know,

2378
02:24:16.051 --> 02:24:21.051
just my recent one was a body fat challenge cause I was at 19.6 April 14th 19%.

2379
02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:26.460
Yeah. And then I dropped to, well my,

2380
02:24:26.461 --> 02:24:29.190
the bet was if I can drop til 10% in three months,

2381
02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:34.660
well that's easy while maybe for someone that really understands how to do that.

2382
02:24:34.801 --> 02:24:38.880
But like, you know, I, I wanted to get there and I just like when I work out,

2383
02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:43.530
I kind of work out just on the being healthy and cardiovascular and just like,

2384
02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:45.810
you know, just staying in shape. But I didn't,

2385
02:24:45.930 --> 02:24:50.400
I never thought I'd get below 10%. You must've changed your diet pretty well.

2386
02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:53.640
Cut out sugar, cut out bread, cut. Exactly. All that stuff.

2387
02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:58.200
Stay below 1800 calories. And you are um, you vegetarian still?

2388
02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:01.950
No, I eat chicken and fish, but I stopped eating.

2389
02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:07.050
I don't eat any uh, cows or, or uh, you know, uh,

2390
02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:11.880
cows, pork pig or um, lamb or anything like that.

2391
02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:15.480
But I pretty much stay with the chicken and fish my proteins.

2392
02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:19.960
And are you dealing with you that motherfucker walking out looking pretty sure

2393
02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:24.610
either way. Below 10% there. What are you there? Um, I think I'm 12.

2394
02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:27.430
Really right there. Yeah. Cause like keeping your fat in your brain.

2395
02:25:27.730 --> 02:25:30.280
That doesn't make any sense. You know, it's, it's in my eyes. Let me,

2396
02:25:30.281 --> 02:25:33.550
I'm probably where I am now because I've, you know,

2397
02:25:33.551 --> 02:25:37.420
the bed ended in July 14th, but I did win the bet,

2398
02:25:37.421 --> 02:25:42.340
so I made 15 grand from my friends. Ah, that's fine. But I, you know,

2399
02:25:42.341 --> 02:25:44.920
that's like how I am motivated to do things.

2400
02:25:44.921 --> 02:25:49.921
I like to make bets with people to have these little challenges and then with

2401
02:25:50.111 --> 02:25:54.220
that timeline than I, you know, work with my trainer who is, you know,

2402
02:25:54.390 --> 02:25:57.910
pull holding the, uh, the towel down and uh,

2403
02:25:57.911 --> 02:26:01.600
and he trains me every time I'm home and he gets me on my meal plans.

2404
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:06.220
So I deal with him all the time. Do you do like a meal prep service?

2405
02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:10.060
I do it through his company, so I do that company, uh,

2406
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:14.620
diced diced kitchen, I think. Dice kitchen. He's your friend,

2407
02:26:15.010 --> 02:26:16.810
huh? I, yeah, but like, you know, he'd like,

2408
02:26:16.811 --> 02:26:21.550
it just gets like my assistant puts it in, in the fridge, but you know,

2409
02:26:21.551 --> 02:26:25.480
it's all like chicken and vegetables. Pretty much. Turkey, chicken,

2410
02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:30.370
fish and then, and then veggies or you drop down to 1800 calories a day,

2411
02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:31.930
dropped down to 1800 calories a day.

2412
02:26:31.931 --> 02:26:35.260
And this is the hard part is I'm on the road like, you know,

2413
02:26:35.261 --> 02:26:38.230
more than 60% of the days when I was not touring across Europe.

2414
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:41.770
And when I'm touring across Europe all summer long, I'm gone.

2415
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:46.150
So how are you getting like really healthy food every meal when you're doing

2416
02:26:46.151 --> 02:26:48.580
this? I round ball, uh, you know,

2417
02:26:48.581 --> 02:26:53.380
eyeball kind of my calorie count whenever I eat and I have my fitness pal is my,

2418
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:57.650
my judge, you know, is that my fitness pals on an app? It's an app, yeah.

2419
02:26:57.970 --> 02:27:00.940
Underarmour app that, that like I just put in all my food,

2420
02:27:01.570 --> 02:27:06.570
so I you just use it to just make sure that I am eyeballing this 1800 calorie

2421
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:10.210
deficit kind of diet and then, you know,

2422
02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:15.720
just avoid the over starchy over carby foods and focus more on eating the

2423
02:27:16.871 --> 02:27:21.400
proteins and the veggies and then that vitamins or supplements. Yeah. Uh,

2424
02:27:21.401 --> 02:27:25.630
yeah, like I, I try to, I try to switch it on and off. Like I said, like before,

2425
02:27:25.631 --> 02:27:28.060
after, after I met Ray, I was like, okay,

2426
02:27:28.061 --> 02:27:30.190
I need to just find out what I'm deficient in.

2427
02:27:30.191 --> 02:27:32.710
I'm going to just load up on those. Um,

2428
02:27:32.730 --> 02:27:35.260
and then I went to see dr Grossman who kind of gave me my,

2429
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:38.230
like 22 page pack of,

2430
02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.940
of my telomere links to cancer markers if I have them, you know,

2431
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:47.290
uh, to like what I'm allergic to, to what I'm deficient in. And then,

2432
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:49.840
and then I followed that regimen of what the vitamins I was taking,

2433
02:27:49.841 --> 02:27:53.160
some of which was, I still take like, one is called Celergyn.

2434
02:27:53.770 --> 02:27:58.570
It's kind of like a, you know, the closest thing to a STEM cell, uh,

2435
02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:01.440
like injection if you can, if you swallow it, it's like, you know,

2436
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:03.970
it's got lots and lots of anti aging properties in it.

2437
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:07.780
Celergyn Celergyn what's in it? Uh,

2438
02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:10.990
look it up and you could do your Joe Rogan research on that and give me some

2439
02:28:10.991 --> 02:28:14.890
more, but I just trusted my doctor on this one, but it's expensive.

2440
02:28:14.891 --> 02:28:18.180
It's like $10 a pill. Really pull that up. Seller,

2441
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:21.890
Jen and I take a skeptical hippo face

2442
02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:25.780
<v 2>and I also take a website. Kroger, Kroger.</v>

2443
02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:30.830
It's a 1 trillion a probiotics. Oh wow.

2444
02:28:30.890 --> 02:28:34.400
It's in a little like I take that every day. Really? Yeah.

2445
02:28:34.401 --> 02:28:39.170
For the bio with cell therapies. Celergyn Hmm.

2446
02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:44.360
Hello there. Thank you for visiting Selgin's online store pop up window point.

2447
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:48.920
So, um Hm. And this is, what is it?

2448
02:28:48.980 --> 02:28:53.630
$2,000 for six months. Damn. It is expensive. It's very expensive.

2449
02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:59.230
And what is it backed by a cellular Marine complex. Peptide III.

2450
02:28:59.231 --> 02:29:03.080
Collagen bio DNA hydro M N peptide.

2451
02:29:03.810 --> 02:29:07.690
Sounds like you're going to piss hot, sir. Other Engli alluded,

2452
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:11.480
teen grape skin extract, set salon selenium, which is important.

2453
02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:14.840
Coenzyme Q 10 I take that.

2454
02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:19.130
That's one thing that Ray Kurzweil really pushes. Is that that cute 10 yeah.

2455
02:29:19.131 --> 02:29:21.480
That's great for cognitive function. Yeah.

2456
02:29:21.570 --> 02:29:22.880
You fuck around with mushrooms at all?

2457
02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:26.120
I mean like healthy mushrooms like lion's mane or anything like that? No,

2458
02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:28.100
really good stuff. That's what I've been drinking.

2459
02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:31.320
This is all lion's mane elixir. I'll try that out.

2460
02:29:31.330 --> 02:29:34.820
I drink this shit all the time. It supports brain function. Yeah.

2461
02:29:34.821 --> 02:29:37.780
That's like anything that's about the brain. I want to know more about. Yeah.

2462
02:29:37.781 --> 02:29:40.910
This is one of my sponsors. This is, I'm a four. Sigmatic.

2463
02:29:40.911 --> 02:29:44.330
I'll have them send you some of this stuff please. And then we, uh,

2464
02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:47.960
we actually have lion's mane that we put in the coffee too. Yeah.

2465
02:29:47.961 --> 02:29:50.420
And then layered Hamilton superfood shit.

2466
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:52.930
Have you seen that coffee machine that I have out here? Yeah. Ooh,

2467
02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:55.190
I'm going to get you something to drink coffee. Yes. Yes, I do. Okay.

2468
02:29:55.210 --> 02:29:58.400
We wrap this up. I'll make you a nice cup of tumeric coffee. Oh,

2469
02:29:58.401 --> 02:30:01.040
I love to American. Yeah. Well he's layered.

2470
02:30:01.041 --> 02:30:03.680
Hamilton has this amazing machine out there that he gave us.

2471
02:30:03.681 --> 02:30:07.900
We got one of the first machines and it's, uh, he mixes, um,

2472
02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:12.650
coconut oil, coconut milk, uh, turmeric, organic coffee,

2473
02:30:12.651 --> 02:30:15.560
and it's fucking delicious and it's actually very good for you. Wow.

2474
02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:18.530
And then he also has like this bag of mushrooms,

2475
02:30:18.531 --> 02:30:21.200
cordyceps mushrooms in lion's mane. You can scoop that in there.

2476
02:30:21.201 --> 02:30:24.470
But lion's mane in particular is what I'm really interested in because it

2477
02:30:24.471 --> 02:30:26.780
supports brain function, you know. And, uh,

2478
02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:29.910
have you seen the work of Paul Stamets? Do you know who he is? Yeah.

2479
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:32.350
I'll turn you on to him. Um,

2480
02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:35.900
and send you a link to the podcast that I did with him.

2481
02:30:35.930 --> 02:30:39.950
He'll blow your fucking mind when he's talking about the power of functional

2482
02:30:39.951 --> 02:30:42.530
mushrooms, not just mushrooms, like psychedelic mushrooms,

2483
02:30:42.531 --> 02:30:43.640
which he's into that as well.

2484
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:47.660
He thinks it's psychedelic mushrooms in low doses are like one of the most

2485
02:30:47.661 --> 02:30:51.470
powerful nootropics that you could have. Like micro dosing. Yeah. Yeah.

2486
02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:54.170
But instead of getting blitz out of your mind and going into another dimension,

2487
02:30:54.171 --> 02:30:56.660
you're taking just a little bit every day, just a little tiny bit.

2488
02:30:56.900 --> 02:31:01.880
And it gives you this like overwhelming, uh, feeling of, uh,

2489
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.360
operating at a very high functions, weird feeling.

2490
02:31:05.361 --> 02:31:10.361
But it's that micro dosing silicide and thing is swept through the fighter

2491
02:31:10.941 --> 02:31:14.600
community has a lot of fighters that are training while they're microdosing

2492
02:31:14.601 --> 02:31:18.620
mushrooms. Yeah. It's very interesting. Why are they doing that? Why,

2493
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:20.020
why is it trainers? Why

2494
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:20.933
<v 1>are, well,</v>

2495
02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:25.320
Donald Cerrone's really into it and a few other fighters have followed suit on.

2496
02:31:25.321 --> 02:31:27.990
Donald I think started doing it because of Joe Schilling,

2497
02:31:27.991 --> 02:31:32.730
who's a world champion kickboxer and he's fighting for Bella tore now and they

2498
02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:36.480
just find that there's something about the way it interacts,

2499
02:31:36.481 --> 02:31:37.350
the way the psilocybin,

2500
02:31:37.351 --> 02:31:41.610
and particularly in low doses interacts with your brain that it just seems to

2501
02:31:41.611 --> 02:31:45.330
supercharge your ability to understand what a person's doing.

2502
02:31:45.331 --> 02:31:47.880
Like especially specific specifically according to Joe,

2503
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:49.350
when he's sparring with people,

2504
02:31:49.650 --> 02:31:53.040
he says he like almost can like read their minds. Wow. Yeah.

2505
02:31:53.610 --> 02:31:57.450
That's really interesting. Yeah, very, very interesting. I know a lot of people,

2506
02:31:57.540 --> 02:32:00.330
a lot of skiers, skiers like to microdose,

2507
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:04.990
it's becoming this a thing where people try to take like a,

2508
02:32:04.991 --> 02:32:08.960
a a functional amount. So like you're not getting blitzed, you're just taking,

2509
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:13.590
it isn't functional now. That's a good question. Good question. Like a, like a,

2510
02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.920
like a STEM, like a little drop. No, that's even,

2511
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:21.930
I mean the best way to find out what it would be would be to grind it up so you

2512
02:32:21.931 --> 02:32:25.770
know the exact ounces and then write it in a capsule and then figure it out.

2513
02:32:25.771 --> 02:32:27.930
And I think that's what a lot of these guys are doing.

2514
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:32.730
It's just very unfortunate that that is a schedule one drug. Right.

2515
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:37.770
A natural life form that grows on earth. It's a fungus bounce on a drug.

2516
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:42.810
Yeah. And it's got some pretty potent positive qualities to it.

2517
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:47.580
But outside of, you know, anything that's psychoactive or psychedelic,

2518
02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:50.120
that lines main stuff is the shit. Well,

2519
02:32:50.121 --> 02:32:51.900
let's put it in this water right now then come on son.

2520
02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:54.700
<v 0>It's going to be a one of these,</v>

2521
02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:57.160
it's going to be my Elon Musk smoking weed moment right now.

2522
02:32:58.490 --> 02:33:03.050
<v 1>Nobody gets high off lions, man. Cool. Thank you.</v>

2523
02:33:04.760 --> 02:33:08.990
Um, so other than that, other than this, uh, sell stuff, what is it again?

2524
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.943
What's it called?

2525
02:33:10.430 --> 02:33:12.440
<v 0>Um, I wish I had like a, my,</v>

2526
02:33:12.441 --> 02:33:16.460
someone from my team kinda give me my whole list cause I take something for,

2527
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:20.800
I take a lot of brain cognitive stuff that I know that are, um,

2528
02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:25.550
not some might can be considered that way, but it's from my doctor that,

2529
02:33:26.090 --> 02:33:29.440
you know, um, you know, from what I,

2530
02:33:29.441 --> 02:33:34.250
I do enough research on a doctors and they tell me kind of what I should take

2531
02:33:34.251 --> 02:33:38.750
and, and I go, okay, let's try this out and see if, and like, you know, my,

2532
02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:42.500
my, uh, performance increases and then I stop.

2533
02:33:43.250 --> 02:33:46.760
So I'll do it for like a month and I'll stop and I'll take a different, like,

2534
02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:47.601
you know,

2535
02:33:47.601 --> 02:33:50.810
I have like two different routes of vitamins and I take a different route and

2536
02:33:50.811 --> 02:33:54.860
see if that changes my patterns or how, um, you know,

2537
02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:58.760
what my performance is like and that kind of like just experiment over and over.

2538
02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:03.470
And again. Have you ever done the isolation tank floating in a, yeah.

2539
02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:07.130
Yeah. I love that. Do you do that? I did it twice. It's very new to me,

2540
02:34:07.131 --> 02:34:11.450
but it's like, it's incredible. Yeah. You need one of those in your life. Yes.

2541
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:14.300
She can. One of those in your crazy Funhouse I know, I was thinking about that.

2542
02:34:14.470 --> 02:34:17.090
There's one place in Henderson where I live that does that.

2543
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:20.560
So I was going to first do that first there. Yeah. Do it man. Um,

2544
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:24.030
we have one here. Yeah. I mean like the, the last two years,

2545
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:28.800
like the ice plunges. Um, I just learned that the Wim Hof method, uh,

2546
02:34:28.850 --> 02:34:33.160
love that. Love that. Amazing. I, I've been, I've, I've never met him in person,

2547
02:34:33.161 --> 02:34:37.780
but it's great. Yeah. I, you know, I know he's in your, in your lane friends.

2548
02:34:38.110 --> 02:34:41.200
He's a character man. Yeah, I've seen the documentary. He's like,

2549
02:34:41.201 --> 02:34:42.820
that's what the F like the vice documentary,

2550
02:34:42.850 --> 02:34:46.870
that guy just died at all drinks beer and eat spaghetti.

2551
02:34:47.290 --> 02:34:49.600
Like he's fucking ridiculous. He doesn't give a shit.

2552
02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:54.220
He goes to Everest fucking barefoot clients. Crazy climbs Evers in his shorts.

2553
02:34:54.221 --> 02:34:55.990
It's like, it's too easy. Yeah. He's like,

2554
02:34:56.140 --> 02:34:58.930
but he gets other people to do with him. Show that like anyone could do that.

2555
02:34:58.931 --> 02:35:01.690
Yeah. It's incredible. He is a unique

2556
02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:06.260
<v 2>human being. Like a really true, truly unique human being in,</v>

2557
02:35:06.261 --> 02:35:10.410
in the sense that he's just talking about breathing.

2558
02:35:10.650 --> 02:35:14.760
He's not talking about doing some sort of incredible athletics that, you know,

2559
02:35:14.761 --> 02:35:16.710
a rare few people can achieve.

2560
02:35:16.890 --> 02:35:20.730
Now he's talking about concentrating on your breathing and understanding how you

2561
02:35:20.731 --> 02:35:25.440
can inhale, like deeper breaths and concentrate on the breath.

2562
02:35:25.441 --> 02:35:29.580
And that in doing so you're changing your physiological state and has got a

2563
02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:33.750
whole program that shows you how to do it correctly and it enhances your immune

2564
02:35:33.751 --> 02:35:36.690
system and enhances your awareness and it's wild shit.

2565
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:41.040
<v 0>That's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I tried to do that breath work, uh,</v>

2566
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:45.970
whenever I possibly can. I, there's two people that I've worked with that,

2567
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:49.810
that, uh, trained underneath whim. One of, one of them's in New York as Spain.

2568
02:35:49.811 --> 02:35:52.960
So whenever I'm in Majorca, Spain, I meet up with him, we do the breath work,

2569
02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:56.140
holding breath exercises, and then we do the ice ice bath.

2570
02:35:56.650 --> 02:35:59.380
And then I have one that's based in San Diego, this woman,

2571
02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:03.640
and she comes out to Vegas. And then I like to do the group dynamic ice bath.

2572
02:36:03.641 --> 02:36:04.540
So I'll have um,

2573
02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:08.710
this like pool that's not an ice bath but 50 degrees.

2574
02:36:08.830 --> 02:36:13.540
So it's cold enough to like feel it. That's fucking cold. Yeah, exactly. So, uh,

2575
02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.310
I get like whoever wants to join me, but you like this group kind of, you know,

2576
02:36:18.311 --> 02:36:21.520
huddle, we get, get in there, become out, we do the breath work,

2577
02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:24.090
hold their breath, you know, and it's,

2578
02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:27.550
it's a great way to get people together and experience something like that too.

2579
02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:28.900
No, that's awesome man.

2580
02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:32.260
<v 2>The UFC training center, uh, the performance Institute in, uh,</v>

2581
02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:36.960
Vegas has this hot bath right next to a cold plunge and they have people going

2582
02:36:36.961 --> 02:36:39.180
back and forth between the two. Have you ever been to that place?

2583
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.711
<v 0>Uh,</v>

2584
02:36:39.711 --> 02:36:43.200
yeah I shot my music video there cause I had Bruce buffer featuring on a song of

2585
02:36:43.470 --> 02:36:47.090
mine called it's time. It's funny,

2586
02:36:47.091 --> 02:36:49.340
I didn't bring that up earlier cause you're so tied in with UFC,

2587
02:36:49.341 --> 02:36:53.630
but we shot the video there. I was training to fight the other DJ that we,

2588
02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:58.550
I made the song with Andy and Bruce. You were trained to fight a DJ? Well,

2589
02:36:58.551 --> 02:37:03.470
I mean, the video is like video. You're trained to fight at the UFC,

2590
02:37:03.471 --> 02:37:08.450
a facility and a this legendary UFC fighter.

2591
02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:11.120
I'm spacing on his name. He was training me,

2592
02:37:11.121 --> 02:37:14.150
so it was kind of cool to have him there with me. What'd he look like? Well,

2593
02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.113
he put up, pick up the,

2594
02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:19.190
<v 2>okay, I'll fine. Can I, can I run to use the bathroom real quick? Sure, sure.</v>

2595
02:37:19.191 --> 02:37:22.490
Go ahead. We'll hold this pit. Here we go.

2596
02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:24.350
So we're watching it on the video.

2597
02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:31.360
A hokey versus Luke is Bruce buffer. So who's training him though? Let's see.

2598
02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.770
There's all these, uh, people running around Bruce buffer

2599
02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:42.050
who is a, who's training him.

2600
02:37:43.630 --> 02:37:47.500
I don't see any UFC guy training him,

2601
02:37:47.501 --> 02:37:50.210
but you keep jumping ahead. We're not going to see it. Yeah.

2602
02:37:50.590 --> 02:37:55.180
Not focusing on there, man. I see it's too quick. Yeah, but who is that? Oh,

2603
02:37:55.181 --> 02:37:58.750
it's Ken Shamrock. Oh, eventually here. Oh, there you go.

2604
02:37:59.590 --> 02:38:02.190
Ken Shamrock screaming in his face with sunglasses on.

2605
02:38:05.710 --> 02:38:10.630
He's a trip, isn't he? Yeah, he's a very interesting guy. Yeah. KC. Me.

2606
02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:15.640
Oh my God. That's hilarious. Okay. He's, um, it's,

2607
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:19.870
it's so interesting when you see all these different people have these different

2608
02:38:19.871 --> 02:38:24.730
paths in life and you go, Oh, okay, you could go down that path too.

2609
02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:29.830
You know, like the Steve Aoki path is so different than most paths.

2610
02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:34.600
And I think that one of the cooler things about talking to people is you,

2611
02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.080
you get this sense that the, the, the way you can live your lives,

2612
02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:41.680
not as rigid as people would have you believe. Did,

2613
02:38:41.681 --> 02:38:44.770
have you believed that there's only a few different ways to go about this or

2614
02:38:44.771 --> 02:38:49.360
this? There's not that much variability. We're saying nice things about you.

2615
02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:53.650
He just returned. We watched, it was Ken Shamrock. He was a fighter. Yeah.

2616
02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:56.240
He was like, you know, when you do, when you're like,

2617
02:38:56.390 --> 02:38:59.700
I was hanging like this and he's just like slept my stomach and stuff. Yeah.

2618
02:38:59.890 --> 02:39:03.820
We were watching it. Sunglasses screaming at you. Exactly.

2619
02:39:04.090 --> 02:39:08.540
Do you do any martial arts training? Um, you know, strangely enough, like my,

2620
02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:12.220
my biggest hero growing up is Bruce Lee. So, you know,

2621
02:39:12.221 --> 02:39:15.550
in the beginning I started wanting to learn G kudo and the, you know,

2622
02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:18.100
do you see constantly at a time in Hollywood now?

2623
02:39:18.101 --> 02:39:23.020
Yet there's a scene in there that's very negative about Bruce Lee.

2624
02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:26.170
I loved the movie. I really enjoyed it. I'm a huge Tarantino fan.

2625
02:39:26.171 --> 02:39:28.760
I think that's awesome. But this does controversy around that.

2626
02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:29.860
But I didn't see that very,

2627
02:39:29.861 --> 02:39:33.860
very controversial cause he made Bruce Lee look like a buffoon. Oh, that sucks.

2628
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:36.190
Really arrogant buffoon. Wow.

2629
02:39:36.250 --> 02:39:39.640
And I don't think there's any evidence that he was ever really like that. Yeah.

2630
02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:44.530
But you know, he Terentino's sorta dug his heels in, sort of defended it.

2631
02:39:44.531 --> 02:39:47.710
But I don't think he knows the culture because he's not a martial artist.

2632
02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:49.210
I think he looked at,

2633
02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:54.300
I think he looked at Bruce Lee as sort of like this historical figure that's,

2634
02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:58.840
you know, kicking people's asses and movies.

2635
02:39:58.841 --> 02:40:01.600
And I think to understand Bruce Lee the way you do,

2636
02:40:01.601 --> 02:40:05.470
or the way I do where he was my childhood hero as well.

2637
02:40:05.471 --> 02:40:10.471
So like he's the guy that's really responsible for mixing the martial arts.

2638
02:40:11.050 --> 02:40:14.040
When you talk about mixed martial arts, like all credit has to go to the

2639
02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:16.260
<v 3>Gracies because they're the ones who, you know,</v>

2640
02:40:16.290 --> 02:40:21.290
Helson Gracie and Horian and hoists and Hixon and that family was responsible

2641
02:40:23.101 --> 02:40:28.101
for really showing people jujitsu and also Horian invented the UFC.

2642
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:33.950
So without Horian and his contributions mean we might not have ever known what

2643
02:40:34.771 --> 02:40:35.880
we know today. Right.

2644
02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:40.140
But Bruce sleep was on that path a long time ago.

2645
02:40:40.410 --> 02:40:45.300
He had figured out a long time ago that you got to find what's useful and all

2646
02:40:45.301 --> 02:40:47.850
different styles of martial arts. Exactly.

2647
02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:52.920
It's also deeply entrenched in philosophy and he was a brilliant guy so they

2648
02:40:52.921 --> 02:40:56.040
made him look like this buffoon and then that sucks. I didn't like that.

2649
02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:57.113
That's like one of the,

2650
02:40:57.140 --> 02:40:59.600
the main things about Bruce Lee that I loved about him was that his,

2651
02:40:59.601 --> 02:41:03.300
his philosophy and a lot of things to say about life. Yeah.

2652
02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:06.360
Like the martial arts was one thing that's like, well made him cool,

2653
02:41:06.361 --> 02:41:09.420
made him such a badass. But his philosophy,

2654
02:41:09.421 --> 02:41:11.470
the words behind all that and how it, it,

2655
02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:14.400
it can reflect on everyone being like water.

2656
02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:17.270
And the best part for me is that he's a,

2657
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:20.850
he's an Asian face because I mean at the end of the day,

2658
02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:24.750
you think about what's out there in the media and popular culture.

2659
02:41:24.751 --> 02:41:29.751
You don't see an Asian face that's loved by all different ethnicities.

2660
02:41:30.450 --> 02:41:33.750
Yeah. He's the number one. He's the, the, uh, like every,

2661
02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:38.250
does it matter if you're black, white, Brown, purple, yellow, whatever you are,

2662
02:41:38.490 --> 02:41:41.910
you're like, yeah, you have to honor, like one of the greats,

2663
02:41:41.970 --> 02:41:43.860
everybody likes Bruce Lee and he's Asian.

2664
02:41:43.861 --> 02:41:46.650
So he represents something very powerful for Asian people.

2665
02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:51.370
How many Chinese dudes got laid because of Bruce Lee? Exactly. Fuck man.

2666
02:41:51.430 --> 02:41:56.430
The numbers probably if you take the main how many Chinese people that got laid

2667
02:41:57.481 --> 02:42:01.290
with non-Chinese women. Oh yeah. That's like, cause at the end of the day,

2668
02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:05.580
the women loved Bruce Lee. Everybody loved, yeah. Everyone. Everybody. Yeah.

2669
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:10.080
And there hasn't been someone like that, you know, uh,

2670
02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:14.610
that has that striking feeling. That's Asian in popular culture like that,

2671
02:42:14.611 --> 02:42:19.040
you know? So also like the first guy that was really shredded in movies. Yeah.

2672
02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:21.540
We'd take his shirt off. No,

2673
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:24.510
you definitely got that stance that she was just like, yeah,

2674
02:42:24.570 --> 02:42:28.050
he was fucking shredded and you would look at him and you go, God,

2675
02:42:28.051 --> 02:42:31.110
that guy's body's ridiculous. Like everybody wanted that body.

2676
02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:34.410
Everybody wanted to be lean and muscular.

2677
02:42:34.411 --> 02:42:38.820
And that's where I got my room from at my house. That Bruce Lee, game of death,

2678
02:42:38.821 --> 02:42:42.750
right? Yeah. That's the dragon. That's end of the dragons.

2679
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:45.690
At least for me. I got the mirror from enter the dragon,

2680
02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:50.691
but that the mirror room scene is way more mirrors like kind of in different

2681
02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:55.560
degrees and yeah, it was, it was entered the dragon, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2682
02:42:55.561 --> 02:42:57.930
It was hundred a dragon. Fuck. That was a good movie.

2683
02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:01.890
And for the time those movies, you know, people don't like them or do like them.

2684
02:43:02.310 --> 02:43:05.790
What's interesting about Bruce is the style of fighting and those movies like

2685
02:43:05.791 --> 02:43:09.300
jumping, flying kicks and all that stuff, that's not what he advocated at all.

2686
02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:12.370
He did that purely the cinematic value.

2687
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:15.010
<v 1>Right. He wanted to make it exciting and flashy. Yeah.</v>

2688
02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:18.630
Like he was all about kicking people in the knees, punch of people throat,

2689
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:19.120
you know,

2690
02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:23.440
like he was about like really effective techniques that you could use to end a

2691
02:43:23.441 --> 02:43:26.040
fight in seconds. You know, that was what he was all about. Yeah.

2692
02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:31.080
But what he did do was there was like two big bursts in martial arts and Bruce

2693
02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:35.140
Lee was responsible in my opinion, for the first,

2694
02:43:35.470 --> 02:43:40.120
he was responsible for getting people excited about training martial arts and

2695
02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:44.200
seeing this guy that could kick everybody's ass. And like this guy was like,

2696
02:43:44.290 --> 02:43:47.080
he was quiet and humble, but you know,

2697
02:43:47.081 --> 02:43:50.230
when it came time to throw down and take his shirt off and fuck everybody up.

2698
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:55.390
And then the next stage was the UFC. Those are like in my lifetime,

2699
02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:58.330
this to two big really culturally,

2700
02:43:58.331 --> 02:44:02.920
the two big leaps in martial arts was people getting into Bruce Lee because of

2701
02:44:02.921 --> 02:44:06.040
getting into martial arts because of Bruce Lee movies. Of course chocolate bars,

2702
02:44:06.041 --> 02:44:06.730
movies. Yeah.

2703
02:44:06.730 --> 02:44:11.110
And then the next one was getting into martial arts because of the UFC. Right?

2704
02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:15.010
So it was bomber. It was a bomber that they made them look like a dope.

2705
02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:16.093
That sucks.

2706
02:44:16.330 --> 02:44:21.100
I'm as excited to watch that movie because I thought that Bresee was gonna look

2707
02:44:21.101 --> 02:44:26.020
like about us. Cause in the, in the, in the trailer. Yeah. You're like, Oh no.

2708
02:44:26.021 --> 02:44:29.440
Bruce Lee's in there. Like it's going to be cool with, yeah. With Brad Pitt.

2709
02:44:29.441 --> 02:44:32.890
Leonardo DiCaprio. Quinn Terentino's is going to be Epic.

2710
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:35.960
It's a fucking great movie. Know, don't let it hold you back because the movies,

2711
02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:40.900
fun shit. I really enjoyed it. It's a fun look. I like all those movies I loved,

2712
02:44:40.901 --> 02:44:44.260
hateful, ate a lot of people don't like hatefully it. Oh, I loved it.

2713
02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:48.760
I think his movies are, if you're into like a Tarantino movie,

2714
02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:53.080
like I like his style of making fiction. Yeah, the Django. Yeah.

2715
02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:57.610
They're wild. They're great films. Absolutely great films. Such a fan.

2716
02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:00.610
I'm just glad he's out there because it's like, there's mu,

2717
02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.330
there's moments in that movie where I don't wanna S I'm not gonna give anything

2718
02:45:04.331 --> 02:45:08.020
away, but there's moments in, in Hollywood, where are you going?

2719
02:45:08.050 --> 02:45:12.160
I can't believe you could still do this in a movie, like on this day and age,

2720
02:45:12.190 --> 02:45:16.690
like you're allowed to do that in a movie. He goes hard while in the paint.

2721
02:45:17.110 --> 02:45:21.640
Yeah. But the Bruce Lee things, you know, whatever you gotta do,

2722
02:45:21.641 --> 02:45:25.030
it wasn't real. The real Bruce Lee is what's interesting and exciting to me.

2723
02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:27.930
Right. You know, I mean, that's where like my,

2724
02:45:27.990 --> 02:45:32.340
my record label democ it's, you know, you know a democracy. Yeah.

2725
02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:36.880
I mean it's not necessarily tied to Bruce Lee, but it's my way of,

2726
02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:38.320
of like, you know,

2727
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:42.350
instead of calling it Bruce Lee records or I love Bruce Lee records. Right.

2728
02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:47.170
I was like, well, this is this mysterious death touch. And you know,

2729
02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.150
there's, like I said,

2730
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:52.750
that this mystery around that that's connected sort of to Bruce Lee. There's,

2731
02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:56.680
yeah. It would be really interesting if there really was a demonic,

2732
02:45:56.681 --> 02:46:00.040
like a mysterious death touch if it was, it was real.

2733
02:46:00.041 --> 02:46:03.830
But a lot of fucking people believe in it. If you ever see those videos on,

2734
02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:07.630
on when they to fall down. Yeah.

2735
02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:11.370
That does make dojo life on Instagram was kind of a shit load of,

2736
02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:12.800
and this guy just collects them all.

2737
02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:14.870
And there's so many of them that are so ridiculous.

2738
02:46:14.871 --> 02:46:17.360
I posted one a couple of days ago of this, uh,

2739
02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:20.990
it looks like an Aikido guy and he's just like doing this like watch,

2740
02:46:21.050 --> 02:46:25.110
watch this video kinda comes out and he's like, pushes him away. Oh,

2741
02:46:25.111 --> 02:46:26.060
I makes you fall down.

2742
02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:31.730
So you stand there like a tall one. Oh,

2743
02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:35.620
you fall down. Look at him. You wow Brown.

2744
02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:39.850
No power here. It's so ridiculous. It is. It's

2745
02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:44.930
playing. He believes it. Yeah. It's so,

2746
02:46:44.931 --> 02:46:49.520
so fucking evangelical preachers that like they touched in someone's head and

2747
02:46:49.521 --> 02:46:53.300
the guys like falling over. Yeah. And they're all practicing it.

2748
02:46:53.301 --> 02:46:55.280
Look like they're all practicing.

2749
02:46:55.281 --> 02:46:59.480
All this nonsense will get you killed in a real fight and these guys are leaving

2750
02:46:59.481 --> 02:47:01.970
their house. They're putting on their fucking outfit. Right.

2751
02:47:01.971 --> 02:47:05.120
It really think that this is real. This is actually happening. Yeah.

2752
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:08.610
It's so corny. It really is what you're going do.

2753
02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:12.620
Well listen man, I really enjoyed talking to you. I appreciate it.

2754
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:17.540
Thanks for having me. Your book blue. The color of noise is available right now,

2755
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:20.060
right it everywhere. It's out everywhere. Did you do the audio book?

2756
02:47:20.061 --> 02:47:23.440
Did you read it? I read the, there's drops in there.

2757
02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:25.580
It's called what I call drops. You're like the, the,

2758
02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:29.810
these small little chapters between the chapters. So I read those. Um,

2759
02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:30.860
I try to read the whole book,

2760
02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:35.630
but I was touring all summer so I could only read the drops. That's too bad.

2761
02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:39.380
But yeah, I'd like to hear you read it. Especially since it's your life. Yeah,

2762
02:47:39.430 --> 02:47:41.480
there, there is like 10 drops,

2763
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:44.990
so you can hear me talk about it in my tone and my voice.

2764
02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:46.760
And if people want to catch your live show,

2765
