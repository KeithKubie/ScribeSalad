[WATER SPLASHING]

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.690
ERENA SHIMODA: So
today, you are going

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.820
to learn how to sink underwater
because I want to take you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.340
to my underwater world.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.280
No, don't hold your
breath like that

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.550
because you won't sink down
into the water like this.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.020
All puffed up like a puffer
fish, holding in all that air,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.510
you will bob up to the
surface like a duck toy.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.590
Being underwater is a
transforming experience,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.320
and I want to yours
to be beautiful.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.440
But you can't get
there if you're

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.590
hanging on to fear, doubt,
and things you don't need.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.260
So you need to
learn how to let go.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.850
Let's do this together.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.110
Inhale and exhale
with a count of five.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.300
And when you exhale,
make sure you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.450
exhale all the way
until you empty lungs

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.000
before you inhale again.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.810
Ready?

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.822
Inhale.

00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:26.150
[INHALES] Your lungs
expanding, and exhale.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.894
[EXHALES]

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.620
Inhale and exhale
as slow as you can.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.340
Your heart rate will slow down.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.800
Everything will slow down.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.510
You are learning to let go
of your breath and fear.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.130
And you are learning to trust
your body and the water.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.080
Let's do this one more time.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.107
Inhale.

00:01:54.107 --> 00:01:59.706
[INHALES] And exhale.

00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:07.742
[EXHALES] You are
learning to let go.

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:11.460
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.650
That means "the ocean is wide,
the ocean is huge" in Japanese.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.750
I used to sing that song
in this inflatable pool

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.860
and pretend that
I was a mermaid.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.550
Raise your hand.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.710
Who wants to be a mermaid?

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.630
Good, good.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.710
Merman?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.420
Good.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.310
I wanted to be a mermaid
and live underwater.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.830
I was born and raised in Japan.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.730
My father took us to the
ocean almost every summer

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.970
right outside Tokyo.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.220
1989, we moved to the US.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.960
One summer, we were in
a terrible car accident.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.400
I was thrown out the car,
sent to ICU by helicopter,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.060
fractured my entire body, and
I had a major brain injury.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.890
I almost lost my life.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.220
But instead, I lost my father,
who was in the driver's seat.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.440
It was a miracle I survived
after all those injuries.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.720
My family and friends tell me
that my father protected me,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.380
and I am a survivor
for a reason.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.540
At the time, I didn't
know what it really meant.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.780
But I felt a huge
pressure because I

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.000
didn't want my father's
death to be in vain.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.700
Years later, I
discovered scuba diving,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.050
and I found out that I had a
talent for being underwater.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.830
Because I was good at breathing,
I was in the water longer

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.600
than everybody else.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.480
I felt like I belong here.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.560
I'm almost mermaid.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.710
That same year, I
went to Venezuela

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.710
and became a dive master.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.950
I started taking
pictures of marine life.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.329
I absolutely love
the underwater world.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.975
Scuba diving and underwater
photography became my passion.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
One day, I read that
scuba diving and swimming

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.450
can be alternative medicines
for anxieties and depressions.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.100
I was actually struggling with
my depression at that time.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.880
I could not get out from
my room or talk to anyone.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.920
I felt anxious, angry,
and frustrated, and sad.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.410
I was not being myself, and it
was getting worse day by day.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.850
And I knew I had
to look for help.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.600
I saw a psychologist,
psychiatrist, and therapist.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.040
Nobody knew what
caused my depression.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.130
I also have no family history.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.385
Maybe the chemical imbalance
from my brain injury.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.870
I was on medications
for over a year,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.476
and I was not feeling
better at all.

00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:22.440
And I even felt worse.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.850
So I wanted to believe in these
articles about scuba diving

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.420
and swimming because it was
my only hope to get better.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.410
And I remember when I
scuba dive, all the worries

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.650
and angers I can let go.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.370
It's like water sets me free.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.880
When I'm touched by
water from 360 degrees,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.380
I can't feel this peaceful
energy swelling into my body.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.440
This is my meditation space.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.280
I can be myself and be free.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.550
Since scuba diving is not
easily accessible for me,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.510
I pushed myself to go
swimming every day.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.120
I felt better
almost immediately,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.180
and I dropped those medications
for being underwater.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.360
That's why I love
creating images

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.410
with people underwater,
because underwater portrait

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.010
photography has the same
psychological benefits,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.460
and I am able to share that
experience with my clients

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.370
underwater.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.650
Everything is different.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.640
The lighting, the
shapes, the sounds.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.840
The subject's hair, face,
and dress move underwater.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.420
Everything's slow and peaceful.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.930
It's like you're dreaming.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.120
What's going to
happen underwater?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.020
I never know.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.500
And it's challenging.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.330
I love that mystery.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.390
And underwater portrait
photography became my passion.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.240
I've been underwater
photographer for over 10 years.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.600
And back in 2013, I
launched a campaign

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.660
called Underwater
Healer About Face

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.090
to help cancer
survivors rediscover

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.230
their beauty through underwater
portrait photography.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.410
Ever since, I donate
my time and reach out

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.980
to survivors of cancer,
domestic violence,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.810
people with PTSD and
physical disabilities.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.840
This project is
so important to me

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.220
because I love to see the
beautiful and mysterious

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.300
transformations that
happen underwater.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.520
I want to give back
to the community

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.490
and spread this project
all over the world.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.860
I've met so many
survivors who have

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.090
shared the powerful stories.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.140
And I want to show you some of
the subject I've worked with.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.610
This is Drina.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.600
When she was eight years
old, she almost drowned.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.060
Ever since, she hasn't
been in the water

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.150
deeper than her knee level.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.060
She contacted me to do
this underwater maternity

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.200
photo shoot because she wanted
to overcome her fear by doing

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.440
this beautiful photo project.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.070
In the beginning,
she was terrified.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.150
Within 20 minutes, she
conquered her biggest fear,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:38.130
and she couldn't stop crying
after the photo shoot.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.340
Facing her fear helped
to release the trauma

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.959
she experienced as a child.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.680
And this is her first time
ever underwater selfie shot.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.280
She looks beautiful, right?

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.540
I have a client who
wants to stay anonymous.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.960
PTSD she experienced
from domestic abuse

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.480
was much, much more
difficult than dealing

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.950
with breast cancer.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.480
She was in a very
abusive relationship.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.120
Thanks to the police
and her mother,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.650
she finally got to escape.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.250
But she was still scared
of dark and being alone,

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.840
and sought psychosomatic
help for her PTSD.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.410
Now, she's in a healthy
relationship and got married.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.050
But then she was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:38.930
During her treatment, she told
me that she went to islands.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:44.270
She discovered water helped the
painful swelling in her body.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.440
She also said underwater,
nobody judges her,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.340
and she feels completely safe.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.830
This is Chelsie.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.700
When she was 17 years old,
she was in a car accident.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.680
Her driver was drunk.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.970
The car smashed into a tree--

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.510
crashed into a tree,
and the accident

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.610
damaged her spinal cord.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.480
She's in the wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.700
This was not her first
time being in the water,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.760
but it was her first time
completely submerging

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.200
underwater.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.710
Also, it was her first time
opening her eyes and smile

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.100
at the same in the water.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.950
Chelsea said it was a
challenging experience.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:41.130
She found a new courage to
feel beautiful and strong.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.770
And she also said
underwater, she

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.150
felt the freedom for not
relying on her wheelchair.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.010
This is Jared.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.360
He's an army veteran.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.970
During his service
in Afghanistan,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.320
his right arm was blown off.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.730
He has PTSD, traumatic brain
injury, chronic phantom limb

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.970
pain, and shrapnel
still in his body.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.580
After he had discovered
scuba diving,

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.450
he found out that
underwater is the only place

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.930
that he doesn't feel any pain.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.725
Ocean is his therapy, and
water means peace, tranquility,

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:24.225
and freedom.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.740
He is also a member of Dive
Warriors, the organizations who

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.520
helps disabled veterans
with scuba diving.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.920
The day after the
photo shoot with Jared,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.800
the Dive Warriors took
me out to go scuba dive

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.370
in Catalina Island.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.540
It meant a lot to me that
I was part of their lives,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.600
even just for one day.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.770
We have different
backgrounds and disabilities.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:03.330
But underwater, we were all
equal, safe, and pain free.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.530
I cannot wait to meet them
underwater in the future again.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.530
The last survivor I want
to introduce you to today

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.920
is Laurie, a breast
cancer survivor.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.348
I'm going to play this video.

00:12:16.348 --> 00:12:17.014
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:17.860
- Hi.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.020
My name is Laurie Ratliff.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.700
I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.050
I was diagnosed almost 30 years
ago with metastatic breast

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.240
cancer.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.280
And doing this underwater
photo shoot with Erena

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.970
was pretty wonderful.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:39.130
It was exciting, but
relaxing and fun.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.250
And she made the
whole process amazing.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:42.750
Thank you.

00:12:47.807 --> 00:12:48.390
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.120
ERENA SHIMODA: She is
in the audience today.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.550
And you will get to meet
her just in a moment.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.730
And if you're ever
curious and brave to jump

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.560
in the water with me,
come talk to me right

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.160
outside after the presentation.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.590
I can give you a
special discount,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.540
and a portion of
your session fee

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.530
will go towards this campaign
for survivors like Chelsie,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.810
Jared, and Laurie.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.010
At the conference like ICEBAT,
International Conference

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.830
on Evidence Based
Aquatic Therapy,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.600
I meet people who study the
benefits of total immersion.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.620
For centuries in India,
China, throughout Europe,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.830
people go into the water
to feel whole again.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.190
Medical science knows
that total immersion

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.740
has the profound benefits.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.370
Nervous, cardiovascular,
musculoskeletal,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.840
and immune systems are
improved with hydrotherapies.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.980
But I'm most interested
in how water reconnects us

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.890
to who we really are.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.050
Water reminds us
of our wholeness

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.950
and restores us psychologically.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.850
Medical science is beginning to
measure the positive and life

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.310
changing effects
of total immersion,

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:14.520
specifically psychological
effects that water has on us.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.520
I'm most interested in
working with the scientists

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.700
at the forefront
of this research.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.110
If you know any scientists,
psychologists, a PhD student

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.570
who would be interested
in this topic, please

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.990
let me know because I am
available to work together.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:38.040
My family and friends tell me
I am a survivor for a reason.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.280
Remember I told you
about the depression

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.300
and nobody knew what
triggered my brain?

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.320
And I went swimming every day.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.080
I finally figured it out.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.530
I can not lie or
hide underwater.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.720
Water makes me honest.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.470
So I'll tell you the truth.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.560
I haven't told
anybody at the time,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:15.450
but the day of the car accident,
I was actually driving first.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:21.810
I got tired, so I asked my
father to switch with me.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.270
He was also tired after working
long hours for the family.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.500
But of course, he
wouldn't say no.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.310
I wish I didn't have to ask him.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.960
I could have saved his life.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.010
My guilt was huge, and I
didn't know how to handle it.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.470
I still have regrets and angers.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:55.250
But being underwater
helps me let go of that.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:01.410
I cannot change the past, but
what I can do is to give back

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.350
to the community and
make my father proud.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.680
As an artist, I am
fascinated with the process

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.620
of capturing that moment when
we let go and remember that we

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.510
are strong, loved, safe.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.350
Underwater, we can all
let go of our regrets

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.500
and remember who we really are.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.420
I think we are all
survivors for a reason.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.004
Thank you.

00:16:38.004 --> 00:16:41.448
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.540
And now, I can bring in Laurie,
a breast cancer survivor.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.696
And we can do Q and A.

00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:55.070
LAURIE RATLIFF:
Slight correction

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.650
on the video that she showed.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.180
I'm actually a 20
year cancer survivor.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.030
I'd been talking with her just
before that about how long

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.700
I'd been married, which
was almost 30 years.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.109
So that kind of slipped out.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.849
My mother died from breast
cancer when I was 23.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:22.069
And when I was
diagnosed at 34, I

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:28.160
decided that I was not going to
be quiet about it like she was.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.560
It happens to so
many more people

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.410
than you realize that I
was going to talk about it.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.440
And so I had been
talking about it

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.950
for the past 20 years to
anybody who will listen,

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.960
because especially when
I was first diagnosed,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.480
I really didn't have much
contact with anybody.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.740
I didn't know anybody like me.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.200
And then as the
internet began to grow

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.750
and people began to put
more things out there,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.440
I began to see images
of women like me

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.525
that I wished I had
seen in the beginning.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.267
So there are several
photography projects

00:18:12.267 --> 00:18:14.600
that people have done called
the Scar Project, the Grace

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.800
Project.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.420
And I'd seen those pictures
and just been entranced by them

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.660
and realized I'm
only getting older.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.900
So if I want to do
something different,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.430
if I want to be
brave, now's the time.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.070
And this is something
that I can say that--

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.780
I've seen underwater
photos and thought

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.580
they were beautiful,
but thought, "Oh, no.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.160
Not me."

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.770
But then decided, "Yeah, me."

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:52.020
So I Googled [LAUGHS] breast
cancer photography portraits,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:52.520
whatever.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.650
And the very first
thing that came up

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.230
was Erena with underwater.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.670
And I said, "That's it.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.920
That's what I'm going to try."

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.860
And so I contacted her and
pretty quickly, we set it up.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.450
And it was harder
than I thought.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.950
It was easier than I thought.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.670
It was a lot more
fun than I thought.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.090
And I would love to
do it every month.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.530
I'd love to go back and do it.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.400
Just like she was
saying, that sense

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.680
of being underwater, the
calmness, the support.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.500
Because over the years,
treatment and cancer

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.790
can take a lot of
toll on your body.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.260
There's a lot of
collateral damage.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.580
So the past 15 years, I've
dealt with some really serious

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.580
chronic pain issues
and mobility.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.860
And way long ago, I
used to be a dancer.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.320
And I don't get to
do that anymore.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.290
And what I discovered
is going underwater,

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.967
I can feel like I
can dance again.

00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:51.800
ERENA SHIMODA: Yeah.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.775
And looking at her toes,
pointy toes, she's a dancer.

00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:59.759
[LAUGHS] It's
beautiful underwater.

00:19:59.759 --> 00:20:02.300
AUDIENCE: Laurie, would you mind
telling us a little bit more

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.700
about what the experience
was like the first time you

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.530
got into the water?

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.210
I am really curious
about what that

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.310
was like, what it was like
being photographed underwater

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.101
for the first time.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.640
LAURIE RATLIFF: When
we started the session,

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.780
I actually had a dress on.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:24.170
I was unsure if I wanted
to do a unclothed session.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.960
I was-- Yeah.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.470
That scared me a lot.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.550
And obviously, I've had
a bilateral mastectomy.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.530
I chose not to have
reconstruction.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.820
And when I talked
to Erena about it,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.940
she asked me if I would
be doing it topless.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.370
And I was saying,
"I'm really not sure."

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.960
And she encouraged
me by saying that it

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.080
can help other women
to see somebody

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.790
like them if I did feel
comfortable enough doing it.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.720
And that is exactly
what I wished I had had.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.510
And so that kind of
tipped the scales.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.150
But I started in a dress
because I was nervous.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.860
And it feels very strange to
get in the water fully clothed.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.370
But it was a warm pool.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:21.800
And going underwater,
you can be very surprised

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.030
how buoyant you are.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.630
So I would think I would
sink, but I would just

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.070
pop right back up.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.190
And so what she was talking
about, releasing all of the air

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.610
was a challenge to do that
and feel like I'm not going

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.920
to run out of air underwater.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.570
But the more you
did it, the more you

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.236
realized that it was--
it made it easier

00:21:41.236 --> 00:21:44.360
to stay relaxed underwater
to let that all out.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.090
And you can sink and
really just relax.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:58.160
So that was surprising and
a little bit of a struggle

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.325
to remember that and try not
to make my face do the fish.

00:22:02.325 --> 00:22:04.070
And "Oh, open your eyes."

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.220
And you know, "Oh, here,
and there's fabric,"

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.980
and struggling with that.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.660
But once I kind of calmed
down about the whole thing,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.410
it just became easy
because of the water made

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.727
everything fluid and movable.

00:22:18.727 --> 00:22:19.560
ERENA SHIMODA: Yeah.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.150
And the water
temperature helps a lot

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.740
because this pool was indoor
heated and 92 degrees.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.920
And you almost don't want
to come out from the water.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.960
[LAUGHS] And I've worked with
so many different temperatures

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.230
of the pool.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:41.600
And a cold one,
they cannot smile.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.150
Their shoulders are
up, and you're cramped.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.870
And you try to smile with it,
and it's just not natural.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.880
So the temperature, I always
ask whenever I look for a pool,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.410
you need to be in
a certain number.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.550
And this one was really easy.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.050
AUDIENCE: Erena, you mentioned
a little bit about survivor's

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.889
guilt. And I think that's
becoming more of a topic

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:06.680
that we talk about.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.388
But I thought it'd be
interesting to hear

00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:11.270
from both of you, even your
perspectives on that guilt

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.987
that we feel when
we lose a loved one.

00:23:12.987 --> 00:23:14.570
ERENA SHIMODA: First,
I didn't realize

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.580
that was causing my depression.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:29.120
And also, it was for me to
accept it, to accept his death

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.110
to begin with.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:36.650
And also, I was trying
to ignore my problem.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:43.730
So when I started
to face that, this

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.190
was my major problem
that I am not

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.560
accepting and letting it go.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:58.970
And I relied on the medications,
but it was not working for me.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.470
And I was searching
and searching

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.040
for the better result.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.790
And then I started to find
out all the other articles

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.670
about scuba diving and swimming.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.050
And scuba diving is
my favorite sport.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.180
And I can say it
was my first hobby.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.890
So That's why I was so--

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.990
diving since then.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.060
And I cannot do that
in San Francisco.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.800
It's so cold.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.440
And then you cannot
see anything.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.720
Maybe Monterey when
it's really great.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.700
Is there anybody
scuba divers here?

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.950
Yes.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.920
But I highly recommend learning
scuba diving, whether here

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.170
or the diving destinations,
because you feel so free.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.320
Just like when I told
you guys about Jared,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.170
he's an army veteran
with disabilities.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.860
And the water is the only place
that he doesn't feel any pain.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.000
And I don't have the
physical pain like that,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.560
but I certainly feel so much
relieved from the stress

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:09.020
or same thing as going into
the water or the hot tub.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.350
You guys go to hot tub,
like a spa and hot tub.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.000
In Asia, I grew up in Japan.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.530
So almost every night,
we go into the baths.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.570
And my father, I
remember he'd take a bath

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.100
to release all stress from
that day, like long hours.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:34.010
And I really believe
that the water really

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.820
helps me so I could
drop those medications.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.580
And then I'm still swimming
every day, almost every day.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:47.900
So it is a way to
heal, to outlet,

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.072
to heal my survivor's guilt.

00:25:50.072 --> 00:25:51.530
LAURIE RATLIFF:
Survivor's guilt is

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.840
something that crept up on me.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.750
In the beginning,
especially since I

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.430
was diagnosed
metastatic, which means

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.730
that the cancer had
already spread to my bones

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.360
and my life expectancy
was actually

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.240
statistically not that long.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.990
So every year that I went on, it
was great that I'm still here.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.880
Yay.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.220
But as more time went on--

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.330
and I would talk to other cancer
people who had been diagnosed.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.614
And I would say, "Hey, I've
been here 10 years, 15 years."

00:26:26.614 --> 00:26:28.030
It felt good because
I felt like I

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:33.310
could give them hope to say
see, sometimes people do survive

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.800
longer than they say you will.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.080
But then it got
to a certain point

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.800
where I was afraid I was
giving people false hope.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.220
And so many people that I had
met and heard about or just

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:50.380
talked to had passed
away, and I hadn't.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.360
And there's no
explanation for it.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.340
So I started to not
want to talk about it

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.250
and not want to tell
people how long I'd

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:05.410
been a survivor because you
get that question of why me?

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:05.950
Why me?

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:06.449
Why me?

00:27:06.449 --> 00:27:07.720
Why me?

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.830
So it's something I'm
dealing with right now.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.880
And I'm finding it
very difficult to--

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.070
I'm happy to be
alive, of course.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.730
But there's also
that sense of people

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:30.160
lose so many people to cancer
that I worry that I remind

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.050
people that they lost someone.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.090
So it's an ongoing struggle.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:40.090
But this is also had
been part of the process,

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.840
and this really helps
too is asking about it,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.430
because that's a tough subject.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.100
Because most people will say,
"Just be happy you're alive."

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.640
And it's like it's
not that simple.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.250
AUDIENCE: In relation
to therapy and also

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.890
kind of your pathway
specifically, Erena,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:03.080
in kind of searching for what's
broken about me, I'm curious,

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.660
does underwater
therapy produce a place

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.270
of more openness with speaking?

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:16.060
And is that part of
the goal in undergoing

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.490
different kinds of therapy?

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.750
Mostly because in, say, like
Asian or Asian-American spaces,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.630
maybe discussion and
openness around words

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:29.590
is not as available or people
don't have the same tool set.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.501
So I'm curious.

00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:32.500
Maybe it's a two parter.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.090
One, for you, what was
your therapy journey?

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.720
And would you have
done it differently?

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.710
And two, have you found that
Asian or Asian-American clients

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:47.830
have a lot more joy and healing
through underwater therapy?

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.010
ERENA SHIMODA: I cannot
really compare from other

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.426
nationalities.

00:28:52.426 --> 00:28:58.970
But it was-- hmm.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.940
I think they're all equal.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.380
Everybody's different,
regardless of how

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.900
what you are, depends
on a temperature.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.680
But also how you grew up
and how you were reacting.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.420
Like Drina hasn't
been in the water

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.870
deeper than her knee
level, or the people who

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.240
are just swimmer.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.040
They thought they can do it all.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.000
But actually, all the swimmers,
they had all the confidence,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.100
but sinking down vertically was
completely different than what

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.790
swimmers would do.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:41.270
So they were struggling
submerging underwater.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.470
So I know that everybody
has different backgrounds.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.740
But the first 5,
10 minutes, we all

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:54.350
struggle because it's a new
space, and it's a surprise.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:59.580
Because in a picture like this,
you think you can do this,

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.110
right?

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.350
You can do it.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.380
And it looks so easy.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.420
But actually, when you are
in the water and sink down,

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.960
it depends on the
muscle mass too.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.730
The muscle is heavy like weight.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.410
So you can sink more.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.960
But sometimes you can't.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.860
So the first 5, 10 minutes
is a struggle for everybody

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.410
to adjust in a different world.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.050
And then after the
10 minutes, everybody

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:35.000
has the similar transformation,
next transformative experience.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.110
And everybody has the different
types of transformation.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:47.090
And my goal is to see them
smile after the photo sessions,

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:51.170
or see that when I show them the
preview photos from my camera,

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.610
I want them to laugh.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.110
That's my goal.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.740
Because laughing is really
important for our lives.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.170
Even just to watch
movies and laugh.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.980
And the laughing-- these
days, we're so busy.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.980
We're not even
having your own time.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.970
And being underwater, I am
providing you a space for you

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.180
to have fun and free.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.730
AUDIENCE: She's asking
about your therapy journey

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.030
and looking back, if you would
have done anything differently.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.390
ERENA SHIMODA: I cannot think
of anything else to do because I

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.290
love water.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:30.290
After I discovered scuba diving,
I knew that was the only place

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.310
I can meditate because
I'm usually spazzy,

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.950
and I cannot stay in one spot.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.380
But underwater, all
the noise block,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.990
and you hear all
the white noise,

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.160
and you can focus on yourself.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.700
And after I found out that
space, I thought, "OK,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.800
this is it."

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.370
Then since then, I haven't
looked for anything.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.170
I do yoga.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:01.900
And yoga helps.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.512
Depends on the teacher.

00:32:03.512 --> 00:32:06.380
[LAUGHS] But yeah.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.660
I think other than that,
I haven't been looking.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.710
I'm just focused on
swimming every day.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.680
AUDIENCE: I guess in terms
of creating the photo sets,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.140
do you have an idea
of a theme beforehand?

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.730
Or does one sort of
present itself afterwards?

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.150
I guess this shot
and the previous one,

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.400
there seem to be abstract hearts
withing her shape of her there

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.290
and the fabric in
the previous slide.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:36.380
So was that on purpose
or happy accident?

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.120
LAURIE RATLIFF: Happy
accident, I think.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.450
I had not noticed that.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.110
ERENA SHIMODA: Yeah.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.690
Yeah, it looks like heart.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.340
Things are moving in
the water constantly,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.770
and it's hard to say, "Can you
do this, and can you do that?"

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.940
Especially with the fabrics,
it's moving like wavy motions.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.080
And always, I want
them to be themselves.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.150
And I don't usually
tell them what

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.520
to do because this
is a place that they

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.350
can be free and be themselves.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.720
So I asked her to just do
whatever you want to do.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.610
Just let me know.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.410
AUDIENCE: How does
a conversation

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.700
kind of go with the client
when this kind of planning

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.970
of what kind of
clothing to bring,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:28.130
or props, or lack
for a better word,

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:33.450
I guess sometimes people might
wear makeup or something.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.640
But then what if that runs
underwater or something?

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.620
You know, things like that.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.997
You know, how does
that conversation go?

00:33:41.997 --> 00:33:42.830
ERENA SHIMODA: Yeah.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:48.260
So I do have that conversation
on Skype or in person

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.140
so that we can trust each
other, because in the water,

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.640
we can't talk or communicate.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.600
So I would like
to get that trust

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.950
before and outside the water.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:05.370
And the question is usually
like the makeup and also a dress

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.740
or where they can get.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.920
And the makeup-wise,
it's really up to them.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.610
Sometimes they don't
want to wear anything.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.139
They want to go natural.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.510
And that's totally fine.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.630
It's their choice.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.870
And if they want
to wear something--

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.120
and I have the basic ones.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.010
And they're all usually from
the theatrical makeup store.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.909
There's one in San Francisco.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.659
And it's water resistant.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.199
It just don't smear your face.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.219
But other than that,
it doesn't come off.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:44.190
And I let them wear
it by themselves,

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:49.050
or I apply on their face
just like the basic ones.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.550
Or they do like
to get their own.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.219
So that's part of their process
to have fun and go shopping.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.190
And you can go get the
clothes from the thrift store.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.610
You can damage it because
it's cheaper than buying

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.590
the expensive new clothes.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.820
So I want them to have
fun for this process

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.124
and to pump up for
the photo shoot.

00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:12.540
AUDIENCE: The first
photos you had

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.920
with those motion photography,
how did you do those?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.930
Is it like an overlay
animation on top of a photo?

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:22.360
The water was all moving,
but the people were still.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.550
ERENA SHIMODA: Oh, yes.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:27.650
I used the app
called Plotograph.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.070
And you can download
it on your phone,

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.010
but I used the browser version.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:38.220
And you use your flat image
and put the effects on it.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.360
And it's pretty good for
the marketing and imagery.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.369
Yeah.

00:35:44.369 --> 00:35:44.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.340
Please join me in giving
a big round of applause

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.020
for both Erena and for Laurie.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.310
Thank you so much.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.960
[APPLAUSE]
