00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:01.633
The other day I went to this restaurant,

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:04.447
and I ran into an old friend of mine in the bathroom.

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:08.643
(gasps) Oh my god, how are you?

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:10.302
Oh, you look so pretty!

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:12.962
I don't..feel pretty.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.841
And it was like: What?

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.965
(chuckles nervously) Are you serious?

00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:19.416
You're not joking? I mean...

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:22.361
Are you, are you looking at that?

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.220
And it just made me really think

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.666
about how constantly bombarded we are

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.051
with this desire to look good.

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:29.719
I mean, it's a message

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.381
perpetuated by TV--

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:31.996
BE PRETTY!

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:32.505
Magazines...

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:33.136
BE PRETTY!

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:33.694
Billboards...

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:34.363
BE PRETTY!

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:35.665
Everywhere!

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:39.101
It's so hard to feel pretty when you look at that.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.115
It is so hard to feel good enough

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:42.800
even though you are.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.752
I think "pretty" is a mindset.

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:46.047
And I think that mindset

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:47.417
can be achieved by

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.305
putting in a little effort here and there,

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:51.124
and with a lot of self acceptance.

00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:52.382
I'm not talking about going out

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:54.465
and dressing like a bedazzled gypsy.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:55.302
(Unless you feel pretty

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:57.463
like a bedazzled gypsy, in which case, go ahead.)

00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:00.355
But, by finding little accents 
here and there

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:02.294
that make you feel like yourself,

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.570
with the volume on full blast!

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.431
Like, I've only gotten my nails done 
3 times in my life,

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:11.548
but every single time, 
the way I carry my arms

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:14.350
and my hands drastically changes.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.508
Like, anytime I hold something, my pinky's up.

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:18.621
I do a lot more like, hands to my face~

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:22.254
And it just makes me feel like 
1000 times more feminine.

00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:25.713
But above all else, most importantly,

00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:29.161
please, just let yourself feel pretty.

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:31.714
There's nothing wrong with loving your body

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:33.935
and loving the way you look.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:36.712
Because feeling beautiful is having more confidence,

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:39.907
is taking more risks, is going out and being friendlier

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:43.219
and having a better life, 
because you'll have a different attitude

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.712
and a different perspective on the world.

00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:47.278
And it starts with loving yourself first.

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:51.582
Well, there you go! 
Lesson of the week! Yeah!

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:55.019
Revelations! Okay. (laughs)

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:57.445
I'm actually really excited for this next week.

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:02.763
Um, cause I'm directing the 
first short I wrote tomorrow. Ahhhh!

00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:05.589
I always do these kind of videos in my room by myself

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:06.832
in my house. You know, there's no one else...

00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:09.435
but with the short, I have to assemble a crew

00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.216
and then I have to cast, get props, rent locations,

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:17.273
it's just...whoa! And I also forgot how 
expensive that stuff is.

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:20.776
So I talked to Audible, who so kindly decided

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.613
to sponsor today's episode.

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:25.048
You can go to audible.com/anna

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:26.462
for a free book of your choice.

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:30.545
They have over 150,000 titles to choose from.

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:32.763
And if you're like me and you live in L.A.,

00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:34.853
I always listen to Podcasts or audiobooks in the car

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:37.130
instead of listening to the same radio songs

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.049
over and over and over again.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.851
I've been listening to Joy Land, by Stephen King.

00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:43.598
Cause I love Stephen King.

00:02:43.598 --> 00:02:45.549
And everything he writes is, oh, so good.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.644
And, uh, that is audible.com/anna 
if you'd like to go there.

00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:53.433
I'll see you next week. 
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:53.933
