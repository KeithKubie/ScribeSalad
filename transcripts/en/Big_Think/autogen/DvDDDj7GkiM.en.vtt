on green energy over the last 10-15

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440
on green energy over the last 10-15
 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.470
on green energy over the last 10-15
years much faster than anyone predicted

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480
years much faster than anyone predicted
 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.320
years much faster than anyone predicted
even if biggest advocates and we need to

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330
even if biggest advocates and we need to
 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.360
even if biggest advocates and we need to
continue doing that so while there are

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370
continue doing that so while there are
 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.950
continue doing that so while there are
places in the world now many places in

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960
places in the world now many places in
 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.720
places in the world now many places in
the world where renewables are cheaper

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
the world where renewables are cheaper
 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.490
the world where renewables are cheaper
than dirty energy it's not true

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500
than dirty energy it's not true
 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.320
than dirty energy it's not true
everywhere and it's not true in the

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330
everywhere and it's not true in the
 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.700
everywhere and it's not true in the
places that need it in most parts of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710
places that need it in most parts of
 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.190
places that need it in most parts of
China India sub-saharan Africa the more

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200
China India sub-saharan Africa the more
 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.110
China India sub-saharan Africa the more
that we invest in that technology the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
that we invest in that technology the
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.870
that we invest in that technology the
more we can share that IP and allow

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880
more we can share that IP and allow
 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.320
more we can share that IP and allow
other countries in the world to develop

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330
other countries in the world to develop
 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.660
other countries in the world to develop
on much more carbon responsible paths so

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670
on much more carbon responsible paths so
 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.040
on much more carbon responsible paths so
there are great technological

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050
there are great technological
 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.500
there are great technological
opportunities for people who are focused

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510
opportunities for people who are focused
 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.270
opportunities for people who are focused
on solving the problem through

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280
on solving the problem through
 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.490
on solving the problem through
technology the problem is the most

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500
technology the problem is the most
 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.610
technology the problem is the most
powerful people who have decided are our

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
powerful people who have decided are our
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.070

technological leaders just seem not all

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080
technological leaders just seem not all
 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.960
technological leaders just seem not all
that interested in this problem and I

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970
that interested in this problem and I
 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.880
that interested in this problem and I
think we really need to change those

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890
think we really need to change those
 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.130
think we really need to change those
minds because we we need that money we

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140
minds because we we need that money we
 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.050
minds because we we need that money we
need that we need that intellectual

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060
need that we need that intellectual
 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.660
need that we need that intellectual
power we need a cultural cachet focused

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670
power we need a cultural cachet focused
 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.790
power we need a cultural cachet focused
on this problem in fact we need

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800
on this problem in fact we need
 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.620
on this problem in fact we need
everything we can get this is really an

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630
everything we can get this is really an
 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.360
everything we can get this is really an
all-hands-on-deck problem and I don't

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370
all-hands-on-deck problem and I don't
 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.560
all-hands-on-deck problem and I don't
think we'll be able to address it

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570
think we'll be able to address it
 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.750
think we'll be able to address it
without technology so we need all those

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760
without technology so we need all those
 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.120
without technology so we need all those
people

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
