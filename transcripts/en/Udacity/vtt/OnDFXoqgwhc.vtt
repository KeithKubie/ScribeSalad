We can also think of these inputs as one set, and these outputs as another set.

00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:09.214
Our relation is a rule that describes the relationship between this set of

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:13.773
inputs and this set of outputs. In this case, the relationship is the vowels

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:18.617
found in each persons name. This relation though is actually very special, it's

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:23.776
actually a function. A function is unique because the inputs always give the

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:28.905
same outputs. For example, Bob will always give us a letter o. Functions may

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:34.105
have two different inputs like Tim and Jill that both produce the same output,

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:39.177
in this case Jill and Tim both give us i. This is okay. This would not be a

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:44.484
function because we can never have two different outputs, a and o, for one

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:49.757
input, in this case, Bob. For a function, each input must correspond with

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:55.190
exactly one output. So there can only be one arrow leading from any input to an

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.820
output.
