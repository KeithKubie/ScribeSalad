00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:53.370 align:start position:0%
overcorrection like maybe they need to
 

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
overcorrection like maybe they need to
find<00:09:53.550><c> like</c><00:09:53.670><c> a</c><00:09:53.730><c> middle</c><00:09:54.089><c> ground</c><00:09:54.300><c> somewhere</c><00:09:54.720><c> I</c>
