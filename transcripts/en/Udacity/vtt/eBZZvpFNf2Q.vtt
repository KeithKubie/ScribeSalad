00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to draw a tree that's already mostly filled out.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This tree uses numbers like 5 and 3 and 1, 6 and 8 and 13,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but it follows the same principle we talked about before.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For any particular node like 5, all of the children I can reach on the left are less than 5,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and all of the children I can reach on the right--6, 8, and 13--are greater than 5.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now I want to add 7 to this tree,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and you're going to help me out by telling me where it might go.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've drawn 7 boxes with sort of dotted edges,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and these represent possible new nodes that I could add.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What I'd like you to do is check all of the boxes where I could legitimately add a node for 7

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to the sorts of trees that we've been talking about.

00:00:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all the boxes that apply.
