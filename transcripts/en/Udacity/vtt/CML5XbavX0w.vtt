00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.710
Now take a look at this set of digits and

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.660
count how many times the digit nine appears.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.340
How long did it take you to recognize the number of nines this time?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.940
Much faster, right?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.780
It's pretty incredible that such a small change, such as color,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.780
can allow us to recognize and instantly process this digit nine more quickly.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.960
I want you to take a guess at how fast pre-attentive processing just

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.490
happened for you.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.630
Now, you may not know which of these is the correct answer, which is fine.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.570
I encourage you to try each of them out and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.310
see how the real world compares to these short timespans.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.320
You'll see what I mean when the site gives you feedback.
