00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:01.649
- [Instructor] Anthony DeNoon

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.133
is analyzing his basketball statistics.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.257
The following table
shows a probability model

00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:12.048
for the results from his
next two free throws.

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:15.067
And so he has various outcomes
of those two free throws,

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:16.958
and then the corresponding probability.

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.933
Missing both free throws, 0.2.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.417
Making exactly one free throw, 0.5.

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.765
And making both free throws, 0.1.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:29.598
Is this a valid probability model?

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:34.241
Pause this video and see if you
can make a conclusion there.

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:38.150
So let's think about what makes
a valid probability model.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.599
One, the sum of the probabilities

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:44.725
of all the scenarios
need to add up to 100%.

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:47.808
So we would definitely want to check that.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.355
And also, they would all
have to be positive values

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:54.675
or I guess I should say none
of them can be negative values.

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:58.608
You could have a scenario
that has a 0% probability.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:02.267
And so all of these look
like positive probabilities,

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:04.192
so we meet that second test

00:01:04.192 --> 00:01:07.732
that all the probabilities
are non-negative,

00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:10.700
but do they add up to 100%?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.450
So if I add .2 to .5, that is .7,

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.904
plus .1, they add up to 0.8

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:19.949
or they add up to 80%.

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.700
So this is not a valid probability model.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.183
In order for it to be valid,

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.458
they would all, all the various scenarios

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:29.207
need to add up exactly to 100%.

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:32.262
In this case, we only add up to 80%.

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:35.013
If we add it up to 1.1 or 110%,

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:37.083
then we would also have a problem.

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:39.540
We can just write no.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.623
Let's do another example.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.633
So here we are told you are a space alien.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:52.137
You visit planet Earth
and abduct 97 chickens,

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:54.054
47 cows, and 77 humans.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:58.483
Then you randomly select
one Earth creature

00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:00.732
from your sample to experiment on.

00:02:00.732 --> 00:02:05.458
Each creature has an equal
probability of getting selected.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.304
Create a probability model to show

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:10.800
how likely you are to select
each type of Earth creature.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.350
Input your answers as fractions

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.900
or as decimals rounded
to the nearest hundredth.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.224
So in the last example, we wanted to see

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:22.605
whether the probability model
was valid, was legitimate.

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:26.671
Here, we wanna construct a
legitimate probability model.

00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.166
Well, how would we do that?

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.891
Well, the estimated probability
of getting a chicken

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.491
is gonna be the fraction
that you're sampling from

00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:36.657
that is our chickens because
any one of the animals

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.901
are equally likely to be selected.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.309
97

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.142
of the 97

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:43.235
plus 47

00:02:44.108 --> 00:02:47.066
plus 77 animals are chickens.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.058
And so what is this going to be?

00:02:48.058 --> 00:02:50.141
This is gonna be 97 over.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.070
97,

00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:54.108
47, and 77,

00:02:55.282 --> 00:02:56.454
you add 'em up.

00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:58.776
Three sevens is a 21.

00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:01.016
And then let's see, two plus nine is 11,

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:02.341
plus four is 15,

00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:03.758
plus seven is 22,

00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:05.957
so 221.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:10.250
So 97 of the 221 animals are chickens.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.116
And so I'll just write 97, 221s.

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:17.508
They say that we can answer as fractions,

00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:19.316
so I'm just gonna go that way.

00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:20.625
What about cows?

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.074
Well, 47

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:24.000
of the 221 are cows,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.833
so there's a 47, 221st probability

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.182
of getting a cow.

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:31.651
And then last but not least,

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.484
you have 77 of the 221s are human.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.333
Is this a legitimate
probability distribution?

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:40.216
We'll add these up.

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:42.424
If you add these three fractions up,

00:03:42.424 --> 00:03:44.349
the denominator's gonna be 221

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.857
and we already know that
97 plus 47 plus 77 is 221.

00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:50.707
So it definitely adds up to one,

00:03:50.707 --> 00:03:53.057
and none of these are negative,

00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:57.140
so this is a legitimate
probability distribution.
