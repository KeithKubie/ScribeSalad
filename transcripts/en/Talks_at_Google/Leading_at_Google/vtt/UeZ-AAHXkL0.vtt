00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.410
&gt;&gt;Michael is the president and co-founder
of E Pluribus Partners, which

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.960
is a leadership training and coaching firm
that specializes in helping

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.940
leaders create what Michael describes as connection
cultures.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.440
Connection cultures increase employee and
customer engagement as well

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.380
as profitability and innovation.
Michael has an established history as an executive

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.430
in business
development, marketing, and investment banking.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.020
He has held positions in top companies ranging
from Morgan Stanley to

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.940
Charles Schwab to Texas Instruments.
Today Michael will be sharing his ideas from

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.649
his best-selling book,
"Fired Up or Burned Out."

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.859
In which he addresses how to reignite your
team's passion, creativity,

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.300
and productivity.
And hopefully he'll also be able to share

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.719
some ideas about what he's
learned about Google culture today.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.969
Please join me in welcoming Michael Lee Stallard.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.370
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Alana, thank you.
Let me ask all of you.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.159
How many of you have experienced times over
your career when you were

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.282
energized?
You were -- you wanted to get to work in the

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:05.269
morning, and when you got
there, the hours flew by.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.820
And by the end of the day you didn't want
to stop working.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.750
How many of you have experienced that?
Okay.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.930
Just about everyone.
How about the opposite?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.510
Where you struggle to get to work in the morning,
and the hours pass

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.290
slowly and by the end of the day you were
physically and emotionally

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.860
spent?
Anybody experience that?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.580
Once again, just about everyone.
What's the difference between the two environments

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.840
that produce that
effect?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.200
That's what we're going to talk about today.
Okay.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.510
What is the work environment that really energizes
people?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.080
Because the work environment that I think
we all know from our

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.830
experience that when we're in that environment,
we're just more

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.180
productive and creative and research supports
that too.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.460
Now I first became interested that in this
whole area of the work

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.490
environment and its effect on productivity
and innovation, when I was

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.610
Chief Marketing Officer for Morgan Stanley's
Global Wealth Management

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.320
Group.
I wanted to, first of all, create an environment

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.180
where the people I was
responsible for leading were thrive.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.480
And secondly, I wanted to create an environment
where the people who

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.590
worked on the front lines of the business
where they would be more

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.670
energetic and enthusiastic because I knew
if they were, it would result

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.200
in a superior customer experience.
The practices we put in place helped us double

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.420
our revenues over two
and a half years.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.950
And I knew we were onto something special.
In 2002, I left Wall Street and founded E

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.510
Pluribus Partners.
Now that's a very unusual name.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.190
A lot of people have a hard time pronouncing
it.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.140
And they ask me, you know, what's that about?
It's actually based on America's motto which

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.980
is e pluribus unum.
A Latin phrase that means out of many, one.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.741
Now I became very interested in this whole
area of the work environment

00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:52.870
because I came across some research that showed
over the last decade,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.500
75 percent of American workers report that
they're not engaged in their

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.959
jobs.
That's over a hundred million people who are

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.770
not achieving anywhere
near their potential.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.040
And of that group, about 15 to 20 percent
of them are what we describe

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.790
as actively disengaged.
So that they're working against the interest

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.440
of the organization.
Now that's a problem.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.610
I believe in the years and decades ahead,
it's going to become a much,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.550
much bigger problem for organizations.
Tom Friedman wrote the book, "The World is

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.170
Flat."
Just -- the world is becoming we know from

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.239
our experience in the
workplace, the world is becoming a more competitive

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.620
place with
globalization.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.120
The standards are going up all the time.
What do is you think is going to happen to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.239
organizations that
75 percent of their workers not fully engaged

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.940
in their work?
Not good.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.709
It's going to be difficult for many of them
to survive.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.410
Now when I founded E Pluribus, I met a number
of individuals who became

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.780
my business partners.
One was Jason Pankau.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.239
Jason is an executive and life coach to many
successful Americans.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.489
He's an expert on how the workplace environment
spills over to affect

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.069
people's lives outside of work.
A really interesting perspective, Jason has.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.049
Carolyn Dewing-Hommes is part our team.
She had worked at Citigroup and studied corporate

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.120
cultures of some of
the leading organizations in the world and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.050
brought some great insights
to our research.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.970
Dr. Mitchell Dickey, who had taught psychology
at Yale and Purdue

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.370
Universities.
He received the first research award given

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.250
on emotional intelligence
research by the American Psychology Association.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.830
In our research, we looked at all the avenues.
We looked at businesses, governmental organizations,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.320
social sector
organizations like hospitals and universities.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.530
We even looked at sports teams to understand
why they thrive, merely

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.990
bump along and survive, or even die.
And as we laid out all the variables we -- time

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.770
and again, we noticed
one factor that seemed to predict the rise

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.640
and fall of organizations.
And we named that factor the force of connection.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:16.080
Now connection is -- it's like gravity.
In the absence of gravity, objects do what?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.090
Anyone?
They?

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.240
Float, they drift apart.
In the absence of this force of connection

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.760
people drift apart.
But with connection they pull together.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.040
They're more trusting.
They're more cooperative.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.010
They're more aligned with each other and with
the organization's goals.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.070
Now, connection has three distinct core elements
we found as part of

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.889
our research.
The first one is vision.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.010
Now vision exists when everyone in the organization
is motivated by the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.850
mission, united by the values, and proud of
the reputation.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.220
And we're going to talk about Google in a
minute.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.190
In fact, what I want you to do is you have
a handout that has the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.500
definitions that has some blanks in it.
I want to you fill in the blanks because you're

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.490
going to use it in a
little exercise.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.690
We are going to make this very specific to
Google in a few minutes.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.800
But I want to take you through the elements
first and then we'll talk

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.690
about how they apply.
So if you'll look at the sheet, fill in the

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.271
blanks as I go through the
definitions.

00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:25.290
One of my favorite examples of the element
of vision came during World

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.110
War II when America was far behind Nazi Germany
in terms of military

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.960
strength.
And General George Marshall, who was head

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.650
of the American Army, he was
focused on organizing the tasks of the military

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.889
industrial complex
during that period.

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.040
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt recognized
that something more was

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.040
required.
So he organized visits to the plants that

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.500
were producing tanks and
planes around America.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.639
And on one occasion, he went to the Boeing
aircraft company up in

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.690
Seattle.
And he brought with him a young pilot named

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.800
Hewitt Wheless.
Hewitt was from Texas.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.680
And he asked Hewitt to tell his story to the
18,000 aircraft workers

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.520
who were in attendance.
So Hewitt got up, he explained that he was

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.539
flying his plane, and he was
surrounded by enemy aircraft who fired on

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.750
him.
His plane was riddled with bullets, but miraculously,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.700
it held together
until he was able to safely return to his

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.060
base.
He thanked the workers at that plant for building

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.330
the plane that saved
his life.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.669
Now, seeing that pilot thank them for their
work had a profound effect

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:43.800
on the workers at Boeing.
It, in a sense, transformed them from factory

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.330
workers into freedom
fighters from an identity standpoint.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.490
Over the next four years from 1941 until 1945,
American aircraft

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.930
manufacturers outproduced the Nazis by a rate
of 3 to 1.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.960
They produced nearly 300,000 aircraft during
that period.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.210
Now when you think about this element, vision,
and how it applies to

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:14.030
Google, one thing that comes to mind is the,
the corporate motto "Don't

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.770
be Evil."
Let me ask you.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.530
Does that connect with the a lot of people
here?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.889
I know when I first read that, I thought,
wow, that's really powerful.

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:25.620
Does that connect with some of you? A few?
Now, you know, items of connection are not

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.620
going to connect with
everyone.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.310
It's really going to depend on your personality
and your unique

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.870
circumstances.
But that's one that really connected with

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:38.110
me was don't be evil.
The next element of a connection culture is

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.830
value.
And value exists when everyone in the organization

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.810
understand the needs
of people, appreciates their positive, unique

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.430
contributions, and helps
them achieve their potential.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.610
Now that's rare in cultures today.
I think Google has one of the best cultures

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.670
I've seen.
And we're going, as I said, we're going to

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.980
talk about that in a minute.
A story that really illustrates this is -- happens

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.209
to be a story about
my favorite rock band.

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:09.270
Now this band has been together for more than
30 years.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.420
They've now received more Grammy awards than
any band in history.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.060
Any ideas who I'm talking about?
Any guesses?

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.350
U2.
Yeah, you got it.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.890
Now U2's motto is "Everybody Gets Out of This
Alive."

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.310
It's a very funny motto, isn't it?
If you know their story, it makes more sense.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.529
Bono, the lead singer -- when Bono was 14-years
old, his mother passed

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:41.130
away.
And he describes that period as feeling abandoned

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.950
and alone .
His father was so grief-stricken that he wasn't

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.600
able to comfort his
son.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.170
So having experienced that, a few years later
when Larry Mullen, Jr,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.360
the drummer for U2, when his mother passed
away when Larry was 16, Bono

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.580
reached out to comfort him as a friend.
And said, "I know what you're going through.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.070
I'm going to be there for you."
And it started this friendship that's lasted

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.880
until today.
Edge, the lead guitar player for U2, he went

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.940
through a difficult period
in terms of just experiencing divorce.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.160
And the band members were there for him to
help him get through that.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.350
Adam Clayton, the bass player for U2, he suffered
through a five-year

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.890
period with a drug and alcohol addiction.
And the band members actually reached out

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.510
to him to help him recover
from that.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.750
I think one of the most dramatic examples
of the commitment that the

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:44.060
members of U2 have to one another came in
the 1980s when the band was

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.019
campaigning for the observance of a Martin
Luther King, Jr, day in

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:52.570
America.
And they were about to play a concert.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.350
They received -- Bono received a death threat
that said if you play the

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.660
song "Pride" or "In the Name of Love," which
is about the Reverend

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.820
Martin Luther King, Jr, that you'll die.
The FBI thought that this was not a hoax.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.110
That it was a legitimate death threat.
But they weren't going to back down.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:18.570
They played the song.
And Bono closed his eyes as he sang the song.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.380
At the end of one verse, when he opened his
eyes, he found to his

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.589
surprise Adam Clayton was literally standing
in front of him to shield

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:38.410
him from potential harm.
Bono has said that U2 is a great example of

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:45.050
how to rely on others.
He said that he is a lousy guitar player and

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.220
an even lousier piano
player.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.950
He hears melodies in his head but without
his band mates, his talented

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.440
band mates, he's not able to bring that music
to life.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:03.360
And so he appreciates their unique contributions.
It surprises many people to find out that

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.660
the economic profits from U2
are equally split five ways between the four

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:14.980
band members and their
longtime manager, Paul McGuinness.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:20.710
These elements, these aspects of U2's -- the
relationships among the U2

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.339
members -- create connection between them.
And that's helped them stay together for 30

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:28.480
years so that they could
perfect their music over that time period.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:39.120
I think of Google's culture.
And what elements in Google's culture represent

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.579
value?
I think one that I learned about was that

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:48.209
the average Googler goes
through about 120 hours of training a year.

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:51.920
That's a lot of training compared to what
the employee in the average

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.670
organization goes through.
So that is just one of many elements that

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.339
show that Google values
Googlers.

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:06.279
The next element in a connection culture is
voice.

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:11.050
And voice exists when everyone seeks the ideas
of others, when they

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:17.720
share their ideas and opinions honestly, and
they safeguard relational

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.209
connections.
One of my favorite stories that illustrates

00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:27.800
the element of the value in
a connection culture comes from the Proctor

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.829
 &amp; Gamble company.
In the year 2000, P&amp;G was really struggling.

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:37.930
In one quarter, they lost $300 million dollars.
They -- half their brands were losing market

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.860
share and talented brand
managers were walking out the door.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.540
Finally, the board at P&amp;G became frustrated
with the CEO. They made a

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.120
change and they appointed a career employee
by the name of A. G.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.070
Lafley.
And Lafley has confidence in the people of

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.370
P&amp;G.
He worked there.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:14:01.300
He knew people all around the organization.
The first thing he did was he surveyed P&amp;G

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.620
employees to find out what
they thought he should do to improve the organization.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.980
Then he went and he travelled all around the
world and met with groups

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.790
of employees.
And when he did, he said, we have moose in

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.970
our closets here at P&amp;G.
We have issues that we haven't been confronting.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.470
We need to get the moose out of the closet
where it's stinking up the

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.839
place and into the light of day on the conference
room table where we

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:29.399
can deal with these issues.
And because I know the employees at P&amp;G, there's

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:32.820
no -- if we put our
heads together, there's no problem we can't

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.760
solve.
No code we can't crack.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.360
And that's exactly what happened.
They rolled up their sleeves and they started

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.041
improving the company day
after day after day.

00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:48.680
Flash forward about 12 months, and according
to an internal survey that

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.829
P&amp;G did, employee confidence in the leadership
and direction of the

00:14:54.829 --> 00:15:02.769
organization soared 250 percent.
In 24 months, P&amp;G's revenues and profitability

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:05.890
soared.
Their stock price went up 75 percent.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.700
It created so much wealth that they were able
to acquire the Gillette

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:18.240
Corporation, which was a huge acquisition.
Now think about that element of voice and

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.279
how it applies to Google.
One of the first things that comes to mind

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:26.530
is the TGIF's you have.
And how that brings the element of voice into

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.160
your culture that helps
connect Google and Googlers.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:37.199
Okay?
Now we're going to get to our exercise in

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:39.550
just a minute.
But one more point I wanted to make before

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:44.300
we get to the exercise is
that when these three elements are present

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.820
vision, value, and voice, it
moves employees to want to give their best

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.820
efforts.
And to align their behavior with organizational

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.370
goals.
But it does more than that.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:05.519
When organizations are filled with disconnection,
it builds knowledge

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:08.211
traps in the organization.
Let me just give you some examples of knowledge

00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:13.470
traps.
When, say, one regional sales group has a

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.800
lead that -- but it's in
another territory -- but it doesn't provide

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.570
that lead to the other
territory because it views that territory

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.970
as competing with them,
that's a knowledge trap.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.740
They have information that could help the
other group but they don't

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.621
share it because of this, in a sense, break
down in the relationship

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:32.640
between the two.
When one employee, maybe an engineer has a

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.290
project and they have some
information that could help another engineer,

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:41.970
but the engineer with the
information doesn't share it with his or her

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.360
colleague because they
view that person as a rival, that's a knowledge

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:53.899
trap.
When the engineers at NASA felt it was unsafe

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:59.019
to express their concerns
with management that they had before the Challenger

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:03.829
launch decision,
that was a knowledge trap that led to disaster.

00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:08.079
And when organizations are filled with these
knowledge traps because of

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:12.999
break downs in relationships, where people
withhold information,

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:19.789
disaster is always what happens.
Knowledge traps are like -- there're like

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:27.449
cholesterol in organizations.
They build up with bad cultures.

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:31.970
And they lead to poor decision making.
And they kill innovation.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:39.759
The -- the statin drug that breaks knowledge
traps is connection.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.910
And connection restores the knowledge flow
that's necessary for

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:48.590
organizations to thrive.
And that happens in two distinct ways.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:53.639
Number one, when knowledge flow is high, decision
makers, which is all

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:57.619
of you at different times, we're all making
decisions.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:00.619
When knowledge flow is high, decision makers
have the information they

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:04.600
need to make optimal decisions.
When knowledge traps are in place, they don't.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.600
So they make suboptimal decisions.
Secondly, when knowledge traps are in place,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.979
it reduces the marketplace
of ideas inside an organization that feeds

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:24.690
innovation.
So four benefits we're talking here that really

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.249
come out of connection.
Number one, people give their best efforts.

00:18:28.249 --> 00:18:31.479
They align their behavior with organizational
goals.

00:18:31.479 --> 00:18:34.609
Decision makers make better information because
of knowledge -- they

00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:36.909
make better decisions because of knowledge
flow.

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:43.070
And fourth, the marketplace of ideas that's
fed by a high degree of

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.259
knowledge flow fuels innovation.
Those are four benefits.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.289
Now what I would like to do this is just a
brief introduction but I

00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:53.119
want you thinking about how this applies to
Google.

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:56.239
So what I would like to do first of all is
get into groups of three.

00:18:56.239 --> 00:18:59.100
Okay?
Can you do that right now, just break up into

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:05.090
groups of three?
And bring your sheets.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:23.380
[PAUSE]
Now what I would like you to do is identify

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.979
ways from your experience
that Google connects with Googlers.

00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:31.499
Okay?
You can list them on the sheet.

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:36.019
And now this can be, these ways, they can
reflect corporate-wide

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:41.440
practices like TGIF's, or they can, they can
reflect a specific

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.979
practice that you've seen in your workgroup
or another workgroup.

00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:48.799
Okay?
And then I'm going to give you about seven

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:51.080
minutes to come up with as
many as you can.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.419
And I have something I'm going to give -- I
want to see which group

00:19:54.419 --> 00:19:57.269
comes up with the most, and then I have a
little prize for that group.

00:19:57.269 --> 00:20:00.519
And then I want to go through some of those
and just talk about how

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:02.229
these apply at Google.
Okay?

00:20:02.229 --> 00:20:05.789
Any questions about that?
Okay.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:06.789
Great.
Go.

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:10.989
[PAUSE]
Okay.

00:20:10.989 --> 00:20:20.150
Count how many you have.
Let me ask, does anybody have -- who was more

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.109
than ten?
More than ten?

00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:25.769
Okay.
More than 15?

00:20:25.769 --> 00:20:30.129
Okay.
More than 20?

00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:34.919
Okay, wow.
More than -- oh, that's a bigger group than

00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:38.000
three.
More than 25?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.519
Whoa, okay.
More than 30?

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:47.269
I came up with 30 myself when I did some research.
More than 30?

00:20:47.269 --> 00:20:49.799
Okay.
How many do you guys have?

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:52.909
26.
How many did you have?

00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:54.849
25.
Oh, yeah. That's true.

00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:58.450
Okay.
Well you have to -- I have books for all of

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.269
you since you're so close
and there's a little bit of a disadvantage

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:03.539
here.
So just send me your business card and we'll

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:07.269
get books to you.
I also have a gift for all of you that I'll

00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:09.999
tell you about later.
Okay.

00:21:09.999 --> 00:21:13.229
Let me, you know what?
Let me take a look at your list.

00:21:13.229 --> 00:21:17.080
Let's just talk briefly about -- I'll ask
you questions, the ones I

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080
don't understand.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.041
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Yes.
Okay, would you?

00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:23.389
Well, keep going.
You can e-mail them to me.

00:21:23.389 --> 00:21:28.240
I see you have off-sites, corporate and team
off-sites.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.309
What are OKRs?

00:21:30.309 --> 00:21:31.850
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.159
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Okay.

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:42.169
&gt;&gt;-- every quarter as a company we define
what the corporate goals are.

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:45.419
And there's a big meeting where everybody
talks about that. And then

00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:47.960
at the end of the quarter, there's a second
meeting where we talk about

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.340
what the goals were and how we met them.
So it's kind of two separate things.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.279
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:21:55.279 --> 00:22:01.450
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Okay.
Thank you.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.859
And, oh, I did read about EMG's.
Tell us about EMG.

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.090
[PAUSE]

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:15.460
&gt;&gt;Well, I guess Google recognizes key contributions
from individuals

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.919
and teams.
And so the they'll recognize -- I don't know

00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:20.929
if it's quarterly it
really depends.

00:22:20.929 --> 00:22:26.220
Sometimes it's like quarterly or sometimes
there's like a huge, huge

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.549
product launch or something that occurs.

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:34.529
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Well, let's see what
you had on your list over

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:37.019
here.
Can I take a look?

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:40.919
Thank you.
Let's see if I recognize.

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:42.070
What's, what's VP hour?

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.850
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:48.080
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Okay.
That simple.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.109
Very descriptive.
And okay, 20 percent time.

00:22:51.109 --> 00:22:56.859
I know about that.
And you have VL rooms or VC rooms ?

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:58.559
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:02.410
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Okay and how is that?

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.410
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.749
MICHAEL LEE STALLARD: Okay, okay.
Right.

00:23:05.749 --> 00:23:10.039
Technically connects them so they can see
each other face to face and

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:11.239
okay.
Great.

00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:15.059
Well, a lot of ideas here.
I may be e-mailing you and following up on

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:18.830
these for an article I'm
writing in the next few days for a journal

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.950
in the UK.
So thank you for doing research for me.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:34.409
I appreciate that.
Today, most leaders focus on task excellence.

00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:39.179
And that's good with things like, you know,
programs such as Six Sigma,

00:23:39.179 --> 00:23:47.929
and Lean Manufacturing, and Competitive Benchmarking.
The performance of our organizations has risen.

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:52.940
But the problem is if individuals and leaders
in organizations focus on

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:58.419
task excellence alone, the absence of relationship
excellence will

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:04.599
ultimately sabotage task excellence.
What happens every time in organizations -- and

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:09.320
this is a pattern that
repeats itself throughout history -- is that

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.129
when an individuals and
leaders focus on task excellence alone, people

00:24:15.129 --> 00:24:18.660
who have power and
influence in the organization, they feel connected.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:25.320
But 70 to 80 percent in the organization,
don't.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.090
And gradually, over time, because they don't
feel connected, they stop

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.570
caring.
They stop giving their best efforts.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.639
They feel like outsiders to some degree.
They stop giving their best efforts.

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:41.570
They stop aligning their behavior with organizational
goals.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.029
And it has an affect on the performance of
the organization.

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:47.649
It starts to spiral down.
They don't fully communicate so the decision

00:24:47.649 --> 00:24:51.549
makers don't get the
information they need to make optimal decisions

00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:53.940
and performance spirals
down.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.669
But the opposite is true, too.
When a leader is intentional, when organizations

00:24:57.669 --> 00:25:02.369
are intentional about
focussing on task excellence and relationship

00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:05.479
excellence, the
performance of the organization spirals up

00:25:05.479 --> 00:25:11.559
and can continue, they can
continue to achieve sustainable superior performance.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:15.049
Let me give you an example from the sports
world.

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:19.629
In 1984, the Chicago Bulls drafted Michael
Jordan, the basketball

00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:23.139
superstar.
In his first month in the NBA, Michael was

00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:25.469
on the cover of Sports
Illustrated magazine.

00:25:25.469 --> 00:25:30.259
The headline read, "A Star is Born: Michael
Jordan lights up the NBA."

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:33.629
And he was lighting up the NBA.
He was scoring 30, 40 points a game, later

00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:38.340
in the season 50, even
60 points at times.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.700
The Bulls, the expectations were very high
for the Bulls.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.279
Because they had arguably the greatest player,
the greatest basketball

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.059
player in history.
But as the years progressed, the Bulls failed

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:52.609
to live up to
management's expectations.

00:25:52.609 --> 00:25:56.519
And the fans' expectations.
They improved during that period.

00:25:56.519 --> 00:26:00.029
Their coach was Doug Collins, and Collins
is a great coach.

00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:04.229
He was very focused on developing new plays
and focussing on excellence

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:09.340
in execution.
And they improved, but it just wasn't enough.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.710
After five years, Bulls management decided
to make a change.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:18.399
And they replaced the head coach with Phil
Jackson, who was an

00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:23.879
assistant coach on the Bulls at that time.
The genius of Phil Jackson was he could see

00:26:23.879 --> 00:26:29.629
that something more was
required than focussing on tasks, on new plays

00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:32.440
and execution.
He sat down with Michael Jordan.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.840
He said, you know, Michael, we're never going
to be the NBA champions

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.940
that you and I long to be unless you surrender
the me for the we.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.690
Michael, when we're traveling on the road,
you spend more time with

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:53.549
your entourage than you do with the your teammates.
You call your teammates your supporting cast.

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:58.109
And that's how they feel.
They feel like nobodies.

00:26:58.109 --> 00:27:02.820
He's -- Jackson told Jordan that -- think
of the ball as a spotlight.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.831
When a player has the ball, they're in the
spotlight.

00:27:05.831 --> 00:27:09.899
And everybody needs the spotlight from time
to time on them, if they're

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:16.249
going to perform at the top of their game.
And Michael Jordan listened to what Phil Jackson

00:27:16.249 --> 00:27:19.859
had to say.
And what I love about Michael is he, right

00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:23.009
away, started to change.
He came to practice early.

00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:26.469
And started working with his teammates to
help them improve their

00:27:26.469 --> 00:27:30.730
basketball skills.
To help them improve, to become stronger in

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.279
terms of strength training
and endurance.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:36.330
He began spending time with them off the court
and getting to know

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.609
them.
He started trusting them on the court.

00:27:39.609 --> 00:27:42.480
He started sharing the ball with them.
It used to be, at the end of the game when

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.419
the score was close,
everybody knew who was going to take the final

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:48.169
shot.
And the opposing teams always tripled-teamed

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:49.639
Michael and shut down the
Bulls.

00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:54.549
But after Michael connected with his teammates,
their performance

00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:57.460
improved.
And Michael started sharing the ball so that

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.981
his teammates were taking
those final shots oftentimes at the end the

00:28:00.981 --> 00:28:05.609
of the game.
Over the next eight years, the Bulls won an

00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:10.580
astounding six NBA
championships.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.110
When Michael, as a leader on the team, began
to connect with his

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:20.830
teammates, it boosted their performance.
Phil Jackson could see that he had to focus

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.269
on both task excellence.
He didn't take his eye off that.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:28.029
He knew that was critical too.
But also there was a problem with the relationships

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:31.659
on the team that
was affecting the rest of the team's performance.

00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:34.789
So when he created, helped create a connection
culture -- when he and

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:38.509
Michael together created that connection culture
so that everybody felt

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:42.759
connected to the team, a part of the team,
that's when the Bulls became

00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:50.419
a basketball dynasty.
Makes sense?

00:28:50.419 --> 00:28:53.289
In our research that we did, we not only looked
at organizations, we

00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:59.089
looked at other fields of knowledge and were
just amazed at all the

00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:02.940
research that supports the importance of connection
in life to our

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.739
performance in life and in work.
Let me just share some of that with you.

00:29:08.739 --> 00:29:12.629
In -- in organizational behavior, research
we discovered that the

00:29:12.629 --> 00:29:15.659
Corporate Executive Board, which is a for-profit
think tank in

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:21.469
Washington, D.C., studied 50,000 individuals
in 2004 worldwide.

00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:25.710
And they concluded that individuals who felt
engaged and connected were

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.389
20 percent more productive than the average
employee.

00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:35.229
That's like an extra day of work a week.
Just think of the compounded effect of that

00:29:35.229 --> 00:29:37.159
over someone's entire
career.

00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:41.330
It's huge.
And multiply that by all the employees in

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:46.729
an organization.
The other finding that the Corporate Executive

00:29:46.729 --> 00:29:51.210
Board discovered was
that emotional factors were four times as

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.809
important as rational factors
when it came to the amount of effort that

00:29:55.809 --> 00:30:00.979
people put in their job.
Now emotional factors are how people feel

00:30:00.979 --> 00:30:03.179
about their day-to-day work
tasks.

00:30:03.179 --> 00:30:09.950
How they feel about their -- the people they
work with, and how they

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:18.139
feel about their organization.
In other words, the elements of connection.

00:30:18.139 --> 00:30:22.729
From -- we start to understand how powerful
this force of connection is

00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:27.559
when we delve into the field of psychology.
And we learn that psychologists have identified

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:32.320
there's six universal
human needs to thrive.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.729
The first three are respect, recognition,
and belonging.

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:39.719
They're relational needs.
And when -- and in our research, what we discovered

00:30:39.719 --> 00:30:43.349
is that when these
needs are being met people inevitably described

00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:47.719
that they clicked or
they connected with the people they worked

00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:52.909
with.
The next two needs are task mastery needs.

00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:57.480
They are autonomy and personal growth.
And when people experience, when these needs

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.159
are being met, people
describe it was feeling connected or immersed

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:06.200
in their day-to-day work.
They're so immersed that the hours fly by.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.289
It's like they've entered into a time warp.
How many of you have experienced that from

00:31:10.289 --> 00:31:14.019
time to time?
Yeah, I think most of us have.

00:31:14.019 --> 00:31:19.209
The final need is for meaning.
And when people are working on something that's

00:31:19.209 --> 00:31:24.249
important to them,
that's connected to the organization's work,

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:28.849
they describe it as
feeling connected to the organization.

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:33.879
So we kept hearing that name, connection.
I feel like I connect with my work on a day-to-day

00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:35.469
basis.
I connect with the people I work with.

00:31:35.469 --> 00:31:40.809
I connect with my organization.
And that's when we came up with the idea that

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:44.370
leaders need to develop
these connection cultures where the needs

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.359
are being met so that people
will thrive.

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:51.700
Then we discovered in neuroscience that these
feelings of connection

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.559
when they exist it boosts hormones in our
bloodstream that make us feel

00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:59.889
more energetic, more confident, and more trusting
of the people around

00:31:59.889 --> 00:32:03.789
us.
And they also reduced the stress hormones

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:09.459
in our bloodstream. So that
we are more likely to remain rational than

00:32:09.459 --> 00:32:14.999
rash when we're in an
environment that's stressful.

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:22.409
From the field of psychiatry, we learn that
psychiatrists see a

00:32:22.409 --> 00:32:25.940
continuous flow of people mostly coming out
of the business community,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.709
and these patients express that they feel
 --

00:32:29.709 --> 00:32:35.299
They're experiencing feelings of emptiness
and boredom in life and

00:32:35.299 --> 00:32:42.190
they're not sure why.
And to treat these feelings, they may become

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:46.409
involved in substance
abuse or they may seek the thrill from taking

00:32:46.409 --> 00:32:52.539
excessive risks, maybe
business risks or sexual risks .

00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:57.669
And to treat these patients, psychiatrists
help them bring more human

00:32:57.669 --> 00:33:03.989
connection into their life.
In fact, Dr. Edward Hallowell, who's a famous

00:33:03.989 --> 00:33:07.489
psychiatrist and former
instructor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical

00:33:07.489 --> 00:33:11.249
School.
He describes this treatment as vitamin C.

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:21.239
And vitamin C stands for vitamin connection.
Even political sociologists today have -- they

00:33:21.239 --> 00:33:25.539
believe that nations
that have a higher degree of connection, those

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:27.369
nations are more
economically productive.

00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:30.879
And that would make sense, wouldn't it?
Given what we've see in these other fields

00:33:30.879 --> 00:33:33.440
of knowledge.
And I'm just covering the tip of the iceberg.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.289
In the book, we go much deeper.
But you get the picture.

00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:41.820
When I was immersed in all this research,
I had a personal experience

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:47.619
that really helped clarify it for me.
In 2004, my wife Katie was diagnosed with

00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:52.469
advanced ovarian cancer.
And that was a year after she had been treated

00:33:52.469 --> 00:33:56.370
for breast cancer.
Now I'm delighted and relieved to say that

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:01.169
Katie is cancer-free and
thriving today.

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:06.740
In 2004, we experienced an outpouring of support
and encouragement from

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:15.539
our family, our friends, and health care workers.
I'll never forget our first trip to -- our

00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:18.251
first visit to Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York

00:34:18.251 --> 00:34:19.830
City.
Let me describe this.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:24.210
We were walking down the sidewalk and a big
doorman by the name of

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:28.750
Nick, when we got within eyesight of the place,
he locked his eyes on

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.179
Katie and greeted her like a returning friend.
And I thought how wonderful.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.480
This guy is -- he recognizes cancer patients,
probably because he's a

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.839
good wig spotter.
And he's intentionally connecting with them.

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:46.639
And then we entered into the reception area,
and the receptionist is

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:54.389
calling everyone honey.
Then the security people we met, the administrative

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:58.500
people we met were
outgoing and friendly.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.839
We spent an hour with our oncologist and she
educated us about the

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:05.130
various treatment options that we had to choose
among.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:11.720
And she answered our long list of questions.
She was upbeat and optimistic.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.070
And by the end of the day, I just felt like
I connected with these

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:19.539
people.
And it made me more optimistic that we could

00:35:19.539 --> 00:35:23.799
get Katie through this
difficult season that was ahead.

00:35:23.799 --> 00:35:31.210
And we did.
As I thought about that experience, there

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:37.970
was a real aha for me.
I realized that connection is especially critical

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.890
in the difficult
seasons we face in life.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:46.230
As individuals, and as organizations.
And a lot of people today are experiencing

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.200
difficult seasons.
Both in their individual lives, and organizations

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.510
are facing difficult
seasons.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.339
When people are connected, they tend to pull
together through

00:35:56.339 --> 00:36:01.619
adversity.
When they're not connected, the environment

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:05.079
tends to become -- people
become isolated.

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:09.650
They retreat.
They become more fearful.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.779
And finger pointing and distrust tends to
rule in organizations.

00:36:13.779 --> 00:36:18.150
And it makes it difficult to thrive and push
through adversity.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:26.710
[PAUSE]
Makes sense?

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.440
Let me just pause here a second.
Any questions?

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:36.220
[PAUSE]
Now the bottom line on the research is that

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:41.269
connection makes us better
in our personal lives and in our lives at

00:36:41.269 --> 00:36:43.230
work.
And it affects us all of our lives.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.260
It's something we go into a little bit deeper
in the work.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.809
Now what I'd like to do is another quick little
exercise before I wrap

00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:55.559
it up and open it up for questions.
What I'd like you to do is first of all stand

00:36:55.559 --> 00:36:58.130
up, everybody stand up.
[PAUSE]

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:02.599
Okay, find somebody in the room you don't
know.

00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:07.619
Introduce yourself, and ask a question that's
unrelated to work.

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:10.930
Okay, then reciprocate, and go back to your
seat.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.220
Okay.
Just a couple minutes to do this, so go.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:33.390
Thanks.
[PAUSE]

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.390
Okay, great.
Thank you.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:40.519
You guys had no trouble connecting.
It's nice to come to basically a session that's

00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:43.619
on connection and go
away with at least one new connection.

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:51.539
So here are some things that research has
shown us will help increase

00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:55.440
connection in a workplace.
The first is role in the whole.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.460
When people understand the answers to four
questions, they feel more

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.140
connected to the organization.
The questions are:

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.980
Where are we going?
Why is it important?

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.849
How do we -- how are we going to get there?
And what's my role?

00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:14.869
So the more you can understand that for yourself
and help the people

00:38:14.869 --> 00:38:19.460
around you understand that, the more your
team is going to feel

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.500
connected.
So how can you do that if you're not supervising

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.630
someone?
Here's an example.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:29.520
If you read a good article --
I noticed in last month's Atlantic, there

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.830
was a great article about
augmented intelligence in Google.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.580
In fact, you can probably see at the top it
says, "Google is Actually

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.250
Making us Smarter."
I don't know if any of you saw this article,

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.819
but it's a great article
that just shows how important your work is

00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:46.730
here at Google.
And if you had read that article, you could

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.569
have circulated that to
your colleagues at work.

00:38:49.569 --> 00:38:54.240
And that would help them see why what you're
doing is so important.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:59.099
And that helps us connect through what we
call role in the whole.

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:03.031
The second is finding the right role.
And that's so critical for all of us in life,

00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:05.279
isn't it?
When we're in the right role that's a good

00:39:05.279 --> 00:39:09.040
fit with our strengths and
provides the right degree of challenge, we're

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.740
just energized.
And we perform better.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.510
We do better work.
Even more than that, though, we also, because

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.750
we're doing good work
when we're in the right role, people affirm

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.460
us, they give us
recognition.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.569
And that helps us.
Okay?

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:30.059
So you can help the people around you find
the right role for them.

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:33.060
When you're working with people you'll inevitably
see over time if

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.779
they're in the right role or not.
And if you have a good relationship with them,

00:39:36.779 --> 00:39:38.350
you can provide them
honest feedback.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.819
Because it's ultimately honest feedback that
helps us find the right

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:44.340
role.
So we need those people around us who will

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.529
provide honest feedback.
And if you're giving somebody that type of

00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:49.940
feedback, it's always good
to start out with praise.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:56.470
Like, Sara, you're great at this.
You may be even more effective if you try

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:01.779
this.
And then when it comes to feedback, we all

00:40:01.779 --> 00:40:03.519
need that feedback
ourselves, too.

00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:08.670
And what I suggest is try to spend some time
with the people you're

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.089
working with and get feedback on your work
product.

00:40:12.089 --> 00:40:16.109
And also how you interact with people one-to-one
and in a group

00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:20.730
setting.
And don't take too a specific feedback to

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.859
heart too much.
It's good to, number one, just listen to what

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:25.599
people have to say.
Thank them.

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:29.910
Don't be critical of what they say.
Write it down in a journal, keep track of

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.650
it.
And then as you gather more feedback over

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.670
time, patterns will start to
emerge and that will give you some things

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:41.039
to work on.
Number three, connect as human beings.

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:46.599
We just did the micro-connections exercise,
is what I call that.

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:51.279
The truth is in most organizations, they're
not blatantly toxic.

00:40:51.279 --> 00:40:54.290
They may have their toxic moments at times,
but most organizations are

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.230
not toxic cultures.
But they do, however, tend to be indifferent

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.000
cultures.
They're indifferent to people.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.380
They tend to be so focused on the -- we get
so focused on the rhythm of

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:10.849
tasks that we ignore people around us.
And that can be toxic, too, over time.

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:15.059
It's like a low level of toxicity.
It's almost like oxygen deprivation.

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:19.710
Where it effects us gradually over time but
there's a cumulative

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.109
effect.
And we oftentimes don't know the effect on

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:28.039
our bodies physically until
we've been in a toxic environment or in an

00:41:28.039 --> 00:41:31.369
environment that's
indifferent over years.

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:38.250
The antidote for an environment that's indifferent
and subtly toxic is

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:44.660
micro-connections like you did.
You know, asking a colleague a question that's

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.410
unrelated to work.
Getting to know them as a human being rather

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:54.670
than strictly interacting
as a human doing is a way to humanize the

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:58.349
work environment.
Another thing we can could that falls in the

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:02.890
micro-connections category
is just when we see people around rather than

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.200
ignoring them when we
pass someone in the hallway, you can just

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.150
make eye contact or smile and
say hello.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.829
Little things like that make a difference
too.

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:13.820
They start to make the -- Atul Gawande, the
surgeon who wrote the book

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:20.970
"Better," and he writes for the New Yorker.
One of the things he wrote about was asking

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:24.940
unrelated questions.
That's his number one recommendations to -- recommendation

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.200
to doctors
to improve their performance.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.109
And he had this great quote.
He said sometimes when we do that it helps,

00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:34.109
it makes the machine feel
less like a machine.

00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:39.609
It humanizes the workplace.
The next recommendation is grow or die.

00:42:39.609 --> 00:42:44.829
You know the definition for death in biology
is when an organism ceases

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:47.430
growing.
We all need to grow.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.579
We all need personal development plans in
writing.

00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:55.950
And so I would encourage you to do that.
Spend some time identifying how you're going

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.540
to grow.
And the beauty of Google is you have such

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.890
a wealth of resources here.
All these G-to-G programs and formal training

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:06.890
programs.
And you if happen to find something that doesn't

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:10.589
 -- an area you want to
grow in that there isn't a formal training

00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:14.660
or G-to-G offering
available, then start something on your own.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.079
Maybe you can find a book on the topic and
get a few colleagues

00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:22.200
together.
Or find an expert within Google who could,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.980
who could teach a new class
that you could structure as a G-to-G offering,

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.660
or find an expert who
becomes your mentor.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.960
So these things are just ways to keep us growing.
Fist bumps moments.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.640
Fist bumps are the high five of today.
I loved to see President Obama and the First

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.730
Lady giving each other
fist bumps.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:43.400
The Bryan twins who dominate men's doubles
in tennis, have you ever

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.369
watched those guys?
They must give like a hundred fist bumps in

00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:47.759
a match.
It's unbelievable.

00:43:47.759 --> 00:43:49.940
I love it.
It just energizes them.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.650
It keeps them up.
We all need that.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:55.720
It's in our DNA.
Fist bumps, whether they're literal or figurative,

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.140
metaphorical, we
need recognition.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.950
It's almost as if we have this recognition
battery that the plug in to

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.819
the battery is in our back at the place where
we can't reach.

00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:11.920
So we have to rely on the people around us
to charge our recognition

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.630
battery.
And we need that, if it's not charged, then

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.180
we lose energy.
But if it is charged on a regular basis, it

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.329
energizes us.
It helps perform better in life.

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:25.660
And I would encourage you that -- take the
initiative to charge the

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.690
batteries.
To be the, you know, seize those fist bumps

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.230
moments with the people you
work with, to encourage them.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:38.109
Keep in the loop.
It -- Google just seems really good at this

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:40.990
one.
You know, with TGIF's and all these other,

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.230
you know, white boards and
suggestion boxes.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.930
It seems like you have all the bases covered
on this one.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.089
That's great.
Don't -- I would encourage you to use those

00:44:49.089 --> 00:44:53.161
and just realize how
important that is to making people feel connected.

00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:58.289
That they're informed and they have a voice.
Not necessarily a vote, but at least a voice

00:44:58.289 --> 00:45:01.910
in decisions that are
being made that effect them.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:07.000
And then finally, study great leaders in whatever
realm.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.839
If you're interested in history or business
or sports.

00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:14.869
If you find great leaders and study them,
I guarantee you that you'll,

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:20.240
you'll find that they were a force for connection.
And by studying their lives, you'll learn

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.599
from their example.
And to get you started, I'm going to offer

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:29.500
all of you --
It's going to be available at my blog -- free

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.789
download of my book.
So it will be out there.

00:45:32.789 --> 00:45:35.539
It's a PDF file.
It's already out there right now.

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:38.990
I put it up this morning.
And the book can really help you get started

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:42.520
in a few ways.
Number one, it has 20 stories of great leaders

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.970
throughout history in
all these different realms, in sports, in

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:53.180
business, in leading nations.
And by reading those examples, you'll learn

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.910
from them.
Secondly, it has hundreds of actionable ways

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:01.240
for you to increase
connection among your team and here at Google.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.859
And then finally, it has questions that are
ideal for team study to get

00:46:04.859 --> 00:46:08.460
together like we did today in small groups
and just talk through.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.069
And that helps us all learn and better understand
connection.

00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:17.269
Who will you choose to become?
That's the question I want to leave you with

00:46:17.269 --> 00:46:20.480
today.
Because becoming an intentional connector

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.770
is a choice.
I think of people as falling into three categories

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:25.789
what it comes to
connection.

00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:30.519
The first is unintentional -- I'm sorry.
Intentional disconnectors.

00:46:30.519 --> 00:46:34.849
These are the individuals who lie, cheat,
and steal for self benefit.

00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:37.039
And some are psychopaths.
Some are sociopaths.

00:46:37.039 --> 00:46:42.280
Some are close to that.
Some, some are -- the abrasive disconnectors

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.670
you'll be able to spot.
But others are smooth and cunning, and you

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.950
have to watch your back.
With intentional disconnectors, because they

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.099
have learned how to
navigate in organizations, and you're going

00:46:54.099 --> 00:46:57.920
to run into them.
The second group is where most of us fall,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.200
what we call the
unintentional disconnectors.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.849
Because we all have blind spots, we don't
see.

00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:10.609
There are things we do that promote disconnection.
It may be that we're overly critical.

00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:15.910
It may be that we are not effective in giving
or receiving honest

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:21.109
feedback.
Those things create disconnection in relationships.

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:25.470
And we need people around us who will give
us honest feedback and help

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.380
us improve in those areas.
And when we do, when we're intentional about

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.820
learning about connection,
and surrounding ourselves with individuals

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.109
who will give us honest
feedback, that helps us reach the pentacle

00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:40.990
of connection which is the
intentional connector.

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:47.539
I wholeheartedly believe with, after doing
all the research, and

00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:52.230
thinking about my own experiences in life
and in work, that if we're

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:55.500
intentional about focussing on developing
task excellence and

00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.779
relationship excellence through connection,
we will perform at the top

00:48:00.779 --> 00:48:04.049
of our game whether we're an organization
or an individual.

00:48:04.049 --> 00:48:09.540
And my hope for you today is that you will
become an intentional

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.529
connector.
That you'll become an intentional connector

00:48:12.529 --> 00:48:16.059
not only here among your
colleagues at Google but also among your family

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:19.309
members at home.
Because this applies to the home, too.

00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:23.569
And with your friends in the community.
Mark this day.

00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:29.160
July 28, 2009, begin connecting, and watch
what happens.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.990
You will experience the prosperity, the productivity,
and the joy that

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:37.109
comes from having more connection in your
life.

00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:40.960
Thank you for taking time to listen to me.
And I'll stick a round a bit if anyone has

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.180
questions.
