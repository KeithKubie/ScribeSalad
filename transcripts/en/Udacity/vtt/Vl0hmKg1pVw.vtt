00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:02.411
The influence of 3D computer graphics is all

00:00:02.411 --> 00:00:04.277
around us. Sometimes its effects are

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:04.495
obvious, like when we see an action movie

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:08.361
or play a video game. Sometimes they are

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.570
not. Like when we take a sip of water or cut

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.944
a piece of paper.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.392
Learning how to model and display objects

00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:15.203
through computer graphics helps us to

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.063
understand, test and communicate ideas.

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:19.914
Take this apple for instance. When I first

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:21.886
began programming the state of the art

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:23.500
looked like this and took minutes to

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.798
compute. Over the past few decades, the

00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:28.152
field has evolved at an incredible pace and

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:30.232
we’re now at the point where elaborate

00:00:30.232 --> 00:00:32.100
effects can be presented through your web

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.999
browser in real time.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.932
In this course, we’ll teach you the basics of

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:37.983
3D Computer Graphics, both practical and

00:00:37.983 --> 00:00:40.581
theoretical. By the end you’ll not only

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.481
understand how to create and animate

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.334
objects, but will know the math that makes

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:46.545
this possible. You learn how to define

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.564
materials in lighting and also come to

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.503
understand the physics of how our eyes

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.097
perceive color. Only a basic understanding

00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:55.128
of programming is needed. So come, join

00:00:55.128 --> 00:00:57.198
us to learn some new ideas and get a fresh

00:00:57.198 --> 00:01:01.198
look at the world around you.
