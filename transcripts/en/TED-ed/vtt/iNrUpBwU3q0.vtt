00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:11.817
Nestled in the tissues of your neck
is a small unassuming organ

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:14.998
that wields enormous power over your body.

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.409
It's called the thyroid.

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.055
Like the operations manager in a company,

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:24.444
its role is to make sure that the cells
in your body are working properly.

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:29.523
It does that by using hormones to deliver
messages to every single one of them.

00:00:29.523 --> 00:00:32.894
This high-ranking organ 
is made up of lobules

00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:36.179
that each contains smaller cells
called follicles,

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.584
which store the hormones 
the thyroid sends out into your blood.

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:41.822
Two of the most important 
hormones it produces

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:48.609
are thyroxine and triiodothyronine,
or T3 and T4.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.727
As messengers, the hormone's job

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:55.575
is to instruct every cell in the body
when to consume oxygen and nutrients.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.797
That maintains the body's metabolism,

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:02.936
the series of reactions our cells perform
to provide us with energy.

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:05.379
This hormonal notification 
from the thyroid

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.015
gets the heart pumping more efficiently,

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.298
and makes our cells 
break down nutrients faster.

00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:12.808
When you need more energy,

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:17.270
the thyroid helps by sending out 
hormones to increase metabolism.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.344
Ultimately, the thyroid allows our cells
to use energy, grow and reproduce.

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:27.709
The thyroid is controlled by
the pituitary gland,

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.341
a hormonal gland deep in the brain
that oversees the thyroid's tasks,

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.816
making sure it knows 
when to send out its messengers.

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:39.250
The pituitary's role is to sense 
if hormone levels in the blood

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.807
are too low or too high,

00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:43.234
in which case it sends out instructions

00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:46.651
in the form of the thyroid-
stimulating hormone.

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.020
Even in this tightly 
controlled system, however,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.944
management sometimes slips up.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.230
Certain diseases,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.580
growths in the thryoid

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.342
or chemical imbalances in the body
can confuse the organ

00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:02.041
and make it deaf 
to the pituitary's guiding commands.

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.171
The first problem this causes 
is hyperthyroidism,

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:09.237
which happens when the organ sends out
too many hormones.

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:11.959
That means the cells 
are overloaded with instructions

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.665
to consume nutrients and oxygen.

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:17.228
They become overactive as a result,

00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:21.895
meaning a person with hyperthyroidism
experiences a higher metabolism

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:27.131
signaled by a faster heartbeat,
constant hunger, and rapid weight loss.

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:32.041
They also feel hot, sweaty, anxious,
and find it difficult to sleep.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.195
The opposite problem is hypothyroidism,

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:38.863
which happens when the thyroid 
sends out too few hormones,

00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:42.847
meaning the body's cells don't have
as many messengers to guide them.

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:47.279
In response, cells grow listless
and metabolism slows.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.042
People with hypothyroidism
see symptoms in weight gain,

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:57.341
sluggishness, sensitivity to cold, 
swollen joints and feeling low.

00:02:57.341 --> 00:02:59.268
Luckily, there are medical treatments

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:02.192
that can help trigger 
the thyroid's activities again,

00:03:02.192 --> 00:03:05.497
and bring the body back 
to a steady metabolic rate.

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:10.311
For such a little organ,
the thyroid wields an awful lot of power.

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:13.816
But a healthy thyroid 
manages our cells so effectively

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:18.703
that it can keep us running smoothly
without us even noticing it's there.
