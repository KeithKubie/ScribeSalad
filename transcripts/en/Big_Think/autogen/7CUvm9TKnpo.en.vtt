I'm not that smart that I can see 50

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410
I'm not that smart that I can see 50
 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.650
I'm not that smart that I can see 50
years ahead and and say which technology

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
years ahead and and say which technology
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.240
years ahead and and say which technology
is going to be the most efficient but

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250
is going to be the most efficient but
 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.609
is going to be the most efficient but
ultimately I don't think anyone can ask

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619
ultimately I don't think anyone can ask
 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.560
ultimately I don't think anyone can ask
the soul of people and they'll say solar

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570
the soul of people and they'll say solar
 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.720
the soul of people and they'll say solar
panels are great ask the wind turbine

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730
panels are great ask the wind turbine
 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.429
panels are great ask the wind turbine
people and they say wind turbines are

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439
people and they say wind turbines are
 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.710
people and they say wind turbines are
great but the point is we should be

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720
great but the point is we should be
 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.470
great but the point is we should be
funding all of those possibly great

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480
funding all of those possibly great
 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.960
funding all of those possibly great
alternatives and it's okay that most of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970
alternatives and it's okay that most of
 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.580
alternatives and it's okay that most of
them are going to fail because the ones

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590
them are going to fail because the ones
 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.530
them are going to fail because the ones
that won't fail are the ones that are

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540
that won't fail are the ones that are
 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.090
that won't fail are the ones that are
going to be powering the rest of the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100
going to be powering the rest of the
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.460
going to be powering the rest of the
21st century if we look at potential

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470
21st century if we look at potential
 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.020
21st century if we look at potential
from an engineering point of view it's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030
from an engineering point of view it's
 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.880
from an engineering point of view it's
very clearly solar that has the greatest

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890
very clearly solar that has the greatest
 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.950
very clearly solar that has the greatest
potential it could actually cover the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960
potential it could actually cover the
 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.860
potential it could actually cover the
entire energy consumption of the world

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870
entire energy consumption of the world
 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.740
entire energy consumption of the world
from just one hour of sunshine on this

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750
from just one hour of sunshine on this
 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.810
from just one hour of sunshine on this
planet or to put it differently if we

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820
planet or to put it differently if we
 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.969
planet or to put it differently if we
put out the current effectiveness of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979
put out the current effectiveness of
 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.280
put out the current effectiveness of
solar panels on just two point six

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290
solar panels on just two point six
 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.710
solar panels on just two point six
percent of the air the Sahara we could

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720
percent of the air the Sahara we could
 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.359
percent of the air the Sahara we could
cover the entire world energy

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369
cover the entire world energy
 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.729
cover the entire world energy
consumption now of course we wouldn't do

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
consumption now of course we wouldn't do
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.770
consumption now of course we wouldn't do
that because we want it different places

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780
that because we want it different places
 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.710
that because we want it different places
and we also have the question of storage

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720
and we also have the question of storage
 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.240
and we also have the question of storage
and there's a lot of other issues that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250
and there's a lot of other issues that
 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.550
and there's a lot of other issues that
we need to fix most of which is the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560
we need to fix most of which is the
 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.830
we need to fix most of which is the
economic point that solar panels is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840
economic point that solar panels is
 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.109
economic point that solar panels is
still about 10 times as expensive as

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119
still about 10 times as expensive as
 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.149
still about 10 times as expensive as
fossil fuels and that leads us to the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159
fossil fuels and that leads us to the
 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.670
fossil fuels and that leads us to the
second point which of these many

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680
second point which of these many
 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.920
second point which of these many
different possible green technologies

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930
different possible green technologies
 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.099
different possible green technologies
are the most sustainable in the long run

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109
are the most sustainable in the long run
 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.330
are the most sustainable in the long run
economically that's a very different

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340
economically that's a very different
 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.459
economically that's a very different
question and unfortunately not one that

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469
question and unfortunately not one that
 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.109
question and unfortunately not one that
I know the answer to and I don't think

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119
I know the answer to and I don't think
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.539
I know the answer to and I don't think
anyone knows we can't predict what is

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549
anyone knows we can't predict what is
 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.639
anyone knows we can't predict what is
going to become of the effectiveness

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649
going to become of the effectiveness
 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.980
going to become of the effectiveness
over the next 50 years that's why we

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990
over the next 50 years that's why we
 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.209
over the next 50 years that's why we
should be investing in research and

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219
should be investing in research and
 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.709
should be investing in research and
development on all of these different

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719
development on all of these different
 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.899
development on all of these different
technologies we don't know which one is

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909
technologies we don't know which one is
 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.690
technologies we don't know which one is
going to win if you will but that's okay

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700
going to win if you will but that's okay
 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.810
going to win if you will but that's okay
because some of them vote will very

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820
because some of them vote will very
 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.940
because some of them vote will very
likely win and those are the ones that

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950
likely win and those are the ones that
 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.559
likely win and those are the ones that
are going to be powering the rest of the

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569
are going to be powering the rest of the
 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.350
are going to be powering the rest of the
21st century
