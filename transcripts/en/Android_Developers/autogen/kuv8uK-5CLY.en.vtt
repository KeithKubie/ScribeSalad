with camera acts they were able to

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970
with camera acts they were able to
 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.270
with camera acts they were able to
reduce their device-specific testing and

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280
reduce their device-specific testing and
 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.810
reduce their device-specific testing and
saw a 75% reduction in lines of code

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820

addition to making the code easier to

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020
addition to making the code easier to
 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.719
addition to making the code easier to
read and a smaller apk size so let's

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729
read and a smaller apk size so let's
 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.659

we talked briefly about use cases so

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300
we talked briefly about use cases so
 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.840
we talked briefly about use cases so
these were the preview image analysis

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.850
these were the preview image analysis
 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.170
these were the preview image analysis
and image capture when we sat down to

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180
and image capture when we sat down to
 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.910
and image capture when we sat down to
design camera rack so we realized we had

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:48.920
design camera rack so we realized we had
 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.550
design camera rack so we realized we had
to balance a few design constraints we

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560
to balance a few design constraints we
 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.390
to balance a few design constraints we
want to make an API that's simple to use

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400
want to make an API that's simple to use
 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.980
want to make an API that's simple to use
we want to create an abstraction level

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:56.990
we want to create an abstraction level
 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.000
we want to create an abstraction level
that lets us hide device specific issues

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.010
that lets us hide device specific issues
 

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.500
that lets us hide device specific issues
we also want to make sure that the API

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.510
we also want to make sure that the API
 

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.240
we also want to make sure that the API
is flexible enough so that you can

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250
is flexible enough so that you can
 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.150
is flexible enough so that you can
create fully featured applications so

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:07.160
create fully featured applications so
 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.440
create fully featured applications so
how did we think about this how did we

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.450
how did we think about this how did we
 

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:14.380
how did we think about this how did we
go about this we figured about creating

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:14.390
go about this we figured about creating
 

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.450
go about this we figured about creating
a programming model where we really are

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.460
a programming model where we really are
 

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.320
a programming model where we really are
capturing the intent of the developer

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:19.330
capturing the intent of the developer
 

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.550
capturing the intent of the developer
but also providing the right amount of

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560
but also providing the right amount of
 

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.610
but also providing the right amount of
flexibility so really we have an API and

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:24.620
flexibility so really we have an API and
 

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.080
flexibility so really we have an API and
we'll walk through some examples where

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.090
we'll walk through some examples where
 

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.490
we'll walk through some examples where
we're really asking three things from

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:27.500
we're really asking three things from
 

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.490
we're really asking three things from
the application first what's the

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:30.500
the application first what's the
 

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.490
the application first what's the
intended usage which of the use cases

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.500
intended usage which of the use cases
 

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.290
intended usage which of the use cases
one are multiple do you want to use

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:35.300
one are multiple do you want to use
 

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.850
one are multiple do you want to use
preview image analysis and image capture

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:38.860
preview image analysis and image capture
 

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.980
preview image analysis and image capture
secondly or should the output go when

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:41.990
secondly or should the output go when
 

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.080
secondly or should the output go when
you get the frames how does that hook up

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.090
you get the frames how does that hook up
 

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.520
you get the frames how does that hook up
to your application so that you can

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:45.530
to your application so that you can
 

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.950
to your application so that you can
write the code that you need to do and

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:47.960
write the code that you need to do and
 

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.410
write the code that you need to do and
finally when should the camera start

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:50.420
finally when should the camera start
 

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.380
finally when should the camera start
when should the camera stop so I'm gonna

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:53.390
when should the camera stop so I'm gonna
 

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.940
when should the camera stop so I'm gonna
walk through some code now and these

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:54.950
walk through some code now and these
 

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.200
walk through some code now and these

first time one of the things you might
 

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.170
first time one of the things you might
want to do is start up that camera and

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:17.690
at what the code looks like for that we
 

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.220
at what the code looks like for that we
start by configuring a preview so here I

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.230
start by configuring a preview so here I
 

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.230
start by configuring a preview so here I
built a preview config using a builder

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240
built a preview config using a builder
 

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.150
built a preview config using a builder
I'm showing it here in his default

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160
I'm showing it here in his default
 

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.850
I'm showing it here in his default
configuration the default configuration

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:30.860
configuration the default configuration
 

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.250
configuration the default configuration
is actually fairly powerful what this is

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:33.260
is actually fairly powerful what this is
 

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.620
is actually fairly powerful what this is
going to do is on that particular device

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:35.630
going to do is on that particular device
 

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.210
going to do is on that particular device
it's going to understand the available

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:37.220
it's going to understand the available
 

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.070
it's going to understand the available
resolutions it's also going to

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.080
resolutions it's also going to
 

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.420
resolutions it's also going to
understand the resolution of the display

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:40.430
understand the resolution of the display
 

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.070
understand the resolution of the display
and it's going to try and make a

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080
and it's going to try and make a
 

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.870
and it's going to try and make a
reasonable decision based on that for

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880
reasonable decision based on that for
 

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.640
reasonable decision based on that for
you

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:44.650
you
 

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.740
you
it will default also to the back camera

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:46.750
it will default also to the back camera
 

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.530
it will default also to the back camera
and making sure that the default

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:49.540
and making sure that the default
 

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.540
and making sure that the default
configuration ones well is an example of

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:51.550
configuration ones well is an example of
 

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.400
configuration ones well is an example of
something that we're able to test in our

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.410
something that we're able to test in our
 

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.850
something that we're able to test in our
lab now at this point you could set

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.860
lab now at this point you could set
 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.620
lab now at this point you could set
additional options if you needed them

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:58.630
additional options if you needed them
 

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:04.140
additional options if you needed them
we'll show some examples coming up now

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.150
we'll show some examples coming up now
 

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.400
we'll show some examples coming up now
that we have configured the preview we

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:05.410
that we have configured the preview we
 

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.780
that we have configured the preview we
can actually create a preview use case

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:08.790
can actually create a preview use case
 

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.980
can actually create a preview use case
simply by handing it the config and

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:10.990
simply by handing it the config and
 

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.990
simply by handing it the config and
we'll see if these use cases actually

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000
we'll see if these use cases actually
 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.350
we'll see if these use cases actually
have API specific methods the preview

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360
have API specific methods the preview
 

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.890
have API specific methods the preview
provides a method to set a listener

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:24.900
provides a method to set a listener
 

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.150
provides a method to set a listener
what's going to happen now is when the

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160
what's going to happen now is when the
 

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.460
what's going to happen now is when the
preview becomes active it's going to

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:29.470
preview becomes active it's going to
 

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.050
preview becomes active it's going to
output a preview output the current

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.060
output a preview output the current
 

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.840
output a preview output the current
version outputs within the preview

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:36.850
version outputs within the preview
 

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.390
version outputs within the preview
output a surface texture that's

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.400
output a surface texture that's
 

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.970
output a surface texture that's
configured and ready you can use a

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:41.980
configured and ready you can use a
 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.890
configured and ready you can use a
surface texture to attach to a texture

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:43.900
surface texture to attach to a texture
 

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.630
surface texture to attach to a texture
view or use this with a GL renderer

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640
view or use this with a GL renderer
 

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.740
view or use this with a GL renderer
future versions may interact with

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:49.750
future versions may interact with
 

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.660
future versions may interact with
surface view or accept the surface

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:51.670
surface view or accept the surface
 

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.380
surface view or accept the surface
texture from the application now with

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:55.390
texture from the application now with
 

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.160
texture from the application now with
this code camera X is configured we just

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.170
this code camera X is configured we just
 

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.390
this code camera X is configured we just
need to be able to turn it on and turn

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:00.400
need to be able to turn it on and turn
 

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.540
need to be able to turn it on and turn
it off so the third step when should the

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:06.550
it off so the third step when should the
 

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.500
it off so the third step when should the
camera start when should the camera stop

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.510
camera start when should the camera stop
 

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.990
camera start when should the camera stop
we do this by binding the previous case

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000
we do this by binding the previous case
 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.590
we do this by binding the previous case
to an activity lifecycle

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600
to an activity lifecycle
 

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.510
to an activity lifecycle
now what this means is when the activity

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:18.520
now what this means is when the activity
 

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.730
now what this means is when the activity
starts the PP is going to start and the

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:20.740
starts the PP is going to start and the
 

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.530
starts the PP is going to start and the
camera is going to start to stream when

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.540
camera is going to start to stream when
 

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.360
camera is going to start to stream when
the activity stops the preview is going

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:24.370
the activity stops the preview is going
 

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.450
the activity stops the preview is going
to stop the camera is going to shut down

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:26.460
to stop the camera is going to shut down
 

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.310
to stop the camera is going to shut down
other life cycles can also be used for

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320
other life cycles can also be used for
 

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.470
other life cycles can also be used for
example a fragment life cycle could be

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480
example a fragment life cycle could be
 

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.870
example a fragment life cycle could be
used here instead and in this way we're

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880
used here instead and in this way we're
 

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.210
used here instead and in this way we're
able to hide the complexity of start and

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.220
able to hide the complexity of start and
 

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.790
able to hide the complexity of start and
stop in particular shutting down things

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800
stop in particular shutting down things
 

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.850
stop in particular shutting down things
in the right order can be kind of tricky

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860
 
 

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.670
 
so here you see all three steps being

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680
so here you see all three steps being
 

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.340
so here you see all three steps being
done together now a real camera

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:50.350
done together now a real camera
 

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.040
done together now a real camera
application will have additional code

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.050
application will have additional code
 

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.390
application will have additional code
there would need to be code for setting

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.400
there would need to be code for setting
 

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.079
there would need to be code for setting
up permission attaching to views

00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:58.089
up permission attaching to views
 

00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:01.230
up permission attaching to views
and managing the surface texture but we

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240
and managing the surface texture but we
 

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.239
and managing the surface texture but we
do show here is actually sufficient to

00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:03.249
do show here is actually sufficient to
 

00:12:03.249 --> 00:12:05.610
do show here is actually sufficient to
get the camera system set up we've

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:05.620
get the camera system set up we've
 

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.290
get the camera system set up we've
hidden many of the details of camera -

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:07.300
hidden many of the details of camera -
 

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.949
hidden many of the details of camera -
for example opening the camera creating

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959
for example opening the camera creating
 

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:12.780
for example opening the camera creating
the session preparing the correct

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:12.790
the session preparing the correct
 

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.920
the session preparing the correct
surfaces selecting the resolutions and

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:15.930
surfaces selecting the resolutions and
 

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.239
surfaces selecting the resolutions and
the careful shutdown that you sometimes

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:18.249
the careful shutdown that you sometimes
 

00:12:18.249 --> 00:12:20.369
the careful shutdown that you sometimes
have to do to make sure that everything

00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:20.379
have to do to make sure that everything
 

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:22.530
have to do to make sure that everything
works just right I'll pause here just

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:22.540
works just right I'll pause here just
 

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:34.580
works just right I'll pause here just
for a second so you can look at slide

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:34.590
 
 

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.110
 
so let's say you have that first

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120
so let's say you have that first
 

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.050
so let's say you have that first
previous dreaming now maybe the next

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060
previous dreaming now maybe the next
 

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.400
previous dreaming now maybe the next
thing you want to do is be able to

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:40.410
thing you want to do is be able to
 

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.200
thing you want to do is be able to
access that camera data so you can do

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.210
access that camera data so you can do
 

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.140
access that camera data so you can do
some analysis or image processing on it

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:44.150
some analysis or image processing on it
 

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.130
some analysis or image processing on it
so for this we have something called

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:46.140
so for this we have something called
 

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.260
so for this we have something called
image analysis which provides easy

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.270
image analysis which provides easy
 

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.079
image analysis which provides easy
access to the buffers from the camera so

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:51.089
access to the buffers from the camera so
 

00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:54.670
access to the buffers from the camera so
that you can perform your own analysis

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680
 
 

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.840
 
what does it look like it really follows

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:56.850
what does it look like it really follows
 

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.720
what does it look like it really follows
the same steps that we showed with the

00:12:59.720 --> 00:12:59.730
the same steps that we showed with the
 

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.820
the same steps that we showed with the
preview first we're gonna go ahead and

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:01.830
preview first we're gonna go ahead and
 

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.110
preview first we're gonna go ahead and
create a config here I'm gonna show what

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120
create a config here I'm gonna show what
 

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.280
create a config here I'm gonna show what
it looks like the set an option on a

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.290
it looks like the set an option on a
 

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.940
it looks like the set an option on a
config in this case we're gonna request

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:10.950
config in this case we're gonna request
 

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.730
config in this case we're gonna request
a resolution now let's say your

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740
a resolution now let's say your
 

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.920
a resolution now let's say your
processing requires some minimum

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:15.930
processing requires some minimum
 

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.500
processing requires some minimum
resolution for it to succeed this is

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:18.510
resolution for it to succeed this is
 

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.310
resolution for it to succeed this is
where you can specify that what camera X

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320
where you can specify that what camera X
 

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.500
where you can specify that what camera X
then is going to do is it's gonna

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:24.510
then is going to do is it's gonna
 

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.360
then is going to do is it's gonna
balance the requests from your

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:26.370
balance the requests from your
 

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.170
balance the requests from your
application with the device capability

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.180
application with the device capability
 

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.000
application with the device capability
so it's going to look at your target

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.010
so it's going to look at your target
 

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.590
so it's going to look at your target

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.650
per device basis if necessary let's take
a look at how that looks it's gonna

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:44.660
a look at how that looks it's gonna
 

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.120
a look at how that looks it's gonna
follow the same pattern as our previous

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.130
follow the same pattern as our previous
 

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:53.820
follow the same pattern as our previous
use cases so first we create a config

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:53.830
 
 

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.340
 
now we know getting rotation on devices

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:57.350
now we know getting rotation on devices
 

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.970
now we know getting rotation on devices
can be tricky getting portrait mode and

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:00.980
can be tricky getting portrait mode and
 

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.100
can be tricky getting portrait mode and
landscape mode just right on a variety

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.110
landscape mode just right on a variety
 

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.010
landscape mode just right on a variety
of devices is hard what we've done here

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.020
of devices is hard what we've done here
 

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.440
of devices is hard what we've done here
is reduce the problem to having the

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:08.450
is reduce the problem to having the
 

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.600
is reduce the problem to having the
application specify its current display

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:10.610
application specify its current display
 

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.360
application specify its current display
rotation what's going to happen now is

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:13.370
rotation what's going to happen now is
 

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.190
rotation what's going to happen now is
internally inside camera X we're going

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200
internally inside camera X we're going
 

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.870
internally inside camera X we're going
to look at the rest of the transforms on

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880
to look at the rest of the transforms on
 

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.850
to look at the rest of the transforms on
the device and make sure that our output

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:18.860
the device and make sure that our output
 

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.289
the device and make sure that our output
is doing the right thing for your

00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:20.299
is doing the right thing for your
 

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.720
is doing the right thing for your
application for example in the case of

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.730
application for example in the case of
 

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.610
application for example in the case of
image capture we're going to understand

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:24.620
image capture we're going to understand
 

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.110
image capture we're going to understand
instead of transforms and we're going to

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120
instead of transforms and we're going to
 

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.820
instead of transforms and we're going to
make sure that the X is made it did it

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:27.830
make sure that the X is made it did it
 

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.310
make sure that the X is made it did it
is set correctly then we go ahead and

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320
is set correctly then we go ahead and
 

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.830
is set correctly then we go ahead and
create the actual image capture use case

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840
create the actual image capture use case
 

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.570
create the actual image capture use case
itself then we bind to the life cycle as

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:40.580
itself then we bind to the life cycle as
 

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.909
itself then we bind to the life cycle as
before now here's an example of binding

00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919
before now here's an example of binding
 

00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:44.919
before now here's an example of binding
all the three use cases together preview

00:18:44.919 --> 00:18:44.929
all the three use cases together preview
 

00:18:44.929 --> 00:18:49.770
all the three use cases together preview
image analysis and now image capture

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:49.780
 
 

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.240
 
again here's the code to set up the

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:52.250
again here's the code to set up the
 

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.010
again here's the code to set up the
image capture and so now when the

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.020
image capture and so now when the
 

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.260
image capture and so now when the
activity starts the preview is going to

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:56.270
activity starts the preview is going to
 

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.659
activity starts the preview is going to
come on screen if you have any analysis

00:18:58.659 --> 00:18:58.669
come on screen if you have any analysis
 

00:18:58.669 --> 00:19:00.760
come on screen if you have any analysis
it'll be running and your application is

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:00.770
it'll be running and your application is
 

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.990
it'll be running and your application is
ready to take a picture but what about

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000
ready to take a picture but what about
 

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.909
ready to take a picture but what about
step two what about attaching that

00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919
step two what about attaching that
 

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:10.750
step two what about attaching that
output it's another example of a use

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760
output it's another example of a use
 

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.220
output it's another example of a use
case specific method so for taking a

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.230
case specific method so for taking a
 

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.049
case specific method so for taking a
picture it might be pretty common that

00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:17.059
picture it might be pretty common that
 

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:19.510
picture it might be pretty common that
the user would tap on screen that would

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520
the user would tap on screen that would
 

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.130
the user would tap on screen that would
have activated button click and perhaps

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.140
have activated button click and perhaps
 

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.350
have activated button click and perhaps
that button click would call into some

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360
that button click would call into some
 

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.540
that button click would call into some
function let's say on

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:25.550
function let's say on
 

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.770
function let's say on
so when user clicks a button now this

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:27.780
so when user clicks a button now this
 

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.270
so when user clicks a button now this
can invoke a function and within that

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280
can invoke a function and within that
 

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.160
can invoke a function and within that
function you can simply call image

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.170
function you can simply call image
 

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.760
function you can simply call image
capture take picture here I show first

function with that take picture function
 

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.730
function with that take picture function
you can then specify the target

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740
you can then specify the target
 

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.640
you can then specify the target
destination the file itself you can also

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:49.650
destination the file itself you can also
 

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.440
destination the file itself you can also
specify what to do after the image is

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:51.450
specify what to do after the image is
 

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.020
specify what to do after the image is
captured by specifying a listener you

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.030
captured by specifying a listener you
 

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.060
captured by specifying a listener you
can specify what to do on error or what

showing all the different use cases we
talked about we're showing preview to

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:38.970
talked about we're showing preview to
 

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.210
talked about we're showing preview to
get the image on screen we're showing

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220
get the image on screen we're showing
 

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.139
get the image on screen we're showing
image analysis to detect the face and

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:44.149
image analysis to detect the face and
 

00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:47.090
image analysis to detect the face and
then also render an overlay and then the

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100
then also render an overlay and then the
 

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.169
then also render an overlay and then the
whole gang is going to come up and

00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179
whole gang is going to come up and
 

00:20:48.179 --> 00:20:50.720
whole gang is going to come up and
finally when we're ready let's see if we

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:50.730
finally when we're ready let's see if we
 

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.399
finally when we're ready let's see if we
can kind of get a picture that we like

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:52.409
can kind of get a picture that we like
 

00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:57.409
can kind of get a picture that we like
with all the foxes when we're ready we

00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:57.419
with all the foxes when we're ready we
 

00:20:57.419 --> 00:20:58.729
with all the foxes when we're ready we
can even go ahead and use the image

00:20:58.729 --> 00:20:58.739
can even go ahead and use the image
 

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:02.659
can even go ahead and use the image
capture and that'll take a photo these

00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:02.669
capture and that'll take a photo these
 

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:10.129
capture and that'll take a photo these
guys

00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:10.139
 
 

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:12.479
 
so this is a great example with what we

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:12.489
so this is a great example with what we
 

00:21:12.489 --> 00:21:14.580
so this is a great example with what we
have today of using all these three use

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:14.590
have today of using all these three use
 

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.259
have today of using all these three use
cases together to create a fully

selfies working with snow they express
 

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:25.350
selfies working with snow they express
on the benefits of camera acts to us

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360
on the benefits of camera acts to us
 

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.590
on the benefits of camera acts to us
they found it was easy to use they

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600
they found it was easy to use they
 

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.359
they found it was easy to use they
appreciated that we managed the camera

00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:30.369
appreciated that we managed the camera
 

00:21:30.369 --> 00:21:33.149
appreciated that we managed the camera
lifecycle they also appreciated that we

00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159
lifecycle they also appreciated that we
 

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:34.710
lifecycle they also appreciated that we
handled camera threatening internally to

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720
handled camera threatening internally to
 

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.810
handled camera threatening internally to
camera X without the need for them to

camera X without the need for them to
 

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.029
camera X without the need for them to
have that in their application so in

00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039
have that in their application so in
 

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:44.099
have that in their application so in
summary we've talked about the use cases

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:44.109
summary we've talked about the use cases
 

00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:48.119
summary we've talked about the use cases
preview image analysis image capture we

sample app what Franklin is going to do
 

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.240
sample app what Franklin is going to do
is take two images a picture with the

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.250
is take two images a picture with the
 

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.760
is take two images a picture with the
normal mode and a picture with the HDR

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:18.770
normal mode and a picture with the HDR
 

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:23.980
normal mode and a picture with the HDR
mode and let's compare the two images so

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:23.990
mode and let's compare the two images so
 

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.150
mode and let's compare the two images so
in the HDR image you'll see that the you

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:28.160
in the HDR image you'll see that the you
 

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.410
in the HDR image you'll see that the you
know the light that's coming out of the

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:29.420
know the light that's coming out of the
 

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.580
know the light that's coming out of the
glass door is actually better the table

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:33.590
glass door is actually better the table
 

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.580
glass door is actually better the table
or the podium here is quite dark in the

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:36.590
or the podium here is quite dark in the
 

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.290
or the podium here is quite dark in the
normal picture but it's more lighted up

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:38.300
normal picture but it's more lighted up
 

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.710
normal picture but it's more lighted up
in the HDR picture so all of these

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720
in the HDR picture so all of these
 

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.770
in the HDR picture so all of these
functionalities can be added very simply

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:44.780
functionalities can be added very simply
 

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.390
