00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Hi. I'm John Green.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.180
This is Crash Course World History.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.900
We're back!

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.620
Stan, we painted over all the green parts

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.280
of not-America with this globe.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.200
We need a new globe!

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.580
Yesss!

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.620
New globe!

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.500
Also this one magically opens

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
and stuff comes out of it.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.660
So it turns out,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.600
surprisingly enough,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.920
there is more world history

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.720
than we could fit into 42 episodes.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.920
So for the next 30 episodes

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
we're gonna fill in some gaps

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.860
that we missed before.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.860
But we're also gonna expand on

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.800
some of the big ideas about history.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.640
And we're gonna continue,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.280
not to sound meta,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.300
to try to think about

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.620
how we think about history

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.300
by approaching the study of history

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.400
from different perspectives.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.320
Mister Green! Mister Green!

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.820
Wait.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.200
I don't understand how all this stuff's gonna help me

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.760
get a five on the AP test.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.020
Ohhh...Me from the past.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.440
I'm gonna let you in on little secret.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.060
How well you do on the AP World History test

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.620
is not actually the event

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.120
that's going to shape

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.160
the course of your life.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.260
And you are not actually

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.040
getting an education

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.180
so that you could get good grades

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.740
so that you can go to college

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.080
so that you can get a job.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.600
We are investing as a social order

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.940
in your education because it is useful to us

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940
to have you be an informed

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.960
and engaged citizen of the world.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.940
I'm not interested in cramming

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.500
the facts down your throat

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.800
that will allow you to get a five on the AP test.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.480
That's not what gets me excited in the morning.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.780
And I don't wanna be presumptuous.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.100
But I think I can speak for your teachers

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.700
when I say that's also not why they're doing their jobs.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.560
Me from the past,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.760
the biggest problem with being alive

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.380
is that you can only see the world out of your eyes.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380
You can only live inside of your skin,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.320
your consciousness.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.900
You can't effectively imagine

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.400
what it's like to be someone else.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.840
But the study of history allows you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.780
to empathize better;

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.500
it allows you to think more complexly about others.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.700
And that's gonna useful to you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.800
not just on AP test

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.940
but in every single moment of your entire life.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.440
So I don't care that you have

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.820
already taken the AP test

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.700
because, and I say this with love,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700
you are still kind of an idiot.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.560
And so am I.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.340
So we're gonna learn this stuff together

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.000
in the hopes that what we learn

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.740
can somehow contribute in a small way

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800
to making our lives better,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.680
but also to making other lives better.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.840
So we're gonna look at complicated

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.820
and problematic ideas like civilization.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.860
We're gonna look at things like

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.760
the history of money and economics,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.320
how environmental changes have affected

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080
the stability of social orders.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.160
And we're gonna talk about how war and disease and technology

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.620
have not only shaped the world that people used to live in

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.420
but also the one that we're living in now.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.220
And yes,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.300
due to extensive popular request,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.600
we will be talking about Vikings.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.040
So it's gonna be a fun 30 weeks.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.260
Full of Vikings and pirates and complex ideas

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.480
and dirty jokes that can be read two ways

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.760
so they can still be shown in class.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.620
We're so excited to back teaching you more World History.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.420
Thank you for watching.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:27.933
We'll see you next week.
