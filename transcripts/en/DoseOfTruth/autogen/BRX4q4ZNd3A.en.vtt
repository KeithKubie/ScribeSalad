you couldn't skip the ad and I thought
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.930
you couldn't skip the ad and I thought

for four minutes of content it violates

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
for four minutes of content it violates
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779
for four minutes of content it violates
the norms and so it had only had about

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
the norms and so it had only had about
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.910
the norms and so it had only had about
12,000 views and that's a really

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
12,000 views and that's a really
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439
12,000 views and that's a really
interesting example of Marshall

technological infrastructure and it's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
technological infrastructure and it's
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690
technological infrastructure and it's
sort of like the old thing because

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
sort of like the old thing because
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000
sort of like the old thing because
YouTube is sort of like a TV network but

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
YouTube is sort of like a TV network but
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310
YouTube is sort of like a TV network but
it's also not like a TV network at all

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
it's also not like a TV network at all
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440
it's also not like a TV network at all
partly for example because when you put

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
partly for example because when you put
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940

something on YouTube its permanent

that's way different than broadcast TV

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
that's way different than broadcast TV
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.999
that's way different than broadcast TV
like it's RIT seriously revolutionarily

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
like it's RIT seriously revolutionarily
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.870
like it's RIT seriously revolutionarily
different and so and it's also the case

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
different and so and it's also the case
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.840
different and so and it's also the case
to that and then this is a strange thing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
to that and then this is a strange thing
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399
to that and then this is a strange thing
and I don't think the classic media

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
and I don't think the classic media
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.960
and I don't think the classic media
understands this either is that YouTube

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
understands this either is that YouTube
 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.819
understands this either is that YouTube
people don't like high production values

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
people don't like high production values
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830
people don't like high production values
in fact they're very cynical about them

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
in fact they're very cynical about them
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749
in fact they're very cynical about them
and I think that's because they've come

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
and I think that's because they've come
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.289
and I think that's because they've come

mean editing doesn't have to be

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
mean editing doesn't have to be
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149
mean editing doesn't have to be
manipulating but it certainly can be and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
manipulating but it certainly can be and
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.120
manipulating but it certainly can be and
so and besides that a lot of the more

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:56.699
saw him and that was with Brett who just
 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.050
saw him and that was with Brett who just
spoke I asked him what it was like to be

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739
the most powerful interviewer the world
 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.559
the most powerful interviewer the world
has ever seen because I think he

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569
has ever seen because I think he
 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.970
has ever seen because I think he
probably is if you think about it in

Cronkite back in the 60s had some

Cronkite back in the 60s had some
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.030
Cronkite back in the 60s had some
comparable influence but he said I just

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
comparable influence but he said I just
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.789
comparable influence but he said I just
don't think about it and like what what

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799
don't think about it and like what what
 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.080
don't think about it and like what what
the hell is he supposed to think about

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
the hell is he supposed to think about
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.089
the hell is he supposed to think about
it because no one knows what to think

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099
it because no one knows what to think
 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.369
it because no one knows what to think
about that and so he just has the

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379
about that and so he just has the
 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.439
about that and so he just has the
conversations and posts them and away he

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449
conversations and posts them and away he
 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.839
conversations and posts them and away he
goes but he has no idea what role he's

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849
goes but he has no idea what role he's
 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.789
goes but he has no idea what role he's
currently playing in society and we
