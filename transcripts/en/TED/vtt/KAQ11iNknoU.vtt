00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.920
[This talk contains graphic images
Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.760
I collect objects.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.440
I collect branding irons that were used
to mark slaves as property.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.680
I collect shackles for adults

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.000
and restraints for adults

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.960
as well as children.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.136
I collect lynching postcards.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.560
Yes, they depict lynchings.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.296
They also depict the massive crowds
that attended these lynchings,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.256
and they are postcards

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.320
that were also used for correspondence.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.320
I collect proslavery books
that portray black people as criminals

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.680
or as animals without souls.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.840
I brought you something today.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.520
This is a ship's branding iron.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.976
It was used to mark slaves.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.736
Well, they actually were not slaves
when they were marked.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.976
They were in Africa.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.056
But they were marked with an "S"

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.296
to designate that they
were going to be slaves

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.016
when they were brought to the US

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.802
and when they were brought to Europe.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.696
Another object or image that captured
my imagination when I was younger

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.176
was a Klan robe.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.416
Growing up in South Carolina, I would see
Ku Klux Klan rallies occasionally,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.696
actually more than occasionally,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.856
and the memories of those events
never really left my mind.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.480
And I didn't really do anything
with that imagery until 25 years later.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.816
A few years ago,
I started researching the Klan,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.800
the three distinct waves of the Klan,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.336
the second one in particular.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.096
The second wave of the Klan
had more than five million active members,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.656
which was five percent
of the population at the time,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.560
which was also the population
of New York City at the time.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.536
The Klan robe factory in the Buckhead
neighborhood of Georgia was so busy

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.376
it became a 24-hour factory
to keep up with orders.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.360
They kept 20,000 robes on hand at all time
to keep up with the demand.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.896
As a collector of artifacts
and as an artist,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.656
I really wanted a Klan robe
to be part of my collection,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.216
because artifacts
and objects tell stories,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.080
but I really couldn't find one
that was really good quality.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.776
What is a black man to do in America

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.936
when he can't find the quality
Klan robe that he's looking for?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.760
(Laughter)

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.256
So I had no other choice.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.720
I decided I was going to make
the best quality Klan robes in America.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.296
These are not your traditional Klan robes
you would see at any KKK rally.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.536
I used kente cloth,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.856
I used camouflage,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.960
spandex, burlap, silks,
satins and different patterns.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.256
I make them for different age groups;
I make them for young kids

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.880
as well as toddlers.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.080
I even made one for an infant.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.576
After making so many robes,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.656
I realized that the policies
the Klan had in place

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.016
or wanted to have in place
a hundred years ago

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.400
are in place today.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.640
We have segregated schools,
neighborhoods, workplaces,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.760
and it's not the people wearing hoods
that are keeping these policies in place.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.976
My work is about
the long-term impact of slavery.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.336
We're not just dealing
with the residue of systemic racism.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.256
It's the basis
of every single thing we do.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.136
Again we have intentionally
segregated neighborhoods,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.480
workplaces and schools.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.816
We have voter suppression.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.296
We have disproportionate representation
of minorities incarcerated.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.760
We have environmental racism.
We have police brutality.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.680
I brought you a few things today.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.080
The stealth aspect of racism

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.680
is part of its power.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.096
When you're discriminated against,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.840
you can't always prove
you're being discriminated against.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.400
Racism has the power to hide,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.160
and when it hides, it's kept safe

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.480
because it blends in.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.040
I created this robe to illustrate that.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.000
The basis of capitalism
in America is slavery.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.480
Slaves were the capital in capitalism.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.416
The first Grand Wizard in 1868,
Nathan Bedford Forrest,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.560
was a Confederate soldier
and a millionaire slave trader.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.776
The wealth that was created
from chattel slavery --

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.520
that's slaves as property --
would boggle the mind.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.456
Cotton sales alone in 1860
equalled 200 million dollars.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.600
That would equal
five billion dollars today.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.680
A lot of that wealth can be seen today
through generational wealth.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.136
Oh, I forgot the other crops as well.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.280
You have indigo, rice and tobacco.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.376
In 2015, I made one robe a week
for the entire year.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.936
After making 75 robes, I had an epiphany.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.736
I have a realization
that white supremacy is there,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.336
but the biggest force
of white supremacy is not the KKK,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.960
it's the normalization of systemic racism.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.576
There was something else I realized.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.656
The robes had no more power
over me at all.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.296
But if we as a people collectively

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.136
look at these objects --

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.496
branding irons, shackles, robes --

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.496
and realize that they
are part of our history,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.960
we can find a way to where they have
no more power over us.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.256
If we look at systemic racism
and acknowledge

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.680
that it's sown into the very fabric
of who we are as a country,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.656
then we can actually do something
about the intentional segregation

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.840
in our schools,
neighborhoods and workplaces.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.056
But then and only then
can we actually address

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.736
and confront this legacy of slavery

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.176
and dismantle this ugly legacy of slavery.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.456
Thank you very much.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.960
(Applause)
