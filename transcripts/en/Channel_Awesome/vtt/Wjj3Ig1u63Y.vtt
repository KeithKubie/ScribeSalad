00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.960
Malcolm: Hey, Critic, what are you looking at?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.440
NC: My next movie review called Bloodrayne.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.660
Tamara: Pretty bad, I take it?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.680
NC: It's an Uwe Boll movie.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.540
Malcolm: Uwe Boll?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.580
Aren't his films so bad, they cause people to bash their heads in with a sledgehammer?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.480
NC: Uh-huh.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.140
Tamara: After jumping out of a plane?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.880
NC: Yup.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.540
Malcolm: After blowing up an airport?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.360
NC: That's right.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.700
Tamara: After crashing a car filled with explosives doused in gasoline while shooting a semi-automatic while going into oncoming traffic while singing I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.900
NC: Twice.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.600
Malcolm: Well, I can see why you don't wanna review it.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.660
NC: That's not the only reason. You see, whenever I do an Uwe Boll movie, there's a...

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.220
tradition.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.260
Tamara: Tradition?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.840
NC: It's a long story. I can take care of it myself.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.060
Malcolm: Hmm.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.340
NC: [sigh]

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.760
Linkara: Hello, and welcome to Atop The Fourth Wall, where bad comics burn.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.640
Sometimes, a comic comes along where you just have-

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.060
It's time.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.560
[zooms out of room]

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.700
Spoony: Of course, there was a Final Fantasy anime, and of course, it sucked.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.180
But even after the first episode-

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.700
[crash]

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.540
[running]

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.000
[crash]

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.760
NC: Christ, you guys are so dramatic.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.320
Spoony: Aah!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.800
["The Three Stooges" theme plays]

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.040
NC: Uwe Boll, the most faithful movie adapter of video games since the directing team behind Super Mario Bros.,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.300
returns with what many consider his crowning achievement of shit, Bloodrayne.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.560
Spoony: The movie based on the classic video game,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
and by based, I mean more gangbanged and mutilated than a Game of Thrones character,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.520
once again demonstrates Boll's talent

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.700
(if you can call it that)

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.880
for cutting more corners than a paper snowflake.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.440
Linkara: And if you thought Twilight was the worst disservice to vampires the world has ever known,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.500
it is.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.800
But this one's pretty bad, too.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.080
NC: So, let's not waste any time. This is-

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.140
Linkara: Ah-dah-dah, Critic!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.480
Oh, we have something we have to address first!

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.120
The elephant in the room, which of course is him!

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.680
Spoony: What did I do?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.040
Linkara: Oh, you know exactly what you did!

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.120
It happened a few years ago,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.100
the drama that was caused,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.260
everything that happened on Twitter, on Facebook, on everything like that,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.900
the betrayal of everything that we stand for!

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.940
Roll the clip!

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.960
You never went to Castleton!

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.940
[orchestral sting]

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.280
Spoony: I dropped out, OK?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.460
NC: This is Bloodrayne.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.980
Spoony: Dude, do we have to censor the lettering? Those 2 O's are looking pretty phallic.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.260
NC: Hey, if the Aliens logo can get away with an I-gina, I think we can let that pass.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.260
Linkara: I wonder if the word "special" is code for "blackmailed".

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.780
NC: I just assumed most of Billy Zane's career is blackmail.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.820
Spoony: We open up in...

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.860
Actually, I don't know. They never give a location or a time period, so that's already two of the basic five essential story elements ignored.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.860
Hell, let's just throw "why" in there, too, as I'm sure most of this film will ignore that.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.680
As we see a team of wanderers led by Michael Madsen and his lion mane mullet.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.720
The main thing I notice throughout this movie is it just seems like Michael Madsen is drunk off his ass through the entire film shoot.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.660
Seriously, he just looks so drunk and miserable, like they had to send a grip to his trailer and clean him up in a hurry,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.420
slap that ratty ass wig on his head, and maybe get a few usable takes out of him.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.240
Vladimir: "How long do you think it will take to get there?"

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.400
Vladimir: "We must go back to Brimstone."

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.040
Vladimir: "This is what I've decided to do."

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.960
Vladimir: "The monastery has been attacked and the Eye is gone."

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.480
Spoony: You can almost sense the grip just off camera with a Long Island iced tea waiting for the scene to end and him to shamble over and take another drink.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.700
Vladimir: "What do you have for us?"

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
Bartender: "I think I may have found something of interest."

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.980
Linkara: But one of them notices that the person next to him has little to reflect on.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.160
[stab]

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.280
Bartender: "Ha, I like you Brimstone people. You never make a mess of the place."

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.200
Vladimir: "What have you heard?"

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.700
Bartender: "What might only be the tall tale-"

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.920
NC: Moving on, I guess.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.300
Linkara: No one even batted an eye.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.740
Spoony: Is this like an everyday thing?

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.340
NC: When did killing a vampire become yesterday's news?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.640
Linkara: Yeah, I don't care where or when you are

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.520
(and again, neither does Uwe Boll),

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.880
but killing a vampire will never be a boring thing.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.560
Cinema Snob: Guys, guys, holy shit, you won't believe it! I just killed a vampire!

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.520
Spoony: Was it a Nazi vampire?

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.720
Cinema Snob: Well, technically, no, but-

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.380
NC: Oh, please, Cinema Snob, everybody knows that Nazi vampires are all the rage now.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.940
Linkara: Yeah, what you did is like the Bing search engine of vampire killings.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.400
Cinema Snob: But he killed a family of six!

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.600
Spoony: Go away, Cinema Snob. I can't even stand to look at you.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.360
Cinema Snob: OK, I guess I can drop his clothes off at the Goodwill or something.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.900
Spoony: You do that.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.980
NC: Noob.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.020
We then see a carnival where a half-human/half-vampire named Rayne, played by Kristanna Loken, is dragged out as a sideshow attraction.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.040
Carnival Barker: "So sensitive to water!

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.260
The very touch of it...

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.160
[Rayne screaming]

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.960
burns her skin!"

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.640
Linkara: Wait a minute, was that holy water?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.420
NC: Nope.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.980
Linkara: Then how the hell did it burn her?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.000
NC: Ohohoho, Linkara, this is the Stephenie Meyer age of vampires.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.620
You can make up anything!

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.540
If you wanna say water hurts them, even though it's not blessed, it's OK now.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.940
Spoony: Yeah, if you wanna say they in no way can fly, turn into bats, or do most of the cool things vampires do, that's OK now, too.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.360
Linkara: Oh, I see.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.100
And if people travel for miles to see one as an attraction, yet nobody turns their head if one is stabbed and violently decomposes in front of their eyes...

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.320
NC and Spoony: It's totally OK!

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.880
Linkara: Now I know!

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.100
And knowing makes it even more confusing.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.760
Spoony: But one of the other attractions, the amazing candle slicer, takes a liking to Rayne and dreams of living in a better world with her.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.000
Woman: "My uncle, he's a sailor...

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.000
and he once told me of a place where people play all day...

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.580
and the trees grow fruits in every color of the rainbow...

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.840
and the sunsets set the whole sky on fire..."

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.680
Mike Ransom: "They got tons of popcorn there...

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.720
There's cotton candy...mountains of it...

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.220
And chocolate milk...and malts..."

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.580
George: "...gonna have a field of alfalfa."

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.060
Lennie: "For the rabbits?"

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.220
Akio: "...without war and traffic accidents
for the sake of the human beings..."

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.520
Woman: "Doesn't it sound wonderful, Rayne?"

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.900
NC: We then cut to her...escaping?

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.720
Wait...when did that happen?

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.820
[Rayne screaming]

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.920
Linkara: Oh, I guess she was just dreaming.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.980
NC: Does she always dream in Photoshop smears?

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.060
[muffled screaming]

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.180
Spoony: Yeah...I'd need to be drunk to get through this movie, too.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.140
[bottle breaking]

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.540
[Rayne growling, attacker screaming in pain]

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.780
Linkara: Wait a minute...now she's back in the field?
What the hell's going on?

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.200
Is this a dream? A flashback? What?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.120
Frank Miller's time codes are more fluid than this!

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.080
Spoony: The three hunters come across the carnival where Rayne was and discovers it's burnt to the ground.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.480
Sebastian: "This is the work of a young vampire."

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.720
Vladimir: "We have work to do."

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.480
[chop]

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.540
NC: Um...thank you for chopping off the heads of our dead people...

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.840
And burning their bodies...

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.300
Woman: "She didn't mean to bite me..."

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.140
[stab]

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.640
NC: And stabbing our performers...
I'm sorry, have you been helped?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.680
Spoony: Seriously, do these people ever react to anything?

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.960
Why does nobody care that these wackos are chopping up their dead and living cast members?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.980
Linkara: Just another fad gone passé, I guess.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.640
Cinema Snob: Guys! Guys! I just decapitated 20 corpses and stabbed an injured woman through the chest!

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.260
No reason, really...I'm just kinda sick!

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.040
Spoony: Were they ninja decapitated corpses?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.380
Cinema Snob: I didn't ask what their martial arts background was.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.540
NC: Oh, Snob...

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.160
Everyone knows if there's any decapitated corpses worth talking about, it's NINJA decapitated corpses!

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.200
Linkara: Does this guy ever wake up?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.240
Spoony: They sneak without thought, man!

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.840
Cinema Snob: But I have a thirst for blood that can't be quenched!

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.400
Spoony: Away with you, Snob. You become more dated with every passing view.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.240
Cinema Snob: Why won't someone help me?!

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.020
Linkara: Meanwhile at Castle Brownfilter, we see Billy Zane dictating a letter to his daughter.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.240
Elrich: "Although we've had our differences in the past,"

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.540
"I beseech you now to put away old grudges
for the good of humanity."

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.460
"Together we will stop this madness
and bring peace to these lands."

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.220
"Your Beloved Father, etc. etc."

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.000
NC: (as Elrich) "And if you have any information about how to get this dead skunk off my head, it would be most appreciated."

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.000
Elrich: "What do you think?"

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.660
Scribe: "A very compelling argument, Master."

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.280
Elrich: "Oh, you're such a suck-up."

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.380
NC: (as Cal Hockley) Bottom line, Lovejoy...

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.380
Spoony, NC and Linkara: Find her.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.480
Spoony: His daughter in this movie is played by Michelle Rodriguez,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.500
and if you couldn't tell by her unbelievable resemblance to him,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.780
surely you could tell by her pitch-perfect, completely unmistakeable British accent.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.760
Katarin: "Will you be opening up the gates to the thralls?"

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.880
Katarin: "...grave importance..."

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.220
Katarin: "You should not travel with her."

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.460
Katarin: "We're growing weaker."

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.880
Katarin: "I seek to feel secure."

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.920
Katarin: "Be sure this message arrives."

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.220
Linkara: Ah...it's good to know those years at the Dick van Dyke School of Accents paid off.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.940
Katarin: "You'll secure the entrance until I return."

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.240
Bert: [stuttering] "I have to be moving along.
The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney."

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.000
NC: We then see Rayne enter a village where she comes across a female vampire hitting on a man...

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.380
...which clearly Rayne takes as she would find her attractive and beckons her to come forward.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.900
Spoony, NC and Linkara: Bow-chika-wow-OW!

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.960
Spoony: But a fortune-teller sees the bit-and-run, and decides for really no reason whatsoever to tell her the future.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.540
Fortuneteller: "Most believe that your kind are merely legends."

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.640
"Part vampire, part human..."

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.700
"Generally they are exterminated..."

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.080
"You've hidden well."

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.580
Linkara: (as the fortune-teller) "Yes...you've been displayed in front of dozens of people

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.160
and killed off an entire carnival singlehandedly.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.420
You're better than Solid Snake."

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.520
Fortuneteller: "There was a man."

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.220
Rayne: "Kagan?"

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.560
Fortuneteller: "Kagan's not a man. He's a vampire."

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.060
"And you are his creation."

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.660
Rayne: "He killed my mother."

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.820
Fortuneteller:
"Dhampirs are rarely a product of a happy union between a vampire and a human."

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.580
Rayne: "You lie."

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.740
NC: So you mean your vampire father killing your mother WAS a happy union?

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.520
Linkara: Boy, somebody's in denial.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.620
Spoony: (as a fortune-teller) Your father is evil...

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.200
Tamara: (as Rayne) No, he just likes to drink the blood of Catholic nuns.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.860
Spoony: He was mean to your mother...

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.780
Tamara: What man wouldn't disembowel his wife for spilling the sugar?

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.520
Spoony: You like to watch the Pawn Stars...

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.880
Tamara: THAT is a lie!

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.140
It is so obviously scripted! Who could be as stupid as Chumlee?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.000
You are a fraud! A FRAUD!

00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.980
Cinema Snob: It's getting worse...

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.280
I just bit the neck of a prostitute and no one seems to notice...

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.180
Spoony: Was it a zombie prostitute?

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.740
Cinema Snob: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE?!

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.940
Linkara: Meanwhile at Hogwarts, we see Ben Kingsley (presumably paying off an LED TV)

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.540
as Rayne's evil father.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.780
He's just been told that Rayne is off to get a magic eye...

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.120
Sure...

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.100
...which is said to help get his attention.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.480
Oh, look! A sailboat!

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.200
Kagan: "Kill her."

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.740
Kagan: "Let her find the Eye or let her try, then kill her."

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.000
NC: Something you'll notice very quickly is that Kingsley's scenes are phenomenally short.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.760
Some barely even reach a minute.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.700
They're so short, I think he literally charged by the second.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.720
You could pretty much sum up every scene with:

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.580
(as Domastir) "Are you evil?"
(as Kagan) "Yup."
(as Domastir) "Just checking."

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.940
Spoony: Rayne then makes her way to the monastery where the Eye is said to be hidden.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.360
She finds a secret location which leads her to a door guarded by an overcooked Fester Addams.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.160

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.020
Linkara: Look out! You nearly hit the camera!

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.020
Spoony: Good.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.960
NC: Is this really the best security they could get?

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.680
Just because he looks like a melting candle of Steve Austin doesn't mean his whack-a-mole method holds any water.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.540

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.000
Linkara: Next, she enters a booby-trapped room that makes Indiana Jones look like a true-life drama.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.680
[traps zooming about]

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.280

[traps zooming about again]

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.000
Spoony: Yeah...right. I think we all know what would happen to her.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.580
[buzzer]

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.160
[water running]

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.480
NC: But the dangerous water is suddenly released--yeah, that's still a thing...

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.120
...as she absorbs the power of the eye,
which makes her immune to it.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:21.620
Linkara: (booming voice) Activating the water trap for the device that makes you immune...to...the water...trap...

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.920
Spoony: Hey, here's an obvious question...

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.060
What if the person getting the eye wasn't a vampire?

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.300
I mean, okay, the whole "vampires melt in water" thing is stupid already,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.560
but what if it wasn't a vampire that got it, though?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.240
What if it was just a normal guy?

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.780
Would the water really be that big a threat?

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.540
Evil Voice: "YOU HAVE STOLEN THE FORBIDDEN TREASURE!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.800

Malcolm: Huh...that's mildly annoying...

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.280
Can you get my pits?

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:08.060
NC: But all the water, all the buzzsaws and all the giant guards are no match for their final defense...

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.760
A polite man who nicely asks her to come with him!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.540

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.500
Spoony: [muffled] Aah...

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.600
Monk: "It seems that you absorbed the eye."

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.640
Rayne: "Why do you protect it?"

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.100
Monk: "Because the eye holds powers."

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.020
"Why do you think water no longer burns you?"

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.100
Linkara: Still wondering how it hurts her to begin with.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.280
The human body is 60% water, and blood is 80% water.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.700
Now how the hell--
NC: No-no-no-no...Linkara, Linkara...

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.220
You're thinking too hard about it. Just let it go...

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.840
Linkara: B-but it just doesn't add up!
Spoony: Linkara, just keep telling yourself...

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.160
"It's Uwe Boll", man...

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.780
"It's Uwe Boll"...

[softly] Crap...

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.540
Monk: "They all belong to a long-dead vampire named Belial."

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.660
"He discovered a method to defy those elements that destroy vampires."

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.860
NC: So it's explained that the eye and the other three separated body parts belonged to a vampire who tried to perfect their weaknesses,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.760
and that if the body parts were all brought back together, it would make the most powerful vampire ever.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.400
Linkara: One, if he managed to pull this off,
then how did he ever die?

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.280
Two, if they're so powerful, why didn't they just destroy the damn things to begin with?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.700
This movie is driving me crazy!

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.420
Spoony: Come on, Linkara. You gotta calm down, alright? Remember what we talked about...

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.260
Uwe Boll...

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.280
In and out...Uwe Boll...that's it--

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.520
Linkara: ADAMANTIUM RAAAAAAGE!!!

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.380
[punch]

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.280
Spoony: [holding nose] Oh God...

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.440
Linkara: Ahhh...that did make me feel better, actually.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.420
Spoony: My sinus cavities...

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:49.340
Spoony: But Kagan's men attack in probably the bloodiest, and yet somehow not actually gory, fight scene in movie history.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.400
The makeup is so fake and poorly photographed that it's barely worth the R rating.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.780
Look at this guy. He's cut in half, but you can clearly see his legs standing up.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.020
NC: Well, you don't know.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.600
Maybe Wallace made him a pair of extra legs,
like in The Wrong Trousers.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.360
Linkara: Half of these guys don't even look that pained to be stabbed.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.000
They just look kind of annoyed, like they've been in the makeup chair for eight hours and just want this crap off.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.200
NC: "Ow, I guess."

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.340

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.220
Spoony: (as Domastir) "Perhaps KILLING YOU will get you to answer my question!"

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.420
NC: Rayne gets knocked out, but that's of little consequence as we have more important things to focus on.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.120
Like, hey...it's been ten minutes.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.780
Time for another five-second Ben Kingsley cameo!

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.060
Kagan: "Come closer."

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.500
"Don't be afraid."

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.140
Linkara: Yeah. All he's gonna do is rip open your neck and feed on your insides.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.740
I can see why Rayne thought her mother and him had a happy union.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.180
Spoony: And just when you think this is the most pointless celebrity cameo,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.520

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.380
Spoony: I'm speaking hypothetically.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.200

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.580

Not that it tried that hard to begin with...

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.580
NC: So Rayne's gonna be sacrificed with the talismans

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.840
and make Kagan the strongest vampire in the world,
or some shit like that...

Linkara: (as Kagan) "How dare you strike my daughter, who I am about to kill!"

Spoony: So the guy just walks in there looking for the magic disappearing prisoner, and of course, he gets knocked out.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.120
This delivery is so bad, I can't even tell if it's done intentionally badly or not. It's amazing.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.960
How could anyone possibly believe a lie so poorly delivered?

"I don't know how I could have gotten so hungry."

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.260
Linkara: Sure enough, the two guys that got captured taking on all the castle guards

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.540
suddenly have no problem taking on the exact same guards again.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.120

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.120
Linkara: Well, I guess Madsen felt the same.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.820

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.920
If the Syfy Movie of the Week is too good for you,
then Uwe Boll is the one for you.

Everybody else knows that his movies bite it, and this one is no exception.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:58.480
Linkara: His characters are flat, his writing ridiculous, and his stories never make any semblance of sense.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.060
Spoony: And the fact that it has little to nothing to do with the original source material makes it one of the most laughably bad adaptations ever.
