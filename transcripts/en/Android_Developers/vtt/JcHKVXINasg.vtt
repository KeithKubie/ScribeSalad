00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.410
HANS DANNEELS: We have
developed a platform

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
to build wearable health
solutions that can track people

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.100
at home and do things that
they usually do in hospitals,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.626
or they're not done at all.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:20.250
So what you have
today is, on one hand,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.860
you have consumer devices that
are very comfortable but not

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.060
very accurate.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450
On the other hand, we
have medical devices that

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.850
are not comfortable at all.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.660
And so what we do at
Byteflies, we combine both.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.040
HANS DE CLERCQ: Our vision
is to enable wearable health.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.415
We want to make sure that
everybody can use our platform,

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.620
and our dream is that
every medical wearable

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.140
will be developed on
the Byteflies platform.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.940
To make that possible,
we collaborate

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.467
with Android Things,
because Android already

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.300
built a whole community
for app development,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.097
and they made possible
that everybody

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:50.430
that wants to build an app
and bring it to the community

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.462
can do so.

00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:52.920
HANS DANNEELS: From
the start, when

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.960
we started building
a Byteflies platform,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.530
we didn't want to
reinvent the wheel.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.620
So for us, we want
to focus really

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.600
on the things where we
can make a difference

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.050
and tap into existing solutions,
existing technologies,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.140
existing platforms that do
it much better than we do.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.020
And that's a very important
part of using Android Things is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.640
that we can tap into
the infrastructure

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.480
but also the stack
that is already set up.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.180
We're talking about securities,
talking about privacy,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.950
talking about
over-the-air updates

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.660
that we don't have
to do ourselves

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.389
as well, because
that's something

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.180
where Google and Android
and Android Things

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.270
is very strong at.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.520
And then we can focus on
accurate data collection,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.620
the seamless collection
to the cloud,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.471
and signal processing,
which are our strong points.

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:35.970
Then we don't have
to worry too much

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.670
about the other parts,
while still knowing that we

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.490
get a very good quality there.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.550
We integrated Android Things
in our docking stations, which

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.590
you can consider as a
small computer that sits

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.080
at the bedside of the patient.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.940
So they basically wear the
sensor for the full day

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.040
or for longer periods,
and at a given moment,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.990
they plug it into
a docking station.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.390
And because of Android Things,
it connects to the cloud

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.574
easily.

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:00.990
HANS DE CLERCQ: Every button
that a patient needs to press

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.130
is one too many.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160
We do automatic updates.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.520
Patient doesn't even know it.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.920
We can deploy as many
units as we want.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380
We have the whole Google Cloud.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.570
We have the whole TensorFlow
technology that is all

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.190
embedded in Android Things.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.370
So it's a very strong
framework where we can just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.140
piggyback the tools that we want
and build our own technology

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.360
on top of that.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.310
Sometimes you want to develop
everything from scratch,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.390
and that's actually the
worst thing you can do.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.940
HANS DANNEELS: We designed
our platform in a way

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.900
that we handle
the data with care

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.540
and that it's HIPAA compliant.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.580
But because of Android
Things, we better

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.480
control to make sure that
security and privacy is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.300
controlled from the moment
it leaves the device

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.570
and it leaves the patient
until it gets to the cloud,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.940
and until it's being
processed there.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.010
We have the vision that
in five to 10 years,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.350
there's going to be an
abundance of health wearables

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.920
that are going to
change health care,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.280
and are going to change the
health of everyone around.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.320
We want that these health
wearables are built

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.940
on the Byteflies platform.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.440
That's going to
allow to transform

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.590
health care from
being 99% curing today

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.600
to hopefully 99% prevention.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.050
