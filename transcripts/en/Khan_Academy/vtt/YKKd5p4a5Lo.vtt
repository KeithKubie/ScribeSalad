00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:01.456
- [Voiceover] I want to talk about

00:00:01.456 --> 00:00:03.933
a new example of an inductor circuit,

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.446
and we have one shown here,

00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:08.618
where this inductor is now
controlled by a switch.

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:12.814
This is a push button switch
that we move in and out,

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.126
and this metal plate here
will touch these two contacts

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:18.864
and complete this circuit here.

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:21.545
This is a lot like the
circuit we looked at before

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.112
without the switch,
where the voltage source

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.322
had a pulse going up and down.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:28.475
This circuit has a real
interesting side effect

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.940
when this switch opens up.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.083
So, let me give you a
couple of examples first,

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:35.140
some practical examples of where

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.367
this kind of an inductor will appear,

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:41.083
connected to a voltage source
and controlled by a switch.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:42.511
And there's a couple of examples.

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:45.261
One of them is called a solenoid.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:51.050
And a solenoid is a coil of wire

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.800
that looks like this,

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.916
and has a metal

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:59.305
rod going through it.

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.950
When you put a pulse of current into this,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.533
what happens is, the rod moves.

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.912
The rod will move back and forth,

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:11.089
so this is a way, for
instance, a doorbell.

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:14.339
A doorbell has this kind of a actuator.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.197
Another kind of device
that has an inductor in it,

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:23.614
or a coil, is called a relay.

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:28.373
And that one, again, has a coil like this.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:31.802
And,

00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:36.657
these are all forms of an electromagnet,

00:01:36.657 --> 00:01:39.928
and this one actually has a switch,

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:42.269
some sort of a piece of metal

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.289
that will move back and forth.

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.211
When the coil is energized,

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:50.667
this piece of metal will
actually tip over here,

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.402
and when the current's stopped,

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:55.091
it'll move back to its original state.

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:59.319
So, for example, if there
is a connection point here,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.071
and a connection point here,

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.205
this piece of metal will go

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:05.441
from making a short across there,

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:06.597
and move away,

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:09.976
and open and close this bigger switch.

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:13.059
So, a relay is some sort of a switch.

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.148
And you might find this in a car,

00:02:16.148 --> 00:02:19.379
where this relay is controlling, like,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.276
the windshield wipers of a car,

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:22.655
where the current for the windshield wiper

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:24.085
goes through this switch,

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:26.429
and there's a smaller current over here

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.374
that pulls this switch open and closed

00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:32.541
to start and stop the
windshield wipers or the motor.

00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:36.516
And that's just two
examples of where inductors,

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:41.051
or windings of wire can show
up in real applications,

00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:42.390
and there's some fairly large currents

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.541
that flow through these windings.

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:45.512
So, we want to look what happens

00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:47.338
when we switch this current on and off,

00:02:47.338 --> 00:02:49.754
and this is the example
circuit that we'll use.

00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:53.342
So, won't assume we have a
inductor of 10 milliHenries,

00:02:53.342 --> 00:02:54.252
and what we're gonna do is

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:56.498
we're gonna push this
push button switch down

00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:00.665
and connect it up, and
then we're gonna let it go.

00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:06.472
And we're gonna look at a couple
of different voltages here.

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:10.683
This is gonna be, we'll
call this voltage V,

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:14.606
and that's gonna be measured
with respect to ground.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:17.071
And then, there's another voltage here

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:20.167
that's interesting too, which is VL,

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.674
and that's the voltage
across the inductor.

00:03:22.674 --> 00:03:26.841
So V plus VL is equal to
three volts, all the time.

00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:29.516
And now, we look at what happens

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:31.506
when we push the button down,

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:32.839
and then, after that,
we'll look at what happens

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:34.697
when we let go of the button.

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:36.112
Something interesting's gonna happen

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.355
when we let go of this button.

00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:39.942
So, as we look at our circuit here,

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:42.203
we see there's an open circuit,

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:45.370
so there's no current flowing in here.

00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:49.591
That means I equals zero.

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.999
We'll call that I zero because
it's the initial current

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.082
when we close our switch.

00:03:57.318 --> 00:03:58.959
So now, let's close our switch.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.959
We'll do that like this.

00:04:05.372 --> 00:04:09.387
And we just closed our switch
at time, T equals zero.

00:04:09.387 --> 00:04:10.433
And let's look at what happens.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.200
All of a sudden now,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.022
our inductor has a voltage across it,

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.681
and it's a voltage of,

00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:19.598
this node is at three volts,

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.308
this node is at zero volts,

00:04:21.308 --> 00:04:25.343
so all of a sudden, we have
three volts across our inductor.

00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:28.536
So, let's use the integral
form of the inductor equation

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:32.817
to solve for the current
that's gonna happen here.

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:34.400
I equals one over L

00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:39.071
times the integral from zero to T

00:04:40.742 --> 00:04:41.575
of

00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:43.511
V d Tau,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.070
plus I zero.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.291
Let's fill in what we know.

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.124
I equals one over 10 milliHenries,

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.341
and V is a constant, V is
a constant three volts,

00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.341
times three,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.223
and it's the integral of d Tau,

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.169
from zero to T,

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.752
and I zero is zero.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.934
And then, we get the final form,

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:21.684
which is I equals three
over 10 milliHenries,

00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:27.548
times the integral from
zero to T of d Tau,

00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:28.381
is just T,

00:05:30.692 --> 00:05:31.525
and that's the answer,

00:05:31.525 --> 00:05:33.557
so what we have here,
just like we did before,

00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:36.622
when we had the switching power supply,

00:05:36.622 --> 00:05:39.282
just like we had before,
we're gonna get a current

00:05:39.282 --> 00:05:42.470
that has a ramp that looks like that.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.735
The slope of that is three

00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.485
over 10 milliHenries,

00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:49.403
which equals

00:05:51.387 --> 00:05:53.054
300 amps per second,

00:05:57.063 --> 00:05:58.436
so, oh my goodness.

00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:00.427
This current is going up really fast.

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:02.769
That's the slope of that
current right there.

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:05.555
This is going up really fast,
and that's what it does.

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:06.465
Now, in a real circuit,

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:09.304
there'll be real resistances in here,

00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:11.072
but it uh, and so,

00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:12.863
there'll be a limit to
the amount of current

00:06:12.863 --> 00:06:14.964
that will be determined by the resistor,

00:06:14.964 --> 00:06:17.017
but for the purposes of showing you

00:06:17.017 --> 00:06:20.116
just how this inductor equation works,

00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:21.882
that's the kind of slope you would see

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:25.344
at the initial closing of the switch.

00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.348
Okay, I'm gonna clean off the screen here,

00:06:27.348 --> 00:06:29.848
so I can keep my same circuit.

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:35.421
And now, we're gonna
look at what happens here

00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:36.995
when we open this switch.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:38.912
Let me open the switch.

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.515
And now, we've opened our switch back up.

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:52.932
It went that way.

00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:56.748
All right, so,

00:06:56.748 --> 00:06:58.998
we have an initial current,

00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.459
and it's gonna be some value,

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:05.303
depending on how long
we held the switch down,

00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:08.368
so it's gonna be some current,

00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:10.362
and that's flowing in the inductor.

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:12.358
Now, let's look at what happens

00:07:12.358 --> 00:07:14.774
when we open the switch,
and all of a sudden,

00:07:14.774 --> 00:07:17.774
I goes directly and sharply to zero.

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:21.333
That's what the switch does.

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:23.371
When we open this switch contact,

00:07:23.371 --> 00:07:25.003
one moment it's touching,

00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:27.653
and the other moment, it's not touching.

00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:32.322
So, if we look at, what's
delta I, or what's dI.

00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:34.806
It's the ending current

00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:37.806
minus the starting current, minus I.

00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:41.300
And if we look at what's
the time involved.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.629
What's the change in time
involved in opening the switch?

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.009
Well, it's something like zero.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.072
The switch was closed, then it was open,

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:52.081
and that's how much, that took,

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:54.550
let's say that took zero time to happen.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.972
Now, here's something that
happens with inductors

00:07:56.972 --> 00:07:58.972
that is kind of strange.

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:02.473
Let's calculate the
voltage on the inductor

00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:04.012
right when this happens.

00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:06.322
And we know that V equals

00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:07.155
L times dI

00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:10.129
dT.

00:08:11.348 --> 00:08:12.520
And plug in some numbers here,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.270
so we have V equals L

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.895
times what, dI,

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:17.812
is minus I,

00:08:19.783 --> 00:08:20.910
over what?

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.743
Over zero.

00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:24.408
And that equals what?

00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:26.908
That equals negative infinity.

00:08:30.306 --> 00:08:31.607
What the heck is going on here?

00:08:31.607 --> 00:08:33.024
Is that possible?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.597
No, it's not.

00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:39.129
Well lets, okay, let's take a second.

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:42.635
Let's say this switch
didn't open in zero time.

00:08:42.635 --> 00:08:44.077
Let's say this switch,

00:08:44.077 --> 00:08:45.494
let's say dT was,

00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:49.848
let's say it was one nanosecond.

00:08:49.848 --> 00:08:53.164
Let's give it some time to open up.

00:08:53.164 --> 00:08:54.526
All right.

00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:55.607
Maybe that'll save us.

00:08:55.607 --> 00:08:57.045
Maybe that'll make more sense.

00:08:57.045 --> 00:08:57.878
Okay, let's do that.

00:08:57.878 --> 00:08:58.711
Let's go

00:08:58.711 --> 00:08:59.544
V equals L

00:09:01.585 --> 00:09:03.888
times dI dT, and dI,

00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:06.544
we decided was minus I

00:09:06.544 --> 00:09:10.820
over, it took one nanosecond
to open the switch.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.903
One nanosecond is one
times 10 to the minus nine.

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.121
Okay, so what is that equal to?

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:20.288
That equals L,

00:09:21.862 --> 00:09:23.362
negative L times I

00:09:24.602 --> 00:09:26.685
times 10 to the holy cow.

00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:32.083
10 to the plus nine.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.594
Okay, let's plug in some real values

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:36.677
and see what we get here.

00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:42.096
Let's say V equals

00:09:42.096 --> 00:09:44.763
let's say L was 10 milliHenries,

00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:48.083
and let's say I was 10 milliamps

00:09:48.083 --> 00:09:50.727
flowing down through the,

00:09:50.727 --> 00:09:53.477
so delta I is minus 10 milliamps,

00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:56.742
and

00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.158
the time involved is

00:09:59.158 --> 00:10:01.575
10 to the minus nine seconds.

00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:05.848
What does that work out to?

00:10:05.848 --> 00:10:08.479
10 milliHenries, that's minus three

00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:09.812
and minus three,

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:12.814
so it's gonna be 100,

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:19.900
minus three minus three is
minus six over minus nine

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.733
times 10 to the third.

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:25.247
Okay, that is...

00:10:30.348 --> 00:10:32.527
And there's a minus sign here.

00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:33.953
This says that V,

00:10:33.953 --> 00:10:35.791
this point right here,

00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:38.335
or the voltage across the inductor.

00:10:38.335 --> 00:10:41.174
Our calculation just
said it's gonna be 100,

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:43.032
minus 100,000 volts.

00:10:43.032 --> 00:10:45.500
Now, minus 100,000 volts means

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.530
that the negative terminal

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.280
is 100,000 volts above
the positive terminal,

00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:56.282
so this voltage V is
actually at 100,003 volts.

00:10:57.742 --> 00:10:59.075
How can this be?

00:11:00.172 --> 00:11:01.500
This is a puzzle about inductors

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.315
that we actually have to solve by

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:05.406
actually looking right up close

00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:08.514
at what's going on here, right
in this switch area here.

00:11:08.514 --> 00:11:11.262
So, this is where reality
comes in and saves us

00:11:11.262 --> 00:11:12.702
from our, our,

00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:14.692
the crazy results we're getting from our

00:11:14.692 --> 00:11:16.442
ideal equations here.

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:20.317
So, let's pretend, here's the uh,

00:11:20.317 --> 00:11:22.622
here's the terminal of
the switch, right here.

00:11:22.622 --> 00:11:25.180
Let's do a blow up, and here's,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.263
here's that switch plate.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.137
As soon as this switch moves away,

00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:35.905
there's an air gap created here.

00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:39.809
In our ideal world, this air
gap was a perfect insulator,

00:11:39.809 --> 00:11:41.173
but what's gonna happen,

00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:43.137
because of these extreme numbers here,

00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:44.872
because of this is happening,

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:47.452
this air gap is actually
not an ideal conductor,

00:11:47.452 --> 00:11:48.714
and what's gonna happen

00:11:48.714 --> 00:11:51.024
is we're gonna get a bright spark

00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:52.941
goes right across here.

00:11:56.762 --> 00:11:58.512
This really happens in real life.

00:11:58.512 --> 00:12:00.415
There is actually, when you open a switch,

00:12:00.415 --> 00:12:03.098
there can be a little
spark that goes between,

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.180
and that gives this equation here,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.623
this dI dT,

00:12:06.623 --> 00:12:09.248
enough time to release that energy

00:12:09.248 --> 00:12:11.128
and that current from the inductor

00:12:11.128 --> 00:12:15.000
continues to flow and go
over into this switch.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.039
That current will flow, and it does it

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:19.346
by breaking down the air molecules,

00:12:19.346 --> 00:12:20.208
and when you do that,

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:22.762
that voltage there, for air.

00:12:22.762 --> 00:12:24.179
If this gap here,

00:12:25.398 --> 00:12:27.898
if this gap is one millimeter,

00:12:29.326 --> 00:12:31.659
for air, that's 3,000 volts.

00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:37.337
3,000 volts will cause
that spark to happen there.

00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:39.187
So, this is what actually happens,

00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:40.738
and you can build switches

00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:43.646
that will take this spark
and work for many years,

00:12:43.646 --> 00:12:47.813
but it's not always a good
idea to let this happen.
