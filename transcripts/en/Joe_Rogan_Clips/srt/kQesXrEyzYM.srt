1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,890
The Joe Rogan experience to criminalize
psychedelic about what we did.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,390
It came through.
Oh my God.

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:09,540
I thought you said it didn't pass this
morning and said it didn't. 15 months ago.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,880
Holy Shit.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Denver became the first city in
the u s to decriminalize marijuana.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,190
Wow. Powerful Denver. Wow.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
Holy Shit Man.
It passed.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,790
Approved, measured, decriminalized
psychedelic mushrooms.
Congratulations. Amazing.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,440
How did we think that you, Jamie? I
better information you son of a bitch.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,350
They were staying up all
night for some reason.

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,540
They did say son of a bitch.

12
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,720
Jamie working with the CIA still
on official apparently though,

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,370
as opposed to it on Wednesday afternoon,

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,220
ended up pulling 51 pulled
ahead this afternoon.

15
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,400
That's why this morning it wasn't
a head and then they still,

16
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,360
they're still counting votes.

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,240
Provision the provision prohibit the city
government for using any resources to

18
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,820
impose criminal penalties against adults
over 21 years of age or personally his

19
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,140
possession. A second psilocybin. Hey,

20
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,270
you don't have to talk with you
and the end of a commercial.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,910
What do you want to do? You have to get
it all out just in case. No, no, no.

22
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,770
This is not a disclaimer.
Something hits us and kills.

23
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,600
Nobody knows what the fuck
you just said. Yeah, they do.

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,930
Why are we going where the
mushrooms are illegal? Oh,

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
too many people who move into Denver.
Man. Too many people means a lot of space.

26
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,600
Who many people in move with that?
Look it up.

27
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,430
Look it up about Denver's
problem with our infrastructure.

28
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,860
They're hating how many people are
coming into their city. Listen Bro,

29
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,980
you moved to evergreen.
Live in the mountains like a savage.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,740
I'll move to bracket
[inaudible] album to breakfast.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,520
How about asking too many rooms? Coke?
Breckenridge is nice. I like brick.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,200
Don't you want to see y'all girls yell
at or boyfriends scream out in this treat

33
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,140
with naked

34
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,850
mcass we need more money.

35
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,760
Is the mushroom legal Allity is that
going to be like a doctor thing?

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,690
Are they gonna like no, it's
deep criminal officer. Right? As

37
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,150
does is that you don't go.
You Go, you don't go to jail,

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,700
but you can't sell it legally.
It's very squirrely,

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,300
but it's what it is is step
one and that's what we need.

40
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,860
We needed step one and then it's also
on the ballot in California soon.

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,120
And when it's on the ballot in California,
soon it has a likelier chance here.

42
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:07,140
I think that even in Denver and more
so now the real problem is people don't

43
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:11,520
understand what it is. Right? And
they think it's just like, oh my God,

44
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,560
these kids are going to do,
mushrooms are going to drive off cliffs.

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,590
That's what people worry about.
You can do more testing now. Right?

46
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:19,140
Is that sort of what it helps
while they've done some tests,

47
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,640
Johns Hopkins University had some pretty
extensive testing that they did that

48
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,050
showed,
um,

49
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,120
real positive results with people
that had terminal illnesses where it

50
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:33,990
alleviated the worry of death.
And um,

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,030
there's some other studies
that had been run on it,

52
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:41,031
but there's so far no one
has ever instituted in the
United States at least like

53
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,580
a real thorough,

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,581
comprehensive clinic where you can go and
they can treat you if you have alcohol

55
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,810
addiction,
Ptsd,

56
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,940
there's a lot of different things
they could treat with psilocybin.

57
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,620
And it's been illegal
because it's a schedule one
substance. So all these people,

58
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,850
it's one of the best
things on earth to fix,

59
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,220
like mental barriers and
problems that you have,

60
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:07,480
especially if it was done in a controlled
clinical environment by people you

61
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:11,200
trusted and you felt safe. And that's
what a shaman is supposed to be, right?

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,470
What a shaman is supposed to be as someone
who provides you with the psychedelic

63
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,540
substances in a controlled
state where they,

64
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,230
they let you be in a good state of
mind set and setting is always very,

65
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,960
very important.
And if we could do that,

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,410
I mean I really think we have a real
good chance of turning a lot of people

67
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,770
around. People that are
addicted to things, people
with psychological problems,

68
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,340
people who can't see themselves should
have a lot of, a lot of different issues.

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,410
And it's one of the best tools for that.
But like every tool, it could be abused,

70
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,580
but the problem is not the tool.
The problem is abuse,

71
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:47,140
whether it's with alcohol or pills
or food or any of these things.

72
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,170
We're talking about sex. People
can abuse anything, of course,

73
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,290
but doesn't mean that silicide and is in
an amazing compound that literally can

74
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,920
change humanity. It can. Yeah.

75
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,100
Yeah. It has. It has, and
there's so many other,

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
there's so many other things
that we don't even know.

77
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,550
We haven't even tapped
into the possibilities.

78
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,710
That's the other thing was when you
limit yourself on the possibilities,

79
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,830
it's like, well, we don't, how do we
know? How do you know what it's gonna do?

80
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,310
What if the chip releases
mushroom choose every 15 minutes?

81
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:16,860
A little microdose cheat? Just
a little micro dose it. No.

82
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,610
It feels your levels when
you start getting angry.

83
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:19,990
When the guy cuts me off and I'm like,
fuck,

84
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,190
aw, releases and I'm
like, a little bit of God.
