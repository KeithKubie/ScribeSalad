Hellosies.
I'm Rich Fulcher.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.431 align:end position:100%
And today we're gonna
talk about

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.833
how Teddy Roosevelt's children

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.136 align:start size:50% position:50%
saved Christmas.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.672 align:start size:38% position:63%
Pretty cool.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.478
<i> It was 1901.
 Teddy Roosevelt was just</i>

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.416
<i> elected the Prize-ident
 of the United Status.</i>

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.151
- [chuckles]

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.487
<i> His motto was,
 "Speak softly,</i>

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.456
<i> and carry a big dick."</i>

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.359
<i> And Theodore Roosevelt
 is a huge conservationist.</i>

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.628
You don't wanna know.
- Actually, I do.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.263 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Okay.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.432
<i> Basically,
 in his lifetime,</i>

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.534
<i> he had five national parks.</i>

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:13.272
<i> 18 national monuments.
 150 national forests.</i>

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.709 align:end position:100%
He loved those trees
so goddamn much.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:20.379
<i> And he thought,
 I don't want any tree</i>

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:24.317
<i> cut down.
 I don't want Christmas trees</i>

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.520
<i> in my White House.</i>

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:31.491
<i> So Theodore--Teddy--was
 a family man.</i>

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.527
<i> He had six kids,
 and he loved his kids.</i>

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.232
<i> Hi, I'm Archie.
 Hey, I'm Quentin.</i>

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:43.569
<i> Hi, I'm Kermit.
 I'm Alice.</i>

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.373
<i> I'm Theodore, Jr.
 I'm Ethel.</i>

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.909 align:end position:100%
So he had all these kids,
and he was just brimming

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.644 align:start size:56% position:44%
with, like, semen.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:54.580
<i> [mimics farting sounds]</i>

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:58.784
- What was that?
- That's a mouth fart.

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:00.720
- That was a mouth fart?
- Yeah.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.854 align:start size:59% position:41%
Oh, what--so, okay.

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:04.557
<i> So, it's Christmas time.</i>

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.561
<i> Roosevelt would dress up as
 Santa for Christmas,</i>

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:11.531
<i> and he would say,
 Ho, ho, ho, sit on my lap</i>

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.367
<i> and tell me what you want
 for Christmas.</i>

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.871
<i> So Archie said to his dad,
 Papa-pea,</i>

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:22.241
<i> can I have a tree
 this year?</i>

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.911
<i> And dad says,
 No.</i>

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:28.347
<i> I do not want
 a Christmas tree here.</i>

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.683
<i> 'Cause it'll ruin our forests.</i>

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.451
<i> This is the thing.</i>

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start size:25% position:75%
He--He--

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.289 align:start size:22% position:78%
[burps]

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.625
<i> So the kids hatched a plan.
 Archie said to Quentin,</i>

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:44.330
<i> We need to cut down a tree
 and show daddy that</i>

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:47.733
<i> Christmas trees
 are the way to go</i>

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.602
<i> for everyone.</i>

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:53.272
<i> Let's go to the edge of the
 c--White House lawn</i>

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:57.543
<i> and chop the [bleep]
 Christmas tree.</i>

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:01.447
<i> So, uh, sure enough,
 they cut down the tree.</i>

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.884
<i> And they get the help of the
 White House electrician,</i>

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.919
<i> whatever that is.</i>

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.621
<i> - They'll turn the lights on,
 if they go off.</i>

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:11.457
<i> - Ooh, you're good at this.</i>

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.693 align:start size:72% position:28%
Well, so--uh, so Archie

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:16.362
<i> asked the electrician.
 The electrician said,</i>

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:19.765
<i> Sure, I can do it.
 I can put lights on the tree.</i>

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:24.503
<i> I'm a goddamn electrician.
 That's what I do.</i>

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:27.340
<i> And so, he put the lights
 on the tree.</i>

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.876
<i> And then they put the tree
 in the seamstress' closet.</i>

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.579 align:end position:100%
[coughs]
The tree's in the closet,

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:35.581 size:88% position:56%
and the mother's [stammers].

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:38.517
<i> And they said,
 We're gonna make papa</i>

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.686
<i> believe in the trees.</i>

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.890
<i> The trees make you believes.</i>

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.630
<i> The trees make you sneeze
 below the knees.</i>

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.731
<i> - [chuckles]</i>

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:56.669 align:start size:63% position:38%

<i> Hey, whoa, this is kinda,

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.771

<i> Theodore Roosevelt said,
 Hey, come on over</i>

<i> [burps]</i>

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.694
<i> If you chop down
 the biggest trees,</i>

<i> it leaves sunlight for
 the smaller ones to grow,</i>

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:35.134

 shit all over the place.</i>

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.636
<i> Well, [bleep] me.
