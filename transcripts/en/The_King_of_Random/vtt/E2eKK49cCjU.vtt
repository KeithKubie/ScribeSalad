00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.090
I just made a Hot Wire "Styro- Slicer" that traces out
styrofoam shapes with an impressive amount

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.850
of precision and control. It’ll create 3D
puzzles for entertainment and decoration,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.870
or help you craft a custom styrofoam sword,
for cosplay or metal casting. The wire blade

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.960
can be set to any angle you need, and perhaps
the best part is, the whole thing compacts

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.720
together easily, for quick and clutter-free
storage.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.960
Styrofoam usually isn’t the nicest stuff
to work with.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.039
If you snap or break a piece in half, it’ll
spew a mess of tiny, styrofoam balls that

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.710
stick to just about everything. And even if
you try cutting it with scissors or a knife,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.059
the pieces still come out jagged, and look
terrible.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.199
But not with the “Styro-Slicer”.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.879
There’s a much easier way to form your foam,
and all it takes is a simple hot wire foam

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.139
cutter, like this one I made out of low cost,
and easily accessible materials.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.449
The heart of the “Styro-Slicer” is a thin,
stainless steel wire that uses electricity

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.359
to slice through any thickness of styrofoam
you want.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.269
As the wire gets hot, it melts through the foam
pieces like a hot knife through butter, leaving

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.120
some of the cleanest and smoothest edges,
imaginable.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.680
The little spring at the top is there to help
keep constant tension on the wire as it expands

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.070
and contracts with the heat, and looking at
the side of this improvised “foam factory”

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.970
you’ll see a red switch, and an adjustable
dial.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.140
The dial is for fine-tuning the temperature
of the wire so it’ll slice faster, or slower,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.940
depending on your skill level and the kind
of material you’re working with.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.730
And the red switch boosts the system from
normal power, to "overdrive". I’ll show you

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.880
what that does in just a minute.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.470
Now watch what happens if you try gluing something
like a custom paper template to the top of

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.560
the styrofoam, and setting it to about 30%
power.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.320
You can see the foam cutter still glides easily
through the styrofoam, but notice how it doesn’t

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.900
actually go through the paper.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.930
This means you now have the option, of using
your own custom paper shapes as cutting guides,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.340
to produce really clean and professional looking
props.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.160
I went ahead and made some custom 3D weapon
art, like a styrofoam handgun, as well as

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.460
an arsenal of “Mini Master Swords”, which
I’ll show you how to make yourself, in two other project videos.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.900
The base of the Styro-Slicer is an 18” work
surface that gives plenty of room for most of your hobby projects.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.820
And if you attach a straight-edge to one of
the sides you’ll be able to slice and dice

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.100
perfectly clean lines, like never before.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.039
Now "normal" power is the mode you’ll typically
use for cutting foam and tracing templates,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.920
but if you need a little extra boost, simply
flip the red switch to "overdrive".

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.700
This instantly gives you enough power to cut
through balsa wood, and burn through paint

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.060
sticks, like the kind you get from the hardware
store.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.320
I’m not really sure why you’d need
that much power, but the option is there, just in case you do.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.420
And check this out. If you have to quickly
step away from your project, just click the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.620
button on the side to instantly kill the power
and stop the cutting.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.950
Withn 3-5 seconds, the wire’ll be cool enough
that you can actually touch it by hand. And

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.100
when you’re ready to get going again, just
press the button, to pickup exactly where you left off.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.030
But that’s not all.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.920
The "Styro-Slicer" is designed to shape foam
blocks up to 8 inches tall, and the Slicer

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.680
arm can be adjusted to make beveled cuts as
well. Up to 45º on the work surface, and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.840
over 180º when used by itself.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.320
What’s really cool is if you position the
arms horizontally over the base, you can actually

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.990
cut styro-slices, as thin as you can imagine.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.980
And if that’s not enough, simply unscrew
the wing-nut at the back of the support, and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.480
you’ll see the entire wire saw comes right
off, giving you the option to cut larger styrofoam blocks free-handed.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.960
But wait, there’s more.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.790
If you ever lose power, or want to operate
off the grid, simply unclip the backup battery

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.480
cable, and hook the clips, to the terminals
of a 6v lantern battery, and you’re back in business.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.660
These cheap and easy modifications make it
so you can take your “foam factory” just about anywhere.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.380
And if your lantern battery dies on you, rather
than throwing it out, try hacking it open

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.180
so you can repurpose the carbon rods inside,
to build a “Mini Arc Furnace”, like the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.700
one I showed you in a previous project.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.380
The Styro-Slicer is made completely out of
low-cost and easily accessible materials,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.770
and can take as little as 5 seconds to set
up and start working.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.670
It’s also designed to snap back together
ergonomically, so it takes up as little space

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.040
as possible, when you’re finished, and ready
to put it away.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.420
Well now you know how to glide through styrofoam
with ease, and create amazing styrofoam creations on a budget.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.140
You’ll just need to build your own “Styro-Slicer”
first, but I’ll show you how to do that,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.080
in another project video.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.820
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
