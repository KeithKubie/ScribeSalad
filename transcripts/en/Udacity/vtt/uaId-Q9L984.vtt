00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.020
What in the world are you doing?

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.440
&gt;&gt; Oh I, I'm just pretending I'm inside a cell, and I just transcribed a gene,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.800
and so I've got the RNA and now I'm cutting and pasting all the exons together.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.470
&gt;&gt; But how do you know where to cut?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, well that's easy. Because the exons and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.330
introns are colored here, the exons are in purple.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.290
And the entrons are in orange and I am

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.160
essentially taking and cutting out the entrons and keeping

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.380
the xons.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.770
&gt;&gt; So we keep the xons, but we get rid of the entrons?

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.310
&gt;&gt; Exactly and what sounds a kind of intuitive, but we keep

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.780
the xons and we cut out the entrons. So that's why the mRNA's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.410
shorter than the gene, because we're actually getting rid of some of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.750
the gene sequence. Except for the ones that only have one exon, right?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.370
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Now, most genes have more than one exon. There are

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.130
a few that have only one. But those genes that have more than one exon

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.660
have to cut out all those introns,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.060
in a process called splicing. That's what splicing

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.050
is, we cut out, splice out, the introns, and we splice together All the exons.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.190
&gt;&gt; Can we infer anything about the number of

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.530
introns and exons based on the length of the mRNA?

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.710
&gt;&gt; So I want you to tell me, here 2 mRNA's made from their

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.320
respective genes. Here is the DNA gene and the mRNA copy that resulted. Another

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.940
DNA gene and its mRNA copy that resulted. After

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
transcription. I want you to tell me for both examples,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.700
how many axons do you think are in each

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.570
gene? So here are the genes, on the left and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870
right, and beneath them are MRNA copies. And just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.460
to be clear, on the left, the MRNA copy is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.750
the exact length as the DNA gene. And over

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.810
here on the right, the mRNA copy is shorter than

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.490
the DNA gene, so using the options below for each scenario, I want

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.770
you to pick the best answer for the question, how many exons do you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.180
think are in each gene? This is a tough one, so think about

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.030
it first, and try again if you don't get it the first go around.
