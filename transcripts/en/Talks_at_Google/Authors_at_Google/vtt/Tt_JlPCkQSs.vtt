00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
&gt;&gt; Hi, I’m Al Verin. I’m the chief economist
here at Google.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.879
And it’s a great pleasure to introduce Joe
Stiglitz. Joe and I have known each other

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.529
for longer than we care to admit. We were
just comparing notes and I think the, I took

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:24.370
my first real class in economics from Joe
in 1966 [pause] the fall of 1966. It’s hard

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.070
to believe that there was economics that long
ago. [laughter] But Joe is one of the people

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.670
who’s really been responsible for, I think,
changing the face of economics, where he became

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.960
the assistant professor.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.890
All the excitement in the area at that time
was about the work Joe and his collaborators

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.050
were doing on Information Economics; studying
how isometric information affects the functioning

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.389
of economic institutions. And, as you know,
he’s received a Nobel Prize for that work,

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:58.230
five years ago, or maybe or a little longer.
Anyway, I’m going to cut the introduction

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.069
short because I know you are all anxious to
hear. Joe is going to talk about his new book

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.260
"Freefall." Thank you.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.020
[Clapping]

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:21.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. And as Al said, this
crisis in a way is very much related to the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.850
subject on which I have been doing research
for a very long time, problems of asymmetric

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.619
information, or imperfect information. In
a way, it’s sort of a case study in what

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.460
can go wrong in markets.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.049
There have been a lot of books written and
will likely to be continue to be written about

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:53.500
the crisis. Most of them are journalistic
accounts of who did what when, who said what

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.890
to whom, and you know, what would have happened
if the guy hadn’t had to go to the bathroom

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.049
at the critical moment in the negotiations,
and how the world would have turned out to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.049
be different.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:11.210
My book is much more of a book about the battle
of ideas. The kinds of ideas, the ideas particularly

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:20.020
in economics, that led to the crisis and that
helped to inform the way we dealt with the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.670
crisis; led in some cases to measures being
taken that were not as effective as they might

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.860
have been. And talking a little bit, going
forward, how those ideas should be, should

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.610
shape where we go from here.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:52.730
In a way, economists are like doctors, we
really like very sick patients and this, this

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.260
crisis is, is really good for us in that sense
because the economy - this has really been

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.960
a moment of true dysfunction. Where the economy
has not done very well, it really failed.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.040
And by us trying to understand why it failed,
I think we can get a lot of insight into how

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.310
economies function when they do; when they
function more normally.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.370
You know, the basic story of the crisis is,
is really very simple. We had a bubble. The

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:42.700
bubble had sustained the economy. In fact
[pause] during the period of the bubble, savings

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.650
rates came down to zero. It was clearly not
sustainable, and as one of my predecessors

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.130
as the chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisors, said 'that which is not sustainable,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:06.030
won’t be sustained.' And it wasn’t sustained.
The bubble is now broken. Savings rates are

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.040
increasing; they have already gone from 0
to 5%. If they go to historical average, it

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.310
will be 7%. The reasons to believe that it
could go above that. All very good for long

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.560
term growth, good for, for people’s sense
of security.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.690
But the problem is that if people are saving,
they aren’t spending. And if they aren’t

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.930
spending, the economy is weak. And it is not
likely that, say that consumption will return

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:47.250
back to the way it was in 2007 any time soon.
And it's every once in a while you hear somebody

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.440
from the administration or somebody in the
market say 'the American consumers is back'.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.620
And we should hope that that’s not the case
because we can’t go back to the way things

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.440
were in 2007, and we are not likely to.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:15.120
So, that’s part of the reason, only part
of the reason, why, why my prognosis for the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.180
economy is, is not very optimistic. I think
it’s going to be a long haul to get us back

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.880
to normal.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.510
But what I want to spend the first few minutes
of my time, is talking about why we had this

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:41.280
bubble, why, why we’ve gotten ourselves
into this mess. And that’s become a favorite

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.840
sport among economists and politicians from
left and right, of you might call the blame

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.620
game. Who is to blame? And you can say the
crisis is bad enough for a lot of people to

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.919
blame. But I’m going to try to argue it’s
really the financial sector that’s really

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:08.160
to blame. They did, they, they messed up,
and they messed up very badly. The regulators

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.010
failed, but they failed to stop the banks
from doing the bad things that they were doing.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.531
And you know, if you have a robbery, you can
say that the policeman should have been there,

00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:23.850
but you don’t blame the cop for the robbery.
You blame the robber. And especially the case

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.920
if the cop was paid by somebody else to not
be on the beat. It’s hard to blame the cop

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.110
and this is very much the case. The financial
sector paid good money to make sure the regulators

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.990
weren’t doing what they were supposed to
do. And so, we can’t really blame the regulators

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.600
for not being there.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.650
But finally, I’m going to try to argue that,
that behind the failures, particularly the

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.449
regulators but also the financial market,
somebody else is to blame. And that is the

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.700
economics profession, other economists.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.199
[laughter]

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:15.830
That the particular set of ideas that they
pushed really provided some of the intellectual

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:23.690
framework that were used by politicians, by
regulators, and led to, to the problem. So

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:32.370
let me begin talking a little bit about what
the financial sector did wrong and why it

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.480
did, why it did so poorly.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.950
The task of the financial sector is a very
important task, but it is a means to an end

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.650
and not an end in itself. And that was, in
a sense, one of our first failures. We really

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:56.150
thought of the financial sector as an end
in itself. But the role of the financial sector

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:04.360
is to manage risk and allocate capital and
to do what, to run the payments mechanism,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.020
and to do this all these at very low transaction
cost. That’s what an efficient financial

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.199
system does.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:21.600
Well, our financial system misallocated capital.
We had a lot of capital that was available

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.600
from around the world and rather than allocate
most of that to sectors where it might have

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.539
been productive, you might all think that
Google is an example, but there are other,

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:39.539
you know, innovations and technology, a very
large proportion went into housing beyond

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:46.490
people’s ability to pay. And to put it in
perspective, you know, I think no government

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.850
has ever wasted money on the scale of the
American financial market, and it really was

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:57.550
a massive misallocation of resources.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.110
The second thing they are supposed to do is
manage risk [pause] but in fact they created

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:10.180
risk. They actually created uncertainty with
these financial products, CDO, CDO-Squared,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:19.100
credit default swaps and so forth. These innovations
were supposed to help the economy become more

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.249
efficient, but as Paul Volcker's pointed out,
there is no evidence that any of these innovations

00:09:25.249 --> 00:09:30.680
led to increased efficiency of our economy.
There is a lot of evidence that they contributed

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.160
to the, the failures that we’ve had.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.540
The third thing that they are supposed to
be doing is running a payment mechanism. I

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:45.139
mentioned this here particularly because modern
technology should have allowed the creation

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:50.879
of electronic payment mechanism that would
allow for the transfer of money. When you

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:55.470
go into a store, from your account, to the
merchant’s account, for a fraction of a

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.360
penny. It should have cost us almost nothing.
That’s what a modern electronic payment

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360
mechanism.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.069
You may not know it, but every time you use
your debit card or your credit card, the merchant

00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:18.139
has to pay Visa or MasterCard or American
Express 1%, 2%, 3% or more of that transaction.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:23.230
And they are not allowed to let you know what
they're paying. But you are paying because

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:29.350
its increase is part of the transaction and
inevitably gets passed on to you. And it generates

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:38.800
literally tens of billions of dollars of profits
to the banks, but it’s a kind of exploitation

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.949
of their monopoly power.

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:44.240
They are supposed to do all these things,
which they didn’t do, but they are supposed

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.429
to do all these things at low transaction
costs. And our financial sector did it at

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:57.279
very high transaction costs. About 40% of
all corporate profits went to the financial

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:03.059
sector in the years before the crisis. They
were really garnering from the rest of the

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:09.309
society huge amounts for not doing what they
should be doing. Well, that's not the way

00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:12.990
a market economy, a capitalistic economy,
is supposed to operate.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:18.880
So you ask, why did it fail so badly? And
part of my book is trying to describe this

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.550
process like, oh, peeling back the onion where,
where every time you get an answer, there

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:31.600
is another question exposed by that answer.
In this case, there's an obvious answer, at

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.439
least to an economist; and that is that there
were flawed incentives. The banks had incentives

00:11:38.439 --> 00:11:45.959
for short sighted behavior, for excessive
risk taking, [pause] for trying to generate

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:47.320
high transaction costs.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.459
[pause]

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:57.130
But then that, that raises a new question.
Isn’t a good financial system, isn’t a

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.230
market economy supposed to generate the kinds
of incentives that actually make it work?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:07.470
That’s one of the things that we try to
pride ourselves. Market economists are creative

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.800
in the incentive structures.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:17.329
Well, the answer to that is a whole set of
other issues related to theories of agency.

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:24.459
You'll have to read the book to get the full
answer to all these, these questions. But

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:31.309
it lies in, in problems that are more broadly
called corporate governance, the way modern

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:37.110
corporations are organized. That they are
different from 19th century capitalism where

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:42.410
there was an owner who makes the decisions.
Modern corporations, the people who own it

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.910
are not the people making the decisions, for
the most part. There are exceptions, but for

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.949
the most part that’s not true. And there
is a separation between ownership and control,

00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:59.170
and that league means that there are distortions
even in the area of creating incentive structures.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:07.300
So if you look at what happened to, say, to
some of the major banks, the shareholders

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:14.100
did very badly, the bond holders did very
badly, but who did very well? [Pause]The,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:20.029
the, the managers of the banks. Even when
the banks lost enormous amounts in value,

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:24.959
they walked off with hundreds of millions
of dollars, which they kept, or billions of

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:28.149
dollars which they kept.

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:36.429
Well, this is a brief synopsis of why the
financial sector performed so badly. The regulators,

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:42.470
this has happened over and over again, and
there was only one period in the history of

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:49.239
capitalism in which we, these problems have
not been recurrent. And that was the three

00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:54.660
decades or so after the Great Depression when
we introduced the set of regulations that

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.879
actually worked, and they prevented crisis
from occurring.

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:04.739
But then we forgot about that. We thought
we had created a new economy. We were so much

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:12.269
smarter than the past and so began the process
of deregulation, particularly under President

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:21.819
Reagan. The, not only did we deregulate but
we didn’t adopt new regulations. I should

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:28.209
make it clear this was bipartisan. Some of
the, I describe here, some of the fights that

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:33.559
we had in the Clinton administration, where
I opposed for instance the repeal the Glass-Steagall

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:38.290
Act; this was a law that separated commercial
banking from investment banking. Commercial

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:46.829
banking is supposed to take money from ordinary
citizens and invest it conservatively, because

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:52.850
when you go to the bank you want to be able
to get your money back. And, you know, sort

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.839
of like when you put your card into the ATM
machine and it says 'insufficient funds',

00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:01.529
you want it to be because you don’t have
enough funds in your account, not because

00:15:01.529 --> 00:15:05.619
the bank doesn’t have enough funds in there,
in the bank.

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:16.550
So, we passed the Glass-Steagall Act in the
midst of the depression because it was realized

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:25.529
that mixing these two was very dangerous;
[pause] the gambling kind of banking. We don’t

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:30.060
want to mix with the conservative banking,
with the boring banking. There are conflicts

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:36.429
of interest and there was a third problem
by allowing these banks to mix together, you

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:40.549
get bigger and bigger banks. And as banks
get bigger, we have a problem you call 'too

00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:48.089
big to fail'. If you are too big to fail,
you have the real risk that if you gamble,

00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:54.449
[Pause] if you win, you'd walk off with the
proceeds. If you lose the tax payer picks

00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:56.329
up the tab, exactly what happened?

00:15:56.329 --> 00:16:04.420
So, all these were concerns that we discussed
in the, in the Clinton administration. And

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:11.670
so, I opposed it. Treasury representing some
people who, who had done very well by, by

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:19.010
this whole process advocating very close to
Wall Street, and unfortunately, most of the

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:25.449
concerns that were raised have turned out
to be, to be true.

00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:30.910
Well, [Pause] it wasn’t just a question
of deregulation. It was also a question of

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:37.730
not adopting regulations to reflect the new
product, the new world. Like, like how, what

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:43.920
do you do with derivatives and credit default
swaps?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:50.309
That raises then the next question. Why did
we not only fail in regulation, but failed

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:55.389
in getting the right regulators?

00:16:55.389 --> 00:17:03.739
We had regulators who didn’t believe in
regulation. That was not an accident. Paul

00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:08.049
Volcker, who’s gotten a lot of attention
recently, was the chairman of the Federal

00:17:08.049 --> 00:17:15.059
Reserve in the period of the early days of
eighties. And in terms of what central bankers

00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:20.720
are usually graded on, he would have gotten
an A+ because he brought down inflation from

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:26.529
double digit levels to a very low levels.
But in return for this service to the country,

00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:35.960
President Reagan fired him. And you have to
ask, why? And the answer, at least from some

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:42.559
sources, is very clear. President Reagan wanted
somebody who did not understand, believe in,

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:48.679
regulation. Paul Volcker understands the need
for regulation, so he’s fired and they found

00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:54.710
somebody who didn’t believe in regulation;
who would help push through the repeal of

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.210
the Glass-Steagall, and that was Alan Greenspan.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.390
But we should be clear, you know, one of the
points I try to make in the book. A lot of

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:07.760
attention in a lot of the others books, a
lot of the popular discussion, focuses on

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.990
the role of Alan Greenspan or the role of
one other, you know, somebody else. What I

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.830
try to point out is that if Alan Greenspan
hadn’t been there, Reagan would have found

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.289
another person who didn’t believe in regulation
to be the regulator. And we would have probably

00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:25.669
been in a very similar kind of mess that we
are in today. That we shouldn’t focus too

00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:27.909
much on particular individuals.

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:30.830
[Pause]

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:36.870
Well, that leads to the question. Why did,
why did this occur? And two obvious reasons.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.019
Why did the deregulation, appointment of people
who didn’t believe in regulation occur?

00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:49.950
And the obvious answer is two-fold. One of
them is that special interest, the banks thought

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:55.159
they were making a lot of money, and some
of them were making a lot of money off of

00:18:55.159 --> 00:19:01.000
this deregulation - stripping away the constraints.
And they paid a lot of money to get, to get

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.789
rid of them. There were five lobbyists from
the financial industry for every congressman.

00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:11.321
So they can’t escape with somebody telling
them what they should be doing. There are

00:19:11.321 --> 00:19:15.510
also major campaign contributors. All this
is actually fairly well known, pretty obvious.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:24.260
The second role, part of the explanation is
the role of the economists and the ideas that

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.860
they put forward. A particular idea was that
markets are self-regulating, are self-adjusting,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.730
self-correcting. So you didn’t need government.
It just got in the way and contributed to

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:41.080
the inefficiency of the economy. Well, we
should have known that that idea was badly

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:47.021
flawed because we had something called the
Great Depression. There are other instances

00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:51.530
where the economy has not worked very well,
other areas where it hasn’t worked very

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.510
well. But those were swept aside.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:04.059
Now [Pause] one of the important ideas, probably
one of the most important ideas in economics

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:14.289
is Alan Smith’s ‘invisible hand’. The
notion that the pursuit of self interest leads,

00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:21.380
as if by an invisible hand, to the efficiency
of the overall well-being of the economy.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:28.519
It’s a wonderful idea, if it were only true.
It’s a wonderful idea because if it were

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:35.000
true, you would never have to ask any questions
about ethics. All you’d have to do is to

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.039
say, 'what’s in my self interest?' And by
understanding what is in your selfish-self

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:45.470
interest you would be doing the best for the
rest of society. So, the only immoral thing

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.269
would be not to be selfish enough. And that
really makes a lot of people feel very good.

00:20:51.269 --> 00:20:58.759
You know. So, so this is really, this is,
is as I say, the most important idea, I think,

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:00.620
in, in, in modern economics.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:09.880
Well, [Pause] not surprisingly, economists
have since Adam Smith put this idea forward;

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:17.100
have trying to understand the circumstances,
the sense in which this idea is true. Some

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:23.059
of the really important work on this is done,
is done by Ken Arrow at Stanford and Gerard

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:26.409
Debreu at Burkley.

00:21:26.409 --> 00:21:27.919
[Pause]

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:36.240
One of the, Bruce Greenwald and I, a colleague
of mine at Columbia, proved a very strong

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:44.269
result. We showed that whenever there is imperfect
information, asymmetric information, which

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:53.160
is essentially always, then the reason that
the invisible hand often seems invisible is

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.320
that it’s not there. That is to say, the
economy, that this assumption that the markets

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:07.270
are efficient is just not true. And, I think;
now people really are beginning to understand

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:15.740
that. I don’t think many people would say
that the [pause] pursuit of greed by the bankers

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:22.179
has led to the overall wellbeing, efficiency
of our economy. I don’t think you would

00:22:22.179 --> 00:22:26.200
find anybody defending that proposition today.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:33.600
So, that’s an example of, of where a certain
set of ideas that free markets and federal

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:41.529
markets always work, is really, was already,
undermined by research in economics. But unfortunately

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:48.009
many of the regulators, many of the people
who were pursuing what I call the 'conservative

00:22:48.009 --> 00:23:00.000
agenda' ignored these results.
Another idea that has been very influential

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.020
throughout the work that was done at the University
of Chicago by Gene Fama and others, talked

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:17.130
about the fact that markets are informationally
efficient. That is to say that they transmit

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:24.350
information from the informed to the uninformed
perfectly. [Pause] Now again, that was an

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.870
idea that, a very powerful idea, that markets
are informationally efficient. It should have

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:39.899
been obvious. It’s not true. But [Pause]
in some work that I did at Stanford a number

00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:45.580
of years ago with Sandy Grossman; what we
showed is just illogical proposition. What

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:52.899
we pointed out was that if it were true, nobody
would have had any incentive to gather information

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:58.750
because somebody who didn’t spend any money
gathering information would have all the information,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.669
that somebody who spent the money. But if
that were the case, nobody would spend any

00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:08.590
money gathering information. And if that were
the case, the markets might transmit a lot

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:14.370
of information, might efficiently transmit
information, but we’re transmitting no information

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.820
because nobody would be gathering information.
So, the market would, in fact, be very inefficient.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:29.029
Well, these are again examples of the logical
and empirical statements that had undermined

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:35.610
before the crisis, before the eighties. The
belief that should have undermined the belief

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:42.190
that the markets always work efficiently.
But those who were wedded to that belief really

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:50.071
swept aside these basic results. The crisis
itself and the behaviors that we see in the

00:24:50.071 --> 00:25:01.620
run-up to the crisis really illustrate a lot
of market irrationalities. A lot of examples

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:07.570
of what might be called cognitive dissonance;
of behaviors that are hard to reconcile with,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:15.220
with any kind of rationality. Let me just
give you a couple of examples. One of them

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:25.889
is that [Pause] they assumed that they were;
those in the financial markets were assuming

00:25:25.889 --> 00:25:32.870
that they were innovating in ways that were
transforming the market dramatically. And

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:38.820
that was why they deserved very high salaries.
But then they had a problem, because after

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.789
they created these new products, they had
to estimate the risks associated with the

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:52.840
products. And where could they get data to
estimate the risk? What they had to look at

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:58.889
[Pause] data, say for foreclosure, the innovations
I'm talking about were like a new mortgages,

00:25:58.889 --> 00:26:06.809
they had to look at foreclosure rates before
they had done these innovations.

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:11.460
So, on the one hand, they believed that they
had transformed the world. On the other hand,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:17.440
they used data as if they had had no effect
on the world. But, in fact, they had had a

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.759
very big effect but it was all for the worst.
They, the mortgages that they had innovated

00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:28.799
were mortgages that had much higher probability
of foreclosure and predictably so.

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:33.120
[pause]

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.960
There were many other instances. Let me give
you one other that, that, two others that,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:50.539
illustrate the sort of the intellectual incoherence.
[Pause]One of the things that, that Alan Greenspan

00:26:50.539 --> 00:26:56.570
advised Americans to do was to take out variable
rate mortgages. Some of you may have variable

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:03.179
rate mortgages. Mortgages that the interest
changes when the, the payments you make change

00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:14.299
when the, when the T-bill rate or some other
interest rate changes. [Pause]If you believe

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:21.429
in efficient markets, which is what Alan Greenspan
said he believed in, the interest rate that

00:27:21.429 --> 00:27:28.419
you pay on that kind of mortgage is on average
the same as the interest you pay on a fixed

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:35.480
rate mortgage. Markets basically average out
everything, so you can’t beat the market,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.741
and that’s one of the basic propositions
of efficient markets.

00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:39.830
[pause]

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:46.070
But he advised people to take out variable
rate mortgages and the argument he gave was

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:51.679
that ten years earlier, if you had taken out
a variable rate mortgage, you would have done

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:57.929
better than you would have with a fixed rate.
Well, there’s a good reason for that. And

00:27:57.929 --> 00:28:05.500
that was that markets always look at historical
experience, and historically, interest rates

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:14.259
had never come down to 1%. But Greenspan brought
them down to 1%. So he was the reason that

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:19.250
they were doing very well because he had broken
what had been the historical pattern by bringing

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.029
interest rates down to this abnormally low
level.

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:29.799
But if interest rates are 1%, what can you
predict that they are likely to be in the

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:34.149
future? Well, you can be pretty sure, you
don’t have to have a PhD to figure out they

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:39.970
are not going to go much lower than that.
They are not going to go, but they could go

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:47.269
much higher than that. So, you are exposing
yourself to a very high risk of interest rates

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:53.440
rises, which would, if you were fully [pause]
you know, if you borrowed as much as you could

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.010
for the variable rate mortgage. If the interest
rates rose as they predictably would, you

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:06.200
would be in a very tight, tight spot. And
if you, or other people started to, couldn’t

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.600
manage the mortgage and you tried to sell
your house, what could happen?

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.460
The price of all the real estate would start
collapsing. You were told 'don’t worry about

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.679
rolling over your mortgage, or refinancing
your mortgage because prices are always going

00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:27.899
to go up.' You should have known that that
wasn’t persuasive because they can’t go

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:33.389
up forever, particularly when most American's
income was going down.

00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:42.639
In 2008, for instance, real income, oh in
the median, people in the middle, were 4%

00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:46.549
lower than they were in 2000 adjusted for
inflation. There have been a lot of, there

00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:53.150
have been increases in GDP per capita, but
all that went to the top 20% and the other

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:59.799
80% were either stagnating or declining. So,
it was quite clear that you could not go through,

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:06.990
that you could not bet on market house prices
going up forever. And particularly you couldn’t

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.139
bet on that if interest rates rose, which
would be exactly the condition where you would

00:30:11.139 --> 00:30:16.399
want to, when you might need to refinance
or sell your house and buy another one, and

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.399
downscale.

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.610
[Pause]

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:25.740
Well, here you had the guy who was supposed
to be the expert on risk management not understanding

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.690
the implications of efficient markets, even
though he claimed to believe in it; giving

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:36.759
people the wrong advice. What he should have
focused on was a simple thing. You can’t

00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:42.210
beat the market, [pause] especially if you
are a first time home buyer who’s not spending

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:46.049
most of your time forecasting interest rates.

00:30:46.049 --> 00:30:50.059
The difference between variable rate mortgages
and fixed rate mortgages is a very simple

00:30:50.059 --> 00:30:58.419
one, risk. And the question is who bears the
risk? And it should be that ordinary homeowners

00:30:58.419 --> 00:31:03.600
should not bear the risk, it should go to
the market. So, he was giving exactly the

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.309
wrong advice. And, you know, it sort of makes
you very worried when the people at the top

00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:15.899
who are claimed to be the experts don’t
know it and when all the people below them

00:31:15.899 --> 00:31:18.210
are repeating that kind of advice.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.980
[Pause]

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.879
Well, as I said, I could go on lots of examples
of this kind of, what could only be described

00:31:26.879 --> 00:31:38.679
as stupidity that was pervasive in the market.
[Pause] This then got translated into a whole

00:31:38.679 --> 00:31:45.309
set of policy frameworks. People like Greenspan,
when people said that there couldn’t exist

00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:51.749
bubbles, because they believed markets were
efficient. If there was a bubble, it would

00:31:51.749 --> 00:31:56.820
be evidence of a kind of irrationality and
it was an almost religious doctrine for them

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.590
that, that couldn’t exist. So, when asked
whether there was a bubble in the market,

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:08.220
he said, 'No, no, no it’s just a little
froth.' And then he went on to say, 'Well,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:15.789
in effect even if there's a bubble, we can’t
be sure. We don’t know, we don't have any

00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:21.379
instruments to deal with it, and in any case,
it’s cheaper to pick up the pieces after

00:32:21.379 --> 00:32:23.139
the bubble breaks.'

00:32:23.139 --> 00:32:30.879
Well, I don’t think anybody would agree
with that now. The cost of the breaking of

00:32:30.879 --> 00:32:38.580
the bubble is literally in the trillions of
dollars. It was a really very major mistake.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:44.340
And all these propositions that are given
are really very flawed economic propositions.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:50.919
But let me say, it’s not just Greenspan
and Bernanke, but a lot of other people who

00:32:50.919 --> 00:32:54.480
were behind that, who were pushing these ideas.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:01.830
Well, that brings me down to the, to where
we are and where we ought to be going [Pause]

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.070
we have to stop at about what time?

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.320
[Pause]

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.570
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:16.020
O, I have a little time for questions, so
let me, [Pause] three, three issues going

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:25.019
forward. It’s very clear that the economy
is not [Pause] in good shape. Growth has resumed,

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:32.429
but [Pause] for most Americans, the issue.
Recession is not over as long as they can’t

00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:39.559
get jobs, the unemployment; the official unemployment
rate is just short of 10%. But more relevant

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:45.179
indicator is that more than one out of six
Americans who would like a full-time job can’t

00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:52.730
get it. Unemployment rates among particular
demographic groups like Afro-American youths

00:33:52.730 --> 00:34:01.480
are up almost 50%. The, more and more of the
unemployed are long term. More than six months

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:07.950
are more than 40%. Something that we haven’t
had in the United States.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.960
Mortgage problems are continuing. The number
of mortgage foreclosures are expected to be

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:19.510
higher this year than last year. So the problems
are actually getting worse. There are new

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:26.450
problems beginning to show up in the commercial
real estate. The states are having very serious

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:34.740
time make, meeting their budgets and the cut-backs
coming for, coming on. All these are, are

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:42.770
reasons that I am pessimistic that there is
going to be a quick recovery. In fact, may

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:48.340
the forecast say that we won’t be back to
normal unemployment until the middle of the

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:53.800
decade and I think that’s probably rosy
scenario.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:35:04.890
The, so that’s why one of the first, I think
we need a second round of a stimulus. [Pause]

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:13.250
The first round worked, it just wasn’t small
enough, big enough. [Pause] I and many others

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:19.450
thought that we needed a stimulus of one trillion
or more. The President wasn’t given that

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.670
choice, even though his own chairman at the
Council of Economic Advisors argued that we

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:29.110
needed around 1.2 trillion. He was not posed,
he wasn’t given that choice. It was narrowed

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:35.950
down to 800 or 600 billion dollars. He thought,
or his advisors thought, the unemployment

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:42.710
rate was going to be 10%, and with the stimulus
would be brought down to 8%. They say the

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.900
stimulus worked. Without it we would have
had unemployment of around 12% and brought

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.910
it down to 10%, but that’s still much too
high and it’s not going to be going down

00:35:50.910 --> 00:36:00.890
any time quickly. So, I’ve been very supportive
of, of, of a second round of a stimulus. [Pause]

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:06.450
When President Bush first began dealing with
the problem, or not dealing with it, we threw

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:11.170
a lot of money at the banks, but didn’t
do anything about the mortgages. And in my

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:16.860
mind, that was sort of like giving a mass
blood transfusion to a patient suffering from

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:23.150
internal hemorrhaging and not doing anything
about the internal problem. [Pause]

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:27.760
What the Obama administration finally did
something, but it was again too little, which

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:34.140
is why the number of foreclosures is expected
to be between two and a half and three and

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.640
a half million this year. And the problem
was he didn’t do anything about the central

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:44.060
problem, which is one out of four mortgages
are under water. That is to say people owe

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.620
more money than the value of the house. And
he didn’t want to do anything about that

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.930
because the banks didn’t want him to do
anything about that. The banks didn’t want

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:56.700
him to do anything about that because they
want to live in a fiction that these mortgages

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.420
are perfectly fine. Any restructure in the
mortgages would make them recognize the losses.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.970
What they told, what they successfully did
is get a change in accounting standards so

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.810
that they can pretend that these mortgages
that were, even mortgages that were not up

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.000
to date, could be treated as if they would
be fully paid.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.590
So, that’s a second thing that we clearly
need to do something, do something about.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:27.150
In my book, I proposed something particular,
what I call 'homeowners chapter eleven'. A

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:32.860
new form, a rapid form of financial re-organization
for homeowners.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:40.520
And the third part is dealing with the banks.
[pause] When we were pouring money into the

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:45.220
banks, we didn’t have any vision of what
kind of a financial system. We should have

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:50.070
known that we needed to downsize the financial
system, but as we down side it, downsize it,

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:54.970
we want more of the money. We want the banks
that actually do lending, the banks that,

00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:00.090
the venture capital parts of our financial
system we want to strengthen and parts of

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.700
it that are involved in speculation we want
to reduce.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:08.260
But what did we do? We poured money into the
big banks that do speculation. And we let

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:14.760
140 of the smaller banks go bankrupt last
year alone. So, the result of this is that

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.610
we have a more dysfunctional financial system.
The 'too big to fail' banks are even bigger.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:30.380
The problem has gotten much worse and the
result of that is that, [pause] the problems

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.080
that we had have not gone away.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:41.000
Finally, I began by talking about the failure
of regulation to stop the banks from behaving

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:50.660
badly. We haven’t reformed the regulation,
regulatory structure at all. [Pause] The proposals

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:58.640
that originally came out of the Obama administration
and out of the House were totally inadequate.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.350
The fortunate thing, the last month, the President
Obama began to talk about some more effective

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:12.010
regulation dealing with the too big to fail
banks, dealing with the conflicts of interests,

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:20.560
but not dealing with some of the core problems,
like the problems of credit default swaps.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:27.020
These are the things that got AIG into trouble.
And just to give you one picture of how important

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.570
this one little piece is and they say that
it’s a lot of complexity but one little

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:39.980
piece. American taxpayers gave AIG almost
180 billion dollars. And that’s a mind-boggling

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.980
amount.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.950
Now when I was in the Council of Economic
Advisors, we would debate for hours and days

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:52.840
[Pause]a school rebuilding program that would
cost a few billion dollars, and we in the

00:39:52.840 --> 00:40:00.590
end, people like Reuben said, 'We can’t
afford to, to rebuild our schools in the inner

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:05.710
cities. We just don’t have enough money.'
And we are talking about miniscule amounts

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:13.350
compared to what went to one company in, in,
in a short period of time. It’s equal to

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:21.170
all the foreign aid that we’ll give to Africa
over a quarter of a century. It is equal to

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.300
all the foreign aid, to all the countries
of the world, from all the rich countries

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:31.090
in the world over a period of two years. And
that just went out, without us having anything

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.940
to show for it.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:39.840
So, that problem, having to do with the credit
default swaps, nothing effective has been

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:51.870
done. The concern that I have is that [Pause]
because we haven’t addressed these problems,

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:59.300
the likelihood is, there is a real risk that
we will not only not recover as quickly as

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:04.150
we could have. That we risk another kind of
crisis, such as the one we have in the not

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:11.190
too distant future. And that’s why I think
it’s so imperative that we begin to have

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:19.511
a national debate. A more effective debate
on, on what we can do to address what I think

00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:22.380
of are some fundamental problems in our economy.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.730
Let me open up for questions.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.640
&gt;&gt;Male: [Inaudible]

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.640
[Clapping]

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:32.380
&gt;&gt;Male: [Inaudible] We don't have a mike to
pass around.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.380
&gt;&gt;Stiglitz: Okay.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.180
&gt;&gt;Male: If you could repeat some of the questions
afterwards?

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.380
&gt;&gt;Stiglitz: That's fine.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.380
&gt;&gt;Male: [inaudible] and just to start it off
[inaudible] Actually, I’ve heard a lot about

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.100
the Glass-Steagall Act playing a key role.
Do all we need is all we need to bring that

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.860
back or are there; do we need something much
more modernized?

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.990
&gt;&gt;Stiglitz: OK. The Glass-Steagall Act is
 ... the question is, should we just bring

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.890
back the Glass-Steagall Act? For those of
you who don’t remember, or don’t know,

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:01.650
the Glass-Steagall Act, it was what separated
the commercial banks and investment banks.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:12.450
And [Pause] as I said before, the repeal of
that was something that I opposed and really

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:24.680
does pose a lot of risk to our economy. But
[Pause] the world of 2010 is markedly different

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:31.640
from the world of the 1930s. And so, what
was adequate then or appropriate then is not

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:38.280
adequate, you know, seventy, eighty years
later. So, in my mind, we need to do something

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.720
along the lines of the repeal of the Glass-Steagall
Act. And that’s some of the things that

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.080
Paul Volcker's has been advocating. Things
like, for instance, not allowing the commercial

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:54.590
banks to engage in speculation on their account
with the risk that if they fail we’ll pick

00:42:54.590 --> 00:43:02.840
up the tab. Next that, this is called 'proprietary
trading' by the banks. He's absolutely right,

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.510
but it’s only one fraction it's a third
of what needs to be done.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:11.730
There’s still a problem of too big to fail
banks. There is still the problem of the credit

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:17.430
default swaps; there's still problems of excessive
leverage. So there is a whole other series

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:23.130
of problems. It’s necessary but it’s not
sufficient for addressing the problems that

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.130
we face.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.130
Ok.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:47.640
&gt;&gt; Male: [inaudible] is there a shortage of
long-term understanding on the part of policy

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.521
makers? You talked a [inaudible] little bit
about the banks and the [inaudible] lobbyist

00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:50.521
that they've employed. [Inaudible] I mean,
do you see a lot of leadership in either Congress

00:43:50.521 --> 00:43:51.521
or in the Executive Branch that, you know,
understands [inaudible] these problems and

00:43:51.521 --> 00:43:52.521
sees things [inaudible] long term beyond the
[inaudible] six or [inaudible] twelve month

00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:53.521
interactions?
&gt;&gt; Stiglitz: The question was, are there many

00:43:53.521 --> 00:43:58.760
people in the policy-making circles and in
the, in Congress who understand what needs

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:06.180
to be done? Whos understand particularly a
long term view of where we should be going?

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:13.430
I think the answer to that is, there are a
few [chuckle] people who do understand this,

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:19.280
but relatively few. As I say, one of the real
concerns that I’ve had is that almost nobody,

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.550
either in Congress or in the administration,
has tried to articulate a vision of what kind

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:30.330
of a financial system we want. What, where
do we? What, what, what is a financial system

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:33.850
supposed to do? And if you don’t know what
it’s supposed to do, it’s very hard to

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:41.420
know how to reconstruct the one that clearly
failed to make it more likely do what it should

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.140
be doing.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.701
And, you know, just to pick up something that
many of you may be aware of that I mention

00:44:46.701 --> 00:44:51.741
very because you are, you know, so focused
on technology. An electronic payment mechanism

00:44:51.741 --> 00:44:56.750
is a simple function that we ought to have.
No discussion of why it is that America doesn’t

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:03.790
have an efficient electronic payment mechanism;
[pause] years after modern technology should

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:11.800
have allowed this to happen. So, that’s
an example where, where, where I don’t think

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:18.680
there just a beginning of an awareness of
these issues.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:30.010
Part of the problem is also though that many
of the people have quite, quite plainly been

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:37.020
overly intellectually captured, to put it
in the best front, or bought, to put it in

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:43.390
the least, by those in the financial sector.
So, for instance, let me give you, you know,

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:48.060
I can give the speeches of those in the financial
sector just as well as they can. So, I'll

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.340
tell you, you know, for instance, after I
have talked about the need for regulation,

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:57.271
they'll say, yes, but we have to be careful
with innovation, and that sort of, you know.

00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:04.100
You can understand the politicians understanding
good words like regulation and then innovation.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:10.150
You can, nobody wants to let the pendulum
swing too far the other way.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:16.860
Well, that’s where I keep emphasizing. Look
at the sector actually resisted innovations

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.760
that would have been well for enhancing. And
I saw that very clearly, for instance, when

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:30.110
I was on the Council of Economic Advisors.
We proposed introducing inflation index bonds.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:35.560
The notion was very simple. That if you are
saving for retirement that’s 30, 40, 50

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:41.330
years away, you don’t know what inflation
is going to be. And there is no product in

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:45.320
the private market that will insure you against
that.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:51.040
So, we proposed that the government produce
a product that would provide inflation protected

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:58.840
bonds. Believe it or not, the private, the
financial sector resisted this idea. And at

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.500
first I scratched my head and said I understand
why you may not be innovative, but why do

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:11.820
you resist innovation? And the answer was
very simple. People buy these and hold them

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:17.000
for their retirement. It’s a good thing,
but not from the point of view of the financial

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.520
sector because they make money from fees.
And if you buy and hold for forty years, you

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.890
are not buying and selling. If you are not
buying and selling, you are not generating

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.810
fees, and that’s a bad product.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:35.100
So, you know, the conflict of interest is,
is very clear. So these are the people talking

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:41.180
to the politicians and I remember, you know
when, say when I was pushing for this, they

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.290
would say, Oh, you are going to have a party
and nobody is going to come to it. It’s

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.392
going to be a total flop. It’s actually
been a very successful product and it would

00:47:48.392 --> 00:47:53.010
be more successful and it will likely be more
successful now that anxieties about inflation

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.990
are increasing.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:01.920
So, I guess in the end what I’m saying is
I think there is awareness of a few people

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:08.330
that we need to get long term, a longer term
focus. But it’s relatively few people and

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:15.040
unfortunately a lot of the rhetoric of Wall
Street has seeped down into the politicians

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.040
and they bought it.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040
Yup.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:30.660
&gt;&gt; Male: [inaudible] So, it seems like the
proposed regulations is to make or to like

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:42.490
stop [inaudible] banks from getting too big
to fail. But to me that kind of [inaudible]

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:43.490
institutionalizes the concept of if they fail
[inaudible] we'll still pick up the [inaudible]

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:44.490
pieces, if they manage to get around whatever
regulations [inaudible] we put in place. How

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.490
do we put in place like the ability for them
to fail no matter what?

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.490
&gt;&gt; Stiglitz: You know, that's a very good
question. The question is, rather than talk

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:53.020
about stopping banks from becoming too big
to fail, how do we tie our hands, so to say,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.910
no matter what your size if you fail, you
fail?

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:05.010
And the answer to that is, there is no way
that you can do that. And that flawed, that

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:13.300
way of reasoning has been very strong in the
administration and some people who in some

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:20.870
of the banks. They say, especially some of
the very big banks, they say, right now, 'You

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:29.390
should be tough with us! If we fail, particularly
if my rival fails, you should let him die.'

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:36.300
And they are very explicit. 'We believe in
death for bad banks.'

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:42.420
They say that now, but I can tell you what
happened, will happen when they actually go

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:48.940
on the verge of failure, because I saw it.
What they say is, you know 'Don’t save us

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:54.220
for our own sake but you have to understand
if you don’t save us, there will be tremors

00:49:54.220 --> 00:50:00.150
in the market, the market will collapse. 'And
we heard that from our politicians who are

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:04.260
saying, you know, Geithner and Obama said,
'we are not saving the banks because we love

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:10.450
the banks. We are saving the banks because
we have to do that to save the economy.' And,

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:13.140
you know, for those of you who understand
economics it’s called the difficulty of

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:20.240
having exposed commitment. You, there is no
way you can really commit yourself after the

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:27.400
event, not to bail them out. And what was
so striking is that in this recent episode

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:38.260
we’ve seen really bad manifestation of this
where [pause] it was very clear we needed

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:43.500
to save the banks because saving the banks
would, if we hadn’t done that they would

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.010
have caused tremors.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:52.141
But we could have used the ordinary rules
of capitalism; ordinary rules of capitalism

00:50:52.141 --> 00:51:02.460
say if a firm can’t pay what it owes it
goes, the bond owners become the new shareholders.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.520
The shareholders get wiped out. And in the
case of a bank, if the bond owners don’t

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.460
have enough then the government puts in money
to pay the depositors and the government then

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.001
owns it until it sells it. Okay? That’s
the way it’s done all the time, we did it

00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:22.750
in Continental Illinois, we do it all the
time. But what we did in this crisis, the

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:30.880
guys from Citibank, the guys in Obama’s
administration said [pause] 'if you do that,

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.000
the market will freak out.'

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.810
So what you have to do is not only save the
banks but save the bankers, the shareholders,

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:46.430
and the bond holders. Citibank had 325 billion
dollars of long-term debt. If we had converted

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:52.530
that debt into the new shareholders, we would
not have had to pour money into Citibank.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:52:01.350
But what they said was, it was totally extraordinary,
it was breaking the rules of capitalism. What

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:07.000
they, what they did is, they said if we did
that, it would cause all kinds of turmoil.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.300
And so, we know that they'll say exactly the
same thing.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:19.350
They talk about creating living wills, a planned
resolution. Again, a living will is perfectly

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:25.240
fine when everything is normal. But when banks
go bankrupt, it’s not normal. And so what

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.470
you plan to do, the guy that you are planning
to sell it to won’t be around when you plan

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:35.340
to sell it, when the whole market is collapsing.
So, I feel very strongly that the only way

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.850
of addressing this is to stop the too big
to fail banks.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:45.780
The other point about the too big to fail
banks is that it totally distorts the marketplace,

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:52.410
because the markets believe, and again nothing
that you say will make a difference, the markets

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:57.920
believe that they will be bailed out. If a
market believes that, what would that mean?

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.510
They can get access to capital lower interest
rates. What does that mean? That means they

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:09.020
get to grow, not because they are more efficient,
better in anything other than being big. And

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:14.390
so, what we're getting is more and more growth
in the dysfunctional big banks at the expense

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:21.310
of everybody else, and it’s a, it's a, it's
a destructive, dangerous dynamic. And that’s

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:26.431
why you really have to take strong action.
Obama is proposing a tax on the big banks,

00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:34.500
especially on the highly leveraged big banks.
But I think that’s not enough because these

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:43.030
banks are not necessarily run by their shareholders:
they are run by their managers, and they like

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:47.660
bigness. And so, even if the shareholders
suffer, they are likely to push it forward

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.660
anyway.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:54:14.140
&gt;&gt; Male: [inaudible] we took questions before
the talk and decided they were [inaudible]

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:19.230
voted up or down in popularity. The most popular
one was [inaudible] saying that it was reported

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.230
that Obama's Stimulus Package was not, [inaudible]
was not enough, and that's well backed-up

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:21.230
in your book. But are you concerned at all,
that, are you concerned about our [inaudible]

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.230
debt levels? Are you also concerned about
[inaudible] effectively endorsing [inaudible]

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.230
wasteful politicians?

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:24.230
&gt;&gt;Stiglitz: I’m certainly against endorsing
wasteful politicians. Am I worried about the

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:28.850
debt? Yes. But, let me first point out that
this way of framing the question is a little

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:38.870
bit misleading. In the context of any firm
[pause] you don’t look at the debt. Anybody

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:42.700
looking at a firm looks at the balance sheet.
In the balance sheet you look at the liabilities,

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:47.250
you look at the assets; you look at the difference,
which is the net worth. And when the liabilities

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:53.430
go up and the assets go up [pause] and the
assets go up more than the liabilities, you

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:59.210
say; fine the net worth is increased. So,
only in the public sector do we have a financial

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:04.120
market that’s supposedly smart. That only
looks at one half of the balance sheet. So,

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:10.410
the lesson of this is, it depends on how we
spend the money. If we spend the money for

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:14.911
investments, then it’s a good thing.

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.990
[Pause]

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:23.070
Now, the banks, as I said repeatedly, were
very short sighted in the run-up to this crisis

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:29.700
and unfortunately, this financial markets
are continuing to be short-sighted. We should

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:37.700
be concerned about the long term national
debt, not the short term. If we spend money

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:43.970
on investments, they will stimulate the economy
in the short run, but the investments will

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:52.310
also grow our economy in the long run. And
you can ask the question, [pause] what rate

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:58.730
of return do we need to get on our investments
in order for the tax revenues that we get

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:04.300
from the short run growth and from the long
run growth lead to an actual reduction in

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.880
the national debt in the long run? And the
answer is a very low return; only about 5

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:16.200
or 6% return on investment, in public investment,
will lead to a long term lower national debt.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.660
And the evidence is that the returns from
investments, for instance in, in public technology

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.270
are much much higher.

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:37.890
So, I think it’s really, pretty clear that
it is foolish to cut back on those kinds of

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:42.630
expenditures, which stimulate the economy
in the short run and grow the economy in the

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:43.630
long run.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:48.190
Now the implication of the worry about the
deficit is exactly the last part of your question.

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:56.350
We should be encouraging spending that yields
returns. So, if from that point of view, two

00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:04.570
clear examples of foolish spending was when
we gave money to the banks, [pause] got back

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:12.740
67 cents on the dollar, and didn’t put conditions
on them that encouraged them to lend. That

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:20.270
was wasteful money. And so, the one big instance
of waste money that we’ve had is to the

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.040
banks.

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:29.621
The other big example in my own mind is war;
military expenditures. We’ve been spending

00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:33.890
hundreds of billions of dollars a year on
weapons that don’t work against enemies

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:38.490
that don’t exist. Its good thing the enemies
don’t exist given that the weapons don’t

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:47.960
work, [laughter] but the fact is we can have
more security for less money. So, that’s

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:53.220
another example, and no matter what your view
on this is, these spending, this kind of spending

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:58.360
doesn’t increase the economy in the long
run. So, yes I worry about the deficit, but

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.061
it should be to encourage us to think about
how we spend the money.

00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:14.060
&gt;&gt;Male: We have time for one more question.

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:29.211
&gt;&gt; Male: [Inaudible] Republicans that are
encouraging tax cuts with growing the economy.

00:58:29.211 --> 00:58:30.211
And obviously you mentioned that, but what
is your thought, exactly, on tax cuts? [Inaudible]

00:58:30.211 --> 00:58:31.211
Obviously, [inaudible] take money away from
the government, but to increase the stimulus

00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:32.211
again, [inaudible] private market, [inaudible]
private economy, [inaudible].

00:58:32.211 --> 00:58:36.190
&gt;&gt;Stiglitz: The question was the role of tax
cuts in stimulating the economy. [pause] There

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:46.590
are two kinds of tax cuts; household tax cuts
and investment tax cuts. Let me separate those

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:52.490
two, the kinds of tax cuts that were, most
of the tax cuts that were in the stimulus

00:58:52.490 --> 00:59:01.980
package, were in President Bush’s stimulus
tax package in February 2008, those are very

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:10.010
ineffective. And the reason is pretty obvious.
The reason they were intended to stimulate

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:15.331
the economy. And one thing about a stimulus
is, you have to spend the money. And if you

00:59:15.331 --> 00:59:21.000
don’t spend the money, it may make you feel
better; you pay off your debt. When I say

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.430
spend it, spend it on goods, not deleveraging,
not getting rid of your debt. So they spent

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:34.300
it on these goods, they, they [pause] they
didn’t spend it on goods. They, they, they

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:39.560
paid down their debt. They put it in a bank
account. There were high levels of anxiety

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:46.470
about their financial positions, for good
reason. But all that meant that roughly only

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:52.730
about 50% of it was spent. And the result
of that is that they were very ineffective

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:56.430
in stimulating the economy.

00:59:56.430 --> 01:00:09.780
The other part of tax cuts or tax credits
are those focused on link. Very closely linked

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:16.400
between spending and the tax cut. An investment
tax credit is that kind where you say to a

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:25.150
firm, if you spend money on investment, we
will pay part of that cost through a tax credit.

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:33.690
Or if you hire a worker, then we will pay
part of that cost through a tax credit. Now,

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:42.210
those at least have a clear link between the
tax cut and the private spending, and they

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:48.190
have at least the potential of stimulating
the economy [pause] even if they have some

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:54.700
effect, as you say, on the deficit. There’s
a big, there’s a lot of controversy about

01:00:54.700 --> 01:01:01.780
the magnitudes of those responses both in
creating jobs or in stimulating the economy.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:07.540
But I think in at least some areas - particularly
when they are well designed in that there

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:15.880
are proposals for what are called incremental
or marginal investment or jobs tax credits.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:22.890
So that one of Obama’s proposals is to say
to firms: if you hire more workers than you’ve

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:29.070
hired in the past, then you will, we will
pick up a part of the cost. And those can

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:41.030
be effective. So, in my mind, the household
tax credits are not a good way. And part of

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:47.650
the reason I don’t think they are a good
way is, even if they worked, they are reinforcing

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:55.910
the problem that America had, which was excess
consumption. And one of my criticisms of the

01:01:55.910 --> 01:02:01.390
stimulus is that it should have been shifting
us towards a new economy, where, with the

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:06.420
view of where we want to go. And we don’t
want to go back to 2007 where we consumed

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:12.010
too much. There are whole new set of things.
And that’s why I like the investment kinds

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:16.020
of tax credits because they are saying, we
ought to, especially the green investment

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:21.260
tax credits, how are you going to re-shift
the economy? That’s the direction. And providing

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.250
a little impetus in that direction.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:31.540
&gt;&gt;Male: Thanks very much and can we get a
[inaudible] big round of applause?

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.050
[Clapping]
