00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 align:start position:0%
or so long but I do think at a
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.779 align:start position:0%
or so long but I do think at a
grassroots<00:00:25.890><c> level</c><00:00:26.310><c> there's</c><00:00:26.609><c> a</c><00:00:26.640><c> better</c>

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 align:start position:0%
grassroots level there's a better

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
understanding of the need to resolve
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.410 align:start position:0%
understanding of the need to resolve
this<00:00:28.560><c> is</c><00:00:28.710><c> that</c><00:00:28.830><c> there</c><00:00:28.980><c> is</c><00:00:29.099><c> greatest</c><00:00:29.910><c> ability</c>

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
this is that there is greatest ability
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
this is that there is greatest ability
right<00:00:30.570><c> and</c><00:00:30.779><c> I</c><00:00:30.840><c> do</c><00:00:30.900><c> believe</c><00:00:31.320><c> that</c><00:00:31.859><c> resolving</c>

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 align:start position:0%
right and I do believe that resolving
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 align:start position:0%
right and I do believe that resolving
