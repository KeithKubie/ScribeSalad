00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.250
 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.930
Life.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.790
What is it?

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.200
As a geneticist, I would
point you towards

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.120
this molecule, DNA.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.290
Watson and Crick called it the
secret of life, and that's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.870
because this molecule
has the ability to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.330
make copies of itself.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.320
And these copies get passed from
generation to generation.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.150
And this has been happening
since the origins of life.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.220
Every living thing has DNA.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:52.616
 

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:56.420
The extraordinary diversity of
life that we see around us

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.960
comes from the fact that
different organisms have

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.540
slightly different versions
of the DNA molecule.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.440
In the case of humans, our DNA
codes for about 22,000 genes,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.500
and these genes are organised
onto chromosomes.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.720
 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.250
The human genome contains 23
pairs of chromosomes plus the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.210
mitochondrial DNA.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.370
And throughout this series,
we'll be featuring a new video

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.340
every day looking at each
of these one by one.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.810
[BIRD CHIRPING]

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:42.050
 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.900
So if we imagine for a moment
that these are some human

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.310
chromosomes, then Chromosome
One is the biggest one.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.080
Human Chromosome One contains
about 2,000 genes, and these

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.170
are arranged along
the chromosome.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.030
So you're going to have some
bits that are packed with

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.400
loads of genes and might have
some big gaps in between.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.890
But these are all along
the chromosome.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.870
And these genes do
different jobs.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.400
For example, one of the genes
on Chromosome One is a gene

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.780
for the amylase enzyme,
which digests starch.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.400
And amylase is in your saliva.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.710
And different genes along the
chromosome have different jobs

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.600
to do and different times and
places when they should be

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.070
doing them.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.060
So you have genes involved in
digestion, you've got genes

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.110
involved in growth and heart
muscles and all of these

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.180
different functions
in your body.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.490
And one thing that the
chromosome structure does is

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.100
it doesn't lie there
in a straight line.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.760
It's actually looped around
like spaghetti.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.310
And you have some genes that are
hidden in this structure,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.330
and they are not active, and
other ones that are turned on.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.660
And so the chromosome structure
helps the right

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.490
genes be turned on in the
right time and place.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.700
But there's something else as
well that the chromosome

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.580
structure helps, and that is
that all important process of

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.910
cell division when the DNA needs
to be copied and sent to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.260
the next generation.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.900
With 22,000 genes, that's
a bit of a mess.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.470
But instead if the genes are on
chromosomes, the job gets a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.240
lot simpler.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.710
So if we're partitioning out
these chromosomes between

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.800
daughter cells, we keep one
Chromosome One there, send the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.440
other one to a new cell, keep
one Chromosome Two, send the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.800
other to a new cell, and the
same thing for the other

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840
chromosomes.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.070
So instead of having this big
messy job to do, we've got a

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.930
comparatively simple
job to do.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.590
 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.160
So this accurate and faithful
copying of DNA has carried

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.430
this genetic information from
generation to generation right

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.150
through all living organisms.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.950
And you could say that this
is the secret of life.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:19.435
