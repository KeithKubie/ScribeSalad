00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.740
Thomas Aquinas was no dummy.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.840
Remember him? The Italian fella? Christian monk? Philosophical superstar of the 13th century?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.719
Aquinas thought morality was important for everyone, and that being a good person was a vital part of God’s plan for each of us.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.219
But he knew that not everyone had been exposed
to the Bible, or had even heard of God.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.840
So, what bothered him was:

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.040
How could people follow God’s moral rules – also known as the divine commands – if they didn’t even know about the guy who made the commandments?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.660
Aquinas just couldn’t believe that God would have expectations for us, if he didn’t also give us – all of us – a way to meet them.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.900
So, Aquinas’ theorized that God made us pre-loaded with the tools we need to know what’s Good.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.240
This idea became known as the natural law
theory.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.280
And there are a lot of versions of this theory
still circulating around today.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.980
But Aquinas’ original take on natural law is by far the most influential, and the longest standing.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.920
How influential?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.980
Well, if you’re Catholic or a member of any of the major Protestant denominations, or were raised in any of those traditions,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.020
then you’re probably already familiar with how Aquinas saw the moral universe and your place in it.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.859
Basically, God is awesome, and he made you.
So, you are awesome.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.319
It’s just important that you don’t forget
to be awesome.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:23.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.100
We all want stuff. Aquinas got that.
And he said that it was OK.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.940
In fact, the theory of natural law is based on the idea that God wants us to want things – specifically, good things.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:43.340
Aquinas argued that God created the world according to natural laws, predictable, goal-driven systems whereby life is sustained, and everything functions smoothly.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.100
And as part of this natural order, God made certain things that were good for his various creatures.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.220
Sunlight and water are good for plants.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.920
Meat is good for cats, and plants are good
for bunnies.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.160
And – because God is awesome – he instilled all of his creatures with an intuitive desire for the things that he designed to be best for them.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.760
The things that we’re designed to seek are known as the basic goods, and there are seven of them.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.940
The first thing that all living things just naturally want, Aquinas said, is self-preservation – the drive to sustain life.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.220
Aquinas thought God built all creatures with
a survival instinct.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.920
And this appears to be pretty much true.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.540
I mean, we naturally avoid dangerous situations
like swimming with hungry sharks,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.640
and when we find ourselves in danger, we don’t have to stop and ponder the options before getting ourselves to safety.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.100
After preserving our own lives, our next most pressing basic good is to make more life – in other words, to reproduce.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:41.660
Some beings are able to do this on their own, but since we need to coordinate matters with a partner, God kindly instilled us with a sex drive, and made the process feel good, to make sure that we do it.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.900
Thanks, God!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.480
But once we manage to achieve our second basic good – reproduction – we need to educate those kids we just made.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.100
For humans, that’s going to mean stuff like
school and lessons in morality.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.200
But even non-human animals need to teach their
babies how to hunt and avoid predators.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.300
Otherwise, the offspring they worked so hard to create aren’t going to survive long enough to reproduce themselves, which, of course, is the goal of everything.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:12.380
And while these first goods seem to apply to a pretty wide swath of creation, some of the basic goods are just for humans, because of the particular kind of being we are.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.780
For instance, Aquinas thought we are built
with an instinctual desire to know God.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.600
He believed we seek him in our lives, whether
we’ve been exposed to the idea of God or not.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.600
Interestingly, the existentialist Jean-Paul
Sartre agreed with Aquinas on this.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.030
He said we’re all born with a god-shaped
hole inside of us.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.520
The tragedy, for Sartre, is that he was an atheist, so he believed this was an emptiness that could never be filled.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:43.120
Next, taking a page out of Aristotle’s book, Aquinas also said that humans are naturally social animals, so it’s part of our basic good to live in community with others.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:52.420
While short periods of solitude can be good, he believed that we’re basically pack animals, and our desire for love and acceptance, and our susceptibility to peer pressure, are all evidence of this.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.420
Now, since we naturally want to be part a pack,
it’s a good idea not to alienate our pack-mates.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.560
So, basically, Aquinas said we recognize the
basic good of not pissing everybody off.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.470
I mean, he didn’t actually say it that way.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.920
But if he did, I’m sure it sounded a lot
better in Latin.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.140
The point is, Aquinas said we feel shame and guilt when we do things that cause our group to turn against us, and that was another basic good.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.320
And finally, Aquinas said we’re built to
shun ignorance.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.660
We’re natural knowers.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.860
We’re inquisitive, and we want to be right.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:27.700
This is another trait we share with non-human animals, because knowledge promotes survival, and ignorance can mean starving to death or ending up as someone else’s dinner.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.300
So these are the basic goods, and from them,
we can derive the natural laws.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.580
We don’t need the Bible, or religion class, or church in order to understand the natural law, Aquinas said.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.980
Instead, our instinct shows us the basic goods, and reason allows us to derive the natural law from them.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.640
Right acts, therefore, are simply those that
are in accordance with the natural law.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.259
So how does this whole system work?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.140
Well, I recognize the basic good of life,
because I value my own life.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.160
And that’s clear to me, because I have a survival instinct that keeps me from doing dangerous, stupid stuff.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.960
Then, reason leads me to see that others also
have valuable lives.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.140
And from there I see that killing is a violation
of natural law.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.400
So, for each negative law, or prohibition, there’s usually a corresponding positive one – a positive injunction.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.740
For example, ‘Do not kill’ is a prohibition, but there’s also a positive injunction that encourages us to promote life.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.500
And I can take that positive injunction of promoting life to mean anything from feeding the hungry, to caring for the sick, to making healthy choices for myself.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.780
And we could do the same thing with each of
the basic goods.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.660
The basic good of reproduction leads to a prohibition, don’t prevent reproduction, which is why the Catholic Church has been so opposed to birth control.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.700
And the positive injunction there is: Do procreate!

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.680
Do all the procreating you want!

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.680
And if you think it through – using your God-given reason – you’ll be able to see how the other natural laws are derived from the basic goods.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.060
But, of course, as with the Divine Command Theory, the theory of Natural Law raises plenty of questions.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:01.500
For example, if God created us to seek the good, and if we’re built with the ability to recognize and seek it, then why do people violate the natural law all the time?!

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:12.780
Like, if this is supposed to be something so intuitively obvious that even plants and non-human animals can manage it, why is the world so full of people-killing and offending others and folks who do everything but seek God?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.289
Aquinas had two answers for this: ignorance
and emotion.

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.949
Sometimes, he said, we seek what we think is good, but we’re wrong, because we’re just ignorant.

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.169
And yes, that happens.

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.520
I mean, there once was a time when cigarettes
were literally what the doctor ordered.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.949
Back then, we thought we were promoting our
health, but we were actually hurting it.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.780
No matter how awesome God made you, or your desires, you have to have some understanding of how to be awesome.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.120
But ignorance can’t account for all of the
stupid things we do.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.680
Aquinas, again following Aristotle here, said that, even though we’re rational, we’re also emotional creatures.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.480
And sometimes, we see what we should do, but emotion overpowers our reason, and we fail to do the things we know we should.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.380
So, in those cases, we just kinda forget to
be awesome.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.620
Now, as with the Divine Command Theory, Natural law gives us a handy answer to the grounding problem.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.620
It tells us that morality is grounded in God,
that he created the moral order.

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.740
It also gives us a reason to be moral – following
the natural law makes our lives work better.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.520
But while it seems to have a lot more going for it than divine command theory, natural law theory has its share of critics as well.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.940
First of all, it’s not going to be super appealing
to anybody who doesn’t believe in God.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.120
You can tell me God set the world up according to natural laws, but if I reject that whole premise, there’s not a lot you can do to convince me.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.200
Another objection comes from 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, in the form of what’s known as the is-ought problem.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.380
And to investigate this, let’s pop over
to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:41.120
Hume said it’s fallacious to assume that just because something is a certain way, that means that it ought to be that way.

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:43.949
But that’s basically what natural law theory
does all day long.

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:46.932
We look at nature and see that creatures have
strong survival instincts.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.760
So from there we conclude that survival instincts
are good.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.900
But, are they?

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.059
I mean, to me, yeah, because it helps me stay
alive.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.260
But my survival instinct could also cause me to do all sorts of things that look immoral to other people.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.460
Like killing you and crawling inside your still-steaming body, tauntaun-style, to stay alive in a blizzard.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.780
Not that I would do that, but just for example.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.060
Likewise, we can observe the existence of sex drives and conclude that reproduction is good.

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:17.320
But, sexual drive can also fuel terribly immoral
things, like sexual assault.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.360
And for that matter, is reproduction always
good?

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.479
Is it something all beings have to do?

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:25.059
Am I sinning if I choose never to have children?

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:26.789
And what about bodies that can’t reproduce?

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:30.569
Or people who don’t want to reproduce or
have partners that they can’t reproduce with?

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:31.640
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.959
As you can see, for all it has going for it, natural law theory can pretty quickly open some big ol’ cans of philosophical worms.

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:42.570
Which might be why 18th century German philosopher
Immanuel Kant thought we needed a better option.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.360
Which we’ll consider next time.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.860
Today, we learned about natural law theory,
as proposed by Thomas Aquinas.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.280
We studied the basic goods and the way instinct and reason come together to point us to the natural law.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.140
We also discussed some problems with the theory, in particular, the is-ought problem advanced by David Hume.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.779
