00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:12.311
( applause )

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:14.947 line:0%
So my name is Vicki Jensen,
I'm a virologist.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.283 line:0%
A lot of the work that I've done

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.252 line:0%
over the past 15 years or so

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.153
has been on Ebola virus.

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.554
And I'd like to tell you
a little bit about

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:24.958
what it's like working
in that environment.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.459
So, usually the first question
that I get asked

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:29.462
when I tell people
I work on Ebola is

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.531
"Why the heck would you
ever want to do that?"

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.567
And for me it actually started
back in college

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.537
when I was a freshman
taking an intro to micro course,

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.939
I read a book that
probably a lot of folks
in the room have read,

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.974
<i> "The Hot Zone"
 by Richard Preston.</i>

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.542
<i> And I think if you've
 read the book,</i>

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.211
<i>you can understand how you would</i>

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.713
<i> easily become infatuated
 with virology</i>

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:50.182
and especially with Ebola virus.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.885
For me though it
actually started a little
bit before that.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.254
I was always interested
in viruses.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.490
As a small child,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.626
actually not that small,
probably 13 years old.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.028
I remember learning about HIV.

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.864
And I remember being in class

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.467
with a friend of mine and
learning about this

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.036
and the two of us came up
with this great idea.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.738
We were going to cure HIV.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.407
We were going to have patients
sit in a chair,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.076
hook them up,
take all their blood out,

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.678
boil it up, send it out,

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:21.948
get new blood back in and
we were going to cure HIV.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.849
And that was my first,
I guess,

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.118
risk and failure in science.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.688
And being a little bit naive
at the time.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.691
But really virology is a
big puzzle, okay?

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.694
And these viruses,
Ebola in particular,

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:37.429
very, very simple.
Only has seven genes.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.232
Lot of bang for its genomic buck

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.234
when you think of
all the havoc that it can wreak.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.470
<i> It's also extremely beautiful.</i>

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.839
<i> If you look at the
 electron micrograph up there,</i>

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.841
<i>those are actually monkey cells</i>

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.843
<i> that are infected with
 the virus.</i>

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:53.178
<i> And the string like particles
 that you see</i>

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:55.081
<i>that completely cover the cell,</i>

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.582
<i> that's Ebola virus.</i>

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:59.552
<i> That's budding off of the cell
 after it's been infected</i>

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.687
<i> for only about 48 hours.</i>

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.789
<i> The other virus shown here in</i>

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.158
<i> yellow and this is colorized,
 of course,</i>

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:09.228
<i> is Lassa Fever virus.</i>

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:12.265
So, most people have heard
about Ebola.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.133
But there are lot of
different viruses

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.303
that cause a syndrome known as
Viral Hemorrhagic Fever.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.040
<i> And there's a lot of viruses
 that are endemic to
 certain regions,</i>

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.042
<i> like Lassa Fever
 which is endemic</i>

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.677
<i> in West Africa.</i>

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.046
<i> Then there are viruses like
 Ebola which</i>

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.948
<i> pop up from time to time.</i>

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.883
<i> Of course, we all know now</i>

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:34.186
<i> there's an ongoing outbreak
 of Ebola in West Africa.</i>

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:38.557
I think the current counts are
up over 17,000 cases,

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.659
over 6,000 deaths.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.528
But as you can see

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:45.364
<i> these viruses occur</i>

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:47.667
<i>pretty much all over the world.</i>

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.601
<i> And we even have some
 in the United States.</i>

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.404 line:0%
<i> Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome,</i>

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:55.708 line:0%
<i> which a lot of people are
 familiar with in the Midwest.</i>

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.343
And with air travel the
way it is,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.545
you can appreciate
how it would be really easy

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.847
to spread viruses
throughout the...

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.216
throughout the
entire world really.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.219
And so,
that's how I got interested.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.688 line:0%
<i> And so when we think
 about viruses</i>

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.591 line:0%
<i> we think of it in terms of
 bio-safety risk.</i>

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.361 line:0%
<i> And so if you look
 at the very bottom</i>

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.629 line:0%
<i> we start with
 bio-safety level one.</i>

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.533 line:0%
<i>And these are viruses, bacteria,</i>

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:24.036 line:0%
<i> things that really don't cause
disease in healthy individuals.</i>

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.839
<i> As you go up a level,
 bio-safety level two,</i>

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.008
<i> these might be your
 hospital labs,</i>

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:33.045
<i> university labs,
 things where you're dealing
 with maybe E. Coli,</i>

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:34.780
<i> can cause human disease</i>

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.050
<i> but really nothing
 too serious typically.</i>

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.053
<i> If you go up another level,
 bio-safety level three,</i>

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.889
<i>that's when things start getting
 a little more serious.</i>

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.125
<i> These are viruses and
 bacteria where</i>

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.694
<i> you have higher case
 fatality rates.</i>

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:51.764
You have more personal
protective equipment

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.966
that we wear as
laboratorians so,

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:56.135
you may wear a face mask.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.905
<i> Or what we call a PAPR,
 as you see here.</i>

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:03.476
But typically at least for the
viruses in that category

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.244
there are some treatments,

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.046
there may be vaccines.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:09.849
<i> However when you go to the
 pinnacle of this pyramid,</i>

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.784
<i> bio-safety level four,</i>

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.920
<i> you have the
 highest case fatality rates,</i>

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.722
<i> they're all viruses,</i>

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:18.757
<i> there are no vaccines</i>

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.926
<i> and there are no therapies.</i>

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.394
And there are very few labs
in the world

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:24.998
that are capable of
working with those agents.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:29.168
So what is it like to
work in the lab?

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.904
<i> It's fun sometimes.</i>

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:34.006
<i> It's cumbersome all the time.</i>

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.341
<i> And everything takes about</i>

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.943
<i> two-to-three times longer
 than you would think.</i>

00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:40.846
<i> So we work in
 positive pressure suits.</i>

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.815
<i>The one up there is a white one.</i>

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.217
<i> And basically
if you look at the yellow hose,</i>

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:46.852
<i> that's an air hose.</i>

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.320
<i> We hook that up,</i>

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.356
<i> air gets pumped into our suit.</i>

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.825
And that's one way
that we protect ourselves.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:55.794
So, if we accidentally
get a hole in a glove,

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:57.229
a hole in a suit,

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.566
the air is always pushing things
out and away from us.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:03.035
The lab itself,

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:06.205
is interesting because it is
almost like playing Tarzan.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.207
If you want to get from
one area of the lab

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:11.010
to the other, it's not as simple
as just walking.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.211
You're tethered to these
air hoses.

00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:15.281
So, if you have things to carry,

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.717
you're having to
constantly stop and move.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.786
The lab itself

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:23.222
is more than just a space
we work in.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:26.358
So a lot of people
don't appreciate this,

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:29.862
<i> but there's a ton of stuff,
 mechanical space above us</i>

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:32.564
<i> where we have
HEPA-filtered air that goes in,</i>

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.933
<i> lots of back up breathing air,</i>

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.101
<i> all sorts of stuff like that.</i>

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.470
<i> Below we have decontamination</i>

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.841
<i> for all the fluids,
 all the waste that goes out.</i>

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.509
<i> So everything that
 leaves the lab</i>

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.677
<i> is dead.</i>

00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:48.581
So what is it like
working in there?

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.050
It's not like the movies.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.452
Vaccines and treatments,

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:57.657
they're not developed in days,
weeks, months, years.

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.626
We fail a lot.
And by that I mean

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.995
for every therapy
that we've discovered

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.763
we've tested hundreds,

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:07.199
thousands more that have failed.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.302
Now with the recent
Ebola outbreak,

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:13.439
we have had a lot more progress.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.108
Things are moving
more rapidly, which

00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:18.077
some would argue,
I would argue is unfortunate

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.611
it takes something like that

00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:21.447
to get things moving so quickly.

00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.619
So, one of the things
we do a lot is mitigate risk.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.721
So, even though we have
these suits that we work in

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:32.658
that's not our primary means of
containing the virus.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.860
<i> So we actually do all
 of our work</i>

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.763
<i> in bio-safety cabinets.</i>

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:39.098
<i> So, if we have a spill,
 it's contained there.</i>

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:42.401
<i> The suit is really
 meant to be as a backup.</i>

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.771
And so, when we think about
failure in science

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.841
I like to think
it's really how you perceive it.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.744
My mentor told me when I was
getting into this field,

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.446
"if you're successful
ten percent of the time,

00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:56.215
you're doing really awesome."

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.183
And so I think of it

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.886
if I have an experiment
that doesn't work,

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.355
it's an opportunity,
it's an experience

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:04.991
we've learned something.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.359
And so, one of my
favorite quotes

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:08.761
that I always think of

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.964
when I think of failure and
risk is from Thomas Edison.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.833
And this is when
he was creating the light bulb.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:18.237
And he said
he hadn't failed 10,000 times.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.105
He hadn't failed even once.

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:22.675
He actually succeeded in proving

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:26.779
those 10,000 ways
would not work.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.715
And that when he eliminated
all of those ways,

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.017
then he would find the way
that would work.

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:34.453
And so,
I leave you with that thought.

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:35.654
Thanks.

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:37.857
( applause )

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.525
