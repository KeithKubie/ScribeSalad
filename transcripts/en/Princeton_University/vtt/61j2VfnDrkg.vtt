EDWIN ROSALES: My
definition of home

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.310
is really being with people
that I love and that inspire me,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.910
and those are my friends, my
professors, my playwriting

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.490
classes, my theater classes.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.160
Have really allowed
me to tell the stories

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.100
that I feel need to
be told about being

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.150
a minority on this
campus, in this country,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.380
about being an immigrant,
about feeling out of place,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.820
about searching, about
figuring out identity.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.540
My name is Edwin Rosales.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420
I'm an English major
earning certificates

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.710
in creative writing, theater,
and Latin American studies.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.150
I'm originally from
Guatemala, but I currently

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.788
live in Norwalk, Connecticut.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.610
I'm writing two
theses, a collection

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.070
of short stories for
my creative writing

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
and Latin American studies
certificate and then a brand

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.730
new play that's being produced
by the Lewis Center for my theater

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.810
certificate.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.610
I have four advisers
on my two theses,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.470
Jhumpa Lahiri is my English
and creative writing thesis

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.370
adviser.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.130
Bob Sandberg is my playwrighting
thesis adviser.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.860
Suzy Agins is a faculty
director on my play,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.960
and Brian Herrera
is a faculty adviser

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.784
on casting and dramaturgy
for the play.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.200
The big question
at the end, which

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.287
is what want to leave
the audience with.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.870
BRIAN HERRERA: And what do you
need to give your collaborators

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.700
to get to that --

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.120
EDWIN ROSALES: Right.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.910
BRIAN HERRERA: I
started hearing stories

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.950
about a young man who was
interested in writing plays.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.420
And so we talked, and Edwin and
I -- he's never been in a class

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.540
I've taught, but we built
a relationship, mostly

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
in conversation with him as a
writer who understands himself

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.560
as a Latino writer, but doesn't
have a lot of role models

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.040
on campus.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.660
And the idea of what is if
he wants to write a Latino

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.990
play, what is a Latino play?

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.510
And so that's sort of how we
first came together

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.650
was talking about the
contemporary realities

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.322
of Latino theater.

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:15.780
EDWIN ROSALES: These two theses
wouldn't have been possible

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.330
without the many
opportunities that Princeton

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.080
gave me to be able to write both
the collection of short stories

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.490
and the new play.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.520
I was able to go to Guatemala
twice during my Princeton

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.620
career to do research.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.790
I had a reading of my new play
with Equity Latino actors.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.920
I had a reading of my
collection of short stories

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.590
at Labyrinth Books,
a local bookstore,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.530
and I'm ending my senior year
with a fully staged production

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.360
of my new play "Spring on Fire."

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.590
ACTRESS: Can you hear me?

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.462
My voice --

00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:47.170
EDWIN ROSALES: My
play, "Spring on Fire,"

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.310
is based on stories from
the Guatemalan civil war.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.180
It follows a Maya family living
in the highlands in Guatemala,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.030
a pair of Guatemalan
soldiers from the capital who

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.350
come to the village to carry
out a massacre, and the spirits

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.680
and the gods who guide
them on their journeys

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.210
throughout the play.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.700
"We haven't been able to find
them since the night he left,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.057
and we're only looking
because we have to.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.140
If it wasn't for the notice
that came in the mail,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.330
we would have just let
him be, let him be,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.380
but now we need him --"

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.300
My collection of short stories
"The Art of Stones,"

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.560
is inspired by my
own family's story.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.650
The characters in the collection
emigrate from Guatemala

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.710
to the United
States, but struggle

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.410
to stay together as a
family as they discover

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.910
that the father has developed
a drug and alcohol addiction

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.085
problem in the new country.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:38.460
"â€¦When you last
kissed me there,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.890
and I thought I miss him.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.540
We pulled up to a
parking spot right

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.430
in front of the
restaurant, and thank God

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.930
the restaurant had big windows.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.481
Who knows if this story would
be different without them.

00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:49.980
It was through these
windows that we

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.840
could see him sitting at the
bar, even before my mother --"

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.140
I was scared to
write the two theses.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.980
I was scared of
finally owning my story

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.370
and owning what
I've gone through.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.450
The two theses with the
help of all my advisers

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.769
was an amazing challenge
to understand myself better

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.980
through my country's history and
also just through my own family's

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.960
story.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.890
I'm leaving Princeton with
these two great projects

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.110
that I'm still
working on that I'm

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.680
going to take years to
finish, if I ever do.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.170
But I feel more confident than
ever in telling my own story.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.880
The arts here
really empowered me,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.500
and I am leaving Princeton a
different Edwin than I came in.
