00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:07.896
&gt;&gt;Sam: I'm Sam.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:12.336
I'm a fifteen year old girl and
digital media is my second life.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:13.266
&gt;&gt;Hello.

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:14.586
&gt;&gt;I am

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.636
&gt;&gt;Sam.

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:18.456
&gt;&gt;Sam I am.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:25.236
&gt;&gt;If it's a school day, I spend
just two hours on the computer.

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:30.486
If it was not a school day, I'd
probably spend twelve hours or more

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:33.136
on World of Warcraft, MySpace,

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:35.816
listening to music
while I draw or yeah.

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:36.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:42.966
First thing we're gonna look at
today is the bone from every angle.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:48.446
&gt;&gt;Sam: My typical day is I
wake up at six thirtyish.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:53.256
I check my text messages and then
get dressed and go to school.

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:53.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: There you go.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:56.396
&gt;&gt;Aline: Samantha's
an excellent student.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:58.226
She is very smart.

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:02.016
She's on the honor roll, does well
at school, off the charts in math.

00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:03.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now mezzo forte.

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:06.246
&gt;&gt;Aline: And, you know,
she's very musical.

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:10.976
&gt;&gt;Sam: I enjoy very
little piece of band.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.846
I like listening to the
music and how we progress

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:18.776
and the songs we make
for our concerts.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:20.336
&gt;&gt;John: Sam is a creative girl.

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:22.946
She, when you give her a
project or an assignment,

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:24.056
she thinks outside the box.

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:25.496
&gt;&gt;Sam: Hello, Plutonians.

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:27.816
Today's weather is going to be a high

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:31.346
of two hundred thirty
six degrees Celsius.

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.646
&gt;&gt;John: She is always using all sorts

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:38.796
of multimedia technology
to create projects.

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:40.986
&gt;&gt;Sam: What is Pluto's mass?

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:44.096
&gt;&gt;John: Always doing something
different than the rest of the group.

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:44.766
&gt;&gt;Sam: Correct!

00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:47.976
Now isn't that just great?

00:01:48.206 --> 00:01:51.856
&gt;&gt;For one of my school
projects, I had to read a book

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:53.906
and it was really boring.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:55.786
I didn't really understand
half of it,

00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:01.626
so I saw that you can buy the book
on the iPod and it reads it to you,

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.676
so you can like listen to the book.

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:04.446
&gt;&gt;Digital voice: Squire
Trelawney, Dr. Livesey,

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:09.906
and the rest of these gentlemen,
having asked me to write down--

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:15.076
&gt;&gt;Sam: And plus, it scrolls
and you can read it on it,

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:16.296
instead of just holding a book.

00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:21.766
&gt;&gt;My first life would be me with
my friends and like going outside

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:25.956
and riding my bike and taking
care of my foster puppies.

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:31.516
Drawing, painting,
music and all that.

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:32.046
&gt;&gt;[Sam playing piano]

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:35.226
&gt;&gt;Sam: Digital media is my
second life because when I'm

00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:40.566
on the computer, I can really
like do whatever I wanna do.

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.986
I can create whatever I wanna create

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:47.286
and I can be a different
person if I want.

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.676
That's me.

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:52.476
That's another one of my characters.

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:55.456
I play World of Warcraft
with all my friends.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:03:00.216
See, this is my team and
right now, we have the flag.

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:01.926
That's what that icon means.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:03.906
&gt;&gt;Aline: World of Warcraft
is a pretty interesting game

00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:06.416
in that it's one of those
multi user online games.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:10.126
So there's other people in there
from other parts of the world.

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:11.886
&gt;&gt;Sam: Our team has the
flag and they're bringing it

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:14.206
to our base to get a point.

00:03:14.206 --> 00:03:16.816
&gt;&gt;Aline: You have to work
with other people to do this,

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:18.696
and so they're learning teamwork.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:24.046
&gt;&gt;Sam: Right now, I'm going to
defend the flag with an ice trap.

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:29.976
That means if someone steps on
that ice trap, they will freeze.

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:31.096
&gt;&gt;Aline: And they're problem solving.

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:34.136
They're using the different tools
within the system to problem solve.

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.496
So I think it's very
educational in that way.

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:39.766
&gt;&gt;Sam: I like this,
'cause it's competitive

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:44.786
and it's really using strategy in
your mind, and it's not like clicking

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:46.336
on something and it's
killing for you.

00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:51.176
It's like, you have to use your own
mind and figure stuff out your way.

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:55.576
&gt;&gt;Aline: Samantha is very much
intrigued with technology.

00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:59.406
She was not the kind of female
child that was drawn to dolls.

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:03.456
She just has always wanted
to be on the computer,

00:04:03.496 --> 00:04:05.976
playing with technology,
and is comfortable with it.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.086
&gt;&gt;Sam: And action.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.296
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Let's go
to the kitchen, girls.

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:10.166
&gt;&gt;Sam: When I was a little kid,

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.666
I was handed a video
camera for the first time.

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.096
&gt;&gt;And, action.

00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:18.776
&gt;&gt;I'm kind of into
directing, you know.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:22.616
I've done lots of videos with
my friends and I'm usually

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.196
like telling them what to do,

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:26.816
what to do with their
faces, taking the scenes.

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:28.756
&gt;&gt;How about you do it over here?

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:33.436
&gt;&gt;Tiffany: Sam is creative, one
of the most funniest people I know

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:37.346
and she's just cool in
every single way possible.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:38.606
&gt;&gt;What does she have to say?

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:40.246
&gt;&gt;Sam: "To make it from scratch."

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:42.246
And then you be like,
"Betty Crocker style."

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:46.416
&gt;&gt;Courtney: She's a little bit
more advanced with technology.

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:48.756
She's taught me a lotta
stuff about it.

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:49.586
She's really smart.

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:56.586
&gt;&gt;Sam: So do you want this first
clip or do you want the second clip?

00:04:57.366 --> 00:05:01.946
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The second one
looks more professional.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:03.946
&gt;&gt;Sam: Awesome.

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:07.736
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Betty Crocker style.

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:09.666
&gt;&gt;Sam: I text more
than I call people.

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:11.626
Like no one calls anyone anymore.

00:05:11.626 --> 00:05:13.796
If you wanna get hold of
someone, you have to text them.

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:18.336
Right now in my in box, I
have one hundred and fourteen

00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:20.956
and it's ninety nine percent full.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:26.306
&gt;&gt;Dave: Sam's definitely learning
social skills and able to connect

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:29.906
to more people that way, and she's
definitely learning future work

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:32.856
skills as far as learning
applications and programs

00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:35.936
and just learning how to
manipulate the software.

00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:41.696
&gt;&gt;Sam: My method of learning new
software is really trial and error.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:46.216
If something doesn't work out, I
just go back and try something else,

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:49.986
and then just explore it until
I figure out what I'm doing.

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:51.316
&gt;&gt;Aline: Or just go
to the Second Life--

00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:55.086
&gt;&gt;I develop online education for
Northern Illinois University,

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:59.676
and I was asked to help students
build a microfinance game simulation.

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:03.016
Most of my students are college
students and don't have a lot

00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:06.026
of graphical background or multimedia
game development background.

00:06:06.236 --> 00:06:08.586
So I said, "Well, you know,
Samantha knows how to do this.

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:10.946
If you need an extra hand,
she can come in and help you."

00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:16.046
&gt;&gt;Sam: Then I can take this
one and I edit the object,

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:20.516
so the top would close in to make
it look like a different shape.

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:22.226
I hit taper.

00:06:22.226 --> 00:06:23.326
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, so you can manipulate.

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:23.996
Okay, I got ya.

00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:28.216
&gt;&gt;Sam: And I made it flexible,
so that it would move.

00:06:28.436 --> 00:06:30.506
&gt;&gt;Ken: Yeah, I just
wanna change my clothes

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:32.106
and appearance in the open sim.

00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:35.076
&gt;&gt;Sam: Go to your inventory
and click create at the top.

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:39.516
&gt;&gt;Ken: You know, I can understand
how my parents feel now, you know,

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:43.346
taking advice from a younger
person, but I'm pretty impressed.

00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:45.956
I kinda wish I knew some of
this stuff when I was thirteen.

00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:47.386
Probably help me out a lot now.

00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:50.136
&gt;&gt;Sam: Then you can
be a guy if you want.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:51.176
&gt;&gt;Ken: Nice.

00:06:51.676 --> 00:06:54.906
&gt;&gt;Dave: Sam just picks
up on technology so easy.

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:58.796
She'll just explore the application
or the laptop and the cameras

00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:02.856
and just spend all day
at it, just having fun.

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:04.126
&gt;&gt;Sam: Yes, that was me.

00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:05.326
I am Sam.

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:05.776
&gt;&gt;Sam I am.

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:09.316
&gt;&gt;So this is the end
of the video, so...

00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:14.116
&gt;&gt;I saw this link for
a virtual piano.

00:07:14.116 --> 00:07:17.006
It shows you what note to hit.

00:07:17.006 --> 00:07:19.706
And I would write down the
notes on the piece of paper.

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:24.976
Then I'd go downstairs
and I would practice it.

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:41.326
&gt;&gt;[Sam playing piano].

00:07:41.826 --> 00:07:43.876
