DYLAN THOMAS: Hello, and
welcome to "What in the World."

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.670
This is a regular show where
Enterprise Googlers talk

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.892
about an interesting topic
for Maps or Business.

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:16.850
My name's Dylan Thomas.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.100
I'm a Maps community
manager, and joining me today

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.770
is Avnish Bhatnagar, who's a
technical solutions engineer.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.680
Hi, Avnish.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.150
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Hi, Dylan.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.320
It's a pleasure
to be here today.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.194
DYLAN THOMAS: Thanks.

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:27.630
So you're an expert on
Google Earth Enterprise.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630
And today you want to
show us a bit about what's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.429
coming up in the 5.0 release.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.720
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: That's right.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.760
We have a lot of
exciting new features.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.680
We've listened to our customers
about many of the feature

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.910
requests that they've
asked for over the years.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.860
And we're really
pleased to announce

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.519
that we implemented
many of them.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.935
DYLAN THOMAS: So
I think today you

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:51.490
were going to talk about
the new publishing workflow.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.787
You're going to talk about
alpha masking and WMS.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.370
But I think first you wanted to
just say a few words about how

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.780
this release fits into the
broader picture of the product

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.580
plan, right?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.871
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: That's right.

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:03.620
Google Earth Enterprise
is an important component

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.980
of the overall ground
to cloud strategy

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.590
at Google, wherein you
could take layers that

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.470
may exist in Google
Earth Enterprise-- online

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.850
or offline in Google
Earth Enterprise.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.830
You could cut those globes that
you have in those two platforms

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.515
and serve them all together
in a single unified way.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:28.390
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.890
So we're sort of removing the
boundary between the products,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.820
in some sense, by letting you
take data from Maps Engine

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.030
and serve it with
Earth Enterprise,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.800
or take data from Maps
Engine and serve it

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.169
with another product entirely,
like the portable, right?

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:43.460
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly,
through the portable server,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.870
that's sort of the
common denominator

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.899
that bridges Google Earth
Enterprise and Maps Engine.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.440
DYLAN THOMAS: All
right, well, thanks

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.760
for sort of setting
the scene there.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.720
So I guess, why don't we take
a look at some demos now?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080
I think you were going to
start with the new publishing

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.702
workflow.

00:01:57.702 --> 00:01:58.660
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Yeah.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.210
So I have here my Fusion
machine that I've logged in to.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.009
So as before, I just go
ahead and launch Fusion.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.360
And this may look familiar--
not too many changes

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.310
on the front end of Fusion.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.020
And these are some
databases, both 2D and 3D,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.870
that I've already
built here in Fusion.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.600
So if I start with the
3D one, for example,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.750
this BlueMarble database, a
very simple BlueMarble database

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.160
with a few vector layers.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.110
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.000
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: If
I right click on this,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.545
you'll note that the option for
push is there, but not publish.

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:44.420
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.920
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
And the reason is,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.280
is we've decoupled
Fusion and Server.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.850
Publishing now is a
server-side function.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.560
And that goes a long
way in simplifying

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.980
the overall workflow,
wherein before, you had to,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.585
on your server, create what's
called these virtual servers.

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:07.260
A virtual server was essentially
one part Apache virtual server

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.610
and one part the
publisher mapping

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.740
that existed in Google
Earth Enterprise.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.050
And to be honest, it's somewhat
complicated to properly create

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.290
that virtual server with
the Apache directives,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.070
configure it.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.565
And so that's vastly
simplified now.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:26.440
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.606
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: All you
need to know now in Fusion

00:03:28.606 --> 00:03:30.844
is build your database and
push it to your server.

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:31.760
DYLAN THOMAS: Perfect.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.037
So it's just way simpler, one
concept instead of a couple.

00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:36.120
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.980
So I've already
built my database,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830
so I'm going to go
ahead and push it.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.620
When you say Push, I have
one server association

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.930
that's built out of
the box called Public.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.030
And I select the version of
the database I want to push,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.250
and I say Push.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.770
It gives me the database
successfully pushed.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.180
So now what I'm going to
do is go to my server.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.520
And this is something that's
new in that there is now

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.530
an actual user interface, a
web-based UI for the server.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.950
If I just type in
the URL of my server,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.230
I'm presented with
a splash page that

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.450
confirms the version I have.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.430
And at the top right is
a button that says Admin.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.230
I click on that.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.540
And typically, I'd be presented
with a username and password,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.970
which in this case
has been saved.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.330
But the idea is that
only administrators

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.660
should have access
to this admin page.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.460
So this admin page, number
one, functions as a dashboard.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.720
Tells me right off the bat
how many databases do I have,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.890
how many of them are published,
what my disk storage is

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.700
like, what the cutter status is.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.850
So in one unified view, I can
get a snapshot of my server.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.814
DYLAN THOMAS: So in
a 4.x environment,

00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:03.230
let's say the
current environment,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.540
how do you get this
information right now?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.830
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Well, since
there was no single UI in 4.4,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.360
you had to get this information
through the command line.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.235
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:19.481
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Various
command lines and-- yeah, you

00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.730
would have to extract that
from different [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.596
DYLAN THOMAS: So [? in ?]
5.0, you can still do that.

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:25.720
We're not taking that away.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.295
You can still get that
information in that way

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:29.440
if you've got scripts that
pull from it or what have you.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.040
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.840
DYLAN THOMAS: But this just
gives you a much easier option

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.090
to get everything in one shot.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.090
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Right.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.010
It really, I think, facilitates
management of your server.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.515
Under Settings, I
can also look at-- I

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:43.960
have direct links to
my documentation, which

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.784
is bundled with the product.

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:48.200
So it's not reaching
out to Google

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.310
to get the documentation.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.300
It's in the product itself.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.720
I have a link to my Apache logs.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.780
Oftentimes, when
something goes wrong,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.020
the first place you want
to look is in the logs.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.340
So now we have a direct link to
the access log and error log.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.700
And I can launch my
cutter from here.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.060
In other words, if I want
to cut my 2D or 3D globe,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.730
I can launch that as well,
directly from the UI.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.082
But let's now go to Databases.

00:06:19.082 --> 00:06:21.290
DYLAN THOMAS: Because we're
trying to publish, right?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.520
We're trying to
finish the second part

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.600
of that process you started.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.683
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:29.080
So you might recall, I published
my BlueMarble database-- sorry,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.430
I pushed it from
Fusion to my server.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.590
So it's showing up right here.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.610
There's an entry for
BlueMarble version 15.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.830
And it shows that the status
is currently unpublished.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.810
So all I have to do is
select it, click on Publish.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.780
And here is where I
select a publish point.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.680
This is what we used to call,
in the past, virtual servers,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.160
where this part of
the publish point

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.990
is what defines
how users are going

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.730
to connect to your [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.560
DYLAN THOMAS: So
the endpoint access

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.920
they would use-- in their
client to connect to the server.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Right.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.880
So I could call it
something simple, like demo.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.960
I tell it what search tabs
I want in this database.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.820
And note that I can mix and
match what types of search tabs

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.890
I want.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.000
It's all specified right
here in this single box.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.650
Snippets-- also something that
I no longer add in Fusion,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.830
but I put in right here
when I'm publishing.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.070
And the advantage of that is
I can have different snippet

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.210
profiles for different
publish points.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.180
So that way if I
had a secure globe

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.800
and I only wanted
certain logos to appear

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.010
on that secure globe,
certain search tabs,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.370
I can define that here.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.150
Whereas if I wanted
a public globe that

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.200
has this same underlying data
but with different search

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.530
tabs and different snippets, I
can manage all that right here.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.660
By default, there's only one
virtual host, which is public.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.960
If I wanted to create
a new one like secure,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.530
I could do that and add in
all my LDAP or authentication

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.630
credentials.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.580
And here's where
I select whether I

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.230
want WMS enabled on
this globe or not.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.790
So I say Yes.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.420
DYLAN THOMAS: We're going
to get to that in a minute,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:14.900
though, right?

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.020
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.990
And then I click on Publish.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.950
Done.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.280
DYLAN THOMAS: Great.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.529
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: At this
point, my endpoint is ready.

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:24.330
My globe is ready to be served.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.760
If I click on that again, I
can even preview it right here

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.320
within the browser.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:37.830
It's going to open up my--
basically, as you can see here,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.220
the URL is basically that
of my GE server slash demo.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.940
And in this case, it's trying
to load it in the plug-in.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.190
As the plug-in loads,
I can also directly

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:55.675
connect from EC, the Enterprise
Client, which I'll launch here.

00:08:55.675 --> 00:08:57.300
DYLAN THOMAS: So the
publishing process

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.120
is pretty much instantaneous?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.203
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.210
Because it's essentially
just a mount point.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.432
And there's my globe in EC.

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:11.140
DYLAN THOMAS: So again,
just to reiterate

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.790
on sort of this new
publishing workflow,

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.790
there's the separation
of concerns, if you like,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.060
just doing what's
appropriate at which stage.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.160
We're not taking
away functionality

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.739
with command-line-driven
workflows

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:21.822
that you may already have.

00:09:21.822 --> 00:09:24.430
But we're just giving you
a really easy, new way

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.647
to accomplish this in a UI.

00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:26.730
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.930
We're just decoupling
the publishing function,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.310
moving all publishing
functions to the server, which

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.200
is really where they belong.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.991
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:34.059
Great, thanks.

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:36.350
So why don't we move on and
look at the next two items?

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.800
The first was alpha
masking, and I

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.824
think we're going to revisit
the WMS item, as well.

00:09:42.824 --> 00:09:44.240
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
So alpha masking

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.870
is a feature that folks have
asked for quite some time.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.670
And the use case
is this-- let's say

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.940
I have some really
high-resolution imagery

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.750
over Mountain View, California.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.970
The rest of my imagery, though,
is not so high resolution.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.960
And in fact, I want to get
that from some other place,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.520
some other database.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.470
So I can now build
my imagery project

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.370
to just have the high-resolution
imagery for Mountain View.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.340
In the past, we've asked
that you have a base

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.140
layer with worldwide coverage.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.319
That's no longer necessary.

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:24.610
We've removed that restriction.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.590
So as an example, let's go back
to my Fusion interface here.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:35.510
And if I pull up
my imagery project,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.790
I have an imagery project here
that consisted of just Cuba.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.770
And I chose Cuba
just because it's

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:46.790
an island with some interesting
features along the coastline.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.040
So I had some high-resolution
imagery of just Cuba.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.927
And I included
that in a database

00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:55.135
which I've already published.

00:10:55.135 --> 00:10:58.240
If I go back here
to my server UI,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.310
I have this BlueMarble
version 13 database,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.150
which is published at
mount point slash cuba.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.400
And I can see that's
already published.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.960
It tells me when I
published it and the size.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.650
So if I go now to EC, and I
connect to my server slash

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:31.130
cuba, you can see here
that the entire globe

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.100
is blank except for Cuba.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.760
So this is my high-resolution
imagery just for that region.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.690
So now I want to overlay
this, essentially,

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.282
on a base of lower resolution
imagery from another database,

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:49.240
from some other source.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.710
Now, that could be Google,
through kh.google.com,

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.870
if you have a license
of Google Earth Pro.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.120
Or it could be another Google
Earth Enterprise database.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.000
So I'm simply going
to say Add Database.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.482
And I happen to have
another internal GEE server

00:12:05.482 --> 00:12:06.940
running, which I'm
going to connect

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:14.190
to to pull in imagery for
the rest of the world.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.930
And there you go.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:23.920
So if I zoom in to
Cuba now, there's

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.940
my imagery for Cuba,
overlaid on top

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.794
of the imagery of the world.

00:12:29.794 --> 00:12:30.585
DYLAN THOMAS: Nice.

00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:31.668
And you can see them both.

00:12:34.715 --> 00:12:36.590
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Now,
the order does matter.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:42.520
In this case, the imagery
of my secondary database

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.490
is being overlaid on top
of my imagery of Cuba.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.150
So usually, I'd want
to switch that, right?

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:55.640
So typically, then I would
connect to the imagery of Cuba.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.870
That database, I would
connect to that second.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.745
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.173
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: So I
can simply say Disconnect.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.520
So I'd probably want
to first connect

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.680
to my database that
has worldwide coverage

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:20.050
and then add the database
that has the imagery of Cuba.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.320
And there you go.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:21.960
DYLAN THOMAS: So
the alpha masking

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.730
is really a pretty
straightforward feature

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.230
in terms of the
end-user experience.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.030
It just makes a lot of sense,
it's how you want to see it,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.946
but that's something
that hasn't been possible

00:13:29.946 --> 00:13:31.281
at all until [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:31.780
Great.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.154
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
Right, and this

00:13:33.154 --> 00:13:36.860
is a feature which, if you
decide you want in 5.0,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.300
you would need to rebuild
your imagery resource.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.435
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:41.435 --> 00:13:43.560
DYLAN THOMAS: Because I
think the one of the things

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.790
our customers are asking at
this point is about the need

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:51.500
to rebuild databases, the need
to make changes to their core

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.000
assets.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.605
And you're saying this is one
of those new features that

00:13:53.605 --> 00:13:54.330
will require it.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.705
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
The bottom line

00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:58.700
is you only have to rebuild your
resources and projects if you

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.260
want to get some of
these new features.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:01.980
DYLAN THOMAS: OK.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.090
Well, let's round it out then
with a closer look at the WMS

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.620
feature.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.036
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
OK, yeah, that's

00:14:07.036 --> 00:14:10.970
a really exciting feature
that folks have asked for,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.730
especially users of
various OpenGIS tools.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:21.370
I can make a 2D or a 3D
map accessible through WMS,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.590
and all that
involves is enabling

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:30.390
any one of these
globes-- 2D or 3D.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.730
I'll start with 2D, say
this one right here.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.100
I have already published
this, but I just

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.940
want to enable WMS on this.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.430
And let me make sure I'm
serving the latest version here.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.680
10/17-- yep, that's today.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.725
OK, so it's already published.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.203
Serve WMS.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.480
And it says, actually, that
target path is already in use.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:10.905
So maybe I should choose
a new one, like demo2d.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.470
If I wanted to add search
tabs to this database,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.047
I could, too, right here.

00:15:20.047 --> 00:15:21.630
DYLAN THOMAS: Your
point here, though,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.921
is that it's very, very simple.

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:25.516
Even if you've got
it serving already,

00:15:25.516 --> 00:15:27.390
you can just go back
and add that capability.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.098
It's very simple.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:30.530
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.580
The publish points are
dynamically created.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.060
It doesn't involve restarting
the server any time

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.296
you make a change or
anything like that.

00:15:38.296 --> 00:15:40.420
DYLAN THOMAS: So I know
you can do 3D globes, also.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.266
But why don't we
take a look at what

00:15:42.266 --> 00:15:43.390
the client experience here?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.814
I think you have an example
of what this feels like.

00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:47.230
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
Yeah, so this is

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:53.860
a preview of my very simple
2D natural earth map here.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.755
And it doesn't have very many
layers-- some urban areas,

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.740
some country borders,
and that's about it.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.540
So now let's confirm that
it's being served via WMS.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.790
So you typically want to launch
whatever your preferred OpenGIS

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.190
WMS client might be.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.645
In this case, I'm
going to launch QGIS.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.385
And over here, I
say Add a WMS Layer.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.400
And you specify your
WMS server here.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.620
Make sure the
endpoint's correct.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.990
The one I created was demo2d.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.080
Type that in, /wms.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.565
If it has a username
or password,

00:16:36.565 --> 00:16:39.360
you enter that there, too.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.900
And then I say Connect.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.640
So now it's essentially
done a Get Capabilities

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.360
request on my WMS
server and seen,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.030
oh, I have three layers
available-- imagery,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.770
urban areas, and
country borders.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:17:00.180
So now I can add the desired
layers into my QGIS workspace.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.120
I'm going to add
country borders, then

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.770
urban areas, and
then my imagery.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.740
And if you want to reshuffle,
I guess, the rendering order,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.045
you can just move
any of those up.

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:21.920
DYLAN THOMAS: So just
like the alpha masking,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.839
this looks pretty
straightforward stuff.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.099
And in fact, it is.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.710
But being new in 5.0 is
a pretty major feature

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.170
and a major new capability
that customers, as you said,

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.920
have been asking for
for a very long time.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.890
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Exactly.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.140
DYLAN THOMAS: So this is a
pretty exciting one for us.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.140
And this is WMS 1.3,
and I believe 1.1, also.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.400
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Correct.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.110
Yeah, we support up to WMS 1.3.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:47.460
And as I zoom in, you can
start to see the layers.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.700
It might be necessary to
disable some of those.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:18:03.070
Let's see-- depending on
what's being rendered on top.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.720
You can see down here in the
lower left the actual WMS

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.840
request that's being made.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.750
DYLAN THOMAS: Great.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.130
Well, let me wrap up with one
quick question for you, then.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.660
You're in the Geo
Support team, so you're

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.370
the one who gets all
the tough questions

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.600
at the end of the day.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.225
Is there anything
about the 5.0 release

00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:31.790
that you think is going to
be difficult for customers

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.230
or might trip them up at all?

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.860
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: Not too
much that I would anticipate.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.870
One feature we have
implemented is sort of

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.300
gravitated towards
Mercator map projections.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.105
So for 2D maps, we
support Mercator only now.

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:50.980
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.640
OK.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.920
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
And that involves

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.495
rebuilding your
imagery projects.

00:18:57.495 --> 00:18:58.870
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh,
OK, but I think

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.994
this is something that
we've announced to our Earth

00:19:00.994 --> 00:19:02.924
Enterprise customers for
some time now, right?

00:19:02.924 --> 00:19:05.090
So this shouldn't-- hopefully
no surprise to anyone.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.770
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
That's correct.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:06.300
DYLAN THOMAS: But
it's just something,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.060
another one of those--

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.740
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
Something to be aware of.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.250
DYLAN THOMAS: And I think
you've worked on the integration

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.990
guide-- or the upgrade
guide, I should

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.415
say-- of this new version.

00:19:13.415 --> 00:19:15.040
AVNISH BHATNAGAR: In
the upgrade guide,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.190
and there will be some white
papers on possible solutions

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.160
that, if you do have a
flat database on migration

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.340
strategies, how to
continue to serve

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.560
that flat database as
a Mercator, et cetera.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.294
So we'll offer solutions
along those lines.

00:19:31.294 --> 00:19:32.710
DYLAN THOMAS:
That's good to know.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.860
Well, Avnish, thanks so much for
taking the time to talk with us

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.215
today about the 5.0 release.

00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:38.590
AVNISH BHATNAGAR:
You're welcome.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.890
DYLAN THOMAS: And
we'll see you next time

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.848
on "What in the World."

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.580
Thank you.
