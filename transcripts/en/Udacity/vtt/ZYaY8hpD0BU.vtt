00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.600
So here's the application that you're
going to build over the next few

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.230
minutes.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.360
It's a simple app that gives you
your latitude and your longitude,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.460
helping you to accurately
position yourself on the globe.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.710
Now as you can imagine, there's lots of
great uses for this kind of information.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.690
One of the first mobile apps I
personally ever built was for

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.010
dog walkers.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.030
They would run the app when they
walked the dog for someone else so

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.140
that the dog's owner could
see the path of the walk.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.510
It worked by taking a very
accurate latitude and

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.870
longitude reading every few seconds.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.270
In this case, of course,
we're just taking it once.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.590
But let's see how you would do that.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.150
Let's see how you would get
that type of information.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.990
In the previous lesson, we were getting
continuous updates on the location, but

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.190
in this one we're going to
do it a little differently.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.690
We're going to get the latitude and
longitude only once upon connection.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.070
Now I think it's important
to learn by doing, so

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.430
we're going to learn how to build
this application by stepping through

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.640
what needs to be done little by little.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.940
So if you haven't already done so, open
Android Studio and create a new project.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.610
Give it a name, in this case
I'm calling it Location2_1, and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.620
you're going to pick it to
have a single blank activity.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.660
So you can see here in this option
I'm going to say blank activity,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.320
I'm going to give it
a single blank activity, and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.450
I'm going to keep all the defaults.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.020
And when Android Studio's finished doing
its thing, you'll have your project

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.900
created for you, and the activity,
generally by default, is opened.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.290
But if it isn't,
just find the layout folder and

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.490
look for
activity_main within that folder.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.820
Then you can see that this is
the basic hello world layout that's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.180
created for you.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.067
So what we're going to do is we're
going to just take a look at the tags

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:30.708
for this, and

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:34.300
we can see in here there's a TextView
simply containing the words hello world.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.730
In the next couple of steps we're
going to change this to update it for

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.810
the UI that we showed in
the demonstration just a moment ago.
