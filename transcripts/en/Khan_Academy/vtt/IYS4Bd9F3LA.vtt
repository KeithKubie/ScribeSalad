00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:02.630
Let's say you and I are
playing a game where we're

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.390
trying to figure out how high a
ball is being thrown in the air

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.460
or how fast that we're
throwing that ball in the air.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.540
And what we do is
one of us has a ball

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.850
and the other one has
a stopwatch over here.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.400
So this is my best attempt.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.150
It looks more like a
cat than a stopwatch,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.507
but I think you get the idea.

00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:20.340
And what we do is one
of us throws the ball,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.674
and the other one times how
long the ball is in the air.

00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:24.090
And then what we
do is we're going

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.890
to use that time in
the air to figure out

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.380
how fast the ball was
thrown straight up,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.244
and how long it was in the
air and how high it got.

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:34.410
And there's going to be one
assumption I make here--

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.430
and frankly, this
is an assumption

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.840
that we're going to make
in all of these projectile

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.550
motion-type problems-- is that
air resistance is negligible.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.380
And for something like-- if
this is a baseball, or something

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.669
like that, that's a
pretty good approximation.

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:51.460
So we're not going to
get the exact answer.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.437
And I encourage you to
experiment on your own

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:57.020
to see what air resistance does
relative to your calculations.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.785
But we're going to assume
for this projectile motion--

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.160
and really all of
the future ones

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.300
or at least in the
basic physics playlist--

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.690
we're going to assume that
air resistance is negligible.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.910
And what that does for
us is that we can assume

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.640
that the time for the ball
to go up to its peak height

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.084
is the same thing as the time
that it takes to go down.

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:18.500
If you look at
this previous video

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.660
where we plotted
displacement versus time,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.330
you see after 2 seconds the ball
went from being on the ground--

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.870
or I guess the thrower's hand--
all the way to its peak height.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.980
And in the next 2 seconds, it
took that same amount of time

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.410
to go back down to the
ground, which makes sense.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.110
Whatever the
initial velocity is,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.130
it takes half the
time to go to 0.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.900
And it takes that
same amount of time

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.460
to now be accelerating
in the downward direction

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.310
back to that same
magnitude of velocity

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.470
but now in the
downward direction.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.970
So let's play around
with some numbers

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.040
here just so we get a little
bit more of a concrete sense.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.100
So let's say I throw
a ball in the air.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.010
And you measure,
using the stopwatch,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.020
that the ball is in
the air for 5 seconds.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.410
So how do we figure out
how fast I threw the ball?

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.930
Well, the first
thing we can do is

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.930
we could say, look, if
the total time in the air

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.730
was 5 seconds, that means that
the time-- let me write it.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.680
That means that
the change in time

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280
to go up during the
first half of, I guess,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.490
the ball's time in the air
is going to be 2.5 seconds.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.180
Which tells us that
over this 2.5 seconds,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.650
we went from our initial
velocity, whatever it was,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.710
we went from our
initial velocity

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.450
to our final velocity,
which is a velocity

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.700
of 0 meters per second
in the 2 and 1/2 seconds.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.450
And this isn't the
graph for that example.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.020
This is the graph for the
previous example where

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.120
we knew the initial velocity.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.710
But in whatever
that time is, you're

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.900
going from your initial velocity
to being stationary at the top,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.500
right?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.083
Right when the ball
is stationary then

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.060
it starts getting
increasing velocity

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.410
in the downward direction.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.060
So it takes 2.5 seconds to
go from some initial velocity

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.830
to 0 seconds.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.140
So we do know what the
acceleration of gravity is.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.730
We know that the acceleration
of gravity here--

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.221
we're assuming it's constant,
although it's slightly not

00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:15.720
constant.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.930
But we're going to
assume it's constant,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.490
if we're just dealing close
to the surface of the earth--

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.010
is negative 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.680
So let's think about it.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.020
Our change in velocity
is the final velocity

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.490
minus the initial
velocity, which

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.220
is the same thing as 0 minus
the initial velocity, which

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.060
is the negative of
the initial velocity.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.700
And what's another way to
think about change in velocity?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.390
Well, just from the
definition of acceleration,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.650
change in velocity is
equal to acceleration--

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.550
negative 9.8 meters per
second squared-- times time,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.176
or times change in time.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.800
We're just talking
about the first half

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.640
of the ball's time in the air.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.630
So our change in time is 2.5
seconds-- times 2.5 seconds.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.440
So what is our
change in velocity,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.649
which is also the same
thing as the negative

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.680
of our initial velocity?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.200
Let me get my calculator,
bring it onto the screen.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.280
So it is negative 9.8 meters
per second times 2.5 seconds.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.220
It gives us negative 24.5.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.440
So this gives us-- let me
write it in a new color.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.950
This gives us negative
24.5 meters per second.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.000
This second cancels out
with one of these seconds

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.960
in the denominator, so we only
have one in the denominator

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.670
now, so it's meters per second.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.710
And this is the same thing as
the negative initial velocity.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.490
That's the same thing as
our change in velocity.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.160
And so you multiply both
sides by a negative.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.860
We get our initial velocity.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.740
So that simply we were
able to figure out

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.330
what our velocity was.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.600
So literally you take the
total time in the air,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.640
take it and divide
it by 2, and then

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.530
multiply that by the
acceleration of gravity.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.180
And I guess you could take
the absolute value of that

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.220
or you take the positive
version of that.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.340
And then that gives you
your initial velocity.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.040
So your initial velocity
here is literally

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.460
24.5 meters per second.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.240
And since it's a
positive quantity,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.280
it is upwards in this example.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.540
So that's my initial velocity.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.700
So we already figured
out part of this game,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.810
the initial velocity
that I threw it upwards.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.440
And that's also
going to be-- we're

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.940
going to have the same
magnitude of velocity

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.606
when the ball's about
to hit the ground,

00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:54.740
although it's going to be
in the other direction.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.810
So what is the distance--
or let me make it clear.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.170
What is the displacement of the
ball from its lowest point--

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.090
right when it leaves your
hand-- all the way to the peak?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.700
Well, we just have to remember--
and once again, all this

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.750
comes from very straightforward
ideas, change in velocity

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.356
is equal to acceleration
times change in time.

00:06:16.356 --> 00:06:17.730
And then the other
simple idea is

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:26.690
that displacement is equal
to average velocity times

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.410
change in time.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.490
Now, what is our
average velocity?

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.360
Our average velocity is
your initial velocity

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.520
plus your final
velocity divided by 2,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.450
if we assume
acceleration is constant.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.070
So it's literally just
the arithmetic mean

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.800
of your initial and
final velocities.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.630
So what is that?

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.460
That's going to be 24.5
meters per second plus--

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.770
what's our final velocity?

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.186
In this situation,
remember, we're

00:06:52.186 --> 00:06:54.020
just going over the
first 2.5 seconds.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.740
So our final velocity is once
again 0 meters per second.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.340
We're just talking
about when we get

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.380
to this point right over here.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.730
So our final velocity is
just 0 meters per second.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.720
And we're just going
to divide that by 2.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.290
This will give us
the average velocity.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:16.930
And then we want to multiply
that times 2.5 seconds.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.580
So we get-- this part right
over here-- 24.5 divided by 2.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.570
We can ignore the 0.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:30.940
That still is 24.5 That
gives us 12.25 times 2.5.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.190
And remember, this right
over here is in seconds.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.180
Let me write the units down.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.525
So this is 12.25 meters per
second times 2.5 seconds.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.650
And just to remind
ourselves, we're

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.450
calculating the displacement
over the first 2 and 1/2

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.710
seconds.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.400
So this gives us-- I'll get
the calculator out once again.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:02.400
We have 12.25 times 2.5
seconds gives us 30.625.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.600
So this gives us--
so our displacement

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:16.402
is 30.625 meters-- these
seconds cancel out-- meters.

00:08:16.402 --> 00:08:17.360
This is actually a ton.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.020
This is roughly, give or
take, about 90 feet thrown

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.570
in the air.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.403
So this would be like
a nine-story building.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.410
And I, frankly, do not
have the arm for that.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.490
But if someone is
able to throw the ball

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.260
for 5 seconds in
the air, they have

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.857
thrown it 30 meters in the air.

00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:33.690
Well, hopefully you
found that entertaining.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.570
In the next video,
I'll generalize this.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.320
Maybe we can get a
little bit of a formula

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.419
so maybe you can generalize it.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.940
So regardless of the
measurement of time,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.159
you can get the
displacement in the air.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.710
Or even better, try to
derive it yourself and we'll

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.400
see how at least I tackle
it in the next video.
