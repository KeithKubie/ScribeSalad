00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.240
There are several hard problems when designing software.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.100
I'm not talking about computer science hard problems like NP-complete things.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.460
I mean hard problems of design, and internationalisation is one of the worst.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.420
Let's imagine you started a social network. Let's imagine that you made it for English-speaking users.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.700
First problem is when someone called ChloÃ« joins,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.660
'cause ChloÃ« has an umlaut above her 'e' and is angry that she can't put her name in properly.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.960
So, okay, you say "I'll open up and add a few more accent characters."

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.180
Well, then someone Icelandic calls in, and he's got an eth in his name. Looks like that.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.380
Looks like that. Sounds like 'th.'

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.500
"Fine," you say. "So let's use all of Unicode."

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.440
And then someone probably breaks your site because there's control characters in Unicode that break everything.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.280
OK, fine, so you work out which characters are allowed to be used in names and you just stick to those.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.760
I mean, that's like 30,000 characters when you include all of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760
but never mind! You put it in.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.420
And then you start getting some users in other countries.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.800
First problem you get is France.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
Your French translator calls and says,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.780
"Look, you've got a "Like" button here, and what I want to put in is "J'aime" -- "I like" --

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.320
but it's not quite big enough? I need you to make the button bigger?"

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.520
And there's problems like this all over the place where sentences that take five syllables in English

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.500
actually take a whole two-paragraph description in some other language.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.080
So you tweak the design. You make it so that the lengths of texts can change.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.060
And then you start working out that what you really want to do is have some kind of drop-in system.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.040
So, in English, you can just put in "%NAME likes this."

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.400
And then you can send that over to the translators and --

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.360
see, this is where I should really speak more than one language --

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
but they can send back -- um, I'm gonna make up a language here --

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
ah, they can say something like "Mana %NAME adilo,"

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.340
which, in their language, means "so-and-so likes this."

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.100
Great! That system's gonna work! You can just send a load of text blocks to them and they can send it b--

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.680
"Hello? Ah, Italy. Yes. What's with -- right, you need to know the gender of everyone using this network.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.480
Why do you need to know that?"

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.940
Italian language relies on gender.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.800
The words in the sentence change depending on whether you're talking about a man or a woman.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.940
Well, that's, that's irritating 'cause you haven't asked users for gender.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.820
Facebook have this exact problem.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.060
But, OK, you start asking and the translators start sending back strings,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.260
and now, of course, anyone who doesn't fit immediately into male or female,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.180
and, if that surprises you, you need to get out more,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.000
but anyone who doesn't fit into those categories, well, now they're angry that they have to go into one or the other.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.560
You have to ask them, "Well, languages don't support that. Which one are we going with?"

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.460
And, in fact, there's a lot of translators calling back and saying they can't support that.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.740
OK. You move past that. You dam down the storm and it moves on,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.360
and then you get a call from France again.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.980
They say, "By the way, you've got a singular and a plural here, but you can't use the plural for 0.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.180
We don't say that something has 'no likes, we say that it has 'no like,'

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.440
and 'one like,' and then 'two likes.'"

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.820
So, okay, I can put a special case in for that. And a few others call in and say,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.080
"Um, yeah, we don't just have singular and plural. We have singular and dual and plural.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.340
Our words change depending on whether there's one of something, two of something, or many of something."

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.620
OK. Great. Right. Special case in for that.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.100
And then, then, your Polish translator calls and they say,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.720
"Right. We've got a paucal."

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.320
Paucal is where you have a singular and then you have a different plural

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.120
depending on whether the number of things ends with 2, 3, and 4, or some other digit!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.740
OK. Great. Fine. Put a special case in for that.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.640
And then your Romanian translator calls

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.100
"Yeah, we need a different plural for any group of objects greater than 20."

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.300
OK. And then you finally get every different plural rule for every language in there,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.100
and now the translators are vaguely happy.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.660
Then your Icelandic translator calls, and they say,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.080
"Right. You've got this '%NAME' thing that I'm just meant to replace."

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.340
Icelandic changes how the names appear depending on what else is in the sentence.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.100
You might have "Tom." Then it might become "Toma" or "Tomi,"

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.520
and there are whole names that this doesn't work with because they don't fit the Icelandic pattern.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.660
You put all that in somehow, and then, then your German translator calls and is like,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.400
"Look, you've got this uppercase and lowercase in.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.560
You wanna put stuff in big, bold uppercase letters sometimes, and I get that,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.240
but we have this double 's' character. When you turn it to uppercase, it becomes two S's,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.340
except sometimes when it doesn't, like in geographic names. Can you deal with that?"

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.200
OK. Right. Yes. I'll make sure we deal with that,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.760
but that's not even the start of it, because then your Arabic translator calls, and they say,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.280
"Right. You're doing this thing where you take an excerpt from a post.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.860
You're taking the first 50 characters and then you're just putting a '...' on the end,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.020
and that works for some languages, but not in Arabic. You can't just chop a word in half,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.760
because the letters in one bit of the word change depending on the letters elsewhere.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.660
They all merge together into one nice, flowing thing,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.260
and computers can deal with that, but you can't just crop it halfway through!"

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.420
OK. Fine. Go with that. Then the Arabic translator goes on to say,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.940
"By the way, you're dealing with right-to-left text, right?"

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.900
Of course you're not. You haven't thought of that because, because surely all languages go left-to-right.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.120
No, Arabic, Hebrew, they go right-to-left.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.100
And you say, "OK. I can kind of flip the whole design around so it still works that way?"

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.520
And they say, "Yeah, that would work, but then you're gonna have left-to-right names in the middle of right-to-left text,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.520
because you're gonna talk about someone who has a name in a different character set.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.140
Just make sure it can deal with that."

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.440
Oh... Then, if you're British, your American translator calls, or vice versa, and they say,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.540
"You need to make sure the date format is right."

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.220
Because Americans, for some bizarre reason, do month-day-year. Brits, day-month-year.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.300
And, by the way, in America, the week starts on a Sunday, and in Britain, the week starts on a Monday,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.880
so you've gotta change all your calendars around,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.680
and, by the way, Europe wants 24-hour clocks and America wants 12-hour clocks, and -- numbers!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.700
Oh, God, we haven't started on numbers yet!

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:20.980
Because Europe wants "256.341,2." The comma and the full stop, or the period.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.980
If you're American, they're around the other way!

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.840
Yeah, OK, you can deal with that and then, then the icing on the cake is your Indian translator calls

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840
and says they have the Indian numbering system.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:37.000
You don't say "100,000." They have the crore and the lakh, so they would group it like that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.540
And it all becomes incredibly, overly complicated and the last time I did a rant like this,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.760
I said that what you do is you get someone else's timezone code and you treat it as a black box.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.140
That, that doesn't work here because languages are infinitely more complex and subtle,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.020
and there are so many changes that will be unique to whatever it is you're designing.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.220
The black box that Facebook uses for translation won't work for whatever you're doing.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.060
It won't work if you're designing software for Windows or Mac or Linux or iPhone.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.300
You can use certain references, certain functions, certain little things to make it easier,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.820
but ultimately you are going to have to go out and translate it and deal with all of this wonderful mess,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.840
or you do what programmers have done for many years, and say,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.740
"Yeah. We're just producing it in English."

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.020
