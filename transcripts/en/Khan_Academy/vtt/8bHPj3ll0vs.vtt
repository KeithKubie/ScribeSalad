00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:01.671
- [Voiceover] There's
a miniature rocketship

00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:04.195
and it's full of tiny
aliens that just got done

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:07.268
investigating a new moon with lunar pools

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:10.314
and all kinds of organic new life forms.

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.800
But they're done investigating,
so they're gonna blast off

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.732
and take their findings home
to tell all their friends.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.039
Let's say at some moment
during their ascent,

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.227
they're moving at four meters per second.

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:21.207
And they're tiny aliens,

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:25.034
their spaceship is only 2.9 kilograms,

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:26.826
but they need to know,
are they gonna be able

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.375
to get off this moon or not?

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:29.957
So they gotta pay
attention to their speed,

00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:32.142
but instead of using a speedometer,

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:35.478
they clever aliens, they use
a force versus time graph.

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:37.952
So on their dashboard, they've
got a force versus time graph

00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:40.958
and it tells them what
the net force is on them,

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.107
so let's say this is the net
force, not just any force,

00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:47.104
but this is the total force
on them from rocket boosters

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:49.913
and the force of gravity
and whatever other forces

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:52.672
there might be, they've
got advanced force sensors.

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:54.646
I mean come on, they can
determine their net force,

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:56.339
let's say, and it gives them this force

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.799
as a function of time.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.581
But they want to know what
is their velocity gonna be

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.372
after nine seconds?

00:01:02.372 --> 00:01:04.319
So they check their force
versus time readout,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.615
and this is the graph they get.

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:06.883
And now they can determine it.

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:07.785
And here's how they do it.

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:09.614
They say, "All right
there's a force, a net force

00:01:09.614 --> 00:01:13.631
"of three newtons acting
for the first four seconds."

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.890
So during this entire first four seconds

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.610
there's a constant force of three newtons.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.312
And every alien worth his weight knows

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:24.479
that force, the net force
multiplied by the time duration

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.584
during which that force is applied,

00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:29.340
gives you the net impulse.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.544
So this gives us the net impulse.

00:01:30.544 --> 00:01:34.032
If we take this constant
three newtons that acts,

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:37.171
multiplied by four seconds
during which it acts,

00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:40.053
we get that there's an
impulse of 12 newton seconds.

00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:42.543
And you might be like, "Wait, who cares

00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:45.402
"about newton seconds
here, I want the velocity.

00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:46.811
"I don't want the force and the time,

00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:50.040
"I want to know the
velocity at nine seconds."

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.794
But they teach you at
the alien space academy,

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:55.067
that the net impulse is not only equal

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:57.302
to the net force times the time,

00:01:57.302 --> 00:02:00.863
it's also equal to the change
in momentum of the object

00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:02.525
that the force was exerted on.

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:03.422
And this is good.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:04.978
We know the mass of the object.

00:02:04.978 --> 00:02:06.733
We wanna know something about velocity.

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.880
So we know momentum is M times V,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.541
this net impulse is
gonna help us get there.

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.288
But his 12 newton seconds was only

00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:14.832
for the first four seconds.

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:17.199
How do we figure it out
for the next three seconds?

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.032
Look at this.

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:20.781
During the next three seconds,
there's not a constant force,

00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.640
this force is varying, the
force is getting smaller.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.486
So how do I do this?

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.080
The force isn't a constant value,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.019
so I can't just simply
take force times time,

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.617
because, I mean, what force do I pick?

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.356
So we're gonna use a trick.

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:35.370
We're gonna use a trick,
because if you notice

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.028
for this first section,
for the first four seconds,

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.441
we took the force and multiplied

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.909
by the time interval, four seconds.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.771
So what we did really is we just took

00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:47.235
the height of this rectangle times

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:48.791
the width of this rectangle

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.871
and that gives us the
area of this rectangle.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.933
So what we really did is we found the area

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.313
under the force versus time graph.

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:58.648
That gave us the impulse and
that's not a coincidence.

00:02:58.648 --> 00:03:02.815
The impulse equals the area
under a force versus time graph,

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.666
and this is extremely useful to know,

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:08.949
because now in this section,
where the force was varying,

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.529
we can still use this, we
can just find the impulse

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.916
by determining the area under that curve.

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:18.130
And by area under the curve,
we mean from the line curve,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.486
in general, to the x-axis,
which, in this case,

00:03:21.486 --> 00:03:24.846
the x-axis is of the time axis.

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:25.679
So let's do this.

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.925
We found the impulse
for this first section.

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:29.919
That was 12 newton seconds.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.620
Now we can find the impulse
for this next section

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.378
by just determining the area.

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:35.376
So this is a triangle.

00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:40.221
We'll do 1/2 base, the base
is one, two, three seconds,

00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:43.058
and the height is still three newtons.

00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:46.891
So we get a net impulse
of 4.5 newton seconds.

00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:49.572
So we've got one more section to go,

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:51.262
but this one's a little
weird, this one's located,

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:54.744
the area is located below the time axis,

00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:56.333
so this is still a triangle,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.350
but since the forces are negative,

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.082
this is gonna count as
a negative net impulse.

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:03.062
So when the area lies above the time axis,

00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:04.797
it counts as a positive impulse,

00:04:04.797 --> 00:04:06.966
and when the area lies
below the time axis,

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:08.858
it counts as a negative net impulse.

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:10.362
So how much negative net impulse?

00:04:10.362 --> 00:04:11.787
We still find the area.

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:15.456
So the area of a triangle,
again, is gonna be 1/2,

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:17.682
the base this time is two seconds,

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:20.422
and the height is negative two.

00:04:20.422 --> 00:04:23.780
So negative two newtons,
which gives us a net impulse

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.116
of negative two newton seconds.

00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:27.585
And now we can figure out the velocity

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:30.733
of the spaceship at nine seconds.

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:34.381
So, assuming that this force
readout started at this moment

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:38.018
right over here at t equals zero seconds

00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:40.665
was the moment when it was
going four meters per second,

00:04:40.665 --> 00:04:44.441
then we could say the total
net impulse should equal

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.374
the total change in
momentum of this spaceship.

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.328
And we can find the total net impulse

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:52.428
by just adding up all
the individual impulses.

00:04:52.428 --> 00:04:53.988
So during the first four seconds,

00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:56.405
there was 12 newton seconds of impulse.

00:04:56.405 --> 00:04:58.044
During the next three seconds

00:04:58.044 --> 00:05:00.972
there was 4.5 newton seconds of impulse.

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:02.257
And during this last portion

00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:05.461
there was negative two
newton seconds of impulse,

00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:06.854
which if you add all of those up,

00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:09.697
12 plus 4.5 plus negative
two, you're gonna get

00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:13.030
positive 14.5 newton seconds of impulse.

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:16.899
That's good news for our
alien buddies over here,

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:18.552
they need to get off this moon,

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:21.426
which means they need positive
impulse, upward impulse.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:22.648
They got some positive impulse.

00:05:22.648 --> 00:05:24.284
Let's see what their final velocity was.

00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:27.033
We know that delta P is
the change in momentum,

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:31.145
so this is final momentum
minus initial momentum,

00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:32.249
which we could write as

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.774
mass times v final minus
mass times v initial.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:38.834
Now, if this were an earth
rocket, this would be hard,

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:41.234
'cause earth rockets
using earth technology,

00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:44.735
eject fuel at a huge rate out the backend,

00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.171
and that loses mass.

00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.451
That means this mass
isn't gonna stay constant.

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:51.526
So earth rockets
essentially push fuel down

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:53.192
which causes and equal and opposite force

00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:55.112
back on the rocket upward.

00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:57.833
But if you're losing mass, this
mass doesn't stay constant,

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.624
and this whole process is a lot harder,

00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:02.940
because m final and m initial
aren't gonna be the same.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.251
Maybe this is where the phrase,
"It's not rocket science"

00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:07.534
comes from, 'cause rocket
science is a little harder

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.833
when that mass changes.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:12.080
So let's just say, these
clever aliens can eject

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.928
only a little bit of fuel, they do so.

00:06:14.928 --> 00:06:16.054
You might say, "How?"

00:06:16.054 --> 00:06:18.319
Well, there's gotta be a certain
amount of momentum, right,

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.083
that they eject to give
themselves momentum up.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.823
But let's say they can
eject only a small mass

00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:26.577
at a huge speed, so there's not much fuel

00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:27.786
that they're losing.

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:30.829
The fuel that they eject is
ejected at enormous speed,

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:32.842
so that they get their momentum upward,

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:35.405
but they lose almost no mass.

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:36.869
And that let's us solve this problem

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:39.221
assuming that the mass is constant.

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.390
So if we do that, if we
assume the mass is constant,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.458
we get positive 14.5
newton seconds equals,

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:47.562
we can pull the mass out,
the mass is a constant,

00:06:47.562 --> 00:06:49.141
so we could just write it as

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:51.808
m times v final minus v initial,

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.626
since I can pull out a common factor of m,

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:58.649
which means I can write
this as 2.9 kilograms

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:01.759
multiplied by the final
velocity after nine seconds

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.692
and I know it's after nine
seconds, 'cause I added up

00:07:03.692 --> 00:07:06.136
all the impulse during the nine seconds,

00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:09.688
minus the initial velocity
was four meters per second.

00:07:09.688 --> 00:07:13.004
So if I divide both
sides by 2.9 kilograms,

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:17.389
14.5 over 2.9 is 5 and
that will be newton seconds

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.144
over kilograms which has
units of meters per second,

00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:22.155
and it's positive.

00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:24.633
And that's gonna equal
the leftover over here

00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:28.622
is gonna be v final minus
four meters per second.

00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:31.506
And now finally if I add
four meters per second

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:35.623
to both sides, I get the
v final somewhere up here,

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:40.319
v final of this rocket is gonna
be nine meters per second.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.692
So after nine seconds

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:44.123
it ended up going nine meters per second.

00:07:44.123 --> 00:07:46.268
That's just a numerical coincidence.

00:07:46.268 --> 00:07:49.103
The way you find it, so
recapping the way we did this,

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:51.335
we found the area under the curve,

00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:52.696
'cause the area under a curve

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.160
under our force versus
time graph represents

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.276
the impulse on the object.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.664
We found it for the entire trip,

00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:00.642
noting that underneath the time axis,

00:08:00.642 --> 00:08:02.825
when this curve goes under the time axis,

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.821
the net impulse is gonna be negative.

00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:06.275
We added up all the net impulse,

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:08.861
we set it equal to the change in momentum,

00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:10.608
we plugged in our values and we solved

00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:13.467
for our velocity after nine seconds.
