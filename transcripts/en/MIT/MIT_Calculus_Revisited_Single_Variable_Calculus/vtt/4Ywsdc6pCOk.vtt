HERBERT GROSS: Hi, today
we start a new

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.510
segment of our course.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.380
It could be entitled 'Techniques
of Integration'.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.000
And a subtitle could be the
difference between 'knowing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.810
what to do and knowing
how to do it'.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.280
You see, essentially in this
chapter, it shall be our aim

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.790
to develop various recipes
to evaluate the inverse

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.010
derivative.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.310
So in fact, let's
call it that.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.260
Some basic recipes.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.280
The idea is something
like this.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.920
Let's start with an
easier problem.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.820
Let's suppose we start with a
differentiable function 'G'.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990
Suppose, for example, that 'G'
prime is equal to 'f'.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.170
Then in terms of the language of
the indefinite integral, or

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.020
the inverse derivative, what we
have is that the indefinite

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160
integral of 'f of x' with
respect to 'x' is then 'G of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.780
x' plus 'c'.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.430
Now, you see, the harder
problem is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160
the inverse of this.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.800
What we're going to be talking
about is not do you find 'f'

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.430
once 'G' is given, but
techniques for finding 'G'

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.200
once 'f' is given.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.700
And as we've seen on several
occasions already, that given

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.110
'f', it is not that easy, in
general, to find a function

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.860
whose derivative is 'f'.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.620
In fact, in many cases, we can't
do it as explicitly as

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.450
we would like to no matter
how sharp we are.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.280
For example, oh, I've just
reviewed this so that you can

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
think of this in one block.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.160
Given 'f' to require 'G' may
not exist in familiar form.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.740
I don't want to pin down what
familiar means any more than

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.810
that right now.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.610
For example, the illustration
that we've used several times

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.700
already in the course, suppose
'f of x' is 'e to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.260
the minus 'x squared''.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.050
And we want a function whose
derivative is 'e to the minus

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.760
'x squared''.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.100
In terms of areas, the second
fundamental theorem of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.640
integral calculus, we can
construct such a function in a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.840
rather straightforward way,
even though it may be

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.490
difficult to name it in terms
of familiar functions.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.460
Namely, what we do is we take
the curve 'y' equals 'e to the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.520
minus 't squared''
in the yt-plane.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.380
Compute the area bounded above
by that curve, below by the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.770
t-axis, on the left by the
y-axis, and on the right by

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.510
the line 't' equals 'x'.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.080
And the area under the curve
is a function of 'x'.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.480
And what we've already seen is
that in this particular case,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.090
'A prime of x' is precisely 'e
to the minus 'x squared''.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.780
In other words, this area
function, which is a function

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.950
of 'x', does turn out to be the
function whose derivative

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.920
with respect to 'x' is 'e to
the minus 'x squared''.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.580
Now you see, that will not
be primarily what we're

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.300
interested in, in
this particular

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.470
phase of our course.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.620
What we're interested in this
phase of the course is given

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.480
various classifications for
the function 'f', to find

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.690
recipes that will give us 'G' in
familiar form, where 'G' is

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.540
the function whose derivative
is 'f'.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.760
Summarize for you
to look at here.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.860
The objective of this block of
material is to find recipes

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.210
for finding 'G of x' for various
types of 'f of x'.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.110
Now the best way to illustrate
what that means is to actually

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.330
pick a few examples.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.970
And by the way, what you'll
notice in today's lecture is,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.620
roughly speaking, we do nothing
at all that's new.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.770
The new stuff will begin with
out next lecture essentially.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.970
But for now what we'll really
be doing is giving us an

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.620
excuse to pull together all
of the recipes that we've

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.830
developed so far.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.860
All of the recipes either called
indefinite integrals or

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.020
inverse derivatives.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.440
For example, the first class
of functions which we could

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.940
handle were things of the form
integral ''u to the n' du'.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.930
Recall that very early in our
course, we found out that the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.000
integral of ''u to the n' du'
was ''u to the 'n + 1'' over

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.960
'n plus 1' plus a constant if
'n' was unequal to minus 1.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.860
And then, in our last block of
material we learned to handle

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.340
the case where 'n' was
equal to minus 1.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.330
Namely, when 'n' is minus
1, integral ''u to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.690
the minus 1' du'.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.010
Namely, integral 'du' over 'u'
is natural log absolute value

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.490
of 'u' plus a constant.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.200
Now this then, is one of our
basic building blocks.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.300
What we're saying is, if an
indefinite integral can be

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.220
written in this form, we already
have a recipe that

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.020
allows us to evaluate
the integral.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.560
By the way, let us also point
out as was mentioned again,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.180
several times in the past, that
'u' is the generic name

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.700
for a variable over here.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.930
It is not important in this
recipe that we use 'u'.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.050
What is important is that
whatever is being raised to

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.530
the n-th power inside the
integrand must be precisely

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.990
the thing that's following
the 'd' over here.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.530
For example, instead of
'u', suppose I used

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.960
'sine x' over here.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.900
In other words, suppose I
had 'sine x' to the n-th

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.810
power 'd sine x'.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.210
See, what's being raised to
the n-th power is the same

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.770
thing as what's following
the 'd'.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.770
That's all I really
care about.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.850
In other words, if this had been
the integrand, the recipe

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.750
would have said, this is 1 over
'n + 1' times 'sine x' to

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.170
the 'n + 1' power.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.170
Plus a constant if 'n' is
not equal to minus 1.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.620
And it's natural log absolute
value of 'sine x' plus a

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.040
constant if 'n' is
equal to minus 1.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.180
Again, the important thing is
not the 'u', but the fact that

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.610
what's being raised to the
n-th power is the same as

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.220
what's following the
'd' over here.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.690
By the way, we can write this
in more familiar form.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.150
You see, namely, notice that the
differential of 'sine x'

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.820
is 'cosine x dx'.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.370
And consequently, in this form
what our recipe says is that

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.010
integral 'sine x' to the n-th
power times 'cosine x dx' is

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.210
given by this.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.950
In other words, it's sine to the
'n + 1' power 'x over 'n +

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.870
1'' plus a constant if 'n'
is unequal to minus 1.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.510
And it's the natural log
absolute value of 'sine x'

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.520
plus 'c' if 'n' is
equal to minus 1.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:53.030
Again, notice this looks more
complicated than this.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.390
But to get our problem, to get
into the form ''u to the n'

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.930
du', notice that the natural
substitution here is to let

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.780
'u' equal 'sine x'.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.030
In which case, 'du' would
be 'cosine x dx'.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.100
In other words, the extra factor
of 'cosine x' here

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.250
actually is to our advantage
over here.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.210
That when we make the
substitution, it gives us the

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.630
form that we want.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.290
With the factor missing, we're
in a little bit of trouble.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.150
By the way, this is what makes
this a rather exciting topic.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.820
That there seems to be no really
canned ways of finding

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.160
indefinite integrals.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.610
That we have recipes.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.180
Frequently, the recipe that
we have doesn't cover the

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.910
situation that we have.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.630
In fact, I know a lot of times
in teaching a course like this

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.280
students say, why do we have
to learn these recipes and

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.820
techniques?

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.030
Why can't we just look them
up in the tables?

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.070
And the answer quite simply, is
that in many applications,

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.790
the integral that we have
doesn't appear in

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.110
that form in the table.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.490
That frequently what we must do
is a tremendous amount of

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.700
algebraic manipulation and the
like to even get the given

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.970
integral to resemble one that
we can find in the table.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.020
Oh, we're starting
off on a fairly

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.440
straightforward level here.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.710
Nothing really too tricky.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.870
But at least enough so that we
get an idea of what kind of

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.120
gimmicks are involved.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.080
For example, suppose we had
'cosine x' to the seventh

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.030
power 'dx'.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.990
You see the idea here is that
when you have cosine raised to

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.590
a power, it would have been nice
if a 'sine x' factor had

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.380
been in here.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.860
Because the differential
of 'cosine x' is

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.730
minus 'sine x dx'.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.120
And what I'm driving at here is
that we often have to have

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.440
a certain kind of ingenuity that
allows us to reduce a new

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.299
integrand to a more
familiar one.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.480
And, as I say, there are many

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.159
techniques done in the textbook.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.060
There'll be plenty of exercises
again, that will

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.570
allow you to experiment
on this.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.050
All I want to do is hit a few
highlights and create the mood

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.360
as to what's going on.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.440
For example, you see frequently
what happens is, if

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.690
we have 'cosine x' raised
to an odd power, a very

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.520
convenient way of handling this
is to split off one of

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.870
the factors of 'cosine
x' separately.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.780
In other words, write this as
'cosine x' to the sixth power

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.700
times 'cosine x dx'.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.180
The idea being that cosine
squared can be written as '1

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.800
minus 'sine squared''.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.620
In other words, 'cosine x' to
the sixth power is really

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.150
'cosine squared x' cubed.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.840
But 'cosine squared x' is '1
minus 'sine squared x''.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.140
In other words, notice again the
role of the trigonometric

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.030
identities.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.160
I take this integrand, write it
this way, and now you see

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.040
if I use the binomial theorem
and expand this, notice that

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.160
my typical term will have 'sine
x' to a power multiplied

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.070
by a 'cosine x'.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.540
And that's precisely the kind
of a term that I handled in

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.980
the previous case.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.500
And again, I'm not
going to bore you

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.650
with the details here.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.670
That is the easiest part
of the problem.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.850
The hard part is getting to
understand why one would want

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.750
to use this particular
kind of form.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.670
Another variation is, what
happens if the cosine is

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.790
raised to an even power rather
than to an odd power?

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.500
How do we handle that?

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.010
Again, the same kind of use of
trigonometric identities.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.370
For example, it would not be to
our advantage in this case,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.040
to replace cosine squared
by 1 minus sine squared.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.960
Because then we would wind
up with the same kind of

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.320
integrands that we started with,
only using powers of

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.400
sine instead of powers
of cosine.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.830
You see, the idea is that if
we have a power of sine, we

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.080
want a cosine factor
to accompany it.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.120
And inversely, if we have a
power of cosine, we'd like a

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.210
factor of sine to
accompany it.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.900
Why?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.355
So that we can get the integral
into the form ''u to

00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:43.260
the n' du'.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.670
In this particular case, a
very common device is to

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.910
invoke the identity that cosine
squared of an angle is

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.350
1 plus cosine twice
the angle over 2.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.600
You see again, this is where
all of these particular

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.430
identities come into play.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.370
It's not a case of saying, let's
learn these identities

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.910
so that we can recite them.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.750
It's a case of getting into a
situation where you want a

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.270
certain answer, can't handle
it conveniently in the form

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.940
that you're in, and hope that
you can pick off a synonym

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.240
that allows you to tackle the
problem more successfully.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.890
That's where this becomes a
matter of insight, lucky

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.260
guessing, skill, whatever
you want to call it.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.370
It's one thing to transform an
integral into an equivalent

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.920
one, and another thing to have
that equivalent integral be

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.370
something that you can handle.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.790
Well, at any rate, for example
in a problem of this type, a

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.730
tendency is to write cosine
sixth theta as

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.710
cosine squared cubed.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.800
Cosine squared theta is 1 plus
cosine 2 theta over 2.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.160
To cube this we can take
out the factor of 1/8.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.750
You see, we use the binomial
theorem to expand 1 plus

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.500
cosine 2 theta cubed.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.750
And notice that of the
terms that we get,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.680
this term we can handle.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.640
This term we can handle,
it's just cosine

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.000
to the first power.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.480
Which involves a sine term
when we integrate.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.240
And here's a cosine cubed.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.110
But we've just seen how you can
handle something to an odd

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.180
power, so that reduces
this term to a

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.690
type that we can handle.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.630
And then we see what?

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.570
That we have another term
in here, which is

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.350
cosine squared 2 theta.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.280
That's an even power
of cosine.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.290
Again, we do what?

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.070
We write cosine squared 2 theta
as 1 plus cosine of

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.260
twice this angle.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.930
That's 1 plus cosine
4 theta over 2.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.510
In other words, we keep reducing
these things, always

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.850
hoping to break them down into
collections of problems that

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.230
we solved before.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.900
As I said, these are things
that we'll drill on in the

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.410
exercises and I think it will
become more meaningful there.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.400
Here, as I say, the main aim
is to create the mood that

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.470
what we're trying to do is to
reduce unfamiliar problems to

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.750
equivalent familiar
ones to which we

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.520
already know the answer.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.520
Now again, in the way of review,
sometimes an integrand

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.190
occurs in the form of the sum or
difference of two squares.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.610
We've already handled this in
terms of the inverse circular

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.830
functions and the inverse
hyperbolic functions.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.340
It's covered for the first time
in our textbook at this

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.040
particular stage
of the course.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.100
And I think it's a tough enough
concept so that it's

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.950
worth emphasizing
at this stage.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.280
So I just separate this
particular type out.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.790
How do we handle sums and
differences of squares?

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.690
And what I intend to show is,
is that by a suitable

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.980
trigonometric function, either
circular trigonometric or

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.870
hyperbolic trigonometric, we can
always reduce that kind of

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.550
a problem to the type
that we can handle.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.180
Again, to keep computation at a
minimum, I have not tried to

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.610
pick a rather complicated
situation.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.060
In fact, I've picked ones where
you can very easily look

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.780
them up in the table
if that was the

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.370
main aim of the exercise.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.510
You see here, it's not so much
that I want to get this

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.810
answer, as much as it is that
I want to emphasize the

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.670
technique that one uses.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.950
The idea is something
like this.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.630
Here we see the difference
of two squares.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.160
That's the square root of a
squared minus x squared.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.580
What this should do for us is
to suggest a right triangle

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.250
whose hypotenuse is a and one
of whose sides is 'x'.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.920
That's the diagram I've
drawn over here.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.570
This is my reference triangle.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.830
As I say, we've done this
before, but I would like to

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.030
reinforce this at this
particular stage.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.460
Especially now that we're more
familiar with both the inverse

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.860
circular and inverse hyperbolic
functions.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.470
At any rate, we use this
reference triangle.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.600
From this triangle, the easiest
relationship to pick

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.890
off involving 'x' is that sine
theta is 'x over a', or 'a

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.710
'sine theta'' equals 'x'.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.080
From which it follows that
''a' cosine theta

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.630
'd theta'' is 'dx'.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.740
The square root of ''a squared'
minus 'x squared''

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.670
over 'a' is cosine theta.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.930
Therefore, the square root
of ''a squared' minus 'x

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.020
squared'' is 'a cosine theta'.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.330
If we now make this substitution
in this

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.580
particular integral, we wind up
with integral 'dx' over the

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.830
square root of ''a squared'
minus 'x squared'' is equal to

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.880
integral 'd theta'.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.930
Which is theta plus 'c'.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:15.190
And since theta is the number
whose sine is 'x over a', we

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.250
have that the answer to this
problem is inverse 'sine 'x

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.450
over a'' plus a constant.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.370
Again, just a straightforward
review, but a

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.820
rather important technique.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.180
In our textbook, this is put in
a separate section, and the

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.470
technique is called
trigonometric substitution.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.150
And I just wanted to show
you what motivates the

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.620
trigonometric substitution.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.930
The harder part as I mentioned
in our previous lecture, is

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.130
how you motivate trigonometric
substitutions when it's the

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.200
hyperbolic functions
that are involved.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.770
You see, what I'd like to do now
is instead of dealing with

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.110
the square root of ''a squared'
minus 'x squared'',

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.300
let me just reverse the
order of the terms.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.380
And now let me take integral
'dx' over the 'square root of

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.380
''x squared' minus
'a squared'''.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.690
Notice that the difference
between ''x squared' minus 'a

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.910
squared'' and ''a squared' minus
'x squared'' is just a

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.690
factor of minus 1.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.060
And the fact that that minus 1
is under the square root sign,

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.790
really means in a certain manner
of speaking that you've

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.970
multiplied by i, the square root
of minus 1, to transform

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.610
the integral that we
just had into this

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.960
particular form here.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.520
And in terms of our lecture on
the hyperbolic functions that

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.400
should, in some way, give us a
preview of things to come in

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.380
the sense that the hyperbolic
functions are very strongly

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.550
related to the circular
functions.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.370
My technique for doing this--

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.630
and again, this is highly
subjective.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.630
It's very simple.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.310
I learnt the circular functions
long before I learnt

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.790
the hyperbolic functions.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.450
Consequently, I feel very
much at home with

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.350
the circular functions.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.820
As a result, whenever I see the
sum or difference of two

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.550
squares, I always think in
terms of a triangle.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.310
I make a circular trigonometric
substitution.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.260
If that works for me, fine.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.240
I haven't lost anything.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.040
If it doesn't work for me, it
gives me the hint that I can't

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.950
seem to get in my own mind
without this hint as to which

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.900
hyperbolic function
I should use.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.950
Let me show you this in terms
of this particular example.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.290
If I saw this problem from
scratch and didn't have any

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.910
previous knowledge of how to
handle this I'd say, this

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.319
seems like I should think of
a right triangle whose

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.760
hypotenuse is 'x' and one
of whose sides is 'a'.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.319
So I think of this particular
reference triangle.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.010
Now, thinking of this triangle,
and in fact, even

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.650
look at this triangle, I very
easily pick off that 'x' is

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.550
equal to 'a cosecant theta'.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.210
See, 'x over a' is 1
over sine theta.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.240
That's cosecant theta.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.610
Therefore and remembering how to
differentiate the cosecant,

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.310
I take the differential of both
sides and I find that

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.840
minus 'a cosecant theta
cotangent theta

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.000
'd theta'' is 'dx'.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.530
Again, from this diagram I see
that the square root of ''x

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.920
squared' minus 'a
squared'' is--

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.080
well, let's see.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.020
The square root of ''x squared'
minus 'a squared''

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.450
over 'a' would be
cotangent theta.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.710
So the square root of ''x
squared' minus 'a squared''

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.720
itself is 'a cotangent theta'.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.090
Making the substitution in the
integral 'dx' over the square

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.270
root of ''x squared' minus 'a
squared'', notice that the

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.310
'a's cancel, the cotangent's
cancel, and I'm left with

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.940
'cosecant theta 'd theta''
and a minus

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.690
sign inside my integral.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.830
In other words, somehow or
other, this circular

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.420
trigonometric function replaces
the integral 'dx'

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.230
over the 'square root of ''x
squared' minus 'a squared'''

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.510
by integral minus 'cosecant
theta 'd theta''.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.710
And the point I'd like to
emphasize at this particular

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.470
stage is that we don't
say that the

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.000
substitution has failed.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.580
The substitution
has been made.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.390
We have replaced an integral
involving 'x' by

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.030
one involving theta.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.450
It's just that in the same way
that it's difficult to

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.125
integrate secant theta--

00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:57.380
in fact, that will be later
in this block of

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.320
material we'll do that.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.060
But the point is that secant
and cosecant are rather

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.780
difficult functions
to integrate.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.850
In fact, at this stage of our
development, we do not know a

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.870
function whose derivative
is cosecant theta.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.630
Consequently, we don't know one
whose derivative is minus

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.830
cosecant theta.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.250
We seemed to have arrived
at an impasse here.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.890
We have successfully made the
substitution, but the key

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.140
point is that the new integral
is no easier for us to handle

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.610
than the old integral.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.780
Now, here's how I visualize the
hyperbolic substitutions.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.330
We did this in the
last lecture.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.340
I think it's tough enough, so
I'd like to do it a second

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.760
time and give you a chance of
seeing how easy this is once

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.800
you see the structural form.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.600
Notice that the substitution I
made here was 'x' equals 'a

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.890
cosecant theta'.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.600
The cosecant was the
key step here.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.750
The reference triangle, knowing
how to draw this

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.930
geometrically, allowed me not
to consciously have to think

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.670
of the trigonometric
identities.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.850
But what I really did in
evaluating this problem, if I

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.870
left the diagram out and wanted
to do it analytically,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.370
the identity that I made use
of was the one that said

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.390
cosecant squared theta minus
cotangent squared theta is

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.620
identically 1.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.590
In other words, I would like an
identity for the hyperbolic

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.660
functions that has the structure
that the difference

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.230
of two squares is
identically 1.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.480
The easiest one I can think of
is the one that says cosh

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.690
squared theta minus sinh
squared theta is 1.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.680
You see, structurally, these
two are equivalent.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.360
In other words, sinh and cosh
are related hyperbolically,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.310
the same way that cotangent and
cosecant are in terms of

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.650
circular functions.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.210
The identification is this.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.460
Since in the original problem I
tried 'x' equals 'a cosecant

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.300
theta', and since the
identification here is that

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.260
cosecant and cosh are matched
up, what I try next-- see once

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.610
this has failed, I very quickly
now say, OK, what I'll

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.590
do is instead of 'x' equals 'a
cosecant theta', I'll try 'x'

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.160
equals 'a cosh theta'.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.060
That's exactly what
I did over here.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.110
'a cosh theta' equals 'x'.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.130
From which it follows
that 'dx' is 'a

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.090
sinh theta 'd theta''.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.570
The square root of ''x squared'
minus 'a squared'' is

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.720
just ''a squared' cosh
squared theta'.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.850
That's 'x squared'.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.220
Minus 'a squared'.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.930
That can be written as the
square root of 'a squared'

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.040
times the quantity 'cosh
squared theta minus 1'.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.910
Now, the interesting point is
the 'cosh squared theta minus

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.190
1' turns out to be sinh
squared theta.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.140
In fact, if we want to just look
back here for a moment,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.890
recall that's exactly what
we have over here.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.880
That cosh squared theta is 1.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.680
Well, cosh squared theta is
1 plus sinh squared theta.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.680
cosh squared theta minus 1
is sinh squared theta.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.660
And you might, say wasn't
that terrific?

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.160
What a lucky break it was that
this complicated expression

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.490
just happened to be sinh
squared theta.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.320
And now taking the square
root I get a sinh theta.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.850
The thing I'd like to point
out is that the element of

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:08.750
luck was removed from this at
the instant that I recognized

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.580
the fact that cosh and sinh
were related by the same

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.510
identity that cosecant
and cotangent were.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.110
In other words, I rigged this
thing so that when I finally

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.220
had to take this particular
difference, I had to wind up

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.750
with an easy square
root to extract.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.870
You see, I had the right
structure to begin with.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.140
At any rate, to make a long
story short here, 'dx' is 'a

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.190
sinh theta 'd theta''.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.200
The square root of ''x squared'
minus 'a squared'' is

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.780
'a sinh theta'.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.640
Therefore, 'dx' over the square
root of ''x squared'

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.580
minus 'a squared''.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.450
Well, look how nicely
this works out.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.950
The a sinh theta cancels from
both the numerator and the

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.960
denominator.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.690
And it turns out that the
integral that I'm looking for,

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.770
'dx' over the square root
of ''x squared' minus 'a

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.730
squared'' is just theta
plus a constant.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.570
But now, recalling that a
cosh theta equals 'x'.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.970
In other words, cosh theta
is 'x over a'.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.100
And therefore, theta is 'inverse
cosh 'x over a'', I

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.970
arrive at the result that this
integral is 'inverse cosh 'x

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.850
over a'' plus a constant.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.920
In other words, what I hope that
these two little examples

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.520
show is that when I have the
sum or difference of two

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.200
squares, the trigonometric
substitutions will usually

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.700
give me a crack at getting an
equivalent integral that will

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.410
be easier to handle.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.120
What may happen is that the
circular functions won't help

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.120
me, but the hyperbolic
ones will.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.330
Or vice versa, and I hope that
you see how these are so

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.180
delicately connected.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.260
Well, there is one final type of
technique that I would like

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.190
to show for today's lesson
that's related to what we've

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.180
already done.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.080
And with that, we'll conclude
today's lesson and go into

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.910
some more elaborate
recipes next time.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:58.020
But this is a take-off on our
old high school construction

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.620
of completing a square.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.240
In other words, let's suppose
we have an expression of the

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.550
form 'ax squared' plus
'bx' plus 'c'.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.540
And this may sound
old hat to you.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.430
You may remember this as looking
pretty much like the

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.650
development of the quadratic
equation.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.200
The idea works something
like this.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.970
First of all, I can factor
an a out of here.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.600
I'm assuming that a is not 0.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.830
In fact, if a were 0, I
really wouldn't have a

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.150
square term in here.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.470
I factor out an 'a' and I'm
left with 'a' times 'x

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.730
squared' plus ''b over
a'x' plus 'c over a'.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.050
Now it turns out that whenever
you have something of the form

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:37.610
'x squared' plus something times
'x', to convert that

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.900
into a perfect square.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.970
And again, we'll have ample
opportunity to practice this

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.350
in the exercises.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.960
You take half the coefficient
of 'x' and square it.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.010
Half the coefficient of 'x'
here is 'b over 2a'.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.910
If I square that it's 'b
squared' over ''4a' squared'.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.060
Now to keep the identity intact
here, if I add in 'b

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.460
squared' over ''4a' squared',
I must subtract that.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.440
In other words, I just add and
subtract this term that will

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.190
make this a perfect square.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:09.150
In fact, what is 'x squared'
plus ''b over a'x' plus ''b

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.720
squared' over '4a' squared''?

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.320
You'll notice that
this is just ''x'

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.460
plus 'b over 2a' squared'.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.800
'x squared'.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.170
Just multiply this thing out.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.540
You see how this particular
thing works.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.950
In other words, what I've done
is I can write this as 'a'

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.020
times a perfect square.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.670
And by the way, what's left over
here if I multiply these

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.910
two terms through by 'a'?

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.980
This is 'c' minus 'b
squared over 4a'.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.770
In other words, recognizing that
this is ''x' plus 'b over

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.310
2a' squared'.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.330
And multiplying these two terms
through by 'a', I wind

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.460
up with the fact that ''ax'
squared' plus 'bx' plus 'c'

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.330
can always be written in
this particular form.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.340
This is called completing
the square.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.450
And notice that this is now a
perfect square and this is

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.530
some constant.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.480
And the question that comes up
is, what does this have to do

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.260
with integral calculus?

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.630
In other words, with finding
antiderivatives.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.720
And again, as is so often
the case, and granted

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.440
that as this course--

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.250
especially this chapter gets
more complicated, the degree

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.750
of sophistication will
become much greater.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.640
But the basic idea will always
remain the same.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.180
Somehow or other, we will always
try to reduce a new

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.810
situation to a more
familiar one.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.100
In other words, let's suppose
now we don't have an integrand

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.560
that's the sum and difference of
two squares, but we have an

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.680
integrand that involves a
quadratic expression.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.630
Say, for example, we have
'dx' over ''ax' squared'

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.210
plus 'bx' plus 'c'.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.780
Well, you see, using hindsight
rather than foresight, I

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.020
already took care of this
problem before we started.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.740
Namely, we just finished
completing

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.070
the square over here.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:53.230
Namely, what is ''ax' squared'
plus 'bx' plus 'c'?

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.780
Notice it can be written
in what form?

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.720
Let's come back here
and take a look.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.820
It's 'a' times ''x'
plus 'b over 2a'

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.910
squared' plus some constant.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.600
I don't care what it
happens to be here.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.240
I'll just call that constant
'c sub 1'.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.500
And by the way, notice depending
upon the relative

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.740
sizes of 'a', 'b', and 'c', this
constant can be either

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.330
positive or negative.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.460
Or in fact, even 0.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.860
So to handle that what I'll say
is I can always write this

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.680
denominator in the form 'a'
times ''x' plus 'b over 2a'

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.590
squared' plus or minus
some constant.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.010
Where I'm assuming now that
the constant is positive.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.900
That's why I put the plus
or minus sign in.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.660
It's plus some positive constant
or else it's minus

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.350
some positive constant.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.840
Now what I can do is factor out
an a from the denominator.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.920
If I factor out an a from the
denominator here, I have 1

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.980
over 'a' times a certain
integral.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.160
What integral?

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:52.150
'dx' over 'x plus 'b over 2a'
squared' plus or minus still

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:53.890
some constant.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.500
In other words, I
had 'c1' here.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.740
I factored out on 'a'. 'c2'
was actually 'c1 over a'.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.740
I just factored out an 'a'
from this thing here.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.900
But it doesn't make
any difference.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.750
The important point is I now
have this written in this

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.960
particular form.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.980
Now if I assume that 'c2' is a
positive constant, notice that

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.610
any positive number is
a perfect square.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.190
Namely, it's the square
of its square root.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.960
And again, as I say with the
exercises, this will become

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.250
clearer when we work with
specific numbers.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.550
But the idea here is what?

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.200
This is some perfect square,
which I'll call 'k'.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.610
And in other words, this
integrand can now be written

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:36.540
in the form '1 over a', 'dx'
over 'x plus 'b over 2a'

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.820
squared' plus or minus
'k squared'.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.910
Well, again, what am
I leading up to?

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:46.040
If I now make the substitution
that 'u' equals 'x plus 'b

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.760
over 2a'', notice that my
denominator simply becomes 'u

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.880
squared' plus or minus
'k squared'.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.560
In other words, my denominator
now has the form of either the

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.860
sum or difference
of two squares.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.780
On the other hand, if 'u'
is 'x plus 'b over

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.730
2a'', what is 'du'?

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.620
Remember, 'b' and 'a'
are constants.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.420
'b over 2a' is a constant.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.680
The derivative of
a constant is 0.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.780
So 'du' is equal to 'dx'.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.970
In other words, notice that if
I now make this substitution

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.850
in here, outside I have a '1
over a', inside I have 'du'

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.560
over ''u squared' plus or
minus 'k squared''.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.590
In other words, when I have a
quadratic I can write that in

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.650
the form the sum and/or
difference of two squares,

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.560
simply by completing
the square.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.310
Simply by completing square.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:46.460
In other words, I can solve the
problem of the quadratic

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.660
by converting it back into an
integral, the type of which

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.100
I've solved before.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.920
And this, by and large, becomes
the technique that we

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.080
will use throughout
this chapter.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.820
Well, at any rate, I won't
go into that in any more

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.930
detail right now.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.070
We will pick up additional

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.455
techniques in our next lecture.

00:30:03.455 --> 00:30:05.460
And until the next
lecture, goodbye.
