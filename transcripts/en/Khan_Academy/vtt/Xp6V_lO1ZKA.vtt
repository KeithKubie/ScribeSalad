00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's now tackle a
classic thought experiment

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.217
in probability, called
the Monte Hall problem.

00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:07.800
And it's called the
Monty Hall problem

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.560
because Monty Hall was the game
show host in Let's Make a Deal,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.400
where they would set up
a situation very similar

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.260
to the Monte Hall problem
that we're about to say.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.080
So let's say that
on the show, you're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.330
presented with three curtains.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.830
So you're the contestant, this
little chef-looking character

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.610
right over there.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.526
You're presented with
three curtains-- curtain

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:29.340
number one, curtain number
two, and curtain number three.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.950
And you're told that behind
one of these three curtains,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.730
there's a fabulous prize,
something that you really want,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.270
a car, or a vacation, or some
type of large amount of cash.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.600
And then behind the
other two, and we

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.800
don't know which they
are, there is something

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.770
that you do not want.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.850
A new pet goat or an
ostrich or something

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.410
like that, or a
beach ball, something

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.510
that is not as good
as the cash prize.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.650
And so your goal is to try
to find the cash prize.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.670
And they say guess
which one, or which one

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.030
would you like to select?

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750
And so let's say that you
select door number one,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.280
or curtain number one.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.190
Then the Monte
Hall and Let's Make

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.960
a Deal crew will make it a
little bit more interesting.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.320
They want to show you
whether or not you won.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.180
They'll then show you one
of the other two doors,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.770
or one of the
other two curtains.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.853
And they'll show you one
of the other two curtains

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:16.156
that does not have the prize.

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:17.530
And no matter
which one you pick,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.570
there'll always be at
least one other curtain

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.900
that does not have the prize.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.400
There might be two,
if you picked right.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.524
But there will always be
at least one other curtain

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:26.054
that does not have the prize.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:27.470
And then they will
show it to you.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.844
And so let's say that they
show you curtain number three.

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:33.320
And so curtain number
three has the goat.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.820
And then they'll
ask you, do you want

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.910
to switch to curtain number two?

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.860
And the question here is,
does it make a difference?

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.150
Are you better off holding
fast, sticking to your guns,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.850
staying with the original guess?

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.560
Are you better off switching
to whatever curtain is left?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.020
Or does it not matter?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.770
It's just random
probability, and it's not

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.660
going to make a difference
whether you switch or not.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.520
So that is the brain teaser.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.850
Pause the video now.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.550
I encourage you
to think about it.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.180
In the next video, we will
start to analyze the solution

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.757
a little bit deeper, whether
it makes any difference at all.

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:15.590
So now I've assumed
that you've unpaused it.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.881
You've thought deeply about it.

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:18.590
Perhaps you have
an opinion on it.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.260
Now let's work it
through a little bit.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.634
And at any point,
I encourage you

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:24.090
to pause it and kind of
extrapolate beyond what I've

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.960
already talked about.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.640
So let's think
about the game show

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.680
from the show's point of view.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.359
So the show knows
where there's the goat

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.650
and where there isn't the goat.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.350
So let's door number
one, door number two,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.810
and door number three.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.390
So let's say that our
prize is right over here.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.590
So our prize is the car.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.105
Our prize is the car, and
that we have a goat over here,

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:51.646
and over here we
also have-- maybe we

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:53.477
have two goats in
this situation.

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.310
So what are we going
to do as the game show?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.060
Remember, the contestants
don't know this.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.220
We know this.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.340
So the contestant picks door
number one right over here.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.266
Then we can't lift
door number two

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:05.640
because there's
a car back there.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.440
We're going to lift
door number three,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.700
and we're going to
expose this goat.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.360
In which case, it
probably would be

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.330
good for the person to switch.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.700
If the person picks door number
two, then we as the game show

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.930
can show either door number
one or door number three,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.600
and then it actually
does not make sense

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.780
for the person to switch.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.440
If they picked
door number three,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.690
then we have to
show door number one

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.670
because we can't
pick door number two.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.380
And in that case, it
actually makes a lot

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.410
of sense for the
person to switch.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.170
Now, with that out of
the way, let's think

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.310
about the probabilities
given the two strategies.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.720
So if you don't
switch, or another way

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.310
to think about this strategy is
you always stick to your guns.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.700
You always stick to
your first guess.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.380
Well, in that situation, what
is your probability of winning?

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.730
Well, there's three doors.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.159
The prize is equally likely
to be behind any one of them.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.450
So there's three possibilities.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.340
One has the outcome
that you desire.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.210
The probability of winning will
be 1/3 if you don't switch.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.696
Likewise, your
probability of losing,

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:20.529
well, there's two ways
that you can lose out

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.487
of three possibilities.

00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:22.610
It's going to be 2/3.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.151
And these are the
only possibilities,

00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:25.920
and these add up to
one right over here.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.410
So don't switch, 1/3
chance of winning.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.770
Now let's think about
the switching situation.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.940
So let's say always--
when you always switch.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.640
Let's think about how
this might play out.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.761
What is your
probability of winning?

00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:45.260
And before we even
think about that,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.680
think about how you would
win if you always switch.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.409
So if you pick wrong
the first time,

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.700
they're going to show you this.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.910
And so you should always switch.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.640
So if you pick door
number one, they're

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.190
going to show you
door number three.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.500
You should switch.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.200
If you picked wrong
door number three,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.950
they're going to show
you door number one.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.440
You should switch.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.820
So if you picked wrong and
switch, you will always win.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.251
Let me write this down.

00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.750
And this insight actually came
from one of the middle school

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.166
students in the summer camp
that Khan Academy was running.

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:18.510
It's actually a fabulous
way to think about this.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.210
So if you pick
wrong, so step one,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.540
so initial pick is wrong,
so you pick one of the two

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:36.110
wrong doors, and then step
two, you always switch,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.110
you will land on the car.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.050
Because if you picked
one of the wrong doors,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.434
they're going to have to
show the other wrong door.

00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:43.850
And so if you
switch, you're going

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.562
to end up on the right answer.

00:05:45.562 --> 00:05:48.020
So what is the probability of
winning if you always switch?

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.395
Well, it's going to be the
probability that you initially

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:51.002
picked wrong.

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:52.960
Well, what's the probability
that you initially

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.910
picked wrong?

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.090
Well, there's two
out of the three ways

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.660
to initially pick wrong.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.467
So you actually have a
2/3 chance of winning.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:02.800
There's a 2/3 chance you're
going to pick wrong and then

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.900
switch into the right one.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.450
Likewise, what's
your probability

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.550
of losing, given that you're
always going to switch?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.310
Well, the way that you would
lose is you pick right,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.630
you picked correctly.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.870
In step two, they're
going to show

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.126
one of the two empty
or non-prize doors.

00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:26.500
And then step
three, you're going

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.517
to switch into the
other empty door.

00:06:33.517 --> 00:06:35.600
But either way, you're
definitely going to switch.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.270
So the only way to lose, if
you're always going to switch,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.582
is to pick the right
the first time.

00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:42.040
Well, what's the
probability of you

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.700
picking right the first time?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.110
Well, that is only 1/3.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.240
So you see here, it's
sometimes counter-intuitive,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.795
but hopefully this makes
sense as to why it isn't.

00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:54.580
You have a 1/3 chance of winning
if you stick to your guns,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.490
and a 2/3 chance of winning
if you always switch.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.420
Another way to
think about it is,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.780
when you first make
your initial pick,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.960
there's a 1/3 chance
that it's there,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.920
and there's a 2/3
chance that it's

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.740
in one of the other two doors.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.630
And they're going to
empty out one of them.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.088
So when you switch,
you essentially

00:07:16.088 --> 00:07:18.470
are capturing that
2/3 probability.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.260
And we see that right there.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.040
So hopefully you enjoyed that.
