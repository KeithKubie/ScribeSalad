00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.030
 Here we have a few words, 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.680
 which relate to different reactions 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.520
 and whether they are swallowed or released 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.150
 different types of energy. 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.750
 The first word is exothermic. 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.190
 The root of the word is "therm" 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.430
 which is associated with heat, and that word 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.180
 means a reaction that releases heat. 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.140
 It releases heat. 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 In a situation where we have 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.920
 constant pressure or change in enthalpy, 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.940
 these words mean 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.350
 how much heat is absorbed or released during a reaction. 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.220
 If we have a negative change in the enthalpy 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.720
 means that heat is released. 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.550
 If we look at the enthalpy, such as the heat content, 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.160
 we have less heat after the reaction than before. 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.880
 So heat is released. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.210
 This means that the change in the enthalpy will be 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.150
 less than zero. These three lines mean the same thing. 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.130
 This is true, 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.420
 when we release heat. 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.950
 This is the same thing as the release of heat, 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.680
 when we have constant pressure. 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.400
 Permanent pressure is reasonable 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.950
 condition when we do something in a flask, 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.110
 which is open and has contact with the air or if we look at it 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.750
 various biological systems. 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 Now, based on that logic, what do you think it means 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.620
 endothermic. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.730
 One thermic has the same root - "therm" 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.890
 and the prefix "endo", 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.010
 it will be a process that absorbs heat. 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.970
 It absorbs heat. 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.850
 If we have a constant pressure, 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.080
 we can say that the enthalpy after the reaction 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.760
 will be higher than the enthalpy before the reaction. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.720
 Delta H will be bigger 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.920
 from zero. 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.670
 So, okay. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.850
 Now let's take a look at these two words here. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 Eczergonic and endergonic. 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.450
 Excessive, here the root is ergon, 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.600
 the root may not be so familiar to you, 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 the term, but maybe you know 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.960
 the word ergonomic. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.620
 For example, "Hey, this is a nice ergonomic bureau." 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.250
 This means that the desk is good for work. 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 Or, "This is a nice ergonomic chair." 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 Ergon comes from the Greek word for work. 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.900
 So exergonic is a reaction that releases energy to do the job 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.000
 or at least that implies the word. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.370
 Release - I will do it in the same color. 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 This is something that will 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.940
 release energy 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 for work. 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.950
 And an endogenous, by the same logic, 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.520
 based on the parts of the word, 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.220
 it will be something that absorbs energy to work, 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 or uses energy 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.790
 for work. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.350
 One of the dimensions 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.290
 or the properties we can use to think about 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.520
 the energy used to work is Gibbs' free energy, 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.950
 as well as Gibbs' free energy formula, 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.050
 when we have constant pressure and temperature. 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.510
 I'll write it down. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.090
 If we talk about constant pressure 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.390
 and temperature, we have the formula 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.390
 Free Gibbs or Gibbs 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.820
 Gibbs definition of free energy. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
 Gibbs Free Energy Change - 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.520
 I'll do it in another color. 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.940
 The change in Gibbs' free energy is equal to 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.940
 the change in enthalpy 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.960
 minus, I will use another color. 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.960
 Minus temperature multiplied 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.990
 the change in entropy. 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.310
 If this seems completely unknown to you, 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.920
 I recommend you watch the video about 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.350
 Gibbs' free energy. 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.640
 The reason this (delta G) is related to the energy used to work 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 is: 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120
 delta H means whether we absorb or release heat, 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.450
 from this we take entropy, which means energy, 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.790
 which brings a mess into the universe. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.870
 What remains is the energy that can be used to work. 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.580
 This is one way of dealing with the issue. 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.520
 We see that this formula connects energy to work 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.770
 with the change in enthalpy here. 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.530
 So exergy is something that separates 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.090
 energy to work and we can say that there is less energy to work 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.040
 following the course of the reaction as compared to previously. 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.490
 Delta G will be less than zero. 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.260
 I'll write it down. 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.220
 Here our delta G will be less than zero. 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.270
 We have seen such reactions that they release 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.670
 energy for work 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.980
 and in Gibbs' free video on video. 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.480
 These reactions are considered spontaneous. 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.010
 Spontaneous. 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.370
 They will run. 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.390
 And these are the reactions that absorb energy for work. 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.130
 They will have more energy to work with 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.720
 in the system after the reaction has occurred than before. 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.760
 Delta G 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.700
 will be greater than zero. 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.020
 We say that these reactions are not spontaneous. 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.020
 They are not spontaneous. 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.090
 We ended up with the definitions. 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.510
 We will now link these dimensions 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.490
 looking at different examples of 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.470
 exothermic and exergic, 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.720
 as well as endothermic and endogenous reactions 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.690
 and we will understand why they are logical. 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.050
 The first reaction is exothermic, 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.380
 delta H is less than zero. 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.770
 This means that we have less enthalpy after the reaction, 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.710
 than before, therefore, heat has been released. 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.150
 Here we see that heat is released. 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.890
 But where did the energy come from? 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.820
 In formation 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.020
 of this new configuration 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.450
 electrons can go to a lower energy level 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.270
 and to release energy. 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.790
 And the heat, if we think about it on a micro level, 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.723
 is something that raises the temperature, 

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:42.200
 at least locally. This means transfer 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.720
 of kinetic energy to these microscopic molecules. 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.150
 Remember when we talk about heat or temperature, 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.870
 we think about these macros, 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.060
 but at micro level, 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.720
 we are talking about kinetic and potential energies. 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.331
 What is happening is that 

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.650
 when these electrons move into a new configuration, 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.750
 they give out energy, 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.210
 which can be transferred to the individual molecules. 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.750
 Here we have released energy 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.420
 and we have increased entropy. 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.440
 We have more entropy after the reaction, 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.420
 than before the reaction. 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.320
 Here we have more objects, 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.760
 as well as more conditions that can occupy, 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.920
 also move faster. 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.210
 If we apply the question 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.120
 for this case, 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.090
 this (delta H) will be less than zero. 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.770
 Here delta S will be greater than zero. 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.870
 The temperature will be an absolute temperature, 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.320
 expressed in Kelvin, so it will always be positive. 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.190
 Therefore, the whole expression will be positive. 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.630
 We will have something negatively minus something positive, 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.750
 we will get a negative result. 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.730
 Our Delta G 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.150
 will be less than zero, we see the reaction 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.060
 will be spontaneous 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.700
 It is logical to proceed, 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.920
 energy will be emitted, and the electrons will like it. 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.010
 More disarray will be created. 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.470
 Another way to think about it is 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.500
 to imagine the reaction in the other direction. 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.060
 We will have to deliver energy to these electrons, 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.450
 to reach a higher energy level and create 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.600
 these links. We will have to arrange 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.040
 these four components in the right way. 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.120
 This seems less likely, 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.750
 than the reaction we have from left to right. 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.490
 Now think of something that absorbs heat. 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.290
 This example is not very intuitive. 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.020
 The reaction absorbs heat but will be spontaneous. 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.360
 It will be exono. 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.920
 It will go. 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.190
 Delta H is greater than zero, 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.160
 absorbs heat to flow. 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.630
 I have these two molecules 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.790
 with these different components, they will collide, 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.260
 we say the temperature is high. 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.140
 If the temperature is low, this reaction may not be spontaneous, 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.320
 but if the temperature is high enough it will be spontaneous. 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.580
 Thus, at high temperature, 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.790
 micro level these particles 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.190
 will have very high kinetic energy. 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.090
 They will collide with each other very quickly. 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.990
 So fast that 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.290
 will be able to form all these particles. 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.410
 So the common entropy 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.360
 has increased. 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.800
 Even the electrons are in 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.250
 high power condition to convey this configuration, 

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.320
 had to 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.920
 to absorb heat. 

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.820
 We call heat, but at a micro level, 

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.720
 we are talking about kinetic energy 

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.530
 of these molecules. 

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.450
 They must have absorbed energy, but where did this energy come from? 

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.190
 It has come from the kinetic energy of the molecules. 

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.650
 At first, they may have had some kinetic energy, 

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.250
 but then part of it is given, 

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.150
 so everyone is stacked 

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.950
 in different new configurations. 

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.490
 If you say, "I do not understand it yet." 

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.390
 Think about what would happen if we try to make the reaction go in the other direction. 

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.990
 We should try to put these four 

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.890
 particles together at the same time, 

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.390
 but even if arranged in the right way, 

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.320
 their electrons can be arranged so as to separate energy. 

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.810
 Also, the temperature is very high. 

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.480
 This is a very, very chaotic system. 

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.980
 The reaction will not go from right to left, 

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.230
 will go from left to right. 

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.100
 When the system is very chaotic, things get hit 

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.860
 one in another very quickly and very likely 

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.730
 the reaction goes in the direction of higher entropy. 

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.630
 This reaction is spontaneous, although it consumes heat. 

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.500
 This reaction is spontaneous, although it consumes heat. 

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.050
 If we do not drain the heat locally, 

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.890
 the temperature at least about these molecules, 

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.150
 will fall. 

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.450
 But at first, we suppose we have a constant temperature, 

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.780
 so we assume that at a macro level, 

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.633
 this temperature is dissipated and absorbed 

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:14.670
 out of the system. 

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.620
 Now look at this configuration. 

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.650
 The reaction is exothermic, delta H is less than zero. 

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.240
 We have less enthalpy after the reaction than before. 

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.100
 So the reaction produces heat but is not spontaneous. 

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.290
 It is not spontaneous, because it decreases 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.630
 entropy in the world. 

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.850
 Reduces entropy in the world 

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.480
 and entropy matters because the temperature in this example is high. 

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.620
 We can look at the equation in a case where entropy does not matter, 

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.590
 when the temperature is low. 

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.950
 Temperature really increases entropy, 

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.220
 but when the temperature is high, entropy begins to prevail. 

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.500
 This expression becomes of great importance. 

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.820
 Here, because entropy is negative, 

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.750
 the reaction will not take place. 

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.090
 If these particles were approaching very slowly, 

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.640
 their electrons could be arranged in the right way, 

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.230
 to reach a lower energy level and 

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.263
 to give energy. 

00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:03.700
 But if they fly one by one very quickly, 

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.550
 will not be able to do so. 

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.190
 If we think of this process upside down, 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.540
 this reaction is much more likely. 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.020
 If we have several two-atom molecules, 

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.190
 who walk around, they will collide at great speed 

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.570
 and the components of the two-atomic 

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.080
 molecules will separate. 

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.060
 Or at least on the picture we have something that resembles a two-atom molecule. 

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.350
 Molecules can absorb some of the kinetic energy, 

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.750
 during the reaction to make it from right to left, 

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.690
 but a reaction in this direction is more likely. 

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.150
 From left to right, the reaction is not spontaneous, 

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.250
 because entropy is very significant at this high temperature. 

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.440
 Finally, this example is very intuitive and logical. 

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.890
 Something that needs heat, from heat 

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.000
 and there is a reduction in entropy, 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.550
 it will definitely not be spontaneous. 

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.070
 Delta H is greater than zero, T x delta S is less than zero, 

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.990
 but when we get them out, that whole 

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.070
 is greater than zero, hence delta G 

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.990
 will be greater than zero. 

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.920
 Delta - I'll write it in green. 

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.790
 This delta G will be greater than zero, 

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.520
 which is logical, because we have these two molecules, which 

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.720
 must be gathered in the right way. 

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.290
 They will need warmth to make the reaction. 

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.510
 to move the electrons to an excited state, 

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.940
 in a higher energy state and to arrive 

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.880
 to this more unstable relationship. 

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.390
 Why do they do it? 

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.620
 This reaction is much more likely to go in the other direction 

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.130
 or if we have several of these molecules, 

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.560
 they will collide, 

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.050
 will achieve a more stable configuration 

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.830
 and there will be more entropy if they are divided into their constituent parts, 

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.950
 than if they were intended. 

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.510
 Thus, delta G is greater than zero. 

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.430
 This is an endogenous and endothermic reaction. 

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.120
 Of course, here too delta G was greater than zero. 

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.240
 Although energy will be attributed to this reaction, 

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.550
 the system is so chaotic that 

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.550
 particles will not be able to connect and is more likely 

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.190
 the reaction proceeds in a direction enhancing entropy. 

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.550
 Therefore, this reaction is also not spontaneous.
