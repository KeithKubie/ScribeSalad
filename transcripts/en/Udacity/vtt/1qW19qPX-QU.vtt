00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.635
If we have three sample means and their means are very close, then they're less

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:10.808
likely to differ significantly. Similarly if the means are far apart from each

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:16.094
other, then they're more likely to different significantly. This is called

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:20.650
between group variability. And that's what we're trying to measure. You already

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.737
found that we're interested in the grand mean and the average squared deviation

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:30.046
of each sample mean from the grand mean. And we're going to keep building on

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:30.940
these ideas.
