00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:01.870
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.610
introduce the idea
of a universal set,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.870
or the universe that we care
about, and also the idea

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.674
of a complement, or an
absolute complement.

00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:12.340
If we're for doing
it as a Venn diagram,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.690
the universe is usually
depicted as some type

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.820
of a rectangle right over here.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.930
And it itself is a set.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.110
And it usually is denoted
with the capital U--

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.700
U for universe-- not to be
confused with the union set

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.780
notation.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.490
And you could say
that the universe

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.530
is all possible things
that could be in a set,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.500
including farm animals
and kitchen utensils

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.450
and emotions and
types of Italian food

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.770
or even types of food.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.780
But then that just
becomes somewhat crazy,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.650
because you're thinking
of all possible things.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.164
Normally when people talk
about a universal set,

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:51.830
they're talking about a universe
of things that they care about.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.910
So the set of all people or
the set of all real numbers

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.390
or the set of all countries,
whatever the discussion

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.560
is being focused on.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.915
But we'll talk about in
abstract terms right now.

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:08.750
Now, let's say you have a subset
of that universal set, set A.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.910
And so set A literally
contains everything

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.680
that I have just shaded in.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.140
What we're going
to talk about now

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.867
is the idea of a complement, or
the absolute complement of A.

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:22.450
And the way you could
think about this

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.110
is this is the set of all
things in the universe that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360
aren't in A. And
we've already looked

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.190
at ways of expressing this.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.770
The set of all things in the
universe that aren't in A,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.240
we could also write as
a universal set minus A.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.890
Once again, this is a
capital U. This is not

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.110
the union symbol
right over here.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.370
Or we could literally
write this as U,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.640
and then we write that little
slash-looking thing, U slash A.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.710
So how do we represent
that in the Venn diagram?

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.389
Well, it would be all the stuff
in U that is not in A. One way

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.180
to think about it, you
could think about it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.104
as the relative complement
of A that is in U.

00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:12.020
But when you're taking
the relative complement

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.020
of something that is
in the universal set,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.364
you're really talking about
the absolute complement.

00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:18.280
Or when people just talk
about the complement,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.100
that's what they're saying.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.250
What's the set of all
the things in my universe

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.139
that are not in A.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.180
Now, let's make things a
little bit more concrete

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.860
by talking about
sets of numbers.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.360
Once again, our sets-- we could
have been talking about sets

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.210
of TV personalities
or sets of animals

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.210
or whatever it might be.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.050
But numbers are a nice,
simple thing to deal with.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.850
And let's say that
our universe that we

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.040
care about right over here
is the set of integers.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.880
So our universe is
the set of integers.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.900
So I'll just write
U-- capital U--

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.370
is equal to the set of integers.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.090
And this is a little
bit of an aside,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.410
but the notation for the set of
integers tends to be a bold Z.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.294
And it's Z for Zahlen, from
German, for apparently integer.

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:02.710
And the bold is
this kind of weird

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.290
looking- they call
it blackboard bold.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.820
And it's what mathematicians
use for different types of sets

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.550
of numbers.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.570
In fact, I'll do a little
aside here to do that.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.740
So for example, they'll
write R like this

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.140
for the set of real numbers.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.710
They'll write a Q in that
blackboard bold font,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.880
so it looks something like this.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.900
They'll write the Q; it might
look something like this.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
This would be the set
of rational numbers.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.567
And you might say,
why Q for a rational?

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:33.983
Well, there's a
couple of reasons.

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:35.590
One, the R is already taken up.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.090
And Q for quotient.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.510
A rational number
can be expressed

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.520
as a quotient of two integers.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.920
And we just saw you
have your Z for Zahlen,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.520
or integers, the
set of all integers.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.032
So our universal
set-- the universe

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.150
that we care about
right now-- is integers.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.990
And let's define a subset of it.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.980
Let's call that
subset-- I don't know.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.220
Let me use a letter that I
haven't been using a lot.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.240
Let's call it C,
the set C. Let's say

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.500
it's equal to negative
5, 0, and positive 7.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.250
And I'm obviously not
drawing it to scale.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.750
The set of all
integers is infinite,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.060
while the set C is a finite set.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.940
But I'll just kind
of just to draw

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.440
it, that's our set
C right over there.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.390
And let's think about
what is a member of C,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.880
and what is not a member of
C. So we know that negative 5

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.310
is a member of our set C.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.230
This little symbol right
here, this denotes membership.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.570
It looks a lot like the
Greek letter epsilon,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.360
but it is not the
Greek letter epsilon.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.450
This just literally means
membership of a set.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.460
We know that 0 is a
member of our set.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.120
We know that 7 is a
member of our set.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.800
Now, we also know
some other things.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.530
We know that the number negative
8 is not a member of our set.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:12.160
We know that the number 53
is not a member of our set.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.540
And 53 is sitting
someplace out here.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.090
We know the number 42 is
not a member of our set.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.460
42 might be sitting
someplace out there.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.790
Now let's think
about C complement,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.810
or the complement
of C. C complement,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.250
which is the same thing as
our universe minus C, which

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.600
is the same thing
as universe, or you

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.090
could say the relative
complement of C

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.145
in our universe.

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:39.820
These are all
equivalent notation.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.850
What is this, first of
all, in our Venn diagram?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.960
Well, it's all
this stuff outside

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.520
of our set C right over here.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.880
And now, all of a sudden,
we know that negative 5

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.180
is a member of C, so it can't
be a member of C complement.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.750
So negative 5 is not a
member of C complement.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.310
0 is not a member
of C complement.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.500
0 sits in C, not
in C complement.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.990
I could say 53-- 53 is a
member of C complement.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.940
It's outside of C. It's in the
universe, but outside of C. 42

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.400
is a member of C complement.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.380
So anyway, hopefully that helps
clear things up a little bit.
