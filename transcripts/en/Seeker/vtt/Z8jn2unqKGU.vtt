00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Molly sounds like that sweet young girl

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
next door, but her real name

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is "E-X" or Ecstacy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She's old, she's been around

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the block, and she's not the nice

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
gal that you think she is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.600
 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Hey guys, Trace here for D-News. The club

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
drug, molly, has been in the news a lot

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.600
lately. What with Miley Cyrus and other popstars

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
are singing about it and 2 deaths at

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600
E-Zoo in New York over labor day weekend.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.400
But before we get too into this, I want to head

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800
some of you off with a pass. Molly

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
is E, molly is ecstasy,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
molly is MDMA.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200
Molly is a generic name for a powdered

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
or crystallized form of MDMA

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.700
or Methylenedioxymethamphetamine.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.700
The U.S. drug enforcement administration

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700
classifies it as a schedule one

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
substance, which means it is highly dangerous. Has

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
no acceptable medical use, and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700
possessing any amount of it is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
illegal. And powdered, by the way,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
powdered does not mean pure.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.700
MDMA was created and patented in 1914,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
and was famously used in 1970's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.600
by psychotherapists due to the drug's strong

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000
effect to lower inhibitions and anxiety.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In the 1980's, the drug, known as E

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
or X, began hovering around the house

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
club scene until in the 90's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it became...

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
clear that ecstasy was being cut with

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
things far more dangerous, addictive and toxic.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now in the twenty-teens,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the drug has resurfaced as molly, and part

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because of the concerted effort by the drug seller

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to re-brand it as purer,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.800
powdered form. Let me assure

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
you, scientists,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
drug users, and drug dealers alike

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
have all gone on the record

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
to say no, that is not

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
true. MDMA is an

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800
amphetamine or a stimulant, and a

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
hallucinogen. MDMA alters your brain's

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.600
neurochemistry, bonding with the structures

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
that release and absorb brain chemicals

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
associated with mood. So, serotonin,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
dopamine and norepinephrine.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.000
This immediately induces feelings of euphoria,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
closeness, and diminished anxiety

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
peaking after an hour or two, and usually

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
lasting 4 to 6. Once people pass

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
their peak, some will hit more

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and more to maintain that high.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
After the flood of chemicals abate,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
your serotonin receptors are just...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
...worn out. This

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is manifested by a depressed mood and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.600
extreme fatigue, often a day or two

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
later. Outside of the brain

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
the chemicals cause the rest of your body to go into

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
overdrive, causing high blood pressure

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600
and body temperature or hypothermia.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Which can then also cause kidney

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
and liver failure. Often people

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600
on ecstasy drink lots of water, thinking their

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600
biggest danger is dehydration, which

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600
they're kinda right. That can be bad, but

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
too much water intake combined with

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
lots of sweating, causes blood sodium

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
and electrolyte levels to drop

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
resulting in confusion, delirium,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
convulsions, and maybe even a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
stroke. The icing on this happy little cake

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
is MDMA usually

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
is not sold by itself.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
It's often cut with Ketamine, LSD,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600
speed, or anything

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
that you crush into a white powder.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
In combination, these drugs are extremely

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
toxic to the human body. Now,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
in its pure form

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600
like actually its pure form, MDMA

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
is relatively safe as drugs go

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600
but it can be habit

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600
forming, because as your neurons become immune

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600
to large amounts of serotonin, it requires

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
more drugs to get the same high.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600
Overall deaths from this ol' gal

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.600
are pretty rare. Though since

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600
2004, the number of hospital visits

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
had more than double to about 20,000 a year

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.600
So, does knowing all of this make you think twice about

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
trying it. Let me know and thanks for

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600
watching D-news today. Stay safe out there everybody
