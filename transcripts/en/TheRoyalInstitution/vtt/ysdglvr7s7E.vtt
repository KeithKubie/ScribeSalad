00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.700
Our recent CHRISTMAS LECTURES were all about
human space travel.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.570
So obviously we had to talk about zero-g and
weightlessness, which are some of the most

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.889
fundamental experiences of being in space.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.830
This led to some discussion in the office
about what weight is.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.800
I thought it'd be good to unpick in a video
some of the issues that came up,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.070
because actually I think there's a lot of
subtlety, dare I say it some confusion, in

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.730
the way people talk about the physics of weight.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.090
One of the biggest misunderstandings is around
the use of the term 'weightlessness', which

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.510
lots of people assume means that in space
you don't have any weight.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.500
But this isn't true.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.690
This misunderstanding isn't because the definition
of weight is confusing at all.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.190
It's actually really simple, and exactly as
you learn it at school.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.810
Weight is just the force on an object due
to gravity.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.600
Or if you want to be more precise, it's the
size of the gravitational attraction between

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200
me and the earth,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:07.520
or the ball and the earth, or this cup, this
chicken, and the earth.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.700
The problem I think is that the way we learn
about weight at school

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.100
doesn't quite capture the way that people
think about weight and experience it in real

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.630
life.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
As I sit here, I can say that I can feel my
weight bearing on my feet and bum, even inside

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.210
my body.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.460
But is really my weight that I'm feeling?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
Remember what we just said: my weight is just
the force of attraction between me and the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.640
Earth.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.250
But there's clearly a lot of stuff between
me and the centre of the earth:

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.080
the floor, the ground, a load of magma...

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.490
As the force of gravity pulls me down, repulsive
forces are set up within all that stuff,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.680
and at the interfaces of all those objects,
and these are intermolecular and inter-atomic

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.900
forces accumulating all the way to the centre
of the earth.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.060
The end result of that is that I just sit
here, not falling.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.810
Those forces oppose and counteract the effect
of gravity.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.070
So the really important point here is that
you don't really feel your weight either.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.880
It's all of these other forces that support
you that you experience as weight.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.450
This is where the confusion comes in.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.130
When we use the term 'weightlessness' in the
context of space and astronauts,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.780
we aren't talking about an absence of weight
itself, but an absence of what you experience

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.760
as weight on earth.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.790
In other words, the absence of the opposing
forces that support you.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.750
Confusion around this had led to another misconception,
that there is no gravity in space.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.770
But gravity is everywhere. The universe is
filled with gravitational fields, you can't

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.400
escape them.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.450
So the idea of being weightless due to the
absence of gravity makes no sense at all.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.230
Interestingly, the effect of the Earth's gravity
doesn't change that much when you go into

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.989
space anyway,

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.489
at least into low earth orbit, like the astronauts
on the International Space Station.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.709
The altitude of the ISS is about 400km, which
sounds a lot,

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.860
but is only actually about 6% of the radius
of the earth,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.239
so gravity there is almost as strong as it
is on the surface.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.530
What's really happening in space is that there's
nothing to counteract the effect of gravity.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.569
There are no opposing forces to hold you up,

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.959
so instead you just fall freely.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.530
With the ISS, which looks exactly like this,
this is exactly what's going on.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.030
It's not floating or hovering, it's just falling
like anything else towards the centre of the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.349
earth.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.099
It's just going so fast, that it overshoots
and overshoots and overshoots,

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.860
until it eventually finds itself back where
it started, and goes round again.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.060
So weightlessness is just a state of unopposed
motion under gravity,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.510
all you need to do to create weightlessness,
is drop something.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:54.470
When you do that, you remove all of those
opposing forces, and the object falls.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.760
This is how we can create temporary weightless
environments, like in aeroplanes like the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.330
'Vomit Comet',

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:10.379
which deliberately fly along paths to simulate
freefall.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.830
So I think the difficulty reconsiling this
formal definition of weight, with ideas like

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.569
weightlessness

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.779
comes from this conflation of these two slightly
different ideas:

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.719
on the one hand, you have the weight you learn
about in school, as a gravitational attraction,

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:28.729
on the other hand you have the slightly subtler
idea of weight as something you experience

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.919
and feel.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.669
In the CHRISTMAS LECTURES we really wanted
to get into this equivalence between freefall

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.039
and weightlessness.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.490
I think physicists would normally say weightlessness
is a consequence of freefall,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.419
but maybe with this view of weight, it'd be
better to say that freefall is a consequence

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.599
of weightlessness.

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.330
As soon as you stop exerting other forces
on an object, it has no choice,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.760
like Wile E Coyote, but to fall under gravity.
