As it turns out, all of these are correct. Equations with two variables can be

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:08.529
used to describe a number of situations, and depending on what concepts or items

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:12.469
we're dealing with, any or all these could be true. The more two variable

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.291
equations we see, and you'll be seeing a lot of them, the stronger your

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:18.649
intuition for dealing with them will become.
