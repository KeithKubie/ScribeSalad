00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.060
I want you to pause this
video and figure out

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.741
if you can figure out the area
of this quadrilateral right

00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:06.240
over here.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.281
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.800
Try to break it up into
shapes where it is easier

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.510
to find the area, especially
given the grid of these unit

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.620
squares that we have
right over here.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.380
So I assume you gave it a go.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.115
Now let's try to do it together.

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.895
So I'm going to
start at points where

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:32.520
it would be very easy to measure
the dimensions of whatever

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.970
figures we might break it up at.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.750
And so in general,
I want to go to any

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.090
of the whole numbers
of these units,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.107
so that point right over there.

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:41.690
And let's see.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.675
I could start to move
in this direction.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:48.870
And it looks like I might
be able to construct

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.550
a triangle down here.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.377
And it would be tempting
to go all the way across,

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:56.210
but that wouldn't be
too useful because this

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.646
gets me to halfway
through a unit.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.020
And I'm just eyeballing it to
say halfway through a unit.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.099
It might not be exactly
halfway through a unit.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.540
And so instead, let me
see if I can get away

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.190
with making a triangle
just like that.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.360
Now, I just did that.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.310
So let me try to
raise this up to see

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.746
if I can make another
triangle where it would

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.625
be easy to figure
out its dimensions.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:22.500
So once again, I don't
want to go all the way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
up here because now I'm
not at a whole unit.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.990
Instead, let me take a right
and go right over here.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.354
And notice, both
of these are very

00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:34.770
easy to figure out
its dimensions.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.000
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
units long and 1 unit high.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.070
This one right over here
is 1, 2, 3, 4 units long

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.880
and 1, 2 units wide.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.570
So let's see if we can cover
the entire quadrilateral,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.620
if we can break it up, I should
say, into a bunch of figures

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.480
like this.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.460
So it seems like we have
another one just like that.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.510
And then I could drop this
down, and then we're done.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.919
All of these are pretty
straightforward to figure out

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.130
what their dimensions are.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.640
This is 5 by 1.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.900
This is 4 by 2.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.160
This is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 by 1, 2.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.160
And this is 1 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.217
So what is the area
of this figure?

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:28.300
And of course, we have
this center rectangle right

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.630
over here.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.040
Well, a triangle that is 5 units
long and 1 unit high, its area

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.425
is going to be 1/2
times 1 times 5.

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:46.430
Or I could write it
1/2 times 1 times

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.510
5, depending on what
multiplication symbol

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.130
you are more comfortable with.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.040
Well that's just going
to be 1/2 times 5, which

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.100
is going to be equal to 2.5.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.640
So that's 2.5 right over there.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.470
This one is going to
be 1/2 times 4 times 2.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.470
Well, that's just going
to be 2 times 2 or 4.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.210
This one is going to be 1/2
times 2 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.600
Well, 1/2 half times 2
is 1 times 6 is just 6.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
And then this one's
going to be 1/2 times

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.680
1 times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.350
So once again, the area of
this one is going to be 2.5.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.750
And then finally, this
is a 3 by 4 rectangle.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.060
And you could even count
the unit squares in here.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.610
But it has 12 of
those unit square,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.437
so it has an area of 12.

00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:38.020
So if we want to find the total
area, we just add all of these

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.090
together.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:49.200
So 2.5 plus 2.5 is 5, plus 4 is
9, plus 6 is 15, plus 12 is 27.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.290
So it has a total area of 27.
