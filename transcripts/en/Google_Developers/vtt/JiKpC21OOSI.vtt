LAURENCE MORONEY:
Here, reporting

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:05.530
from the Coffee
With a Googler stage

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.159
on level two in the Moscone.

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:09.450
I'm going to be chatting
today with Ellie powers, who's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.170
a Product Manager
on the Google Play

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.920
team, who gave us a wickedly
great keynote this morning.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.897
Thanks, Ellie.

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:17.230
So tell us all about what you
do at Google Play and some

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.140
of the stuff you spoke
about in the keynote.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.880
ELLIE POWERS: Well, so I'm
a product manager, which

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.430
means I work on all sorts
of new products and services

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400
for our developers
and our users.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.420
So we're constantly
trying to understand,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.860
as the world of
Android grows, what

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.090
do developers and users need
to have a better experience.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.069
And so for users that
can mean how do we

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.360
surface the right apps to them?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.026
How do we help them
find what they want?

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:40.950
How do we help
them explore and do

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.981
the most with their phones and
tablets that they possibly can?

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
As a parent myself

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.259
I saw some of this stuff on
families that you spoke about.

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:50.800
That looked really, really cool,
because my kids use the Play

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.430
Store all the time,
and I don't want them

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.700
to find anything inappropriate.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.658
Could you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:57.892
ELLIE POWERS: Sure,
so we saw basically

00:00:57.892 --> 00:00:59.850
exactly what you've been
seeing with your kids;

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.900
we've seen that about a third
of Android users in the US

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.415
actually have kids under age 12.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.540
So that's a lot of parents
who are out there trying

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.450
to find the right
content for their kids.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940
And so we said we can
do something that's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.648
better than what we've
been doing before,

00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:14.350
and what we're so
excited to have now is

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.820
an easy way for
parents to say, let

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.440
me find the right
content for my kids.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.140
And the right content can mean
appropriate for their age,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.270
but also aligned
around their interests.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090
So whether it's like
a favorite character,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.970
if they're big fan of Mickey
Mouse or something like that--

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.470
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Dora the Explorer.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.636
ELLIE POWERS: Dora the
Explorer, that's my favorite.

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:33.820
They can go and find that
content easily and be sure

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.080
that that's going to be
appropriate for their kids.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.121
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
I'm a developer producing

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:39.680
child-friendly
content, how do I get

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.200
it like filtered and filed
and appropriately listed

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.840
in the Store?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.800
ELLIE POWERS: So, if you're
a developer on Google Play,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.460
you're already going into the
Google Play Developer Console

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.750
to publish your app
and check on the latest

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.350
stats, how much money you're
making, things like that.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.440
And so if you just go in
there, click on the app

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.820
that you want to distribute
into our family section,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.427
and then you go to a page
called Pricing and Distribution.

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:02.760
Down at the bottom, there's
actually a little check box,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.540
and it just walks you
through the process.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.710
It shows you exactly what
the requirements are,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.877
and you can submit
your app, and we'll

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:10.460
let you know as soon
as it's approved.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.320
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, so is there

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.710
some kind of smart work
going on in the background

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.529
to kind of pick characters out
of the app and validate age

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.320
appropriateness and
all that kind of thing?

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.990
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
absolutely, we

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.724
really want to have a very
professional experience

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:25.390
for the parents.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.349
We want them to be
really confident in what

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.140
their finding, so we
do go in and make sure

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.600
that it adheres to all
the rules for the program

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.800
and make sure that
we're not filing

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.310
Dora the Explorer under "Star
Wars" or something like that.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.590
So we'll make sure
that you can actually

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.650
find the right content.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: I think a
"Dora the Explorer"/ "Star

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.600
Wars" crossover
would be awesome.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.640
ELLIE POWERS: That
would be so awesome.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.490
I guess we'd have to put it
in both places in that case.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
it'd be really, really neat.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.890
Now I know you also
do a lot of stuff

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.090
with the Developer's Console.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910
Can you talk through a
little bit about that?

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, absolutely,
so one of the biggest

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.230
challenges we're seeing the
developers are facing today

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.885
is that they want to just
bring more users to their apps.

00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:00.260
So in addition to everything
we're doing on the user side

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.200
in terms of surfacing
the right apps to users,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.610
we're also making it so that
developers can take action

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.600
to make their apps
more discoverable

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.060
and to make users more
likely to install it.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.130
So there's a couple big
things we're doing there.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.880
The first one is
we're making it really

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.510
easy for developers to
create advertising campaigns.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.090
So if you haven't
tried it before,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.298
we want to make it possible
with just a couple clicks

00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:24.320
to start advertising.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.653
So we have something new in
the developer console called

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:28.840
Universal App Campaigns,
and all you need to know

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.200
is just the total budget
that you want to spend

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.340
and the amount that you
want to pay per user.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.556
And we just make it easy.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:37.180
Within a couple minutes you, can
set up your whole ad campaign,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.221
and we'll go and we'll
select the right inventory

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:45.050
across Google search, YouTube,
AdWords, and the Play Store

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.919
Search ads as well, and
so that's really easy.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.710
And so probably the
next thing you probably

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.668
want to see after that
is, well, is it working?

00:03:52.668 --> 00:03:55.030
If I'm doing certain types
of marketing activities,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.930
which ones are going
well, which ones aren't?

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.221
Where do I want to double down?

00:03:58.221 --> 00:03:59.610
Where do I want to cut back?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.830
So we have a new page that we're
calling the Conversion Funnel,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.880
and so you're able to
see all of basically user

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.530
traffic in the
Play Store, and you

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.094
can see how many users look
at your page on Play, how

00:04:10.094 --> 00:04:11.760
many of them actually
installed the app,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.007
and then how many went
on to spend money.

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:15.590
And you can also
break that down based

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.881
on how the user found your app.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.779
So you can see, oh, this
ad campaign that I created,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.810
this is how many installs
it was able to get me.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.870
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Sweet-- I also saw

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.740
that you have like an AB testing
kind of thing in the Play Store

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.324
itself, so you can
test your listings?

00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:29.031
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
that's exactly right.

00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:30.531
So a lot of developers
say that they

00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:32.531
want to make the best
store listing that's going

00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.800
to appeal to the most users.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.940
But how are you supposed
to know if like a red icon

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.856
our a blue icon is going
to be most effective?

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:39.770
And you can get in the
conversation all day,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.766
but without data,
it's not really clear

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:42.890
what you're supposed to do.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.100
So you can just create up
to three different variants

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.950
of your store listing in the
Google Play Developer Console,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.430
and then we go on and we test
those new graphics and texts

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.086
across a bunch of users.

00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:56.460
And then we'll tell you, hey,
it looks like this one here

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.551
is the winner, and you can
just switch over to it.

00:04:58.551 --> 00:04:59.800
You don't have to do any math.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.400
You don't have to
write any code.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.390
We just create
everything for you,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.766
and all you need to provide
is the graphics and the text.

00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:07.973
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, and
if I want to make changes

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:10.480
to my graphic and text based
on feedback from this testing,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.730
it's pretty fast for me to
filter that into the store?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.700
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, absolutely,
you can just make the change.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.230
We'll say, this
option is the winner,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.600
and you can just click
on it, and say, yep,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.516
I want to make that my
new Play Store listing.

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:22.140
And then very soon, it'll
show up there for everybody.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool,
and one other thing

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.540
that I saw that I was really
excited by was developers

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.140
can actually have their
own page in the store

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.580
where they list
all of their, apps

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.980
and I think that's
really powerful.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.080
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, we're
really excited about that, too.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.180
Some developers have maybe
just one or two apps,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.500
but other developers have a
very large catalog actually

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.501
of what they've created.

00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:39.791
And a lot of developers have
told us, well, wouldn't it

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:42.660
be nicer if there was just a
single place in the Play Store

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.850
where they can send users.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.599
They could say check
us out on Google Play

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.840
and send the users
to that one page.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.120
So now we've made it so that
developers can customize

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.220
that page, and they can really
give it a flavor of their brand

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.877
by putting custom
graphics there.

00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:57.460
And then if they
have a certain title,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.490
maybe they've just
launched a new game,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.590
they can feature that one
at the top of the list,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.440
and then users can go and
explore the other apps

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.570
and games that they have, too.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.260
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I personally

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.690
found it's a great
way to discover things

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.150
that I like, is
that usually, if I

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.030
like one app from
a developer, it's

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.890
like liking a book from
a particular author,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.220
that you tend to like the
other ones from that author.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.440
So if I have that page where
I can see the other apps

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.760
from that developer, it's
great for me as the user,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.490
and it's great for
that developer, too.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.590
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
absolutely, we really

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.970
hope this can be a way to build
loyal fans like you, where

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.000
you say, oh I like the first
game from this developer.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.916
I'm going to try the
next one and the next one

00:06:27.916 --> 00:06:29.160
and the next one after that.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: Exactly, and
like if I'm an app developer,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.680
how do I go about getting one of
those pages or setting that up?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.180
ELLIE POWERS: Well it's all in
the Developer Console, again,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.210
so you just go there.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.820
You click on your store listing,
and there's a new experiment

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.194
section, and you can set up
all the different experiments

00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:44.520
that you want to run,
and you can go there.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.440
And you can also go to find your
developer page in your profile

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.041
section, too.

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool,
so basically the Console

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.090
is a one-stop shop
for all of this stuff?

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.770
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, anything
you want to do on Google Play,

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.700
you can just go to the
Developer Console right there.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.570
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Cool, well thank you.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.680
Is there anything else?

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.805
We've covered so much.

00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:00.420
ELLIE POWERS: Gosh, I think
that's pretty much it.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.086
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty awesome.

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:04.035
So a lot of great new
announcements today.

00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:05.410
Thanks so much
for coming, Ellie.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.884
This has been fabulous.

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:08.550
Great job with the
keynote this morning.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.170
It was just wonderful.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.810
We've looked at
so many new things

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.480
that are available in the
Google Play Developer Console.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.220
As Ellie mentioned,
there's the advertising.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.200
There's the AB testing.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.780
There's a developer page.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.240
There's the
family-friendly stuff,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.560
and there's great new stuff
available for Play Games

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.490
developers.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.897
So just go and check out the
Google Play Developer Console.

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:31.480
If you're submitting any apps,
if you're submitting any games,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.560
there's lots of great new
tools on there for you.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.600
So thanks, Elie.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.150
ELLIE POWERS: Thank you.
