00:00:00.652 --> 00:00:02.054
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.054 --> 00:00:05.389
is start to compare distributions.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.572
So, for example here, we
have two distributions

00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:10.003
that show the various temperatures

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.314
different cities get during
the month of January.

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.021
This is the distribution for Portland.

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:16.910
For example, they get eight days

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.592
between one and four degrees Celsius.

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:22.439
The get 12 days between four
and seven degrees Celsius,

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.698
and so forth, and so on,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:26.370
and then this is the
distribution for Minneapolis.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.062
Now, when we make these
comparisons, what we're going

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:32.267
to focus on is the center
of the distributions,

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:35.350
to compare that, and also the spread.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.269
Sometimes people will talk

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.569
about the variability
of the distributions.

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.451
And so, this is, these are the things

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:44.888
that we're going to compare.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:46.316
And making the comparison,

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:48.466
we're actually going to try to eyeball it.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.070
We're not going to try to
pick a measure of central

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.586
tendencies, say the mean or
the median and then calculate

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.535
precisely what those
numbers are for these.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.922
We might wanna do those if they're close.

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:00.479
But if we can eyeball it,
that would be even better.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.947
Similar for the spread and variability.

00:01:02.947 --> 00:01:05.133
In either of these cases,
there are multiple measures

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.196
in our statistical toolkit center.

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:10.738
Mean, median is valuable of the center.

00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:14.894
For spread/variability, the
range, the interquartile range,

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:17.398
the mean absolute deviation,
the standard deviation.

00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:18.620
These are all measures.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.354
But sometimes, you can just
kind of gauge it by looking.

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:26.354
So, in this first comparison,
which distribution

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:31.543
has a higher center,
or are they comparable?

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:37.856
Well, if you look at the
distribution for Portland,

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:40.564
the center of this distribution,
let's say if we were

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:43.098
to just think about the mean,
although I think the mean

00:01:43.098 --> 00:01:46.196
and the median would be
reasonably close right over here.

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:49.550
It seems like it would
be around, it would be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.765
around seven or maybe a
little bit lower than seven.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.434
So it would be kind of in...

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:57.030
It would be kind of in that range.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.678
Maybe between five and seven
would be our central tendency.

00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:02.577
It would be either our mean or our median,

00:02:02.577 --> 00:02:06.162
while for Minneapolis,
it looks like our center

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:08.958
is much closer to maybe negative two

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.851
or negative three degrees Celsius.

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:12.374
So here, even though we don't know

00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:13.853
precisely what the mean

00:02:13.853 --> 00:02:16.516
or the median is of each
of these distributions,

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:20.516
you can say that Portland,
Portland distribution

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:25.345
has a higher center.

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:29.937
Has higher center.

00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:36.957
However, you wanna measure
either mean or median.

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.369
Now, what about the spread or variability?

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.434
Well, if you just superficially
thought about range,

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:46.187
you see here that there's
nothing below one degree Celsius

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.640
and nothing above 13.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.143
So you have about a 13-degree
range at most right over here.

00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:54.805
In fact, what might be
contributing to this first column?

00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.566
It might be a bunch of
things at three degrees

00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:58.246
or even 3.9 degrees,

00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:00.240
and similarly, what's
contributing to this last column

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.522
might be a bunch of
things at 10.1 degrees.

00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:05.761
But at most, you have a
12-degree range right over here,

00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:09.086
while over here, it looks
like you have, well,

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:12.936
it looks like it's
approaching a 27-degree range.

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:15.827
So, based on that, and even
if you just eyeball it,

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:17.941
this is just, we're using the same scales

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.797
for our horizontal axes
here, the temperature axes,

00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:24.047
and this is just a much wider distribution

00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:26.188
than what you see over here.

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:28.070
And so you would say that
the Minneapolis distribution

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.592
has more spread or a higher spread

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:32.545
or more variability.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.378
So, higher spread right over here.

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:37.777
Let's do another example.

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:41.944
And we'll use a different
representation for the data here.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.203
So we're told at the Olympic games,

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:47.013
many events have several
rounds of competition.

00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:50.577
One of these events is the
men's 100-meter backstroke.

00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:53.132
The upper dot plot shows
the times in seconds

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.526
of the top eight finishers

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.315
in the final round of the 2012 Olympics.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:59.672
So that's the green right
over here, the final round.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.971
The lower dot plot shows
the times of the same

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.350
eight swimmers but in
the semi-final round.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.850
So, given these distributions,

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:12.707
which one has a higher center?

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:16.650
Well, once again, and
here, you can actually,

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.761
it's a little bit easier to eyeball here

00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.890
what the median might be.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.787
The mean, I would probably have to do

00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:23.237
a little bit more mathematics.

00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:24.942
But let's say the median...

00:04:24.942 --> 00:04:25.775
Let's see.

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:26.768
There's one, two, three, four, five,

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:28.641
six, seven, eight data points.

00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:29.802
So the median is gonna sit

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:32.107
between the lower four and the upper four.

00:04:32.107 --> 00:04:34.156
So the central tendency right over here

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:36.115
is for the final round, is,

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:39.772
looks like it's around 57.1 seconds,

00:04:39.772 --> 00:04:42.322
while if we, especially if
we think about the median,

00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:45.330
while the central tendency
for the semi-final round,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.163
let's see.

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:46.996
One, two, three, four,

00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:48.077
five, six, seven, eight.

00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:50.584
Looks like it is right about there.

00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:54.251
So this is about 57,
more than 57.3 seconds.

00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:59.664
So, the semi-final round
seems to have a higher

00:04:59.664 --> 00:05:02.540
central tendency, which is a
little bit counterintuitive.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.342
You would expect the
finalists to be running

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:06.387
faster on average than the semi-finalists,

00:05:06.387 --> 00:05:07.957
but that's not what this data is showing.

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:11.457
So the semi-final round has higher center.

00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:14.184
Higher, higher center.

00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:19.274
And I just eyeballed the median.

00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:20.778
And I suspect that the mean

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.523
would also be higher in
this second distribution.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.090
And now what about variability?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.213
Well, once again, if you
just looked at range,

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:30.192
these are both at the same scale.

00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:33.865
If you just visually look,
the variability here,

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:37.185
the range for the final round is larger

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:40.668
than the range for the semi-final round.

00:05:40.668 --> 00:05:42.143
So you would say that the final round

00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:44.060
has higher variability.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:47.462
Variability.

00:05:48.324 --> 00:05:49.762
It has a higher range.

00:05:49.762 --> 00:05:53.436
Eyeballing it, it looks
like it has a higher,

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.316
a higher spread, and
there is of course times

00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:59.592
where one distribution
could have a higher range

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:02.292
but then it might have a
lower standard deviation.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:04.693
For example, you could have
data that's like, you know,

00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:06.707
two data points that are really far apart,

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:09.658
but then all the other
data just sits right,

00:06:09.658 --> 00:06:11.352
it's really, really closely packed.

00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:14.497
So, for example, a
distribution like this...

00:06:14.497 --> 00:06:16.248
I'll draw the horizontal axis here,

00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:19.054
just so you can imagine
it as a distribution.

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:20.626
A distribution like this

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:25.532
might have a higher range
but lower standard deviation

00:06:25.532 --> 00:06:28.032
than a distribution like this.

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:30.285
Let me just...

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:31.906
I'm just drawing a very rough example.

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:35.406
A distribution like this has a lower range

00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:40.793
but actually might have a
higher standard deviation.

00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:42.090
Might have a higher standard deviation

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.923
than the one above it.

00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:44.967
In fact, I can make that even better.

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.967
A distribution like this

00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.982
would have a lower range

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:55.419
but it would also have a
higher standard deviation.

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.048
So you can't just look at...

00:06:57.048 --> 00:06:59.673
It's not always the case
that just by looking at one

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:03.009
of these measures, the range
of the standard deviation,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:03.897
you'll know for sure,

00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:06.153
but in cases like this, it's safe to say

00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:08.025
when you're looking at it
by inspection that look,

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:10.485
this green, the final round data

00:07:10.485 --> 00:07:13.711
does seem to have a higher
range, higher variability,

00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:15.178
and so I feel pretty good.

00:07:15.178 --> 00:07:17.669
This is a very high-level comparison.
