00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This guy is moving his bucket upwards and he is exerting a force that is also somehow upwards.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I can take some component of this and it would be parallel to this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Same direction means positive.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For the woman on the other hand,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
well, she still lifts up to hold the bucket upright but she is taking it downstairs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Opposite direction means negative work.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And this sort of makes sense, it's in line with our intuition.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's hard to carry heavy things upstairs. To do so, you need to do work on that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Taking things downstairs is much easier. The work done there is negative.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This thing wants to go downstairs.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I know we're talking a lot about work but that's only because it's such a vital concept.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Stick with me a few more minutes and you're going to encounter something amazing.
