00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.750
Why Do Cats Like Catnip?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.849
Catnip, which is a perennial herb in the mint
family, contains a chemical called “nepetalactone”

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.360
that is released when catnip is crushed.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.830
When cats get a whiff of nepetalactone, most
will start rubbing themselves against it,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.070
playing around with it, sometimes eating it,
and generally will act quite bizarrely.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.290
It is thought, but not known exactly, that
this chemical mimics certain feline pheromones,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.210
specifically their theoretical facial pheromones
(it isn’t known whether these actually exist,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.629
but many researchers think so, which is why
cats probably like to rub their faces on various

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.629
things).

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.850
Once cats have been exposed to the nepetalactone
for a few minutes, it loses its effect on

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.960
them and they will usually no longer be interested
in it for about an hour or two, at which point

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010
the chemical will start to kick in again as
they breathe it in and they will once again

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.710
begin acting bizarrely around it for a few
minutes.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
Despite the apparent drug-like effect, it
isn’t thought that catnip is in any way

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.239
harmful to cats, nor is it thought that it
is addictive.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.110
Most researches think that nepetalactone simply
triggers something in their brains that causes

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.890
them to want to rub up against this particular
smell, not unlike what dogs often do when

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.430
they encounter certain smells.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.570
That being said, cats can “overdose” on
catnip, which will typically result in vomiting

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.570
or diarrhea.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.570
I’ve personally seen a cat that got into
a bulk bag of catnip that was about five times

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.570
the size of the cat.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.570
The poor cat was found with catnip all over
itself and more or less half buried in it.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.570
As a result of this, for whatever reason,
she was mostly unresponsive, was twitching

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.570
and making random noises, and had a significant
amount of drool in her fur around her head

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.570
and mouth.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.570
I expect this is something like coming home
to an overdosing drug addict.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.570
🙂 Unlike a person who’s overdosed on
a drug, though, once the cat was extracted

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.570
from her self made catnip bed and washed off
(which was much easier to do than normal given

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.570
her more or less catatonic state), within
about 15 minutes of that she was completely

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.570
back to normal with no residual effects.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.570
Interestingly, not all cats respond to catnip.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.570
Whatever genetic quirk that causes them to
respond to nepetalactone is inherited and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.570
only about 70% of cats out there show a behaviorally
difference around catnip.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.630
Further, cats under the age of a few weeks
old also are not attracted to catnip and some

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.550
even show an aversion to it.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.250
Not only are very young cats sometimes averse
to catnip, but so are cockroaches, mosquitoes,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.410
flies, and termites.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.350
In fact, nepetalactone extract has been shown
to be ten times more effective at repelling

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.250
mosquitoes than DEET (N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide),
which is the chemical traditionally used in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.610
mosquito repellant.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.460
However, it should be noted that when put
on human skin, nepetalactone’s effectiveness

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.780
as a mosquito repellant decreases quite a
bit, so it’s more suitable as a mosquito

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:18.599
repellent when sprayed on clothing 
or the like.
