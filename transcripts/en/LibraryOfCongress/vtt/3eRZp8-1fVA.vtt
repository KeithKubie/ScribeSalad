&gt;&gt; Charlotte Harper:
Everyone welcome.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.670
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.970
We really appreciate
you coming out.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.270
Who knew it was going to rain?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.200
I didn't. But you all did,
because you all have umbrellas.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.740
Anyway, thank you for coming.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.040
I'm Charlotte Harper.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.160
I'm the director of
programming here at Hill Center.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.980
For how many of you is this
your first time at Hill Center?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.280
That's great.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.690
We love having events that bring
in new people, and it seems

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.250
like this series, Life of
a Poet, with Ron Charles,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740
is one of those series.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.420
We are so happy to have Ron and
the Library of Congress partner

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.720
with us on this series.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.950
We could not, obviously,
do this without them.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.300
We are thrilled, and
we are thrilled today

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.970
to welcome Ross Gay and can't
wait to hear about his work.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.990
And by the way, his work
is being sold out here

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.870
on the right-hand side
by East City Bookshop,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.140
a nice local bookshop,
women owned and operated.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.090
Yes. But right now, ID like
to turn it over to Rob Casper,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.200
the head of the Poetry
and Literature Center

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.500
at Library of Congress.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.300
So, give it up.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.370
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Hi everyone.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.670
Thanks for coming out.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.810
I'm curious how many
people came last week too?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.600
Wow, check you out.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.140
This weather is marginally
better than-- yeah, me too.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.280
Marginally better than last
week, but we hope you continue

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.090
to come to the series
as we do rain or shine.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.810
All right.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.680
I want to thank Charlotte and
everyone here at the Hill Center

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.670
for making this series possible.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.990
It's wonderful to be back
here in this great room

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.220
with all of you tonight.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.890
I also want to thank
The Washington Post

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.750
and my personal hero,
Ron Charles.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.810
You know, two of these
conversations is a lot

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.040
to take on in one week, but--

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I
was happy to do it.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.640
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: And we're happy

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.680
to have you here,
making it possible.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.980
Before I say anything more,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.380
I just want to tell you a
little bit about the poetry

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.110
and literature center at
the Library of Congress.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.850
We are home to the Poet
Laureate Consultant in Poetry

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.870
and in fact our poet
laureate, Tracy K. Smith,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.870
will be giving her closing event
on April 15, April 15, yeah.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.700
So you should come check
her out down the street

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.110
at the Jefferson building.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.230
We also host a range
of programs.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.230
We'll have all sorts of programs
between now and April 15

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.730
over at the Library's
Capitol Hill campus.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.920
If you want to find out
more about the Library,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.880
you should visit our
website, www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.410
And we would really also
love to know what you think

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.710
about tonight's program.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.440
On your seats, there
should be some surveys.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.130
If you could fill them
out, you can leave them

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.430
on the chairs afterwards.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.820
You can hand them to me.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.770
We want to make sure
to get them and find

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.220
out what we can do
better going forward.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.900
Though with Ron there's
not much we can do.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I filled
most of them out already.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.330
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: He said why does
that introducer go on so long.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.660
So, [inaudible] kicked off
our spring series last week.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.370
We're thrilled to have Ross Gay
here to end it a week later.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.060
If only winter was as short.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.320
Ross Gay is the author of
three books, Against Which,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.580
Bringing the Shovel Down, and
Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.860
winner of the 2015, National
Book Critic Circle Award

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.020
and the 2016 Kingsley
Tuft's Award.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.330
Indeed. He is also
the founding editor

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.720
of the online sports
magazine, Some Call it Ballin',

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.390
and an editor of the
Chapbook Press's Q Avenue

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.920
and Ledge Mule Press.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.050
He is as well a founding
board member

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.600
of the Bloomington Community
orchard, a nonprofit,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.500
free-fruit-for-all food
justice and joy project,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.280
which is a great description.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.080
He has received fellowships
from Cave Canem,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.780
the Bread Loaf Writer's
Conference,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.180
and the Guggenheim Foundation.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.900
He is currently a professor
of English and director

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.530
of the Creative Writing
Program at Indiana University

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.410
in Bloomington where he lives.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.890
Of all the poets we have
featured in this series,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.940
Ross Gay has arguably
been the most anticipated.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.970
This is partly due to the fact
that our dear Ron Charles served

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.570
on the committee that awarded
Gay his National Book Critic

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.060
Circle award for Catalog

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.180
of Unabashed Gratitude
just a few years ago.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.000
The Washington Post,
and not Ron,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.450
but Elizabeth Blunt called
Catalog, "A charming collection

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.050
that gives readers
permission to feel joyful.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.010
Losses, small slights, and
large issues such as prejudice

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.210
and violence also appear,
yet the speaker always tries

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.010
to translate everything back

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.700
into the original
language of possibility."

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.830
Ron had the opportunity
to meet our future poet

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.760
at the prize ceremony in
New York and hear him read,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.200
and I believe he's been
smitten ever since.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.470
I too have been struck by Ross
Gay's poems, which NPR says,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.460
"burst forth in leggy,
unexpected ways,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.690
zooming in on legs
furred with pollen

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.440
or soiled breasts
stroking into the xylem."

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.970
[laughter] Tess Taylor
had a lot more fun

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.380
than [inaudible]
that description.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I
didn't edit that.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.150
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Though
Ross and I have never met,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.450
and I've never heard him read,

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.480
I'll never forget the
day I read Catalog

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.800
of Unabashed Gratitude
cover to cover.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.750
I was staying with
friends down in Austin,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.220
and I woke up one morning
to glorious sunlight pouring

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.690
through the blinds of
my friend's office.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.990
In the course of getting up,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.910
my eye caught Gay's
third collection

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.330
with its stunning cover art

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.200
by Arista Alanis sitting
atop a pile of books.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.710
It's right here.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.750
I thought to myself, this has
been getting a lot of play,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.120
and picked it up with the
intent to simply leaf through

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.130
and then head to the
kitchen for breakfast.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.580
Well let me tell you, I did not
leave that room until I'd gone

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.000
from To the Fig Tree on
Ninth and Christian straight

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.460
through to Last Will
and Testament,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.890
and I was good and
full of poetry.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.960
The same could be
said of what we're

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.820
about to experience right now,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.970
and I'll bet you too won't ever
forget the magic of this moment.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.510
Please join me in welcoming
Ron Charles with Ross Gay.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:35.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I am
delighted you're here.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.640
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Thank
you, same here.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.940
And we get him first, you know.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.610
His new book comes out next
Tuesday, and here is the Book

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.430
of Delights, and
it is delightful.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.730
It's not poetry.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.860
It's a selection of brief
essays that he said he wrote

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.850
because the more
you study delights,

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.680
the more delight
there is to study.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.380
My delight grows
when I share it.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.870
You will want to
get this, read it,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.630
and feel the delight
and the joy.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.710
In the middle of this piece,
I'm reading along, you know,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.880
enjoying them all, and at number
64, it's about poetry readings.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.170
So I got to read, I got
to read from this again,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.380
but I did want him to read
a bit of this first essay

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.800
to start us off, if you would.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.100
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Totally.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.700
It's called, this title
was so hard to get right.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.830
We really tried on this.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.320
It's called, number 64, fishing
an eyelash, two or three cents

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.170
on the virtues of
the poetry readings.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.130
It might be a kind of
self-aggrandizement to say so,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.100
but I love poetry readings.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.450
I love going to them.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.150
I think I love them, I probably
love them most often more

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.520
than I love poetry books.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.520
I'm pretty sure this is true.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.320
The reason is simple.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.980
Because during a poetry reading,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.060
you're watching someone
communicate with their body,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.990
which is at it communicates
in the process of fading away.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.370
It will, perhaps one day
soon, be dead I mean.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.640
It sounds necrophilic, I
know, but it's not exactly.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.760
Because the fact of the dying,
which too you and I will do,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.630
and which books will not,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.940
reminds us that the performing
body, the reading body,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.100
the living body, the body
fiddling with the reading lamp

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.590
on the podium or playing
with the hem of her dress

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.250
or keeping beat on
the microphone

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.300
like Whitney Houston used
to, looking in the corners

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.350
of the room, the occasional
sparkling line of spit

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.940
between his lips, the armpit
of their T-shirt damp,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.460
pointing to the giraffe in their
poem, all of it is illustrious.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.140
[ Applause ]

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.940
There's a charming disruptive
self-consciousness in some

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.840
of your poems when you
suddenly speak directly to us

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.610
about the very act
of writing poems,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.910
if you know what
I'm talking about.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.210
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.810
In one poem you speak of burning
the world down to rebuild it,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.340
and then you stop and
admit, well that sounds

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.400
like a bullshit poem
in the making.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.700
[laughter]

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.000
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: That's right, yeah.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And then,
in a poem called Come On,

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.020
you describe your mother's
hands as the claws of a crab,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.110
and then you stop and say,
that's one of those poetry lies.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.070
What are the hallmarks
of a bullshit poem,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.870
and what are poetry lies?

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.630
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: That's
a good question.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.190
You know, maybe a great
story that I will tell is

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:23.180
that my friend Evie was
talking about this poem

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.330
where I say something
like that in the New Book,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.070
a poem called Fee, and I said
something about, you know,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.510
I love it when a poem says
I'm trying to do this,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.910
or I'm trying to do that.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.940
Sometimes it's a
horseshit trick.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.730
But sometimes, and I sort of,
I think the poem needs to say,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.570
but sometimes like what
I'm doing, it's not.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:50.400
And Evie was like, sometimes I
think that's a horseshit trick.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.100
So, anyway, what
was your question?

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So what are,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.890
what all right the
hallmarks of a bullshit poem?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.190
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Oh, yeah.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.030
God, I don't know.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.560
But I know in myself, like there
are moments where I'm trying

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.010
to sort of just do, do
a poemy thing, you know.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A poemy thing?

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.720
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, I'm trying to
do a poemy thing, and it's like,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.570
you know, sometimes it's a
real, honest attempt to get

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.260
at some sort of genuine
feeling or something like that,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.210
and sometimes I'm
imitating the idea

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.550
of what a poem feels
like somewhere.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.850
I think something like that.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're
acting like a poet.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.450
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, totally.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.750
Like and I catch myself
periodically, like in that one

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.220
where I'm, whatever I said
about my mom, and I'm like, eh,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.450
that's bullshit, you know.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.860
So, and I think it's kind
of fun to like leave it

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.580
in there sometimes
too and be like--

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.180
So we see the poem in the
process of becoming itself.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.480
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's great fun.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.080
You teach poetry?

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.380
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You must
see a lot of bullshit poems.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.980
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.280
[laughter] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.580
I mean no more from my students
than from myself though,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.880
to be perfectly honest.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want
you to read a poem called

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.010
To the Mistake, in
your new collection.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.310
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Which is called
Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.640
To the Mistake.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.260
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: To the Mistake.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.780
It is good to know a
thing or two about that

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.160
of which you speak,
or even to be expert,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.520
which is not requisite though.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.040
A thing or two is good, like
the prop plane I know is going

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.720
to land on the canvas roof
of my friend's rickety jeep,

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.530
while the salutatorian to be
sits in the back seat giddy

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.720
with her new graphing
calculator.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.930
And the driver says something
I think about Arsenio Hall,

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.510
and he sounds like a bunny.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.770
So, I don't know how
to do this poem really.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
are you doing?

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.360
[laughter] You can just read the
poem, then we can talk about it.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.660
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: I know, I know.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.380
If it's better to
tell you before.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.560
So the story is that
I made the error

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.580
of like taking acid
right before this reunion

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.880
for the gifted class.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You'll
get to that in the poem.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.480
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: I know,
I know, I know.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.280
But I don't, I don't
want you to miss it.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.580
All right.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.880
You know the poem then.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.440
Just joking, just joking.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.640
So, while the salutatorian to
be sits in the back seat giddy

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.520
with her new graphing
calculator,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.070
and the driver says something,
I think, about Arsenio Hall,

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.260
and he sounds like a bunny in
an echo chamber, but it's hard

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.730
to hear with those
propellers roaring above.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.780
And today, I am lecturing on
the miracle of the mistake

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.490
in a poem, that hiccup or
weird gift that spirals

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.420
or jettisons what's dull
and landlocked into as

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.240
yet untraversed, i.e.,
cosmic, I overuse this metaphor

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.460
with my students, grounds.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.500
I tell this to 105 give or take
undergrads who mostly don't care

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.290
and wrestle second to second
the by now blood-borne drive

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.270
to check their beckoning
phones, which mostly,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.970
bless them, they don't.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.870
The mistake, I say, is a gift.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.170
Don't be afraid.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.760
See what it teaches you
about what the poem can be.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.560
I know of what I speak.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.030
Like the two tabs of very
potent, evidently acid I drop,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.870
four hours before this reunion
and graduation party of sorts

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.020
for we, the gifted and talented,
corn chips and Mr. Pibb

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.650
and store-bought cookies,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.270
the texture of which sunk
me knee deep in a dessert.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.200
I imagine I looked something
like an opaque cloud that day

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.740
when Mr. and Mrs.
Simonoski, our brainy hosts

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.820
and teachers guffawed
acclamation, the tremendous bead

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.570
of spit balancing on Mr.
Simonoski's lip before a gust

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.230
of air lifted it, and it
drifted to the coarse fabric

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.650
of his beard, all the
spiny hairs of which seemed

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.770
to screech like crickets.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.990
And no wonder I declined
the invitation

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.320
from the volleyball court,
although I was a phys ed major.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.640
And beneath the white arcs,
the ball painted in the sky,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.680
my classmates, Lisa
and Eugene and Ick

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.840
and Becky all looked a bit alien
with craniums engorged slightly

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.180
and spines compressed
if not even serpentine,

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.800
their limbs flailing about
wildly like cuttlefish,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.480
speaking only in poly-slavics

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.400
which must have made my breathy
grunts all the more apish.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.540
Who knows where the
poem will lead you.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.610
I tell them to let go
their reigns and listen

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.120
to the tongues half-wit
brilliance,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.160
the corner of the mind made
light by some accidental yoking

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.550
of two impossibly joined
things, one or two in the rear.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.760
I notice their eyes roll into
the backs of their heads.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.560
And my plastic cup of root beer

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.870
by now is spilling a bit
while Mr. Simonoski laughs

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.630
like a hyena, plunging
its face in a ruptured gut

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.990
and nothing has ever been
as clear to me as the bell

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.100
that rang in my head that day.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.210
We were a 12-year experiment.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.760
The garden variety brainiacs
from a suburban school,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.190
passable genetic mixture,
forgettable location,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.850
Mr. Sim's oddly large eyes

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.750
and his long reptilian tail now
making sense in the way someone

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.550
with an electric can
opener voice seemed always

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:08.300
to be inside him, speaking
when he spoke, now making sense

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.990
as the night winds
down and the last

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.030
of the cake is served writhing

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.700
with some fluorescent
scrawl only I seem able

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.680
to read while all the
good-natured kids whose

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.090
fingernails are chewed raw and
jaws pulse who are so good,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:29.130
so very good, and soon will be
hauled into the bottomless sky

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.630
under which I stumble

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.990
to see what direction they're
coming from, and can I run.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.790
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:42.260
[ Applause ]

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is one

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.170
of the most fun poems
about writing a poem.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.410
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The miracle
of the mistake in a poem,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.000
that hiccup or weird
gift that spirals

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.760
or jettisons what's
dull and land locked.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.340
The mistake, I say, is a gift.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.640
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
do you mean by that?

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.750
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Here I would

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.560
like to reference Patrick
Rosow's [phonetic] essay,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.160
The Art of the Mistake.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.300
And, you know, really it feels
to me like, so I'm going to talk

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.910
about teaching, so much
of my teaching and so much

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.490
of my writing life, like
when I'm discovering things,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.230
I feel like so often
I'm doing something

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.790
that really feels accidental.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.720
It feels like I bump
into something, you know.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.750
So, the accident or the
mistake is the thing

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.070
that I never would have
done, for whatever reason.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.370
I don't know how it gets there.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.640
Whatever, for whatever
reason something happens,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.610
and it is more true or
more like, you know,

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.130
something is revealed in a
way that I could not have sort

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.150
of willed myself to do.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.450
Something like that.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
you want your students

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.140
to become self-conscious
of that process?

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.760
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: I want to
sort of train all of us to,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.320
I mean when I'm talking to the
Intro to Creative Writing Class,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.830
which is, you know,
I just would be glad

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.530
if they came every once
in a while, you know.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.450
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: But like when I'm
thinking about my, you know,

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.070
further along students, I
am thinking about how is it

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:10.700
that we can allow ourselves
or set up the conditions

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.810
for ourselves to write things

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.630
that we otherwise
could not have explored

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.880
so that our knowledge itself
is not the sort of determining

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.960
or predetermining sort of limit
of what we can make, you know.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.860
So we know something, but
then there's this other kind

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.170
of knowing.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.310
And my hope as a teacher
and as a whatever,

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.520
someone who makes stuff, is
that I'm able to sort of figure

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.120
out how to bump into those other
kinds of knowing, you know?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, yeah.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.050
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Okay.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You describe
the poetry-making process

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.780
in a variety of ways.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.520
In one poem called The Opening,

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.820
there's this gorgeous
description

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.570
of you pruning a peach tree.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.580
And you describe pruning away,
pruning away, pruning away,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.250
until you say the
air and the light

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.000
and even a bird can
flow through it.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.300
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It seems
to me you're talking about,

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.980
among other things,
editing a poem.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.280
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.580
That's totally right.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.880
That's all right, hey.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Not
at all, not at all.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.480
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In The Spoon,
you write, I swear when I got

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.470
into this poem I would convert
this sorrow into some kind

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.040
of honey with a little music
that I can sometimes make

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.830
with these scribbled
artifacts of our desolation.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.130
Tell us about that.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.100
Converting sorrow into honey.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.170
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: That poem is so
like trying hard to make sense

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.170
of something that
doesn't make sense.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It
says that in the poem.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.600
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah,
exactly, and--

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But I think many

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.700
of your poems are making
honey out of sorrow.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.000
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.300
That's right.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.100
I think that was a poem
where I realized it more sort

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.310
of profoundly than maybe
in some other poems.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:47.080
And yeah, it occurred to
me that often that the act

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.050
of writing a poem, for me is
to make sense of something

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.580
that doesn't make sense, or
maybe, I don't know, yeah,

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.100
something like that, and
it arrived in that poem,

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.430
that sort of thing of like,
oh, this is kind of what we do.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.030
This is kind of what we do,
like try to organize or order

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:11.090
or make beautiful what
doesn't make sense, you know.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The honey sounds
sweet, risk being saccharine,

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.230
your poem is taking
on some really,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.210
really tough, horrible issues.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.020
They are not sweet
poems, generally.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.320
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
scribbled artifacts

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.820
of our desolation are really
clear in some of these poems.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.250
Would you read a poem called For
a Young Emergency Room Doctor?

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.550
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Take
the tab out.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.640
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.590
For a Young Emergency
Room Doctor.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.460
Although this prayer should
first dress the dead boy's

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.320
wounds, nine gunshots, in
and out, the spine pierced

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.210
and wrecked enough to twist
the head dangled backward,

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.520
and before the body, the night
through which the bullet chewed,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.480
and the latex sheathing the
hands of the cops who dragged

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.700
and dropped the boy
on the gurney,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:12.270
last touch of this world
gloved, and the heart's dirge,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.150
dwindling lament for
spilled blood, lost love too,

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.090
for the blankets of
light wrapping him,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.230
jeweling the viscous
liquid slicking his lips.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.490
It's for the living, for those

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.980
who close the boy's
eyes again and again.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.650
For whom salve is the
wound's mend, the eased bleed,

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.100
who tell the story while eating,

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.970
who too die at the
dying's rising pile.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is this written
from some personal experience?

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.690
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, this
is my best, you know,

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.900
one of my best friend's is
an ER doctor, and we were in,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.000
I was getting my PhD in English
while he was in med school.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.630
So we were living
together, and I was sort

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.480
of with him while
he was in training.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.900
So, you know, he was
encountering all kinds of,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.200
you know, [inaudible].

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's incredibly
common for ER doctors.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.880
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah,
yeah, totally.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
city was this in?

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.480
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Philly.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.080
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.040
I haven't read that
poem in a long time.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Here's
another poem called the Bullet

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.280
in Its Hunger.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.670
It's number four.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.270
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.790
The Bullet in Its Hunger.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.800
The bullet in its hunger
craves the womb of the body,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.900
the warmth from there.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.330
Begs always release from
the chilly dumb chamber.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.920
Look at this one who's glee
at escape was out shown only

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.390
by the heavens above him.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:57.740
The night's even-keeled breath,
all things thus far dreams

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.040
from his cramped bunker.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.800
But now, the world.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.270
Let me be a ravenous
diamond in it, he thinks,

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.110
chewing through the
milky jaw bone

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.180
of this handsome 17-year-old.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.600
Of course, he would have loved

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.670
to nestle amidst the brain's
scintillant catacombs,

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.750
which only for the boy's
dumb luck slipped away,

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.430
but this will do.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.250
The bullet does not, as
the boy goes into shock,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.720
or as his best friend
stutters, palming fluid wound,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.200
want to know the nature of
the conflict, nor the sound

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.290
of the shooter's
mother in prayer,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.200
nor the shot child's
future harmonies,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.270
the tracheostomy's
muffled wheeze,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.000
threaded thru the
pencil's whisper

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.350
as the boy scrawls unscarred.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:51.850
No. The bullet, like you, simply
craves the warmth of the body.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.930
Like you, only wants to
die in someone's arms.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:03.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's an
incredibly unnerving poem.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.180
And paired with the other
one, there's nothing as sweet

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.050
or honey, nothing
was transformed

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.680
into honey in those poems.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.120
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
inspires poems about that kind

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:20.460
of endemic American violence?

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:25.550
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: I guess trying to
figure out like some [inaudible]

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.370
to think about what feels
like such a profound failure

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.710
of the imagination, you know.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:39.230
It just feels, you know,
some way of talking

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:44.080
about how this is, how this is
even possible among, you know,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.180
like people who ostensively care

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.060
for each other or
can, you know--

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:55.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like why
it would become normal

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.640
to lose 85 people a
day to gun violence.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.940
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Exactly.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.240
It's just a thing.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.410
It's just what it is.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.760
It's, you know, it's, and you
know, of course, you talk to,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.890
you know, it's fucking crazy.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.490
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: It's fucking crazy.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.030
And I guess in a way the poem
is just trying to be like,

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:19.310
you know, I don't even know,
like trying to just further sort

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:24.550
of contend with the craziness.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well, it
upsets our apathy, I think.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.910
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's so creepy
and unnerving that it forces us

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.950
to content with this violence

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.890
in a completely different
and unsettling way.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.240
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Right,
right, right.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A
lot of the violence

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.840
in your poems is
linked to racism.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.080
In The Book of Delights, the
essay collection that'll come

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.380
out Tuesday, you write,

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.170
I'm trying to remember the
last day I have been reminded

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.710
of the inconceivable violence
black people have endured

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.890
in this country.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.870
Innocence is an impossible state
for black people in America

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.700
who are by virtue of this
country's fundamental beliefs

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.580
always presumed guilty.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:10.920
And if you'd read
this poem, Postcard.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.360
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Postcard.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.560
Lynching of an unidentified
man, circa 1920.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.460
I don't want to read it.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.760
I can't.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.360
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Thank you.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How about Pulled

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.560
Over on the Short
Hills of New Jersey?

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.860
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.160
I can read that.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There
was a display at the show

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.760
at the portrait gallery.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.060
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just went down.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.660
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do you remember
the name of the photographer?

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.930
She took photos of lynchings
and through some magic took

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.340
out the bodies, and
so all we're left

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.590
with are these grinning white
people looking at the cameras.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.960
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Absolutely
unspeakably horrible.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.910
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.270
Yeah. Pulled Over In
Short Hills of New Jersey

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:10.310
at 8 a.m. It's the shivering,
when rage grows hot as an army

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.310
of red ants and forces the mind

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.730
to quiet the body,
the quakes emerge.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.550
Sometimes just the knees, but at
worst, through the hips, chest,

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:24.800
neck, until like a virus,
slipping inside the lungs

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.000
and pulse, every ounce of
strength tapped to squeeze words

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.280
from my taut lips, his eyes
scanning my car's insides,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.420
my eyes, my license, and as I
answer the questions, three,

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.200
four, five times, my
jaw tight as a vice,

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.510
his hand massaging the gun butt,
I imagine things I don't want to

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.850
and inside beg this

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.760
to end before the shiver
catches my hands and he sees

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.060
and something happens.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I have had
you read these brutal poems.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.450
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because we're
about to talk about gratitude,

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:12.190
and I want your audience to
know that you have contended

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:17.050
with the most horrible
aspects of life

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:21.390
and still somehow
persist in joy.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.820
And it's the most
remarkable thing about you.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.470
In some of your poems, we can
see you moving back and forth

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.800
between the light and horror

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.380
in really surprising
unsettling ways.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.680
Grief to joy.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.340
It's a signature maneuver
in some of your poems.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.640
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would
you read Ode to Buttoning

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.860
and Unbuttoning My Shirt?

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.160
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.460
Yeah.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Seven.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.060
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.360
I had such a nice
time last night.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.660
I was reading at Villanova,
and a couple of these,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.170
a couple students had read the
book, and they were talking

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.520
about this poem and they were,
when they were talking to me,

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.720
they were sort of like
buttoning and unbuttoning.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.860
[laughter] It was great.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.880
Ode to Buttoning and
Unbuttoning my Shirt.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.400
No one knew or at least I
didn't know they knew-- no.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.390
No one knew or at least I didn't
know they knew what the thin

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.750
disks threaded here on my shirt
might give me in terms of joy.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.370
This is not something
to be taken lightly.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.020
The gift of buttoning one's
shirt, slowly top to bottom,

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.170
or bottom to top or
sometimes the buttons will be

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.630
on the other side, and I
am a woman that morning,

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.900
slipping the glass
through its slot.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.120
I tread differently that
day, or some of it anyway.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.530
My conversations are different.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.220
And the car bombs slicing
the air and the people in it

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.510
for a quarter mile and the
honey bee's legs furred

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.220
with pollen mean another thing
to me than on the other days,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.550
which too have been drizzled
in this simplest of joys,

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.860
in this world of spaceships and
subatomic this and that, two,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.700
maybe three times
a day some days,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.790
I have the distinct pleasure of
slowly untethering the one side

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.970
from the other, which is
like unbuckling a stack

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.350
of vertebrae with delicacy.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.460
For I must only use
the tips of my fingers,

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:08.460
with which I will one day
close my mother's eyes.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.010
This is as delicate as
we can be in this life,

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.800
practicing like this,
giving the raft of our hands

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.660
to the clumsy spider
and blowing soft

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.870
until she lifts her damp
heft and crawls off.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.340
We practice like this, pushing
seed into the earth like this,

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.200
first in the morning,
then at night,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.590
we practice sliding
the bones home.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.390
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:38.110
[ Applause ]

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So lovely, and
you hear that movement back

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.140
and forth, and it's
surprising each time, right.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.310
It starts so light, funny.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.180
This is not to be taken
lightly, the pleasure

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.480
of buttoning my shirt.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.780
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.050
And then, the car bomb
suddenly slices the air.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.790
And those delicate fingers

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.090
with the buttons are
suddenly closing--

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.240
It's surprising,
again and again.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.900
Would you read a
poem called Feet?

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.670
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Oh, yeah.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This also
feels so light and funny.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.610
It's not just me.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.910
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:20.770
Feet. The things that
you might need to know is

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:29.050
that the Real World was a, maybe
it is a show still on a MTV?

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This
looks like an MTV crowd.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.650
[laughter]

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.540
&gt;&gt; They canceled it.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.420
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Oh, they
cancel, okay thank you.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank
you, young person.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.580
[laughter]

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.920
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Thank you.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:46.570
Yeah. And the other one
is Powerman and Iron Fist.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.950
So that's a comic book.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.830
Luke Cage is Powerman.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:55.010
Powerman and Iron Fist, that was
what I read when I was a kid.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:31:00.100
Feet. Friends, mine
are ugly feet.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.770
The body's common wreckage
stuffed into boots.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.640
The second toe on the left
foot is crooked enough

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.250
that when a child asks what's
that of it, I can without flinch

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.580
or fear of doubt lie
that a cow stepped on it,

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.620
which maybe makes them fear
cows, for which I repent.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.310
In love as I am with those
philosophical beasts,

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.510
who would never smash
my feet nor sneer

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.090
at them the way my mother does.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.310
We always bought you good
shoes, honey, she says.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.900
You can't blame us
for those things.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.600
And for this, and other--

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.730
my mom has been in a crowd
like when I've read that poem,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.160
and she loses her
mind at that line.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.120
She like falls out
of her seat laughing.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.190
And for this and other
reasons, I have never indulged

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:47.430
in the pleasure of flip flops,
shy or ashamed, digging my toes

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.260
like ten tiny ostriches into the
sand at the beach with friends,

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.670
who I'm not sure love me.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.290
Though I don't think
Tina loved me.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:58.770
She liked me I think,
but said to me,

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.150
as we sat on lawn chairs beside
a pool where I lifeguarded

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.150
and was meticulous at
obscuring from view with a book

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.620
or towel my screwy friends,
you have pretty feet.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.900
In that gaudy, cement
mixer, Levittown accent

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.730
that sends all the lemurs
scaling my rib cage to see,

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.220
and she actually
had pretty feet.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.510
So I took this as a
kindness, incomparable

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.600
and probably fell a
little bit in love with her

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.210
for that afternoon, with the
weird white streak in her hair

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:30.480
and her machine gun chatter
and her gums snapping,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.760
and so I slid my feet
from beneath my Powerman

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.740
and Iron Fist comic book into
the sun for which they acted

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.950
like plants, open their tiny
mouths to the food hurtling

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.100
to them through the
solar system.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.010
And like plants, you could
watch them almost smile,

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.040
almost say thank you.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.130
You could watch them turn
colors and be almost emboldened,

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.780
none of which Tina saw,
because she was probably digging

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.180
in her purse, or talking about
that hotty on the Real World

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.720
or yelling at some friend's
little sister to put her ass

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.080
in her trunks or pouring
the crumbs of her Fritos

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.770
into her thrown open mouth,

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.540
but do you really think I'm
talking to you about my feet?

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.440
Of course she's dead.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.390
Tina was her name, of
leukemia, so I heard.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.820
Why else would I try
sadly to make music

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.690
of her unremarkable kindness?

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.460
I'm trying, I think,
to forgive myself

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.730
for something, I
don't know what.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.090
But what I do know is
that I love the moment

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.770
when the poet says
I'm trying to do this

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.350
or I'm trying to do that.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.400
Sometimes it's a horseshit
trick, but sometimes it's a way

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.220
by which the poet says I
wish I could tell you truly

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.750
of the little factory in my
head, the smokestacks chuffing,

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.240
the dandelions and
purslane and willows

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.930
of sweet clover prying
through the blacktop.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.160
I wish I could tell you how
inside is the steady mumble

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.020
and clank of machines, but
mostly, I wish I could tell you

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:06.270
of the footsteps I hear,
more than I can ever count,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:11.480
all of whose gaits I can
discern by listening closely,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.230
which promptly disappear after
being lodged again, here,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.580
where we started, in the factory

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.010
where loss makes all
things beautiful grow.

myself at that moment,

the way that memory,
I think, I think.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:07.140
The way that memory gets
sort of conjured out of that,

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:15.270
that sense of like, oh, that,
that person's not here anymore.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.910

unremarkable kindness becomes

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:35.310
of writing it, like
trying to, yeah, yeah.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.430
Something like that.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That
little factory in your head,

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.240
the factory where loss makes
all things beautiful grow.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.540
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
the poetic function.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.410
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:54.000
Yeah. Now I don't think only
loss makes beautiful things

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.880
grow, but I think probably the
fact of loss is always there

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.360
with the beautiful
things that are growing.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.450
You know, I think it's probably
actually the truth, you know.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.050
Even the most abundant
and ebullient sort

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:18.930
of exaltative poem has loss
around it, touching it.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
honest, if it's honest.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.770
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, if it's
honest, yeah totally, yeah.

all going to stand up,

do this all the time?

That's great.

of them expect it.

intermission, you can't leave.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.740

can't concentrate.

before I read the long poem

We're halfway.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:09.580
[laughter] You've got a poem
called Heaven, which is full

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.920
of some really stark
juxtapositions.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.520

this poem?

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.180
This is the heaven.

child whose eyes are wide enough

siblings, each hungry as him.

Maybe, probably one will
die from some disease

that twists the air
from his lungs.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.740
It will hurt.

out, and love thick as ore.

The heaven takes
and takes, smirks.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.390
It is the weight sinking

into a shroud of light.

poem reaching for a sort

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:20.550
of complexity and
an encapsulation

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.510
of different things that
you can't really contain.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.180
Yeah. Like, you know, it's
sort of, I'm trying to think

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.740
like what I was thinking
about or, but it's clear

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.470
that in some way the poem
wants to be like, you know,

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.850
the whole thing is the
heaven, that's the,

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.160

of, it's like the whole thing.

the end, like that conversation

looked at that poem for years.

It's amazing.

poems are about the persistence

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.720
of life, what you call the
florid burden of living.

tick, the following.

must have sounded

like a rocket's stratospheric
crash,

just crested the crown,

head, now a kabob,

to unscrew the skewer

from the little lodged
missile and pull it out,

think he had treated

heard about it.

interesting to me to look

at that poem and then say
to look at that heaven poem

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.640

so many of the poems

not changed, you know.

same poem, different syntax.

so gory it's funny.

then the line

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.810
about grace taking strange
shapes and the light

of heaven shining
on his budding horn.

to imagine grace amidst horror.

mean I think it wants

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.160
to be like, I hope he's okay.

It's another poem where the
feelings and the themes are not

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.120
at war with one another
but definitely in conflict.

at, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.980

delights, I say something about,

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.360
because I have a mind of
death, da da da da da,

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.210
and like all these
poems it's like, yeah.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.720
I wasn't lying.

just had a mind of death--

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.320
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: I know, I know.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.620
That'd be a bummer.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Outside the
Wake of a Friend's Father.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.940
Although I know I
should be trying hard

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.290
to palpate this common
sorry, to unspool sympathy

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.750
for the bereaved, stumbling
and sobbing inside those doors,

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.540
my tongue sits like
a stone in my mouth,

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.130
and the truth's matter is,

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:16.920
I am right now contemplating the
mysteries of light on an ankle.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.770
That one, in particular,

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:22.970
which beneath this sun
favors the Earth's lush shape

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.560
from the an airplane.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.240
And it might be the dogwood
abloom, like a gaggle

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.450
of screaming angels makes me
dumb or the wrenched gut slight

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:35.880
of hand, but that ankle has put
death to bed and has me dreaming

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.260
of the lucky saint whose tongue
transcribes channeled [phonetic]

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.970
fragments throughout the
minute ravines there.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.890
And I know I should stop, except
I hear my own father's dust

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.800
at this moment whispering
in a breeze.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.640
No, no, go on.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.100
So let me sing the largest
praise upon the subtlest

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.370
juncture of flesh and bone,
bony bud, the pillow upon

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.150
which scripture was dreamt
and writ, mother of the muses

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.300
in their gowns flowing
just above their ankles,

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.690
and the sun's hot mouth
breathing on me in dress pants,

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:13.340
afraid to enter the parlor
for my own wound lying

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.560
in that casket, rubs
also its lips along

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.370
that miniscule mountain
of motility.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:23.290
Crossroads of the foot's baroque
architecture and the girder

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.460
of the shin, delicate crux
calling at once birdsong

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.060
and the melodious
stirring of worms,

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.230
ecstatic axis whose
dragonfly-like skinning

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:37.300
of this New Jersey asphalt
parking lot sucks gasps

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.470
and moans from all of
Trinidad's tarpits.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:45.070
Ankle, ankle, for which I would
give my good hand to listen

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.540
to its trillion vascular
secrets,

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:52.900
which include heartbreak's
4268 glistening names.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:57.900
Silk, stamen, inseam,
moonlight, diamond,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.600
father, smoke, mirage, ankle.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.780
Don't ask, just close your eyes,
get on your knees and pray.

Will do.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You know, she's
supposed to be very reverent,

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.650
but she can't stop
laughing during a funeral.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.380
You're obviously
supposed to be grieving,

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.430
and you can't stop
observing this presumed young

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.120
woman's ankle.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:52.040
Yeah. The persistence
of life amidst grief,

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.340
lust amidst sorrow.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.880
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.180

and funny.

Yeah, yeah.

Like the, you know, it's a body.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:05.170
That's like sort of admiring
like being alive or like sort

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:11.330
of being alive, which
includes, you know, the dead,

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.380
the dead in the other room.

of your father's voice--

No, yeah, I think
it's interesting.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.920
I mean it's like I can remember
the experience from the poem,

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.300
that the poem sort
of came out of it.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.610
It was around the time of,
it was, you know, all these,

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.190
so many of these poems are
poems of mourning for my father.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.150
It's just like these different
ways of sort trying to sort

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:54.140
of contend with this absence and
this sorry and this, you know,

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.700
illness that had led
up to it and all this.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.440
And that's one of them.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.130
I mean one of the thing that
I sort of was getting a kick

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.140
out of reading the poem is
how much it's in the mouth.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.450
It's so like chewy, you know.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.570
Like all those words, and
it kind of makes me glad

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:18.020
to remember, again Tom Lux and
other people, how much a kind

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:23.080
of like leaning on
language is going on.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.560
And it's just like the erotic,
it's the erotics of the music

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.580
in the mouth, you know,
is sort of happening.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.770
So that even saying it,
it's like your mouth has

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:36.490
to do all these sorts
of, you know, things.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:37.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.560
It pushes back against death
even in memorializing it.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.860
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Totally, yeah.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.160
It's like music.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.460
You know, you dance.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.760
That's it.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.060
You know.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one
poem you say dance is one

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.660
of the things you
happen to do pretty well.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.960

even though I don't know it,

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.180
I love that Mary
Tyler Moore reference.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.030
[laughter] That was
totally curveball.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:16.330
That's great.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
poem called Overheard.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.710
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Um, yeah.

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.010
Overheard.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:34.070
It's a beautiful day the
small man said from behind me,

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.050
and I could tell he had a slight
limp from the rasp of his boot

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.600
against the sidewalk, and
I was slow to look at him,

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.400
because I've learned to close
my ears against the voices

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.680
of passersby, which is easier

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.380
than closing them
to my own mind.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.150
And although he said
it, I did not hear it

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.670
until he said it a second
or third time, but he did.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:55.830
He said, it's a beautiful day.

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:59.090
And something in the way he
pointed to the sun unfolding

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.970
between two oaks
overhanging a basketball court

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:05.780
on Tenth Street made me too
catch hold of that light,

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.950
opening my hands to the
dream of the soon blooming,

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:10.690
and never did he
say forget the crick

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.820
in your neck nor
your bloody dreams.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.070
He did not say forget
the multiple shades

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:19.160
of your mother's heartbreak
nor the father in your city,

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.490
kneeling over his bloody child.

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:25.090
Nor the five species of bird
this second become memory.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:29.730
No, he said only it's a
beautiful day, this tiny man,

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.370
limping past me with
upturned palms,

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.510
shaking his head in disbelief.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.450
that your poems again
and again reenact.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.750
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Right, right, yeah.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.260
And the garden is like this
bounty, like this bounty,

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:13.730
like this bounty of sort of,
you know, like it's so full

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:18.380
of wonder and incomprehensible
like happenings, you know.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:19.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.540
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Like there's so
much going on in a garden,

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.180
which is part of why
I remain fascinated,

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:28.210
and I think I'll probably never
not be fascinated by the garden

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:29.830
because I will come
upon something,

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:32.860
and I'll be like,
what are you doing?

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.100
You know, what is happening?

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:39.640
Like how is it that this many
pollinators are swirling around?

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.190
Like I can't get my head
around it, you know.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.600
And that feels, that
feels wonderful.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.540
Like there is this cycle, this
utterly necessary cycle going

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.600
on that I can witness and be

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.880
like that's fucking
beautiful and--

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Miraculous.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.500
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yes, yes, yes.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You have
so many great references

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.100
in your poems to bees.

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.400
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Bumblebees.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.000
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Bees coming out
of flowers covered in pollen.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.170
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:13.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Confused
and drunk.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.330
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You have a
gorgeous poem called burial

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:25.250
about using your own father's,
using your own father's ashes

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.410
as fertilizer for your plums.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:33.230
Could you read that for us?

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:34.560
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.860
Of course.

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mark 14.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.460
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yep.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:44.110
So when I read this,
I need to ask

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:47.180
if anyone has done
anything with placenta?

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.350
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.730
What have you done with
a placenta, if I may?

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:54.040
&gt;&gt; I buried it under a tree in
our back garden, a cherry tree

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.340
that I love very much.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.640
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Okay, great.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.940
Yeah, yeah.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.240
So that's a thing.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.820
A beautiful thing.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.370
Burial. You're right,
you're right.

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:06.830
The fertilizer is good.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:09.900
It wasn't a gang of dullard
came up with chucking a fish

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.260
in the planting hole or
some midwife got lucky

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.560
with the placenta.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.280
Oh, I'll plant a tree here.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.070
And a sudden flush of quince
and jam enough for months.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:23.800
Yes, the magic dust our bodies
become cast spells on the roots

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.220
about which someone else could
tell you the chemical processes,

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.080
but it's just magic to me, which
is why a couple springs ago

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.940
when first put it in my
two bare root plum trees

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:38.860
out back I took the jar which
has become my father's house

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:42.620
and lonely for him and hoping
to coax him back for my mother

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:47.110
as much as me, poured some
of him in the planting holes.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.250
And he dove in, glad
for the robust air,

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:53.360
saddling a slight gust
into my nose and mouth,

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.380
chuckling as I coughed.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.190
But mostly he disappeared into
the minor yawns in the earth,

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:03.850
into which I placed the trees,
splaying wide their roots

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.260
and casting the gray dust

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.450
of my old man evenly
throughout the hole,

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:12.160
replacing then the clods
of dense Indiana soil

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.370
until the roots and my father
were buried, watering it all

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:20.920
in with one hand while holding
the tree with the other straight

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.680
as the flag to the
nation of simple joy,

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.380
of which my father is now
a naturalized citizen.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:31.240
Waving the flag from
his subterranean lair.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.280
The roots curled around him
like shawls or jungle gyms,

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.310
like hookahs or the arms of
ancestors before breast stroking

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:42.990
into the xylem, riding the
elevator up through the cambium

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:47.470
and into the leaves where when
you put you ear close enough you

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.340
can hear him whisper.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.900
Good morning.

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.900
Where if you close your eyes

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.120
and push your face you can
feel his stubbly jowls,

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.170
and good Lord, this
year he was giddy

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:02.600
at the first real fruit set and
nestled into the 30 or 40 plums

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.750
in the two trees, peering
out from the sweet meat

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:08.510
with his hands pressed
against the purple skin,

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.800
like cathedral glass.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.000
And imagine his joy as the sun
wizarded forth those abundant

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.110
sugars, and I plodded
barefoot and prayerful

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.240
at the first ripe plum swell
and blush, almost weepy,

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.610
conjuring some surely
ponderous verse

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:26.230
to convey this bottomless grace.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.190
You know, oh father, oh
father kind of stuff.

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:33.410
Hundreds of hot air balloons
filling the sky in my chest.

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:35.790
We're placing his
intubated body,

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:39.240
listing like a boat
keel side up.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.690
Replacing the steady stream
of water from the one eye,

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.100
which his brother wiped
before removing the tube.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.650
Keeping his hand on the
forehead until the last wind,

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:51.040
and his body wandered off,

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.920
while my brother
wailed like an animal.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:58.420
And my mother said,
weeping, it's okay.

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.720
It's okay.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.100
You can go honey.

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.550
At all of which my
father guffawed,

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:07.390
by kicking from the first
buckets of juice down my chin,

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.740
staining one of my two
button-down shirts,

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:15.080
the salmon-colored silk one,
hollering, there's more of that.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.800
Almost dancing now,
the plum in the tree.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.460
The way he did as a person,
bent over and biting his lip

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.950
and chucking the one hip
out and then the other

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:31.450
with his elbows cocked and fists
loosely made and eyes closed

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:34.690
and mouth made trumpet when he
knew he could make you happy,

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:38.300
just by being a little
silly and sweet.

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:47.170
[ Applause ]

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
just perfect.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:53.790
That's not a poem you can write
in the grips of fresh grief.

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:55.090
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:56.390
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:57.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
grief resolved.

00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:58.990
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Transformed.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:01.590
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Transformed, yeah.

00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:02.890
Yeah, and the garden sort

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:04.190
of modeled how we
might do that, for me.

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:05.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
very lovely.

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:06.790
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, thank you.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Very lovely.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.930
In the title poem of
your latest collection,

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:19.130
Catalog of Unabashed
Gratitude, you write,

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:23.160
I can't stop my gratitude,
which includes dear reader, you,

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.880
for staying here with me,

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.240
for moving your lips
just so as I speak.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.090
I want so badly to rub
the sponge of gratitude

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:36.260
over every last thing.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.850
Why is gratitude so
important to you,

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:40.030
or why has it become
so important to you?

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:47.160
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: You know, I've
been trying to think about that,

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.680
like, I mean obviously it's
sort of this, as I'm reading all

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.460
of these poems, it's this
think I'm sort of like arriving

00:59:55.460 --> 01:00:00.620
at over years of sort
of thinking and study.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:05.310
But I think, like thinking
about that heaven poem,

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.500
it's like what am I working
out there, like working

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:12.540
out like how do you sort
of deal with all of it,

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.250
like sort of just sort
of be with all of it.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:24.670
And but then there's this,
this thing in that Catalog poem

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:29.210
where I, I sort of, you know,
I want to practice this thing

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:34.280
of acknowledgement, that one,
that we are not here long

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.910
if we're, you know,
we're not here long.

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:39.500
And so there is this
kind of preciousness

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:44.180
that no matter what
it's fleeting, you know,

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.230
and it's passing, and you are
passing, and I am passing,

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:50.320
and that, I think we're
more likely, if we're sort

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.620
of with that, we're more likely

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.400
to love each other
actually, you know.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.590
And then I think of this, I've
been thinking about like what,

01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:00.360
I had this card, I mean I
do letter press printing,

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.540
and I made these cards with
the word interdepend on them.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:11.260
And I gave, I gave one to a
friend, and she was like, yeah,

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:15.380
that's, that can be hard
work, hard to do, you know.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.660
And I was like, right, and
sort of thinking about it,

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:27.520
and I was thinking, like
among the sorrows or mistakes

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.460
or failures of the
imagination again is to,

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.740
is to not understand
or not believe

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.450
that we are fundamentally
interdependent, you know.

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:43.090
And when I say we, I mean the
grand we, meaning the water,

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:47.600
you know, meaning the air,
meaning the trees, you know.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.340
Everything is interdependent,
and that is like,

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:56.330
and I feel like, you
know, when you celebrate,

01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:58.820
and it just occurred to me like,
you know, maybe I'm slow coming

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:03.640
to this, but when you celebrate
the winter equinox say,

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:10.150
you're saying to the earth,
etc., if you're so gracious

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:16.250
as to come back, Summer, that
would be awesome, you know.

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.290
[laughter] Which is like
a real thing to say.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:25.750
Like if you are so gracious to
rain again or to stop raining

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:31.200
or however it is, if you're
so gracious as to grow things.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.190
And it strikes me that
the more, the more I think

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:37.250
about gratitude, the more I'm
thinking that like, you know,

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.210
because there's like
gratitude about like, yeah,

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:40.690
I got a nice pair of
shoes, I'm grateful,

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:43.850
like that's, who
cares, you know.

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:47.390
When I'm talking about
gratitude, I think,

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:52.070
the more I sort of try to
put it together in my head,

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:56.720
I'm talking about the
understanding of this

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.010
like undeniable
interconnectedness

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:03.680
and interdependence actually,
and I think that's thing

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.600
that we are utterly
necessary to one another.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.440
And again, like the one
another is the big one another,

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.800
and I feel like if you, if
you think of it like that,

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.040
it is like, it conjures
and it requires gratitude.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.260
It requires gratitude, you know.

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.880
But if you think, I'm in charge
of the water because I turn it

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.950
on and I pay the bill, it's
like that's a fucking joke.

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.410
That's a joke.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.810
See. [laughter]

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:37.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: From
the mouth of babes.

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:47.170
[laughter] You knew I was
going to have you read this.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.470
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Great.

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.930
It's called Thank You.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:55.110
If you find yourself
half naked and barefoot

01:03:55.110 --> 01:04:00.400
in the frosty grass, hearing
again the earth's great sonorous

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.810
moan that says, you are the
air of the now and gone,

01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:08.810
that says all you love will turn
to dust and will meet you there.

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:11.640
Do not raise your fist.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.040
Do not raise your
small voice against it.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.260
And do not take cover.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:20.820
Instead, curl your
goes into the grass,

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.300
watch the cloud ascending
from your lips.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.450
Walk through the
garden's dormant splendor.

01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:30.220
Say only thank you.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.520
Thank you.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.130
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.930
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: That's
interesting, huh.

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:40.320
[ Applause ]

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
an early poem.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.920
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, it's
an early poem, yeah.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.090
It's the last poem of the book.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That spiritual
wisdom has been generating your

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.020
poems for years.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.320
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, totally.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Huh.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.960
We sing a hymn in my church,
a grateful heart a garden is.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:02.910
There is a kind of wisdom
and gratitude in being able

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:05.390
to see what you've been given.

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.260
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Oh my God, totally.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.640
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: The
graciousness of your life.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.910
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Totally,
totally, yeah.

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:13.210
Absolutely.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:18.610
Like it's a kind of, it
requires maybe many things,

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:21.980
but tenderness among
them, you know.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.550
Like, yeah.

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:26.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Humility.

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:28.150
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Humility.

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:29.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Love.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:30.750
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah, love.

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.050
God. How lucky.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
last poem I'll ask you

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.670
to read tonight, Wedding.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:41.970
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Oh.

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:43.270
Cool.

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:44.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I suppose this
was written for friends, but--

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.160
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: It was,
it totally was.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It
works for anybody.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.010
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:54.260
It's called Wedding Poem, yeah
for my friends Keith and Jen.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.610
Friends, I am here to modestly
report seeing in an orchard

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:05.460
in my town a gold finch kissing
a sun flower again and again,

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.840
dangling upside down by its
tiny claws, steadying itself

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.530
by snapping open
like an old tiny fan,

01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:15.500
its wings, again, and again.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.020
Until swooning it tumbled
off and swooped back

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.170
to the very same perch,

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:24.620
where the sunflower curled
its giant swirling of seeds

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.510
around the bird and leaned back

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:31.400
to admire the soft wind
nudging the bird's plumage.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.100
And friends, I could
see the points

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.110
on the flower's stately
crown soften and curl inward

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:40.580
as it almost indiscernibly
lifted the food of its body

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.820
to the bird's nuzzling mouth,
whose fervor I could hear

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.940
from oh 20 or so feet away
and see from the tiny hulls

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.430
that sailed form their good
racket, which good racket,

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:55.290
I have to say, was
making me blush and rock

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.920
up on my tippy toes and
just barely purse my lips

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:04.330
with what I realize now
was being simply glad,

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:09.510
which such love, if we
let it, makes us feel.

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:18.560
[ Applause ]

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So,
grateful you came tonight.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:21.850
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Yeah.

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:23.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been
a delight to talk to you.

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:24.450
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: It's
fun to talk to you.

01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:25.750
Yeah, it's great.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's
books for sale

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.210
and people can come talk to
you and get their books signed.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.510
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Great, yeah.

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:31.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Really nice

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.110
&gt;&gt; Ross Gay: Thank you so much.

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:34.410
It was really nice to talk.

01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:35.710
Yeah.

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:42.510
