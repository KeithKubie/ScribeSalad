00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.420
Happy Independence Day, everybody!

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.880
Let's celebrate by reviewing Independence--

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.820
Daaargh-argh!

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980
God, I hate this movie. I hate it so much.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.900
And yet, I always find out that I'm part of a small minority on this.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.620
I mean, granted, it was a critical flop,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.820
and when this movie first came out I was excited to see shit blow up,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.500
but after you get past the explosions, there is nothing creative or original about this movie.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.640
It's just human stereotypes trying to fight off alien stereotypes. Nothing more.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.520
But so many people keep telling me, "oh, it's a popcorn movie. Can't you just have fun?"

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.500
Well, let me tell you something. A water slide is fun.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.840
All the slipping and sliding, it's just great.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.000
But if someone took you off the water slide, shook you,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.120
gave you a noogie and then spat in your face and put you back on the water slide, you'd be like,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.520
"that wasn't fun. That was weird and annoying." And that's this movie.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.580
So, let's celebrate Independence Day with Independence Day.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.860
So we start off with a bright flash as we see something hovering over the moon.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.780
Boy, this is like the opening shot from that other sci-fi movie. What was it called again?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.340
Oh yeah, Suburban Commando.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.680
Another bright flash appears as we cut to the Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.800
Who are just now noticing that the spaceship is approaching Earth.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.340
I guess it was just hiding behind the moon the whole time.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080
Cut to another stinking flash as we're suddenly in Washington,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.340
where we see our president, played by Bill Pullman...

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460
Lone Star!

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.560
who is not happy about his slipping polls.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.820
That's the problem. They elected a warrior and they got a wimp.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.480
Ah, it's the Obama administration.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.200
But you know...

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.640
(canned laughter and applause)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.800
You know...

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.760
Yes.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.900
Could you say that again?

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.120
Cut to a - goddamnit! Will you knock it off with those bright flashes?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.180
Your movie isn't a f**king magic show.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.020
Watch, everybody, as I magically switch locations!

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.940
Woo! Look, I'm in a different location! Woo!

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.540
Here we see two people playing chess. And...

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.440
Yeah, there's really no point in prolonging this anymore.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.580
Cast, step forward and state your stereotype.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.580
I'm Judd Hirsch. I'm the Jewish stereotype.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.400
I'm Robert Loggia. I'm the gruff military stereotype.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.880
I'm Randy Quaid, and I'm the redneck stereotype.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.580
I'm Brent Spiner, and I'm the geeky stereotype.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.180
I'm that guy from Mrs Doubtfire and I'm the gay stereotype.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.260
I'm Harry Connick Jr. and I'm the annoying best friend stereotype.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.120
I am Jeff Goldblum and I am, in and of myself, ah, a stereotype.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.600
So, with a cast like that, how can't an alien race be tempted to wipe out all that Earth has to offer?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.040
As they send out their giant mechanical sand dollars to cover the globe.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.420
I swear to God, if I see another flash,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.340
I'm gonna shove this movie up Roland Emmerich's dickhole.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.840
I don't wanna add to a public hysteria that's gonna cost lives.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.240
And what happens if they do become hostile?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.980
Okay, big cliché, big cliché, come on, come on, come on,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.220
big cliché, big cliché, come on, come on, come on!

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.800
Then God help us.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.000
Yeah!

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.240
So we cut to Randy Quaid, who's a drunk, redneck pilot

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.380
who actually claims to have been abducted by aliens before.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.340
Russ?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.800
When they took you up in their spaceship, did they do any...

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.400
sexual things? Do you recall? Do you recollect?

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.460
I don't need this. If I wanted to be laughed at, I'd go back to Hollywood.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.540
So the aliens arrive and place themselves conveniently over America's most famous monuments.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.220
But that doesn't stop our other main character, Will Smith,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.280
getting jiggy with it on his girlfriend, Vivica A. Fox.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.980
What you been doing out there?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.380
Shooting the aliens.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.980
Oh, you're shooting aliens, right? Oh, you think you're tough, huh?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.980
Must resist Men in Black joke. Must resist Men in Black joke.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.060
And I have to admit, this is the only character who doesn't suck.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.700
Not because of the writing or anything, but because it's f**king Will Smith.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.240
The king of cool. He can make anything sound awesome. He's, like, the most charming man alive.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.300
I don't even know what it is. There's just something about... him.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.380
(acoustic guitar plays)

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.780
Boobs! You like boobs!

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.300
But seriously, he can make anything sound good.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.340
Look at this very basic scene and listen to how he makes it so cool.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.680
Uh-uh. Come on now. You can't go. You got to call them back.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.880
I'm not going to do this with you, Jasmine.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.860
But you said you was on leave for the fourth.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.340
Look, why are you acting like this?

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.940
Why?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.760
That's why.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.000
What's wrong with her?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.920
She's crazy.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.640
He's gorgeous.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.060
I really don't think they flew ninety-billion light years to come down here and start a fight.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.700
Look at this bit. The line is, "you're not as charming as you think you are." And Will Smith just says...

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.640
"Yes I am."

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.480
What a terrible line. Who the hell would write that?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.440
But when you listen to him say it...

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.760
But you are not as charming as you think you are, sir.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.760
Yes I am.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.920
But more important things are going on.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.580
Like how our government, with all their scientific technology,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.240
discovers that the alien ships are using our own satellites against us,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.100
sending out a signal that will eventually run out and probably mean an attack.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.380
Oh wait...

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.980
No, sorry, this was figured out by one cable repairman

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.780
whose job is to make sure that your HBO is coming in clear.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.060
FBI, TV maintenance, they're both pretty similar.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.780
Ah, it's like in chess. First, you strategically position your pieces,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.560
then when the timing's right you... strike.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.220
They're positioning themselves all over the world and, in approximately six hours,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.780
the signal's gonna disappear and the countdown's gonna be over.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.880
And then what?

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.160
Checkmate.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.320
Good Lord, Jeff Goldblum can make just about anything overdramatic, can't he?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.220
Even in a scene that is overdramatic, he makes it even more overdramatic.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.520
How is it Jeff Goldblum can turn anything into a melodrama?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.780
Ah, yes, I would like to, ah, return this taco,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.700
ah, to you because there was, ah, ah, ah, no sauce on it

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.300
and, ah, as we all know when there is, ah, no sauce on the taco

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.960
ah, you will realise that, ah, it is not spicy.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.600
And, ah, but, but, but, if it is not spicy, ah, well then,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.340
you all know what that means, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.360
Checkmate.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.080
Oh my God! Oh my God, I gotta call my brother.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.640
I'd better call my housekeeper. I gotta call my lawyer.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.660
Ah, forget my lawyer.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.560
I gotta call Disney and let 'em know I won't be able to do Mulan 5.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.520
So Jeff Goldblum and his father head to the White House to try and warn them.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.420
So tell me something, huh? You're so smart?

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.020
How come you spent eight years in MIT to become a cable repairman?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.520
Dad...

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.340
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.600
Look at these, look at these people, look.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.180
Vultures. They take and then they go.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.000
They're going. They're going faster than we are. Look at this. We're in the fast lane.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.300
I can't go faster. They're cutting me off here.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.940
No one's cutting you off. We're gonna get a ticket.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.500
They're getting in front of me. I can't go any faster.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.920
I can out-Jew you. I can out-Jew you. I can out-Jew you. I can out-Jew you.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.320
I can out-Jew you. No, I can out-Jew you!

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.800
So Randy Quaid tries his best to get his family away from the area.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.880
We've got his son, who is ashamed of his father,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.540
his daughter, who's a complete slut,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.140
and the third one, who's...

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.780
the third one.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.200
But enough of that. We see Will Smith and his friend, Harry Connick Jr.,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.320
as it seems Will has been turned down again to join NASA.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.400
Man, you know I really like Jasmine,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.760
You know that, right?

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.420
Man, you're never gonna get to fly the space shuttle if you marry a stripper.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.860
That's right. His fiancée's a stripper,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.620
and, because of that, I guess NASA doesn't think he'll be mentally sound.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.060
Y'know, because the space program has produced some real examples of mental health in the past few years, haven't they?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.900
So Goldblum and his father finally get to the White House.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.300
Urgh. Goddamned Tea Party-ers.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.780
But it's okay. They have a way inside. How?

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.240
Well it turns out Goldblum happens to have an ex-wife who works for the White House.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.800
Isn't that a happy little coincidence?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.860
I would never believe in my lifetime that I would be in the White House.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.880
Look at this. If I knew I was gonna meet the president, I would've worn a tie.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.980
I mean, look at me. I look like a schlemiel.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.160
Schlemiel! Goyim! Bar Mitzvah! Did I mention I'm Jewish?!

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.920
So he convinces the president that they have less than a half hour till Boomsville.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.520
So they get the president out as one helicopter tries to make contact with the ship.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.340
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.580
You may fire when ready.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.280
Meanwhile, the president's wife, who is in another location, is told to evacuate as well.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.840
And our prayers go out to the wives and children of those brave pilots.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.880
Indeed, God help us all.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.360
Really? The newscaster just said "God help us all"?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.420
Isn't that the equivalent of saying,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.400
A hurricane was spotted on the eastern coast.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.780
Panic! Panic! Panic! We're all gonna die!

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.940
So the ships finally start to open up as Goldblum sees the clock has ticked its last seconds.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.840
Time's up.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.820
Oh hey, uh, push that button over there, would'ya?

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.880
Uh huh, yeah.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.480
So the Earth is on fire as Will Smith's fiancée rushes for cover.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.480
Yeah, hide there. The explosion will never think to look for you there.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.140
Boomer!

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.440
Yes, what about Boomer?!

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.660
Dude, lady, you have a kid with you. F*ck the dog and just close the damn door.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.020
Luckily, the explosion's too polite to enter through an open door,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.680
so I guess they'll be safe after all.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.320
So July 3rd hits as we look over the aftermath the aliens have left behind.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.240
You maniacs! You blew it up!

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.140
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600
In the Gulf War we knew what we had to do.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.440
Aw, hey, look on the bright side. It could've been an oil spill.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.000
So Vivica and her kid are shocked to find that duck and cover shit really works

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.320
as they grab a truck and start looking for survivors.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.640
Yeah, but...

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.640
Did Boomer make it okay?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.260
Meanwhile, Will Smith and the rest of the fighter pilots head out to kick some alien ass.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.220
Let's bring that bad boy home, captain! You loose?

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.900
Yes sir. You got your victory dance?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.320
Oh, I got it right here! Yeah!

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.160
Oh, wow, you are so dead.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160
As the good Reverend would say,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.180
"why we are on this particular mission, we'll never know.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:02.960
"But I do know, here today, that the Black Knights will emerge victorious once again."

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.440
Amen, man.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.780
Amen, Reverend.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.840
Hey, you know what else I love?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:13.780
Living. I love living. I hope to do a lot of living while I'm still alive. I'm just so lively.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.980
Wouldn't it be a great tragic irony if I was to not be living?

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.680
Wouldn't that be the most dramatic contrast that only a B-movie

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.240
that somehow got a bajillion dollar budget would put together?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.820
God, I love being alive. Alive!

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.080
Lock and load.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.120
But unfortunately the ship has some sort of refreshing mint shield

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.460
as the alien pilots come out to kill the fighters.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.180
I got you covered, Big Daddy.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.100
Damn, they got shields too!

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.680
Let's get low, let's get fast!

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.540
I got you, Big Daddy, let's get 'em!

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.820
Do a barrel roll!

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.720
Oh, and here's a big shocker. Are you ready for this?

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.860
This is, like, a big shocker. Holy smokes, you're not going to believe this.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.180
I mean, it's just incredible. I mean, are you ready?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.500
Are you ready? Sit down, it's just really incredible. Are you ready?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.880
The best friend dies!

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.140
Jimmy!

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Jimmy! No!

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.260
Oh my God! They killed Jimmy!

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.660
You bastards!

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.900
So one of the alien pilots chases Will Smith through the desert, where they perform some stunts

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.540
that, quite frankly, would be too silly for the Hot Shots movies to pull off.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.780
Whoa, low bridge!

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.940
Woo!

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.520
See if you can fly that thing undercover.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.980
Argh! A sheet! A sheet!

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.080
All my advanced scientific technology and I'm defeated by a sheet!

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.800
All of your base are belong to us.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.620
Ow.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.800
Welcome to Earth.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.940
Now that's what I call a close encounter.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:01.700
(Fresh Prince of Bel Air Theme)

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.540
But meanwhile, the president and his men try to figure out what they're going to do next.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.000
It was, what, in the 19-what-50s, uh, whatever, you had that, uh, spaceship?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.820
Oh God, you're not.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.840
Roswell. Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah. No, you had the spaceship and you had the bodies.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.180
You're not really going in that direction, are you?

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.340
Area 51, right? Area 51.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.260
Regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.660
there have never been any spacecraft recovered by our government.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.480
Oh, good. You know, for a second, I really thought you'd be stupid enough to

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.820
That's not entirely accurate.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.420
You know, I'll believe it when I see

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.880
Argh, I don't believe it!

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.820
You're actually saying that Area 51 really was an alien

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.540
and that you never brought it to anyone's attention while the ships were landing?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.100
Stand back. He's gonna go for it. He's gonna go for it. He's gonna go for it.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.640
He's gonna go for it. Ah! He jumped the shark!

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.340
So we see Brent Spiner, also known as Data from Star Trek, as the head scientist.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.340
Since these guys started showing up, all the little gizmos inside turned on.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.120
Actually, I'm confused. Which of these two characters wasn't human again?

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.440
Oh well, who cares. We have more implausible meet-ups to combine.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.260
Now let's see, what shall we do here? I know.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.300
Let's say Vivica A. Fox coincidentally runs into the First Lady

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.100
and Will Smith coincidentally runs into Randy Quaid

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.260
who coincidentally runs into the secret base which coincidentally has the president in it.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.900
Well that''s all fine and good, but..

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.540
Did Boomer make it out okay?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.600
So they decide to perform an operation on the alien to see what's inside.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:42.860
Uh...

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.440
Hey, uh, here's a crazy idea, um... why don't you have some security around?

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.600
I mean, you know these aliens want to kill you. Say something went wrong.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.460
I mean, what if for some crazy reason you didn't give him anaesthetic,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.580
he wakes up, he makes some ear piercing sound, knocks out all the power

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.060
kills the doctors and uses the body of one of them to communicate with other people?

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.820
I mean, I'm just saying.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.400
So the alien tries to do some mind zapper thing with the president

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.560
as the security finally takes the alien out.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.640
Meanwhile, Will Smith decides that he wants to steal a helicopter to look for his fiancée.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.240
The hell are you doing? Get outta there!

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.220
Look, I got something I gotta handle. I'm just borrowing it.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.520
No you're not, sir.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.560
Do you really want to shoot me?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.060
Damn that Will Smith charm. Next time, I've gotta try that.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.620
Just go up to a military helicopter and be like,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.200
"Hey, I need this. There's something I gotta do."

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.600
I mean, I never thought just to ask. It's practically fullproof.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.220
And, wouldn't you know it, in the middle of the night, without any signals,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.860
without any clue of her location, he just happens to stumble across her.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.620
You're late.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.360
Ah, you know I like to make an entrance.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.740
So they reunite the president with his wife

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.920
but unfortunately she's bleeding internally and can't be fixed.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820
Jeesh, I felt like we barely knew her.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.260
That's because we did barely know her.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.120
Maybe if we didn't have thirteen other characters in this movie, we would feel bad that this person dies.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.720
Is Mommy sleeping now?

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.720
Yeah.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.020
Mommy's sleeping.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.520
Oh no, this is giving me an emotion.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.680
Must not act. Must not act.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.040
Oh good, I made it to the next credit.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.040
But the president isn't the only one having problems.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.840
A drunken Jeff Goldblum screams in anger and seeks the aid of his father.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.700
Everyone loses faith at some point in their life.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.640
Look at myself.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.800
I haven't spoken to God since your mother died.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.340
Mother's dead?

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.920
You still have your health.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.000
But Goldblum suddenly gets an idea: to give the alien mothership a virus,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.520
because now this TV repairman can not only find signals that the government's top men can't find,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.020
but can also apparently hack alien technology while only being aware of it for one day.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.100
By God, Jeff Goldblum, is there anything you can't do?

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.820
No.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.200
But still, they need a pilot to fly that alien ship. Who are they gonna get?

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.880
I've seen these things in action and I'm well aware of their manoeuvring capabilities.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.600
With your permission, general, I'd like the opportunity to try.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.440
Yes, let that man fly that ship.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.120
What's that?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.300
His fianceé's a stripper? Bring him back, bring him back. We can't allow that, no.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.380
So Smith and his fiancée finally get married right before they head up to infect the mothership.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.100
An alien race that wipes out Earth but is killed by our viruses?

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.440
Who ever heard of such a thing?

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.300
Jerkoff!

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.260
So as they head off into space our president gets ready to make the biggest speech for the trailer.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.180
The fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:15.020
But as the day when the world declared, in one voice, "we will not go quietly into the night."

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.640
Today we celebrate our Independence Day!

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.320
Boy, thank God this all went down on Independence Day.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.000
I mean, can you imagine what would happen if this took place on a lesser holiday?

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.300
Today,

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.960
on Talk Like a Pirate Day,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.000
we celebrate our right to talk like pirates!

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.500
And we will show them

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.940
Hey, come on, be authentic.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.300
We will show dem scurvy dogs who's boss.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.140
Who's are with me, say argh!

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.080
Argh!

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.960
And just when you think this movie couldn't get any more silly clichés

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.800
Mister President, I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.500
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.680
I belong in the air.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:08.400
That's right. The president of the free world is flying up in the air with the other fighter pilots.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.320
Wow! It jumped the shark so high it's nearly in orbit!

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.540
Yeah, sure, let him fly with the other fighter pilots.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.800
I mean, it's just the president.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.340
It's not like he'll be needed for anything else.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.640
It's not like there's any choice decisions that a democracy chose him to make.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.880
Just let him have his fun.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.920
Ah well, f*ck it. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum fly into the mother-ship to implant the virus.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.040
Now this raises another question.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.560
An alien ship from the 1950s isn't gonna cause any suspicion from the other aliens?

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.380
Over 40 years of technological advancements must have happened over that time

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.280
and they just blend in like one of the other ships?

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.740
Does one of the main aliens just think he knows who the alien is in there?

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.540
Stephanie? Stephanie, is that you?

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.040
Oh my God, I haven't seen you or your ship since the 1950s. Tell me, how's your Aunt Flo?

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.480
That... that is the reason you said why you'd be away for a while, right?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.280
St-Stephanie?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.460
We have visual.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.020
Do not engage until we've confirmed...

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.520
So the fighter pilots, led by the president trying to seal his next campaign poster,

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.700
fire their missiles at the ship who should have their shields down by now.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.700
God.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.840
Hold on, Command. I want another shot at it.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.740
Eat laser Tic-Tacs!

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.840
Evasive manoeuvres!

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.120
Stephanie? Wh-why aren't you talking to me?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.700
Is it because I slept with your eight million sisters? Look, they came on to me, okay? I...

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.600
Oh, wait a minute. It's because you want me to see your pretty face, isn't it?

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.360
Let me just open up the window here so I can see your eyes one more...

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.680
Stephanie, were you always invisible?

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.120
Eagle 1, Fox 2.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.900
Aw. Maybe you should've let a professional pilot fly?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.460
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.720
Sorry I'm late, Mr President.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.180
Pilot, you armed?

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.760
Armed and ready, sir.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.040
Who is that guy?

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.000
Put him on speaker.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.400
Who is that brave, lone American that we all underestimated?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.480
It's me, Russell Casse, sir.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:34.140
But his missile gets jammed as he decides to do the noble thing and sacrifice his life for the world.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.180
I'm back!

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.880
Really? So all this advanced scientific weaponry

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.920
and the answer was the equivalent of a cartoon character putting his finger in a gun?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.840
I guess cartoon logic saves the day!

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.940
Get out the wire to every squadron around the world.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.560
Tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.800
Tell them to get all the drunk suicidal redneck pilots they can find.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.440
Stephanie, you can't hide from our love.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.420
I really thought we had something there. I felt a connection.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.560
Something cosmic, if you will.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.340
Ready?

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.240
Yes I am.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.440
Hey, all right! Hey!

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.660
Stephanie, did... did you do something to your hair?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.880
Peace!

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.760
Pluto's balls!

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.540
We're loose. Can you get us outta here in 30 seconds?

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.740
So they get themselves loose, they fly through the ship of dried-up dog turds

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.200
and Goldblum delights in ripping off Jurassic Park.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.260
Must go faster. Must go faster.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.940
Hey, you know what?

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.900
I'm beginning to think that wasn't Stephanie

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.620
So all the other ships are taken down, Goldblum and Smith get home safe

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.900
and the president is declared a hero.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.720
Daddy, did you save the day?

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.620
Actually, no, a drunk redneck pilot did.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.180
Well, at least Mommy is still alive.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.700
Yeah, we'll have to have a talk later.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.800
So they all live happily ever after.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.580
But what about Boomer?!

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.480
What a piece of shit.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.000
I mean, granted, I did kinda like it as a kid

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.700
but as an adult it's just too corny and too clichéd.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.780
The characters are unbelievable cut-outs, the story has about a bajillion plotholes and...

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.240
no, I don't need anything else. That's enough to hate this movie.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.700
I will say this, though. The explosions are cool, the spaceships are cool and Will Smith is cool.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.260
Is it one of the worst films I've ever reviewed? No, but it's still bad. It's really, really bad.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:47.200
And let's face it, ever since, the director's been trying to make the same movie over and over and over.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.120
And seeing how it's already rumoured that there's gonna be an Independence Day 2,

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.800
I have just one question for you.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.580
Who's side are you gonna be on? The humans or the aliens?

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.220
Nanu, nanu!

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.760
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.240
Checkmate.
