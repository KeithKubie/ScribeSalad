NATASHA AARONS: For those
who are not familiar

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.653
with you, or even with
the notion of Ebonics

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.960
and where it came from,
you made your public debut

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.260
about 20 years ago during
the uproar around the Oakland

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.390
public school
district wanting to--

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.100
a proposal to teach Ebonics
to black children in school.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.900
Can you take us back,
and give, for those

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.000
who are not aware, more
information about the proposal,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.320
and how you kind of rose
as the thought leader

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.487
on Black English or Ebonics?

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:35.278
JOHN MCWHORTER: No.

00:00:35.278 --> 00:00:36.680
I'm not the thought
leader on it.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.440
But it's interesting that you
trace like whatever reason

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.200
I'm sitting here back to
that, because you're correct.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.200
But it's not something that many
people have any reason to know.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.684
Basically, it was--

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:48.350
I can't believe that
it was 20 years ago

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.230
now that the Oakland
school board--

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.000
and this was a
primarily black school

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.530
board with a largely black
and brown public school

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.680
population-- were alarmed
that children in the school

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.400
system who were black were
failing so much, particularly

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.150
in reading.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.690
So they were operating
on a hypothesis that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.640
had gotten around in
some parts of the country

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.870
here and there before that
perhaps part of black kids'

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.530
problem in school was that
their home dialect was

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.410
Black English, which you can
think of as a separate system

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.500
from standard English.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.680
And so when they were
encountering standard English

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.767
on the page, they
were encountering

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:28.350
basically a different
language, and it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.760
was hard to make the switch.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.160
So the idea was not to teach
them a dialect they already

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.820
spoke, but to use the
dialect in teaching materials

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.790
and to call special
attention to the fact

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.740
that there are two different
ways for them of speaking

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.240
English.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.020
So the idea was to use it as
kind of a translation tool.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.930
Now, the media
just jumped on this

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.850
and completely
misunderstood what

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.500
was meant by dialect,
what was meant

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.430
by using it in the classroom.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.440
And so the big joke was that
basically Ebonics, which

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.020
is a name for Black English no
one had heard of until then,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.420
except for a few education
scholars in about

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.009
1973, that this Ebonics was
going to be taught in class

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.900
as opposed to standard English.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.140
And this was right around when
'round the clock cable news

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.100
started.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.610
It was Christmas, and so
it was a slow news cycle.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.870
Fox News was new.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.930
And so there was a reason why
this became such a big deal

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.726
at that time.

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.600
So the whole country is
laughing at this idea

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.183
that there is something
called Ebonics

00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:31.910
that is actually language, or
a language, as people put it.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.240
And I was in a weird position,
because to tell you the truth,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.020
I came out of that despised
by the Black English

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.710
establishment.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.800
To this day, there are
people of that sort

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.660
who will walk by
me at a conference

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.490
and not say a word, literally.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.500
That's how mean
people get about it.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.620
Because I said Black English
is legitimate speech,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.140
but it's not why these kids
are having problems in school.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.810
And I talked about problems
I'm sure we've all heard,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.320
about inner city schools.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.690
I said, that's the problem.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.110
It's not the dialect.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.070
We don't need to give it special
attention in the classroom.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.619
I think I was misunderstood.

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.160
And I didn't have
the experience then

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.880
that I do now in trying
to get out of my own head.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.090
So really, it was, if I
may, the expression today

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.380
is a shit show.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.450
The whole thing in the
media was a shit show.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.920
My life was a shit show.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.290
But that is how it
started, because that's

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.150
when people got the
idea that I was,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.040
quote, unquote, "interesting."

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.130
So that's what happened.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.800
NATASHA AARONS: So where did
the term Ebonics actually

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.774
come from?

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:35.170
JOHN MCWHORTER: It was
something somebody made up

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.170
in good faith in about 1973.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.540
There was a psychologist,
a black psychologist,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.520
who was concerned with
the same sorts of things

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.684
that we're talking about.

00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:45.100
He didn't happen
to be a linguist.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.880
And so he wanted to make up
a name for Black English that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.220
didn't sound like
"Negro English," which

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.290
is what it was called.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.470
Ebony was a hot
term at the time.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.100
It didn't sound as
dated as it does now.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.230
And if you're talking
about phonics,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.270
well, he figured since
this is about reading,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.850
we'll call it Ebonics.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.560
It's a moment
that's so long ago.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.330
And I mean, I was only
a small kid myself,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.860
but I can just smell.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.540
Ebonics must have felt
really cool at the time.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.210
That felt modern.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.740
It felt like people
with big afros.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.019
I mean, that made sense.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.959
But it was only something used,
really, at one conference.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.900
And there was one volume
that called it that.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.030
But there's this one guy.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.660
And if you want to imagine
this guy, basically, take--

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.120
imagine Al Sharpton right now.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.500
You have him in your head?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.770
Now, imagine Al Sharpton
20 years ago as opposed

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.080
to the sort of statesman
that he's become now.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.380
That, now change the
hair, put him in a suit,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.200
and there was this guy
who was kind of a linguist

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.460
and kind of a doctor at the
same time named Ernie Smith, who

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.680
was really big on arguing
that Black English is

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.300
a separate language
from English,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.280
and that anybody
who says otherwise

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.830
is a kente cloth
wearing poverty pimp.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.920
That's what-- he used
to call people names.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.040
He actually sent me
long screeds telling me

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.490
that I must have a subdural
hematoma, because I don't think

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.060
that Black English is Hebrew.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.310
It was scary.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.640
He had a major influence
on a lot of schoolteachers.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.500
He picked up that Ebonics term.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.330
He had given it to
the Oakland people.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.690
And so they were using it.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.320
And that's the only reason
that we now say Ebonics.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.870
For about 10 years, I said,
I'm not using that term.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.994
And then I realized,
everybody-- it's set.

00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:26.410
And so you just
have to accept it.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.730
So Ebonics.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.660
But it's chance that you
and I are calling it that.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.090
NATASHA AARONS: And so
what is your definition

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.370
of Black English and it's
distinction from slang?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.830
JOHN MCWHORTER: You mean
you want like one thing?

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.410
NATASHA AARONS: Or many.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.190
JOHN MCWHORTER: Well, we
boring people, like linguists,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.870
think of Black English as a set
of grammatical constructions,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.542
which if I may, many of
you until, of course,

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:59.000
you read my book, which is the
only source that's ever been

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.580
written on it, many of you
will think of as "the mistakes

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.380
black people make
when they talk."

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.446
All of those things, if
you put them together,

00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:06.320
they're not mistakes.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.200
They're just differences
from standard English.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.690
And so when we say Black
English, what we really mean

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.180
is that alternate grammar.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.316
That's not really going
to help for the public.

00:06:16.316 --> 00:06:17.690
And so I'm going
to use something

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.790
that I think is more useful.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.974
Whether you want to
admit it or not--

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:23.390
I have a whole
chapter in the book

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.420
about why we need to get over
pretending this isn't true.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.410
Whether you want
to admit it or not,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.560
when you hear somebody
talk on the phone,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.290
or if you're on the train
and you don't see them,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.260
you know in an
instant whether or not

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.570
they're black 99.5% of the time.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.270
We all do.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.460
To grow up in the United
States is to know that.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.810
And it's not just a matter
of this, quote, unquote,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.890
"bad grammar."

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.200
The person may not be
using any Black slang.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.510
You know in an instant.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.580
And if you're white,
you've brought it up

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.187
with some of your
nearest and dearest,

00:06:54.187 --> 00:06:56.270
and wondered whether it
was racist to say anything

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.930
about it.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.390
A lot of black people
know it, and aren't

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.740
quite sure what to do with it.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.073
And so we tell ourselves that
there are white people who

00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:06.800
sound just like black people,
which they're almost never are.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.690
And we say, well,
black people just

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.390
have southern accents,
as if black people talk

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.500
like Roy Moore.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.010
And we know that there
is a huge difference.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.240
That's Black English.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.320
Why can you tell?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.120
It's partly the sound system.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.317
It's partly
grammatical features.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.650
And to tell you the truth,
the slang is the least of it.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.060
That changes every 10 minutes.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.790
But there's a different system
that is a legitimate alternate.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.260
That's what Black English is.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.760
NATASHA AARONS: And is Black
English different from Ebonics?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:40.670
JOHN MCWHORTER: No.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.350
Ebonics refers to
the exact same thing.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.308
NATASHA AARONS: Got it.

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:45.270
JOHN MCWHORTER: And so
let's not use that word.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.275
NATASHA AARONS: Let's
call it Black English.

00:07:47.275 --> 00:07:47.910
JOHN MCWHORTER: Black English.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.360
NATASHA AARONS: Let's
call it Black English.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.420
JOHN MCWHORTER: No,
Ebonics is stuck in.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.850
And so yeah, Ebonics.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.620
NATASHA AARONS: So I find this
very fascinating after reading

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.680
the book, because I'm Jamaican
and grew up in America,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.965
so at home, I spoke Patois.

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:04.240
JOHN MCWHORTER: Jealous.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.615
NATASHA AARONS: And in the
streets, I still speak Patois.

00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:09.530
And growing up in
a predominantly

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.530
black and Hispanic neighborhood,
I guess I spoke Black English.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.630
JOHN MCWHORTER: You did.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.690
NATASHA AARONS: Yeah.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.520
But at school and now at work,
I speak standard English.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.260
So I think there's
something really

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.160
to be said about your argument
that it's actually a dialect.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.540
And it's accepted in other--

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.550
well, let's talk about
the word accepted, right?

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.572
It's accepted in
Jamaica or in Haiti.

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:33.030
JOHN MCWHORTER:
But there's still--

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.488
NATASHA AARONS:
But still, like you

00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:37.190
can't go to work or to
school speaking Patois.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:44.179
So talk about, why do you think
it's not accepted in the US?

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:49.140
And what role does racism have
in that lack of acceptance?

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.590
JOHN MCWHORTER: Well, one
thing that you get at usefully

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.380
is that in Jamaica,
there are terrible things

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.570
said about Patois.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.240
There are people who
disavow using it.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.870
I had neighbors, for example,
very educated neighbors

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.580
from Jamaica who
said when I said

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.190
I have studied creole languages
that they don't speak it.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.837
I don't know how
often I would hear

00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:11.420
them going up and down the steps
speaking something I couldn't

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.480
understand a word of.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.730
NATASHA AARONS: We call
those people stush.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.500
JOHN MCWHORTER: Is
there a word for that?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.550
NATASHA AARONS: There's
a word for that, stush.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.810
It means uppity.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.226
JOHN MCWHORTER:
They did speak it.

00:09:17.226 --> 00:09:18.707
NATASHA AARONS: Yeah.

00:09:18.707 --> 00:09:19.790
JOHN MCWHORTER: They were.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.950
They really-- and
that's coming from me.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.940
And I'm kind of uppity.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.020
But yeah, they were.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.382
And so they did speak it.

00:09:25.382 --> 00:09:26.340
And that's very common.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.830
That's true of
Black English, too.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.910
People who would
say, I would never

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.710
speak that way to my
kids, and turn around

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.301
and speak exactly that way.

00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.550
That's how it goes with
varieties that are vernacular,

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.830
basically, around the world.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.624
With Patois, part of why maybe
it has a slightly easier time

00:09:39.624 --> 00:09:40.790
is that it's more different.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.164
So if you speak
Patois, you speak

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:44.030
something where,
unless I listen closely

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.800
and I have a little
bit of training,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.310
I don't know what you're saying.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.060
And so that's really something
that's a different language.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.100
I'd have to wrap
my ear around it.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.890
Your syntax, the
prefixes and suffixes

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.190
that you use are really,
really different from anything

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.110
that I would say most
people in this room

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.080
are likely to be familiar
with from English.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.190
But yeah, racism is part of it.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:11.040
And this book got ripped
in "The New York Times"

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.670
by some individual who
was mad at me-- gosh,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.780
no one's ever mad at me--

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.289
mad at me because I
didn't stress racism

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.080
enough in the book.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.950
And I didn't.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.820
And I wouldn't do
it now, because I

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.720
don't think it's constructive
to tell America's readers,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.970
if you don't like the
way black people talk,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.850
and if you think it's
wrong, you're a racist.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.600
And the reason that I
don't think it's effective

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.610
is because I've seen
that it isn't effective.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.460
For 20 years, I have watched
people read that argument

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.720
and kind of pretend to agree.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.520
But they think to
themselves, no, I'd

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.890
be a racist not to call
them on their bad grammar.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.810
That's perfectly reasonable.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.910
But is the reason that
people think of it

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.490
as such trash talk partly
because people are black?

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.060
Certainly.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.660
Definitely.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.300
But we also have to
remember, suppose

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.470
it wasn't Ebonics that came out
in 1997 in that controversy.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.830
Suppose it was, well,
to use Roy Moore.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.220
Let's say that it
was uneducated--

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.440
not Alabama-- let's say
Mississippians, and so

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.690
poor white trash
Southern English.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.382
And suppose some
people said, our kids

00:11:11.382 --> 00:11:12.840
don't do well in
school, maybe it's

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.190
because the speech that we
use at home is so different.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.520
Let's use it in the classroom.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.020
I don't think anybody would
have thought that was wonderful.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.769
Everybody would have
laughed at them, too.

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:22.620
Now, would they have
laughed as hard?

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.050
Would they have laughed
in exactly the same way?

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.710
No.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.520
But I think part of it is
that we, as Americans, have

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.370
a relatively uniform dialect.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.170
We have a relatively
uniform English.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.970
There are people who
speak differently.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.249
Black people, especially.

00:11:37.249 --> 00:11:38.790
That's about as
different as it gets,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.520
unless you go to the Sea
Islands and hear Gullah

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.920
or if you go to Hawaii
and hear Hawaiian Pidgin.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.510
Other than that,
everybody speaks

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.230
variations on this one
sort of the way people talk

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.100
on "The Office."

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.690
That's just all it is.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.940
And so when we hear
vernacular, when

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.190
we hear something different,
it's easier for Americans

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.500
to think, that's wrong.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.380
And we need to learn
that there have always

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.150
been different ways
of speaking English

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.360
and that the reason that
the one used in "The Office"

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.180
is considered the best
one, it's just chance.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.400
And so we can't help
hearing that as the default.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.770
We're human beings,
but it's just chance.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.900
So yeah, race plays a part.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.150
And there are books
about Black English.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.280
I would recommend
"Spoken Soul," which

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.550
has a better title than
mine by John Rickford, which

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.400
he wrote after the
Ebonics crisis,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.560
where he gets across
the racist aspect of it

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.150
better than I ever could.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.280
But I figured
that's been written.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.680
And with all due respect
for John Rickford,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.110
who was my dissertation
advisor, that argument

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.680
only works with us.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.880
It doesn't spread.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.290
And so I wanted something that
would have a wider suasional

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.350
impact.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.681
So that's my sloppy
answer to that question.

00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:48.930
NATASHA AARONS: So in your
chapter "It's Complicated,"

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.650
part of your defense of Black
English being a dialect,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.380
it's rooted in its complexities.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.662
I'll highlight a few examples.

00:12:55.662 --> 00:12:57.870
And I think everyone here
will be familiar with them.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.450
So the word up, and how
the word up is used.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.197
Like DMX, "Y'all going to make
me lose my mind up in here."

00:13:05.197 --> 00:13:06.030
JOHN MCWHORTER: See?

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.350
What's up about it?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.140
NATASHA AARONS: What's
up about it, right?

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.570
Done.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.740
He done lost his mind.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.340
Right?

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.330
And had, which everyone--
what had happened was.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:22.760
So can you dissect that a
little bit further and talk

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.970
about the complexities
of Black English

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.920
and why that makes it a dialect?

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.960
JOHN MCWHORTER: Those
things are so important,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.430
because it's easy to miss it.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.310
Somebody will often tell
you about Black English.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.190
And they'll say, well, this is
a different system, because you

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.440
can drop off these consonants.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.480
It's a different system,
because you don't have

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.060
to use this word for to be.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.965
It's different.

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:45.590
It's not worse.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.890
It's just different.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.850
It's different in that you can
leave this out and chop this

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.049
off and drop this off.

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:53.090
And then everybody wonders
why people still don't

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.560
think that it's sophisticated.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.050
You have to talk about
how it's more complicated.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.720
And it tends to be in the
ways, which when we hear them,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.970
we think, well,
that's just slang,

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.220
when really it's complicated.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.810
And so for example, the done.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.760
It's not just the past.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.890
So for example, yesterday,
what did I drink?

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.850
A really bad glass of wine.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.875
So yesterday, I drank
a glass of rosé.

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:19.460
OK.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.860
That's standard English.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.130
"Yesterday, I done
drunk a glass of rosé,"

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.149
would not be how somebody who
was speaking Black English

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:28.690
would say it.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.430
It's not past tense.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.650
The done is used in
a very specific way.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.350
It indicates that something's
counter-expectational.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.090
And so "You done
growed up," is what

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.548
you would say to somebody who
is one of those people who is

00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:42.410
too tall to be 13 or something.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.240
It's counter-expectational.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.340
"You done ate it," doesn't
mean, "Yesterday, you

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.730
consumed some food."

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.780
It means, "I was going to
find it in the refrigerator,

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.890
and you ate it.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.180
You done ate it."

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.200
That's what it means.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.930
Now, no one knows that,
outside of somebody

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.900
who has too much time on their
hands and becomes an academic,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.650
basically.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.420
But that's what it is.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.070
And standard English
doesn't have a way

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.070
to indicate that in
such an economic way.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.110
And so done is complicated.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.550
Up sounds like slang.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.700
You think of Will Smith, or
DMX, or something like that.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.080
It really indicates intimacy.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.880
So you would never say, "up at
the dentist's," because you're

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.730
not happy there.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.160
Unless it was on a hill,
or something like that.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.740
But you would never say
"up at the dentist's."

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.350
You could give away an
infidelity by accident

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.160
by saying, "Oh, I was
up at Clarissa's."

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.769
Well, if Clarissa just
lives flat on the street,

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.310
and you're talking
about it being up,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.890
how often are you there?

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.930
That's what up means.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.130
And so you hear it.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.601
And usually, you're dancing
or something, and you think,

00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:46.100
oh, up.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.690
Black people say up too much.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.926
It means something
very specific.

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:51.050
There are a bunch of those.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.090
And so I won't take
up time with what's

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.740
called the narrative had.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.770
But it means that Black
English has a separate tense

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.940
from standard English.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.520
And so it's not just,
what had happened was.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.120
You can listen to people
speaking the dialect using

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.490
had in a way where
it's natural to think,

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.500
they use the
pluperfect too much.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.280
But no, it's actually very
specific how that had is used.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.990
So the book has a
list of those things.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.890
And that list could go longer.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.670
But Black English has
complicated in the same ways

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.530
as it is simplified
from the standard.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.620
And it's not a forced point.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.140
It's not a matter of
me sitting and trying

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.349
to squeeze the
last drops of water

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:30.890
out of that washcloth
thinking, well,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.290
how is it sort of complicated?

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.367
It just falls out.

00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:36.200
It's just something
that most people haven't

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.760
had any reason to write about.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.110
So that's part of why
I wrote that book.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.880
NATASHA AARONS: So
there's an objection,

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.020
and then you speak
about this in the book,

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.450
"But they can't talk that
way at a job interview."

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.540
And again, being
Jamaican, I could never

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.220
go anywhere and speak--

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.580
my mother would
slap me, literally--

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.350
Patois, because
it's embarrassing.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.240
You come off as uneducated.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.080
So when people say, you
can't speak that way

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.380
at a job interview, and that
indicates that Black English

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.859
is not acceptable.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.410
It's not a dialect.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.349
Let's talk about that.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.900
That means they missed
the entire point of--

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.150
JOHN MCWHORTER: Just missed it.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.490
NATASHA AARONS: --what
Black English is.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.200
So can you talk
about that some more?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.658
JOHN MCWHORTER: Who would talk
that way at a job interview?

00:17:17.658 --> 00:17:19.849
And so basically, people
speak different ways

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.980
in different places
more than many Americans

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.500
have any reason to know,
for the reason I mentioned.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.109
But if somebody's response
to all of this is,

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.560
well, they can't talk that
way at a job interview, often

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.140
that seems to indicate that
somehow it refutes whatever

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.640
the person said before.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.920
But no, you wouldn't talk
that way at a job interview.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.560
But that doesn't mean that
you can't, or that you

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.790
shouldn't talk that way during
the other 98.5% of your life.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.460
So at a job interview,
yeah, you have

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.710
to learn how to speak
in what is arbitrarily

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.360
considered the standard way.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.970
But that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.260
have these alternate
ways of speaking.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.980
So I have that chapter.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.900
That was something
I used as a lead-in

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.470
to explaining how many people
around the world, such as you,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.330
have two very different
ways of speaking

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.060
that you toggle between, and
that that's how Arabs live.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.140
That is how most people in
India and Sri Lanka live.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.690
More people in China live
that way than are often

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.300
willing to admit it,
but that is very true.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.280
Mandarin is one thing.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.762
Step two feet
outside of Beijing,

00:18:19.762 --> 00:18:21.220
and often, people
are speaking what

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.420
might as well be Vietnamese.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.910
There are different levels
of Chinese in that way.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.220
So it's just ordinary.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.229
And in most of those
places, nobody would say,

00:18:29.229 --> 00:18:31.270
well, you can't talk that
way at a job interview,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.103
and therefore, there
should be no such thing

00:18:33.103 --> 00:18:33.970
as Egyptian Arabic.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.230
Nobody would say that.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.680
There is standard Arabic,
and there's Egyptian Arabic.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.972
Max, because I always call
you out when I'm on a stage,

00:18:39.972 --> 00:18:41.096
and you're in the audience.

00:18:41.096 --> 00:18:41.660
Hi, Max.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.010
And so Egyptian Arabic
and standard Arabic.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.380
So the idea, well, you
can't talk that way

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.690
at a job interview,
that's a nice statement.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.240
But nobody said that
anybody wanted to.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.584
And so I bristle, I
bridle at that statement,

00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:58.000
because it kind
of gets in the way

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.400
of getting across fun
things like up, and the had,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.234
and everything else.

00:19:01.234 --> 00:19:02.733
NATASHA AARONS: And
there are people

00:19:02.733 --> 00:19:04.300
in the black community
that actually

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.389
say these type of things.

00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:07.930
JOHN MCWHORTER: Yeah, can't talk
that way at a job interview,

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.100
they say, having spoken
that way their entire lives.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.689
It's just we need to cut
through these sorts of biases.

00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:17.230
NATASHA AARONS: And
so that brings me

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.330
to this notion of
code switching.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.690
So we talk about that a
lot here as black Googlers,

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.510
because we oscillate between--

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.830
we're a minority.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.647
But when you see
your people, you then

00:19:29.647 --> 00:19:30.730
switch into Black English.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.590
JOHN MCWHORTER: Subconsciously.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.506
NATASHA AARONS: Right.

00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:33.400
Subconsciously.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.680
So how does like
code switching play

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.734
into this overall
construct of Black English?

00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:41.150
JOHN MCWHORTER:
Natasha, I'm going

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.420
to give you the real
answer on code switching.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.300
Code switching, you
described what it is.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.930
It is subconscious.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.700
Nobody was talking about it with
a name until roughly the 1970s.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.960
And one is expected
to talk about it.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.290
And you know, I'm not being a
smarty pants in saying this,

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.990
but I think this is
really where it fits in.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.680
Code switching-- and
I mean this lightly--

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.730
code switching, as a
topic, bores me to tears.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.144
Whenever a student
wants to write about it,

00:20:13.144 --> 00:20:14.810
whenever I have to
give a lecture on it,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.940
I just have to take a
deep breath and pretend--

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.690
you know, that's what we all do
for about half of our lives--

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.570
code switching,
Spanish and English.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.374
And wow, people
in Spanish Harlem,

00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:25.040
they switch between
English and Spanish.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.060
Who'd have thunk it?

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.820
You know, of course, they do!

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.370
It's basically, people
live between languages

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.020
and between dialects,
frankly, in most of the world.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.800
Bi or multilingualism
is probably the norm.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.880
Nobody's ever done an exact
count, but probably the norm.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.040
And so if people
speak two things,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.570
then chances are
that the two things

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.870
are going to mix together to
an extent as part of identity.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.640
Part of you is
formal, and so you're

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.050
going to speak your Mandarin.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.000
Part of you is normal
life, and so you're

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.760
going to speak the local dialect
that's completely different.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.040
And of course, you're going
to toggle between the two.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.640
So Black English usage is a
matter of code switching, too.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.900
But it also confuses the
matter, because somebody

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.640
who studies the
dialect will put up

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.620
all these constructions
on the board,

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.420
and say, well, here it is.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.970
And understandably,
even a speaker thinks,

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.312
that's not how I talk, because
I don't talk that way all day.

00:21:17.312 --> 00:21:18.770
And so they're
thinking, well, it's

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.810
really just something
that you sprinkle in.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.580
What they mean is
that we code switch.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.340
But it's a very ordinary thing.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.510
To see somebody who goes
through all of their life

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.240
speaking more or less the
same way as in, frankly,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:38.100
most educated white or
blue American people,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.170
that's unusual.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.440
That's not the norm, as
we naturally think it is.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.060
The speech repertoire
of somebody

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.800
who grows up in
Greenwich, Connecticut

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.330
is not the norm in terms of how
most people negotiate language

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.090
around the world.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.930
So you with Jamaican,
Black English, and English,

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.800
I look at you, and I
think, you're better.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.900
You know, you have
a wider English.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.091
I tried to call one book
I wrote "A Wider English,"

00:21:59.091 --> 00:22:00.590
and they thought
that wouldn't sell.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.423
And they were right.

00:22:01.423 --> 00:22:04.720
But you have a
broader repertoire.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.950
Then there are people who
have standard and black,

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.074
then there are people who
only have that one thing.

00:22:09.074 --> 00:22:10.280
And you know, life goes on.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.800
But that's unusual.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.310
And so you're better, and
you're normal is the thing.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.410
You having all of
that is normal.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.300
It doesn't make you exotic.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.520
Greenwich,
Connecticut is exotic.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.590
NATASHA AARONS: So as
an example, so white

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.240
Southern Americans, they
code switch between--

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.240
JOHN MCWHORTER: They don't
think of it that way.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.190
They say, well, I slip
a little something in.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.690
No, you code switch.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.160
You have two things.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.650
But people don't get
told that enough.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.750
That's part of why I wrote
this, because everybody

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:46.730
is going to read it, the
whole, whole country.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.200
NATASHA AARONS: So
as black culture

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.400
starts to permeate
mainstream culture,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.200
do you foresee Black English
becoming more accepted?

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.250
JOHN MCWHORTER: Yes.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.940
It's happening right
now right here.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.540
You just see it outside
in these hallways.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.380
Something has changed
profoundly in the past 20 years

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.990
in particular in the way
that-- not the stereotype,

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.150
but this Greenwich,
Connecticut person, or somebody

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.620
who grows up in Scarsdale,
the way that person speaks

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.920
is influenced by
Black English in ways

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.790
that nobody would have
predicted before about 1995.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.040
And I think it's a good thing.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.750
It certainly doesn't mean that
we're anything like past race,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.940
but in that superficial
way, there's

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.130
a coming together that,
for example, hadn't

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.620
happened when I was in college.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.730
Up at Columbia, I will see
white men, in particular,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.490
greeting each other and
talking to each other in ways

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.860
that they're not thinking
of as black at all.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.430
But in terms of the sound
system, in terms of the slang,

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.280
in terms of even a lot of the
gestures and the body language

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.620
and subtle aspects
of facial demeanor,

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.114
they're acting black in a
way that their parents, which

00:23:54.114 --> 00:23:56.030
I hate to admit it's at
the point where I went

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.550
to college with their
parents, their parents, who

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.466
were very cool guys, cooler than
me, they didn't talk like that.

00:24:02.466 --> 00:24:03.590
They didn't move like that.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.907
They couldn't dance like that.

00:24:04.907 --> 00:24:05.990
They didn't act like that.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.350
It was a different time.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.470
And it wasn't 1927.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.180
This was like 1987.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.850
Those people's kids now are
influenced by this new--

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.670
does it say-- did I
call it lingua franca?

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.770
Lingua franca in
a way that nobody

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.060
would have dreamed before.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.650
So yeah, it's really changing.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.650
Watch any stand-up
comedian at this point

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.690
and listen to a lot of
the things that they do.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.750
Watch "Broad City" and
watch Abbi and Ilana,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.540
and whenever they say something
that's meant to be funny,

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.269
about 50% of the time, they're
saying it in a black way.

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:37.060
I doubt if they're
thinking of it that way,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.310
but that's certainly
what they do.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.072
That's new.

00:24:40.072 --> 00:24:41.530
Their mothers didn't
talk that way,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.900
and their mothers were not
wearing crinoline skirts.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.120
It's just that
something has happened

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.611
over the past generation.

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:49.360
NATASHA AARONS: What
do you think that is?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.560
Is it hip hop music?

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.270
JOHN MCWHORTER: Yes.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.370
NATASHA AARONS: Really?

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.035
JOHN MCWHORTER: Yes.

00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:54.430
NATASHA AARONS: Great.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.805
JOHN MCWHORTER:
The mainstreaming

00:24:55.805 --> 00:24:59.080
of rap in the late '90s created
a whole new consciousness,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.330
which shows that
this is superficial.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.070
But I do think
that's what did it.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.464
Yeah, definitely.

00:25:04.464 --> 00:25:06.130
NATASHA AARONS: So
furthering that point

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.500
of black culture becoming
mainstream culture,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.910
this is a tough one.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.540
As people start to become more
comfortable with Black English,

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:12.850
particularly--

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:13.810
JOHN MCWHORTER: I
know what you're--

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.700
I know what--

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.420
NATASHA AARONS: And
I get this question

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.819
from a ton of my white
friends from college

00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:20.860
and from graduate school.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.470
JOHN MCWHORTER: It's
because it's two words.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.810
NATASHA AARONS: Why can't we--

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:22.990
JOHN MCWHORTER: Go ahead.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.600
NATASHA AARONS: --say
the word, the N-word.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.750
JOHN MCWHORTER: Yes.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.470
It's very common.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.780
NATASHA AARONS: Because it's--

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.810
particularly, hip hop culture
is mainstream culture,

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:38.290
and the word is used numerous--
all the time, every other word.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:42.640
And it seems like we've taken
the sting out of the N-word.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.300
And now that they feel like
they're part of the culture,

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.650
many feel like they
can say the word.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.380
JOHN MCWHORTER: It's
very, very complicated.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.350
I am asked about
that in some venue

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.910
probably three or four times
a week, including yesterday.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:02.770
And the first answer is
anyone who says, well,

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.170
if we're not supposed
to use the word nigger,

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.510
then it's wrong for black
people to use it, too.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.860
That completely misses the boat,
because the black usage of it

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.010
isn't the usage of it that
Roy Moore's father used.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.570
I don't know
anything about his--

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.320
you can tell.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.220
So not that.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.820
It became a different
word, which means buddy.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.820
So when you're listening, we
don't have to exoticize it.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.870
Go to the subway today
when you go home.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.330
All you have to do
is go like this,

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.360
and you will hear some
black boys using it.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.180
They don't mean what
Bull Connor meant.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:37.806
It means buddy.

00:26:37.806 --> 00:26:39.221
NATASHA AARONS:
But not only-- you

00:26:39.221 --> 00:26:41.230
won't not only-- you
not-- you will also

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.900
hear Hispanic kids
saying it, Chinese kids.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.820
I've heard white kids
saying it on the subway.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.278
JOHN MCWHORTER:
That's complicated.

00:26:47.278 --> 00:26:50.332
I remember when I first heard
actually a white guy use it.

00:26:50.332 --> 00:26:51.540
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.770
Because I had seen him.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.400
I was in a 7-Eleven
or something.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.320
And I thought,
wait, he was white.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.177
Did he change?

00:26:57.177 --> 00:26:58.010
And I turned around.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.170
It was about 10 years ago.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.110
And I thought, I can tell he
didn't mean that in a bad way.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.820
And I thought, this
is going to continue.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.110
And it has.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.900
It's subtle, because
that boy thinks

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.820
that because he
listens to the music,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.700
because he dresses in a certain
way, moves a certain way,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.620
has had relationships
with probably

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.880
a couple of black girls.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.010
He lives in a very
different way.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.110
He thinks he can use
it to mean buddy,

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.710
because he thinks of
himself as that buddy

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.250
in the same positive
way that black kids do.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.770
You and I see it,
and we think, no, you

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.470
have to understand the
history of the word.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.970
You know something,
Natasha, I don't

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.710
think we can control that.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.244
You know, I want to say,
well, that shouldn't be.

00:27:38.244 --> 00:27:40.410
And there are whole books
that are written about it.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.730
And we are going to
go in the subway,

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.250
and we're going to keep
hearing those Filipino boys,

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.550
those Asian boys.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.710
I'm now hearing Asian--

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.410
Chinese-American kids doing it.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.680
Can we fix that?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.430
I don't think so.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.346
They're not listening.

00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:55.180
And if any of them
learn to listen,

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.550
then the younger ones coming up.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.470
I think we have to
get used to that.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.024
And I'm not saying that it
doesn't make me bristle, too.

00:28:03.024 --> 00:28:04.690
But there are some
things you can't fix.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:09.160
I don't think you can fix that
Chinese couple of guys saying

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.800
that any more than you could
stop black guys from saying

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.400
it or black women.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.659
So it's a weird thing,
but the response to it--

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:18.700
it's just like, they can't
talk that way at a job

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.200
interview-- the response to it
is not simply, we can't use it,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.690
so how come those
black men can use it?

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.940
It's two words, but the
question is, what do you

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.630
do about that second version
when other people start

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:32.650
taking it up?

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.670
It's hard.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.000
It's a hard one.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.905
It's a tough one.

00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:38.280
NATASHA AARONS:
It's a tough one.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.710
I still don't accept that
I always say something.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.560
And I have to--

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.439
but I guess as Black English
becomes more acceptable,

00:28:47.439 --> 00:28:49.230
that's probably one of
the downsides of it,

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.860
is that we're going to have to--

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.360
JOHN MCWHORTER: I
would have to agree.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.693
And there are people who are
going to go to their graves

00:28:53.693 --> 00:28:55.200
not liking what they hear.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.130
That's hard.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:00.750
I don't intend to die, but most
people seem to just accept it.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.180
And they are going
to go underground.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.364
And that's just-- that's it.

00:29:05.364 --> 00:29:06.780
NATASHA AARONS:
So I think we have

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.071
some questions in the audience.

00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:09.510
Thank you.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.360
Hi.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.151
AUDIENCE: Hey, Hey.

00:29:11.151 --> 00:29:13.557
So I'm looking forward
to reading your book.

00:29:13.557 --> 00:29:14.640
JOHN MCWHORTER: Thank you.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.110
AUDIENCE: I moved to this
country when I was 16.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.080
My sister was three
years younger than me,

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.130
and I noticed she picked up
a lot of what you describe,

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.795
Black English, and I didn't.

00:29:24.795 --> 00:29:27.730
I think there was this
slight difference in where

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.290
we were in our formative years
that allowed her to pick up

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.440
parts of this language that
I never ended up doing, even

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.620
though we lived in
the same household.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.450
And it's interesting
when you talk

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.460
about how it's been spreading.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.060
Something was in
the back of my mind.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.959
I hear a lot about this idea
of cultural misappropriation.

00:29:48.959 --> 00:29:51.000
But it feels like it's a
slightly different power

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.125
dynamic at work here.

00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:55.500
And I'm curious about what
that is, because I can't quite

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.517
put my finger on it.

00:29:56.517 --> 00:29:57.600
JOHN MCWHORTER: Well, see?

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.750
That's one of those
things, because your sister

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.750
would have been picking
up these ways of speaking,

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.410
and probably moving and joking,
without thinking about it.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.910
It's not like she
did it on purpose.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.940
She just-- that happened
because of who she was around.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.280
And it may not have even
been from black girls.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.250
She could have gotten it
from other girls of whatever.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.780
And so that's her reality.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.690
And some people would say that
that's cultural appropriation.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.850
But I don't know.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.400
I don't know your sister,
but I've got a picture.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.640
And I'm not sure that I
would accuse her of anything

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.770
in terms of cultural
appropriation.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.740
She was busy studying
and watching TV.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.270
So she didn't know.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.670
And I don't think that
I could condemn her

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.180
for whatever she's saying and
doing and however she's moving.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.620
So there is a such thing
as cultural appropriation.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.980
But I am unpopular
in some circles

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.190
in saying that, no, it's
not appropriation for people

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.350
to start talking more
like black people simply

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.900
because I am not aware--

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.370
I'm also not an anthropologist.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.350
But I play one on TV--

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:02.280
I am not aware of any
world historical situation

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.670
where people came together
and didn't start sharing.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.200
I don't know where that was.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.900
People from above take
from people below.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.240
People from below take
from people above.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.070
I don't know how
you would stop that.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.500
And so for cultural
appropriation,

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.150
the argument sounds
to me like people

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.230
are saying in particularly the
situation of the descendants

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.290
of African slaves in a
misbegotten country called

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.600
the United States of
America in the beginning

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.080
of the 21st century, and only
then, only in that situation,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.720
people are going to come
together and not mix.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.340
It doesn't strike
me as something that

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.860
has any chance of happening.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.470
And so I'd rather be unhappy
about things that I can change.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.080
That's my personal view.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.990
Most advocates of
Black English would not

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.160
have given you that answer.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.272
Don't take me as representative,
but I've got to be me.

00:31:51.272 --> 00:31:52.230
NATASHA AARONS: Thanks.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.080
I think we have
another question here.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, first of all.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.690
You mentioned that rap
was a huge influence

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.420
in the rise of Black English
outside the African-American

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.890
community.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.117
In my recollection,
gangsta rap seemed

00:32:06.117 --> 00:32:08.450
like one of the things that
really helped bring this on.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.127
And it was a very aggressive,
angry message that they had.

00:32:11.127 --> 00:32:12.710
And it resonated
with a lot of people,

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:16.370
but it also came from a
place of street toughness.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:21.290
And I'm wondering if that became
part of the modern association

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:24.770
of that kind of language
with these guys who were mad,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.720
who were poor, who weren't
going to take it anymore.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.110
And has that sort of had
like negative influence

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:35.300
or negative perceptions of
Black English even today?

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.820
JOHN MCWHORTER: It
helps, certainly.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:43.670
I think that the association of
Black speech with this violence

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.240
and the street can be
taken a little further back

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.170
to the '60s.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.910
I think that a lot
of that started

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.360
with what was called the long
hot summers, and the prelude

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.030
to it.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.810
So there's this new idea
that Black speech is somehow

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.030
angry or menacing,
but certainly that was

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.080
focused by the tone
of the rap that

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.370
was most popular at that time.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.020
And I think there's an extent to
which any teenager, and this is

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.040
almost gender neutral.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.330
It's probably more among boys.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.190
But there's a tendency to think
of aggression and sticking it

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.370
to the oppressor, or to the
man, or to your parents,

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.280
as authenticity, as something
that one does as a teen.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.950
And so it played into that.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.740
It's something that
white boys were doing

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.000
in different ways in 1973.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.570
But it certainly
was a useful source

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.220
for striking those
sorts of poses.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.280
And I think it still is,
in general, to the extent

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.710
that that black vibe is
associated with giving

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.720
the finger to the authorities.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.700
People still use it in that way.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.514
It can be a good thing and a
bad thing at the same time.

00:33:49.514 --> 00:33:50.930
AUDIENCE: So I was
reading a while

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:57.770
back "1984," and in the
novel, Orwell kind of touches

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:03.380
upon how language can
inform consciousness.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.759
And I had remembered, oh, also,
he's not a linguist, right?

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:08.300
And neither am I.
So like, this could

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.290
be like a stupid question.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.831
JOHN MCWHORTER:
Orwell was brilliant.

00:34:10.831 --> 00:34:12.330
You probably are, too.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.800
AUDIENCE: So you had mentioned
before that there is probably

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.940
some superficiality in
how Black English has

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:27.020
spread through the
popularization of hip hop.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.730
And I don't want to
like challenge that,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.719
but I just want to
ask, if it is the case,

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.540
like if language does
inform consciousness,

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.460
then does the spread
of Black English

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.469
actually have some
sort of impact

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.199
that maybe we're not
probing in how we look at

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.010
and relate to each other?

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.909
It doesn't necessarily even
need to be on racial lines.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.621
JOHN MCWHORTER: You know what?

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:51.870
I'm going to give you the
real answer for that instead

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.920
of the prepackaged one, because
the real one, predictably,

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.940
is more interesting.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.220
But it's less certain.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:34:59.970
This is something.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.220
I haven't gotten to this yet.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.940
There are people who are
studying what makes Black

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.760
English different all the time.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.620
A lot of what I put
in books like this

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.412
is from watching the research
being done, and thinking,

00:35:13.412 --> 00:35:14.370
oh, that's interesting.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.610
For example, it was one person
only about eight years ago

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.990
who figured out done.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.910
That had bested
everybody, including me.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.070
I have one early book where
I made something up about it.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.056
I had no idea, but I knew
nobody would catch me

00:35:26.056 --> 00:35:27.180
on it, because nobody knew.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.245
Somebody actually
figured it out.

00:35:29.245 --> 00:35:30.870
And you know what
they're figuring out?

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.570
And I don't get the feeling
that the others are noticing

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.131
this pattern, but I've wondered
whether I should go public

00:35:36.131 --> 00:35:36.630
with it.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.440
And then I just--

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.120
I had a second child.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.370
But a lot of Black
English's constructions

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.150
carry a certain indignation,
proportionally more

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.810
than I'm used to seeing in
other human speech varieties.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.310
I don't want that to be true.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.110
I find it peculiar, but
very often when you find,

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.110
actually, wait a minute.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.580
That's grammar.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.200
It's kind of an angry grammar.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.020
And so for example,
there's a future perfect

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.059
in Black English, be
done, which I don't

00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:07.350
think I mentioned in this book.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.471
You know, I'd be done killed
him if he does that again.

00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:12.720
The truth with be done is
that it's grammatically very

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.522
sophisticated, but it's
only used when you're angry.

00:36:15.522 --> 00:36:16.980
You don't talk
about it when you're

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.219
talking about drinking juice
or something like that.

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:20.760
There are various
constructions where

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.070
I think, what is it
about culture, history,

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.070
and these constructions?

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.730
Is there a reason for that?

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.450
And linguists distrust
linking language and culture

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.380
too tightly.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.336
And I also don't want to call
this wonderful dialect angry.

00:36:34.336 --> 00:36:36.210
But on the other hand,
there are some reasons

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.660
that black people might
have for being angry.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.270
And so I don't know,
and I really mean it.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.001
I have meant to look into it,
and I keep getting sidetracked.

00:36:46.001 --> 00:36:46.500
But--

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.010
AUDIENCE: My question--

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.180
JOHN MCWHORTER: --maybe.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.910
AUDIENCE: I think more so
than culture is specifically

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.790
the behavior itself, right?

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.740
Like if I raise a
child and he was

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.700
inundated in an angry
grammar, would he

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.470
behave in an angrier way?

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.030
JOHN MCWHORTER: No.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.040
That relationship, no.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.680
If the child was raised
with angry grammar.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.464
That is the title of
something I'm going to write.

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:14.700
If the child is raised
with angry grammar,

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.670
but the child is not
raised in an angry life,

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.990
that angry grammar will make
the child infinitesimally more

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.330
angry in ways that
you could isolate

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.880
in some silly
psychological experiment.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.310
The grammar alone will
not have him walking out

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.480
of the house with a club.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.070
No.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.300
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:31.510
Right.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.267
JOHN MCWHORTER: Grammar
does not do that.

00:37:33.267 --> 00:37:34.350
It would be infinitesimal.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.130
But culture and language do
have an influence on each other.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.520
The angry culture is, I
think, of more concern

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.560
than the angry future perfect.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.687
But one does wonder
about such things?

00:37:46.687 --> 00:37:47.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.030
Sorry.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.486
JOHN MCWHORTER: That's OK,
because you gave me a title.

00:37:50.486 --> 00:37:52.210
NATASHA AARONS: We
have a question here.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:52.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.730
Thank you so much for coming.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:54.450
JOHN MCWHORTER: Sure.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.950
AUDIENCE: So my
question is actually

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.040
kind of going back to your
question about the N-word,

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.290
because I actually
disagree with the concept

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.050
of having to just accept it.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.550
And the reason for
that is because I

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.675
feel as though there are
a lot of other communities

00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:11.310
that also have similar words
that the general populace--

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.980
say, for example, in
the LGBTQ community,

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.210
the use of the F-word.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.120
You know, like they may
use it interchange-- like

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.040
amongst their own community.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.870
But at the end of
the day, I don't feel

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.750
compelled to call anyone that.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.440
And so I guess I
feel as though there

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.140
are certain exceptions
that are made when it comes

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.310
to the N-word, when it comes to
other people wanting to use it

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.290
in our community, and sort of
like the acceptance of like,

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.320
hey, we just have to
deal with the fact

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.960
that it's going to happen,
and it's just going to happen.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:45.420
What exactly about, sort
of, I guess, Black language,

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.110
or sort of black
culture, et cetera,

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.046
do you feel makes people
feel as though they have

00:38:51.046 --> 00:38:52.170
to make that concession, A.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.230
And B, are there
other types of, quote,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.870
unquote, "concessions" that
we feel like we just have to--

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.780
it's going to happen.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.060
We can't do anything about it.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.851
And people are going
to want to participate

00:39:01.851 --> 00:39:04.560
in a certain way, where
when you look at it

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.540
and transpose it into
other communities

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.300
in similar situations, you
can't really understand

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.420
why you would want to.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.920
I know--

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.400
JOHN MCWHORTER: Yeah,
this is the viral clip

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.410
with Ta-Nehisi Coates
two or three weeks ago

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.150
where he makes a similar point.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.770
And the response to it is this.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.930
That is a rich question.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.300
And that's a huge--

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.610
one must compare,
why is it that nobody

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.130
is walking around trying
to use the F-word?

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:31.200
And they're exactly
four answers--

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.467
and I'm going to
forget one of them--

00:39:33.467 --> 00:39:35.550
is that there's a difference
between the word that

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.580
ends in the ER and the
word that ends in A.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.970
So it's not that white boys
are trying to use the ER one.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.570
It's the A one
where that word is

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.950
thought of as having a different
meaning than the nasty one.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.120
That's one part.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.970
Second is why is it
only black people?

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:56.130
And the thing is to
the extent that anybody

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.580
agrees that America
is all about race

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.280
and that that's the
substrate, that's

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.510
part of why it would be black
people rather than LGBT,

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.780
or whatever Indians call
each other, et cetera, that

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.340
would attract that
kind of attention,

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.740
especially because of--
third point-- the music.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:18.510
And so the music becomes
America's mainstream music

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.520
in a way that nobody
would have expected.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.090
And the music, especially a
lot of it in the recent past,

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.977
uses that buddy
word all the time.

00:40:27.977 --> 00:40:29.310
So you've got that in your ears.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.161
And especially with
modern technology,

00:40:31.161 --> 00:40:32.160
you walk around with it.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.000
It's in your ears all the time.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.160
And so that, also.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.237
It's not only that
America is all about race,

00:40:37.237 --> 00:40:38.820
but America becomes
all about hip hop,

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.140
and that word is in it.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:46.170
And then, finally, it's
because especially boys

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.920
like calling each other
salty affectionate names.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.730
And so for example, there's
a "Seinfeld" episode

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:58.230
where George Costanza picks
up calling his friends bastard

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.225
from these white men.

00:40:59.225 --> 00:41:00.225
It's like, hey, bastard.

00:41:00.225 --> 00:41:01.140
Hey, bastard.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.050
And that, or a certain
generation of white men,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.570
ah, that son of a bitch,
and that's affectionate.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.930
That word ending in A is that.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.490
All of that, I
think, comes together

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:16.440
and means that that's why
people want it to be that word.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.350
Whereas let's say that
gay men walked around

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.770
calling each other, if I may,
fag, faggot, affectionately,

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.460
all the time.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.020
I don't know if they do.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.100
That would be less
likely to jump the rails,

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.450
because there is no
gay hip hop that people

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.920
are listening to all the time.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.830
It has a lot to do with
the centrality of blackness

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.060
in the culture.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.530
That's my explanation.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:46.530
And because I feel that all that
is so big, and I feel so weak,

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:51.067
I accept that the white
boy is going to say nigga.

00:41:51.067 --> 00:41:52.650
People would disagree
with me on that.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.108
I don't think that I have any
kind of word of God on that--

00:41:55.108 --> 00:41:56.680
as opposed to so
many other things--

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.460
but on this question,
I just have an opinion.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.960
But I think that's why.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.960
I think that Ta-Nehisi
Coates's version of it,

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.420
with all due respect to him,
is a little oversimplified.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.764
There's a reason
why the black word

00:42:09.764 --> 00:42:10.930
would get so much attention.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.850
One of them is that
black is everything,

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.010
and another is that there
are two of those words.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.321
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:17.321 --> 00:42:19.710
JOHN MCWHORTER: You're welcome.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.100
AUDIENCE: Hi, you
talked about the "You

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.930
can't use that in a
job interview" line

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.390
as being not the point,
because like we all know that.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.320
But would you say that it's
necessarily problematic

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.670
that we can't do that?

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.320
Because it means
that some people

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.770
have a much harder time in
that socially important area.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.800
Like, should we be
able to tolerate

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800
that in a job interview?

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.051
Or is that also not the point?

00:42:41.051 --> 00:42:42.925
JOHN MCWHORTER: There
should be no such thing

00:42:42.925 --> 00:42:43.820
as standard English.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.410
It's an abomination.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.565
We're stuck with it.

00:42:46.565 --> 00:42:48.560
That's just the way
it's going to be.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.880
I'm a fatalist.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.820
But no, nobody would have any
trouble with comprehension

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.155
in any real way if everybody
could just talk and write

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:56.780
the way they wanted
to in this country.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.490
It wouldn't work in
Italy or Germany,

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.040
where there's more
variation, but here, it's

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.840
an arbitrary thing.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.050
So yes, I do think it's a shame.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.210
A person who doesn't feel
comfortable in standard English

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.610
should be able to do an
interview the way they talk,

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.812
because it would affect
comprehension not at all,

00:43:12.812 --> 00:43:15.020
and they'd be more articulate
talking the way they're

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.340
used to talking.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.080
That day will never come.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.960
But yes, if I could
wave a magic wand.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.890
And really, it's true.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.000
When I think about
waving that magic wand,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.250
there are always three things.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.350
And it's funny how it
changes throughout my life.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:31.610
One of them now-- my three are
nobody would ever be hungry.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.280
The idea that people are walking
around in the world sometimes

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.290
without enough to eat, that.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:40.310
Two, love would be based on the
inside rather than the outside.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.510
The idea that looks matter,
I think that's just horrible.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.300
Third, no standard
language, really.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.200
Everybody should just be able to
talk the way they want to talk,

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.760
and everything would be fine.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.860
But we're just stuck with
the reality on all three

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.016
of those things.

00:43:57.016 --> 00:43:58.627
NATASHA AARONS: A
question of here.

00:43:58.627 --> 00:44:00.710
AUDIENCE: I'm hoping that
this isn't as open-ended

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.510
as I think it is.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.960
A lot of what's changed in the
21st century versus the 20th

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.640
is that we have
online communication.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.500
And specifically in
the last few years,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.620
you have phones and
keyboards coercing you

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.497
towards standardized English.

00:44:15.497 --> 00:44:17.330
So for instance, I will
type in on my phone,

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.070
and several of my
friends complain to me

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.289
about the ducking L
train this morning.

00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:22.830
And you can--

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.516
JOHN MCWHORTER: I'm nodding
in complete ignorance.

00:44:25.516 --> 00:44:27.350
The ducking what?

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:30.290
AUDIENCE: They wanted to type
a different word, but they've--

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.955
JOHN MCWHORTER: Oh, got it.

00:44:30.955 --> 00:44:31.455
OK.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.160
Continue, sorry.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.404
AUDIENCE: And so this
happens on a spell check,

00:44:38.404 --> 00:44:40.070
and this happens on
a grammatical sense.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.230
And it happens a lot
in a coercive way

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:44.690
towards a standard
very polite English,

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.550
because a lot of
companies say, oh, we

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.890
shouldn't AutoCorrect
towards another word,

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.660
because that's a naughty word.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.450
How do you feel that that will
change the way people speak?

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:57.140
And how should we
change that, if at all?

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.126
JOHN MCWHORTER: You are--

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:01.740
I'll put it this way.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.500
There are two forms of language.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:07.070
There's speaking, and
then there's writing.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.160
And we write informally
today to an extent

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.660
that we didn't before.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.160
But really, the two
things are very different.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.060
And so the truth is that
whatever AutoCorrect

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.090
does or doesn't do has--

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.680
I don't mean this
in a flippant way,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.610
but it has no significant
effect on the way people speak.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:31.520
And we speak a lot more,
most of us, than we write.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.420
However, in general,
people are spontaneously

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.624
bidialectal in writing,
as well as in speech.

00:45:38.624 --> 00:45:40.040
So they're going
to be things that

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.050
go on on keyboards that really
in the grand scheme of things

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.090
mean that you can choose
to be or force yourself

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.490
to be informal or formal.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.830
The decisions that
people make in terms

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:55.130
of how these things correct
or don't, they're interesting,

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:56.630
but I don't think
that they're going

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.410
to affect the basic
sense that, one, language

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.910
is speech, and two,
even when we're writing,

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.080
we'll always be able to
do it in different ways.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.280
So for example, the word
ducking, so to speak,

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.970
it's not going
away no matter what

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.940
some program tries to do,
especially because that's

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.210
primarily a spoken word.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:20.470
So we'll see, but
I take your point.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.180
NATASHA AARONS: I think we
have one more question here.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.807
AUDIENCE: Hey, good to see you.

00:46:25.807 --> 00:46:28.140
JOHN MCWHORTER: Max is one
of my students from Columbia.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.040
Hi, Max.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.030
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.370
So with the
prevalence of American

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:37.206
pop culture and music
worldwide and its influence,

00:46:37.206 --> 00:46:39.330
do you see any interesting
effects of Black English

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.790
on other Englishes worldwide
or even other languages?

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.610
JOHN MCWHORTER: I do,
because it's not only

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.620
here in the United States.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.190
Because of the music, that
way of speaking English

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.230
is having an effect in
other parts of the world,

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.680
including among people who
have no sense of whatever

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.360
the social parameters are.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.830
They just do it.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.820
And also use the language
of that place in a way that

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.160
has a black effect.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.260
I've heard rap in Germany
where I was thinking,

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.880
this is black German.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.620
And most of these
people have never

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.530
met an American black
person in their lives.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.030
And it's ironic.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.520
Once I was in New Guinea.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.800
I spent a short
week in New Guinea,

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.210
and everything was
completely different.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:23.370
The food.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.830
Indonesian is nothing like
any language any of us

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.450
have probably ever known.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.720
It was about 200
degrees the whole time.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.510
The whole sense of
where a bathroom is

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.750
and what it's like, even
in formal situations,

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.900
was something that one had to
learn as one went, so to speak.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.744
It was absolutely amazing.

00:47:41.744 --> 00:47:43.410
The one thing that
was the most familiar

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:46.500
was that the boys, including
many of them who compared

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.500
to Americans are much smaller.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.020
I was so tall in this place.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.220
The boys could rap in
English sounding exactly

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.100
like Jay-Z, even when they
didn't really speak English.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.370
And they speak Indonesian, but
they could go right into it.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.080
That, or Usher.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.540
A lot of them could
just sing exactly

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.280
like Usher, when I could barely
have a conversation with them

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.020
otherwise.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.970
That was something I
found very interesting

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.660
in terms of music making.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.950
And so 10 minutes ago, somebody
in New Guinea making music,

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.120
god knows what they did.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.140
I don't know.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.590
Today, a young boy in New
Guinea who makes music

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:26.130
gets up with gestures,
and movements, and a sense

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:28.620
of accompaniment, and
a sense of attitude,

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.960
and that word we've
been talking about,

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.670
even if it's in some language
we've never heard of.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.420
That's absolutely
fascinating to me.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.610
It's everywhere.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.510
No one would have expected
this 20 minutes ago.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.200
And here we are in this minute.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.470
It's the answer.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:47.807
NATASHA AARONS: We have
a question from Jonathan.

00:48:47.807 --> 00:48:49.265
AUDIENCE: Thank
you, Dr. McWhorter,

00:48:49.265 --> 00:48:50.460
or Professor McWhorter.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:54.450
I really appreciate all the
expertise that you've provided.

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.170
One question that
I have, though,

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:58.740
is when we talk about
language, at least

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.830
in the American context
and about Black English,

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.020
there seems to be
no way to separate

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:08.520
the etymology of the language
and the political nature

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.430
in the way that it's received,
in the way it's treated.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:14.730
So when we talk about the
boring code switching papers

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:16.560
and things like that,
it seems like part

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.226
of that's connected
to the fact of there

00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:20.250
is a weight to the
type of switching

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:24.180
that one particular part of
the community or the population

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.450
has versus others and
a question of power.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:34.230
So when we talk about the
future of how Black English is

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.890
accepted academically, accepted
culturally, and accepted just

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.230
in general as a
language, how do you

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.930
think we have to come to terms
with the political and power

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:43.830
aspect?

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.070
Because it seems that, at least
within the American context,

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.920
it wasn't just by chance that
standard-- what we consider

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.020
standard English became
standard English,

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.650
but it was an act of
power, an act of politics.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.040
And the way that Black English
has traditionally been treated

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.540
and code switching
has been treated

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.815
has been also an act
of political power,

00:50:03.815 --> 00:50:05.190
political subjugation,
or the way

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.140
that certain communities
have embraced it has

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.250
been an counter-act of power.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:13.230
So how, as an academic, as
someone who researches this,

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.800
how do you come to terms, and
how does the academic community

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.220
come to terms with that idea
of not only understanding

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.962
there is an aspect of language
that is organic and changing

00:50:24.962 --> 00:50:26.670
and things like that,
but also that there

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.727
is a political and
power aspect as well?

00:50:29.727 --> 00:50:31.560
JOHN MCWHORTER: That's
a very good question.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.250
Most of the people who study
Black English-- and honestly,

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:39.330
what I do in linguistics is such
that I've got a couple of toes

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.675
in Black English study,
enough to write this,

00:50:41.675 --> 00:50:42.930
but it's not my main thing.

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:45.540
So that community, I
know them, like them,

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.840
but that's not where I go
to five conferences a year.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.890
Most of that community would
feel that what we need to do

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.320
is change those power
relations, that we need

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.330
to change the way people think.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.940
And often, many of them
say that standard English

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.430
is a gatekeeper language
and it's not fair

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:05.970
that a black speaker should have
to learn that at all, which I

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.340
think, intellectually, is true.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.880
So the idea is that we
need to change society.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.680
That is a respectable view.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.540
It is not my politics.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.220
I'm just not that idealistic.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.750
So they are leftists.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.350
God bless the leftists.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:22.680
I'm more liberal in this sense.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.560
I just don't see
how society is going

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.360
to change the way
a lot of them do,

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.580
which puts me at odds
with some academics.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.600
But I think this.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.780
This is what I think we can get.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.940
I don't think we're going
to change that there's

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.500
a degree of inequality.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.490
I hope that in 100 years that
inequality is not so tracked

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:44.160
to skin color, but I
don't imagine that there

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.390
will be no inequality.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:49.200
What I think is feasible is to
teach succeeding generations

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.030
of Americans--
seceding generations

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.480
of-- no-- succeeding
generations of Americans

00:51:53.480 --> 00:52:00.304
that different forms of language
are different, but not worse.

00:52:00.304 --> 00:52:02.220
So of course, people are
going to keep saying,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.719
you can't use it
in a job interview.

00:52:03.719 --> 00:52:06.330
And somebody like me will say,
you have spoken a true thing.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:07.230
Yes.

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:11.910
But the point is if one
can hear Black English

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:15.390
and not hear junk, but can
just think, it's different,

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.760
the way somebody in
Milan hears somebody

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.080
speaking Milanese Italian
and thinks, it's different.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.390
It's not junk.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:24.720
That's as far as I
imagine it getting.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.950
Now, are people who are hearing
that still probably going

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:31.410
to think of black people
as lesser human beings?

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.540
That's going to
be a harder fight.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.890
My attempt to kind of pull a
few bricks out of that wall

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:40.287
is to try to make it clear
to people who will listen.

00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:42.120
And I find that if you
put it the right way,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.800
a critical mass do.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.100
What you're hearing
as mistakes isn't.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.754
And I definitely try to pull
the racism out of that equation,

00:52:50.754 --> 00:52:52.420
because it makes
people feel threatened.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.490
Should it?

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:54.540
Probably, yeah.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:57.690
But still, you want to
keep their minds open.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.130
So that's what I think.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.600
Again, that's not
representative.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.160
Many people who
study the dialect

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.390
would have a more revolutionary
approach than I do.

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.190
Maybe I'm a little
cynical, but I

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.590
think that we need
to be able to hear

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.660
all the nonstandard
speech, but especially

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:17.430
Black English, as interesting,
rather than broken down.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:19.564
So that's my mission.

00:53:19.564 --> 00:53:20.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.220
JOHN MCWHORTER: Sure.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.290
NATASHA AARONS: Well, we're
unfortunately out of time.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:27.915
But we just want to thank you
on behalf of everyone here.

00:53:27.915 --> 00:53:28.636
JOHN MCWHORTER: Thank
you all for coming.

00:53:28.636 --> 00:53:29.080
NATASHA AARONS:
Everyone here at Google.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.260
JOHN MCWHORTER: Thank you.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.370
NATASHA AARONS: This
has been awesome.

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:33.300
Thanks for dropping some
