00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.010
Talking a little bit about Zero 1…

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:18.090
Zero 1 started a long time ago. We were everything you can 
imagine in terms of digital media: agency, producer… We did a lot of things.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.070
From 2009, we started makings apps,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:30.080
and in the process of seeking a better understanding 
about how this market works, and what to do with it,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.080
we tried making legal apps, esoteric apps, cinema…

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.020
When we got to the children area, we had the luck of 
working with Galinha Pintadinha

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.050
Which was also in the beginning, they haven’t had launched 
their first DVD at that time.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.000
We realized that there was a great chance of growth

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.010
and an opportunity to make a video distribution 
in this app format.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.010
The idea was to simply make the distribution 
of audiovisual content.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.010
We started doing this since the beginning.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.030
We set out to the distribution of VOD channels,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.010
And thinking better, reflecting and 
understanding what was happening,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.080
we noticed that something was missing for a 
children app.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.080
It was missing the play.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.090
Our solution was to combine audiovisual content

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.000
with what we call interactive activities 
or minigames.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.000
What would that be?

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.030
Coloring

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.010
Memory games, puzzles, find-a-match…

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.010
What shape is this? What color is this?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.010
and so on.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.040
We had quite a success with this.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.070
Today, we work with approximatively 
40 intellectual proprieties

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.070
from Brazil and abroad.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.070
We work with the main Brazilian intellectual proprieties:

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.050
Galinha Pintadinha, Patati Patatá, Palavra Cantada, 
Os Pequerruchos,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.070
and the international ones, such as Masha and the Bear, 
which is Russian,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:36.070
Uchi, from Belgium, The Beet Party 
from Australia,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.060
with Korean co-production.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:48.020
Today we are top browsing in both 
platforms in this category.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:59.055
Let's talk about the Freemail model that people 
adopts as a monetization model.

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:07.098
I think everyone here knows what this is; 
you let your free app to download.

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:12.092
Eventually, as some in our case 
there is some of the free content,

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:20.020
and you monetize it, usually in a 
hybrid way, with advertising and networking.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:28.028
Since 2014, The Premium Model is the 
dominant model of the App Stores.

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:36.022
98% of store billing is within this model,

00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:37.063
very driven by the gaming market.

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:52.010
The important thing about it is quite obvious,
you have no barrier.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.085
You download the app without having to pay before.

00:03:55.098 --> 00:04:01.052
You can test it first and buy it later.

00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:10.041
The main focus of this session is the networking.

00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:17.089
Here I will talk a little about these three concepts, 
which I think are very important for you to make

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:22.048
the path between download and sale.

00:04:23.065 --> 00:04:25.096
You need to have a good experience,

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:29.068
you have to engage your user that made the download,

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:33.080
he has to like this, and just from there 
he's going to buy something.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:48.036
Speaking a little about U-EX, it is the thing that 
permeates the journey of the people.

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:51.064
Since the first time someone talked about your app,

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:57.002
the first time he visited your App Store list,

00:04:57.035 --> 00:05:02.053
you have to imagine that there you have to 
believe in love at first sight,

00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:16.020
and do your best to sell what 
you think is important in your app,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.091
what we use to call Unique Sales Propositions,

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:31.028
trying to state clearly in the listing 
 what is the value of your app.

00:05:31.073 --> 00:05:38.018
What is really important here, as you might have 
seen many times here, in the other sessions,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.069
The icon is very important, you have to test it,

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.056
especially here, because the children really 
look at it with a lot of attention.

00:05:48.073 --> 00:05:49.070
Listing

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:53.057
Google and other platforms let you 
put a video.

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.008
Video is a key issue today.

00:05:57.038 --> 00:06:00.019
A lot of people say that video is the new HTML,

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.092
it's a thing that, in the future, starting now,

00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:08.065
will dominate the internet and the mobile market.

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:17.099
You have the description, the first three lines 
which is the first that appears in the store,

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.083
they are very important.

00:06:20.043 --> 00:06:23.053
And we have to remember something very important,

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:26.070
that we are within the Google environment.

00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:29.070
Obviously, browsing.

00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:34.094
You have to pay a lot of attention to that,

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.024
and also on what we today call ASO, which stands for

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.092
AppStore Search Optimization.

00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:46.026
Let's say it's the youngest cousin of SO.

00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:50.024
In it, you basically apply the same concepts.

00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:56.027
In my opinion, you have to pay attention to what, exactly?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.083
To the title,

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.097
to the three main lines that appear 
and to the keywords.

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.017
Next item,

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.000
Onboarding

00:07:12.074 --> 00:07:18.035
I'm a big fan of this kind of approach when it comes to

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:26.097
getting the person into your product.

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:35.055
You have to invite him to know your 
features, what you have to offer,

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:38.056
you have to seduce, you have to conquer.

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:43.004
It is the key point for you to 
ask for things like:

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:51.051
if your app uses a microphone, for example, 
it's a good point to ask for the requisition to use this,

00:07:51.086 --> 00:07:53.052
or the camera, too.

00:07:56.024 --> 00:07:59.067
Ask for Opt-In, to push notifications,

00:08:00.097 --> 00:08:07.029
which is essential for you to have this channel open 
with your user.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.030
And for you, eventually, if the app had a 
registration or login process,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.048
here is the place where you should work this.

00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:25.073
Going back a bit to the Listing, but...

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:28.097
Actually is no the Listing, I got confused.

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.017
There's been a lot of talk about...

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:37.083
the app compatibility.

00:08:38.012 --> 00:08:41.028
We have an interesting experience 
to be talking about this, because

00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:44.080
we believe that...

00:08:45.078 --> 00:08:47.007
Obviously,

00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:53.086
bad experience gives bad word-of-mouth 
and you will mostly get bad reviews,

00:08:53.086 --> 00:08:58.037
and in the end, as it was said, 
the review is very important in this category.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:02.046
Parents will pay a lot of attention to what 
other parents think about it.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.063
What we perceived is that

00:09:07.043 --> 00:09:16.073
a while ago, a lot of negative reviews were coming 
from a specific group of devices.

00:09:17.087 --> 00:09:20.052
We went to verify this and indeed,

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:25.042
although we always want to have 
a universal compatibility,

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:29.029
Sometimes this is not possible depending 
on the features your app has.

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:30.089
What did we do?

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:38.008
We took off compatibility fifty-eight devices

00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:46.050
and after a while, we managed 
to raise our three-star ranking to four.

00:09:47.016 --> 00:09:55.073
Because you limited the negative reviews, 
the positive reviews ended up standing out.

00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:03.043
Another interesting concept here is that...

00:10:05.057 --> 00:10:08.039
You have to create an app for everybody.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.097
When you talk about children at this age, 
they are the center of attention of the house.

00:10:15.084 --> 00:10:20.095
The parents interact together, the uncles, 
the grandparents, the relatives,

00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:23.073
This child is surrounded by everybody.

00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:32.012
This ends up influencing the usage and participation 
of the game within the application.

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:36.023
I would want to leave two cool ideas here:

00:10:36.023 --> 00:10:39.094
One is the concept that Galinha Pintadinha uses, which is

00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:42.094
Uniting generations through music,

00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:48.098
because the songs they mostly use are 
from a songbook called Popular Songbook.

00:10:48.098 --> 00:10:50.018
They are very old songs,

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:52.060
that the grandmothers or the mothers use to know,

00:10:52.096 --> 00:11:00.066
practically all the Brazilian people, and now 
the foreign people that we are working with.

00:11:02.013 --> 00:11:08.087
They seek to bring back these traditional songs,

00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:13.076
And that makes the app appreciated by everybody.

00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:15.021
Another cool thing is that,

00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:16.081
is that I recently heard

00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.009
the leader of BuzzFeed,

00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.083
Ze Frank, I believe this is his name, 
I don´t remember,

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:30.035
he said that today the content is not done by itself.

00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:33.066
Before, you were creating content and 
the people they liked this content.

00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:36.067
Today you have to think what 
content you will create.

00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:40.050
The important thing is that the people will 
interact with it.

00:11:41.022 --> 00:11:43.086
The focus has changed a bit,

00:11:43.086 --> 00:11:49.004
it has shifted from who creates it 
to whom uses it.

00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:53.025
Support

00:11:54.078 --> 00:11:59.083
Support is more than a good experience, 
it´s a marketing tool.

00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:04.096
You are bringing trust, you're together with your user,

00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:10.003
you detect problems before they 
become a big problem.

00:12:10.047 --> 00:12:16.026
And both the interaction, via its own channel, 
 and the Google reviews,

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:21.074
It is very important that they are 
monitored and responded to,

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:27.061
for you to have a successful outcome.

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:30.053
Talking about engagement,

00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:35.037
I don´t know anything better, in order to let 
the person inside your app,

00:12:35.037 --> 00:12:37.017
than giving something for free.

00:12:37.017 --> 00:12:40.086
If you already removed the barrier from the beginning, now 
you take the barrier from inside.

00:12:40.086 --> 00:12:47.037
Open a little part of your content 
for using and for tasting.

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:51.057
If you have a coloring book, you give 
some coloring pages,

00:12:51.057 --> 00:12:55.061
if you have, like in our case, 
videos, you give some videos,

00:12:55.061 --> 00:13:00.062
so that the person can understand and 
 use your app, and so on.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:07.026
And I think it's an elegant thing, 
pleasurable, it creates a better relationship.

00:13:07.026 --> 00:13:11.000
You get the person to spend more 
time inside your app.

00:13:15.052 --> 00:13:18.052
Push Notifications, like I said on the Onboarding process.

00:13:18.052 --> 00:13:20.053
It´s a thing that we use a lot.

00:13:21.024 --> 00:13:25.070
It's a direct channel with the people 
that made the download.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:34.066
You can communicate, bring 
the person back to the app

00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:41.083
to interact more, this increases your chance 
 to monetize this user in the future.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:42.091
Another way to do this,

00:13:42.091 --> 00:13:46.035
actually it´s the same way, but 
in a different key,

00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:48.063
is local notifications.

00:13:48.092 --> 00:13:53.083
They are not sent from the outside in, 
but they are already inside your app,

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.093
the moment in which the person installs it.

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:58.010
This is cool, because you can do what?

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:02.079
In the moment of the installation, you define 
some notifications

00:14:03.054 --> 00:14:12.027
From that moment on, to take advantage of the 
most important moment of the engagement process,

00:14:12.027 --> 00:14:14.088
Which is, I would say, the first weeks,

00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:20.069
or the first hours, is the moment that people remember 
having downloaded it, they are using it,

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:28.096
or used it yesterday and you can try to engage 
the person in the moment with this type of activity.

00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:34.000
Localization

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.070
This is a different idea that everyone talked about,

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:43.097
which is also important with regard to 
location by language.

00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:47.097
For us it's a key thing, because we're 
talking about music.

00:14:47.097 --> 00:14:53.019
It´s even more complex than for other 
types of apps.

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:59.016
But here I want to highlight one point; 
that children from the whole world are very much alike.

00:14:59.047 --> 00:15:06.094
In this phase of life, they have the same experiences, 
they are getting to know the world.

00:15:06.094 --> 00:15:13.064
They are wondering what is yellow, 
what is white, what is green, square, circle...

00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:25.073
And you can use this similarity, so you can manage to 
expand your product in the whole world.

00:15:25.073 --> 00:15:32.040
That is... actually, talking about the application market 
it's actually what you want.

00:15:37.058 --> 00:15:38.070
Content Refresh

00:15:41.071 --> 00:15:48.088
I think that, together with the free content, is one of the 
best ways for you to bring the person back,

00:15:48.088 --> 00:15:52.002
of you holding back the people who downloaded it.

00:15:52.002 --> 00:15:57.086
Is it to change your app, let it live, because the app 
is a living organism.

00:15:57.086 --> 00:16:01.072
It has to evolve, if it doesn´t evolve 
it will get stuck.

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:07.096
One thing that sometimes you may not even notice: 
as you can see here,

00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:12.089
Here is a chart of some of our apps, 
which had two updates

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:14.056
upcoming

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:20.048
In the case here, I think thre were two languages, 
I think, I do not know, Mexican and Portuguese.

00:16:20.048 --> 00:16:31.024
And you realize that you can raise your 
average revenue threshold to another level,

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:38.034
meaning that when you renew 
your content, you change the revenue threshold.

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:45.061
Monetization, let's talk a little bit about what matters.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:53.088
I think, when you've managed to win the person 
and it's her goal to buy something,

00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:56.097
Nothing better for you than having price options.

00:16:58.028 --> 00:17:03.013
In our experience, we sell videos
 with ninety-nine cents.

00:17:03.013 --> 00:17:12.083
We sell the collection by six and ninety-nine 
and all collections for twelve.

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:17.021
You get to choose a number...

00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:21.024
You reach various kinds of pocket, let's say.

00:17:27.098 --> 00:17:32.040
Going back to this concept of packages,

00:17:33.097 --> 00:17:38.005
it's what I'm going to talk about in the end, now that we 
are in ... this here is retail

00:17:38.009 --> 00:17:47.074
It´s retail you know, take three, pay two, 
is a way for you to increase your average ticket

00:17:47.074 --> 00:17:54.084
and reach more people who eventually 
want to buy the...

00:17:54.084 --> 00:18:01.093
They want to buy the full content, 
but they have doubts because of the price.

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:14.043
Users are the best prospects, it´s much easier, 
it´s also known retail technique.

00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:20.003
It´s way easier to sell to whom 
already bought from you,

00:18:20.003 --> 00:18:22.010
than to somebody that doesn´t know your product.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.014
This is easy, obviously.

00:18:25.014 --> 00:18:33.057
And you have to take advantage of this 
characteristic of people, right?

00:18:33.057 --> 00:18:37.081
They feel confident, they may have already bought it, 
they already know what it is, and they'll want to buy it again.

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:42.094
Sales

00:18:42.094 --> 00:18:45.043
Once more, retail.

00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:51.008
You have to take advantage of it in all the ways, 
you have to prepare for it.

00:18:51.008 --> 00:18:55.070
There are few times a year with this opportunity,

00:18:55.070 --> 00:19:00.056
that you can grow your revenue, 
give peaks of three to five times,

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:06.025
and after, to even have a positive residual 
for some time.

00:19:06.025 --> 00:19:13.003
So, sales is the time to work and 
try to sell more.

00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:18.077
Retail again.

00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:21.037
All the sales techniques 
that you can possibly know.

00:19:21.037 --> 00:19:22.086
I come from the advertising market,

00:19:22.086 --> 00:19:30.024
I used to work with sales and i know 
what it is: looks like it doesn´t, but it works.

00:19:30.024 --> 00:19:31.026
What?

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:32.091
From - to

00:19:32.091 --> 00:19:37.020
Price cut, this for that,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.074
Splash discount.

00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:50.029
All this type, this tool that comes 
from the retail and sales.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:54.035
You have to take advantage in the time of 
making your sales screen.

00:19:57.022 --> 00:20:04.044
Here is perhaps the tip the most 
difficult to achieve,

00:20:04.044 --> 00:20:11.020
which is to find certain points of your app 
that with small changes,

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.095
you will achieve a great increase 
in engagement or sales.

00:20:16.002 --> 00:20:18.076
A classic example of this is Facebook and LinkedIn,

00:20:18.076 --> 00:20:24.037
who discovered that, from X numbers of 
users that the person puts on the network,

00:20:24.037 --> 00:20:26.083
the network will continue.

00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:31.004
Here you can think in points like

00:20:31.004 --> 00:20:39.004
Oh, OK. I´ve already sold a video to this person, 
if I offer him the next collection, maybe he will buy.

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:46.037
Or, if this person watched more than five videos, 
it´s very likely that this person wants to buy.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:54.008
If they have gone through five phases of the game, is very 
likely that they want to buy the other.

00:20:54.008 --> 00:20:55.020
And so on.
