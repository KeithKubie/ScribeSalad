00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.610
That's the happy sound of one
of my favourite molecules,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.690
carbon dioxide, being released
from captivity inside a bottle

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.640
of sparkling water.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.270
Now, the reason why sparkling
water tastes so fantastic is

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.377
because the carbon dioxide
actually dissolves, giving a

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:30.480
slightly acidic carbonic acid.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.390
But what this carbon
dioxide look like?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.350
Well, I have a little
bit of it here.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.370
And we've cooled it down
so that it's a solid.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.120
And it's a very interesting one,
because it goes from the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.950
solid to the gas without passing
through the liquid.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.630
So it actually sublimes.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.670
On my left here, I have a big
tube of water which has a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.380
little bit of indicator in it.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.100
Watch what happens when
I drop a bit of carbon

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.630
dioxide into the water.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.160
Of course, the carbon dioxide
starts to sublime immediately.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.430
And it forms loads and
loads of bubbles.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.360
But as those bubbles rise
through the liquid, a little

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.860
bit of the carbon dioxide
actually dissolves and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.100
gradually the pH of the solution
begins to change.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.570
And so the indicator
changes colour.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.220
And you can see its now gone
from purple to blue.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.460
And slowly it's changing
from blue to green.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.360
And eventually, it will
become yellow.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.300
What this is telling us is that
the water is becoming

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.450
more acidic.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.130
Now, you might think that this
is just another pretty

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.520
demonstration.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.570
It's not.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.870
It's actually really serious.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.610
As we put more and more carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.920
one of the things that is
happening is that the CO2 is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.030
dissolving in the oceans.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.840
And as that happens, the oceans
are becoming more and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.140
more acidic.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.680
And that really spells disaster
for all kinds of life

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.750
forms that can only live in
a very narrow range of pH.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.670
And so while we have here a
beautiful demonstration, in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.520
reality it's an alarm signal
for what we're

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.770
doing to our world.
