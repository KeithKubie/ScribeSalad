00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.136
Crystal Williams

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.805
“Year After Year We Visited Alabama”

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:10.110
After Jacob Lawrence’s
“There Were Lynchings”

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:13.746
The past has long legs
&amp; is heavy, they said,

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:16.226
which was a kind of warning —

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:20.620
stay clear of the enormous
twisted tree on Tidwell Hill.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.223
To we cousins the tree seemed fabulous,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.028
a grand old heron,
wings stroking eternity,

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.896
the southern vista beneath it so soft
&amp; innocent,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.368
so dramatically green.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.403
We were dazzled.

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.675
From there our lives
unfurled hypnotically before us:

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:46.746
we could be
doctors &amp; principals, actresses, mayors.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.841
We wanted to escape
their watchfulness &amp; murmurings,

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.451
their relentless apprehensions

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:57.456
that seemed to want
to reign everything about us in,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.360
our unruly hair,
our clothes,

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.063
&amp; our brash voices &amp; sauce,

00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.265
even our childlike curiosities.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.318
So we’d climb up,

00:01:08.453 --> 00:01:10.936
lay on Daisey’s ancient red quilt,

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.673
play word games,
dream up novellas

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:18.278
about a mutant boll weevil
named Boll Winkle,

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:23.050
lamenting missing summer
in Detroit with our friends.

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:25.051
Truthfully,

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:27.620
we thought they were too southern,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.723
too old school,

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:32.991
overly full of moon-gloss &amp; doom.

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:38.131
In our imagination,
the past had no place among us,

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.066
certainly didn’t have
heavy legs,

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.501
was not resting on our shoulders,

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.640
&amp; wasn’t hanging
from a twisted tree.

00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:50.443
We also mistook their burgeoning pity

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.245
for disapproval,

00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:56.715
the weight,
the growing tightness in our shoulders

00:01:56.848 --> 00:02:00.886
as ephemeral &amp; of only that place.
